personally i prefer int string double etc
i have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed-code to interface to mapi although the c++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged
obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use scp sftp in classic asp
also since the data is sorted given a non-key field the rest of the table doesn t need to be searched for duplicates values once a higher value is found
these classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either wpf or silverlight 2.0
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax methods is fired
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts
other alternatives are quicktime windows-media-player or even silverlight microsoft s flash competitor which can be used to embed several video formats
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
can anyone recommend any good add-on plugins for microsoft visual studio
you could add some ajax-y goodness that reads a hidden form field value requests a verification key from the server and sends that back along with the response but that will never be populated if javascript is blocked disabled
the collect method which can be applied to any enumerator object
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5
powershell scripts might be useful too and surely more flexible than xcopy and other dos cmd
something like mediatemple - which won t host the worlds fastest websites but for the price is far better than shared-hosting
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc
just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java
i have never used gruby-on-rails or ruby-on-rails before but i have used groovy and ruby before and as a language i think ruby is much cleaner and more consistent and the team might enjoy production more
with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one
is there a better windows command-line shell other than cmd which has better copy paste between windows windows and console windows
assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authentication a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also leaks the total number of instances older than this one in this case users which might be privileged information
the source control tool s diff algorithm probably won t handle it efficiently but it s likely to required less space than checked in an opaque binary database file
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before
pure .net in visual-studio is better than win32 obviously but developing against the mono libraries perhaps using the sharpdevelop ide is probably an even better approach
tons more line of code much faster than the awk script
then from the develop menu choose show web-inspector and click on the console link
it uses significantly less memory than the sieve-of-eratosthenes and is generally faster for individual numbers
this was available in vs 2005 with moss extensions but has to be run off windows-server with a full moss installation and the correct permissions set
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway
but we really haven t had any problems integrating fogbugz into a team that was totally unfamiliar with any bug-tracking software
i know this is more a philosophical subjective questions but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five line of code for each field
i ve used sql-server express on the past projects but time and time again i hear people saying that the product from oracle is faster and more powerful
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant
gpl is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that on the face of it can t be applied to asp.net-mvc applications
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box
from my understanding subsonic and asp.net-mvc can be redistributed for either an open-source or commercial license and you should be fine just as long as you don t use some sort of viral gpl license that needs to gpl everything
what i did when i had a similar problem to solve was trying to guess regular expressions to match line
bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionary hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples
so basically i m building an app for my company and it needs to be built using ms-access and it needs to be built on sql-server
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm
.net 3.0 and .net 3.5 did not change the version of the clr so using asp.net 3.5 is a more complicated thing that it sounds like it should be at first
it s like having the cake and eating it too the speed factors is there since when using the enter key no unnecessary tabing must be done to get to the correct field and using the enter key next to the numeric keyboard makes it really smooth
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities
if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principles can and should be broken just like database normalization rules
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c++
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variable to be a register variable
i prefer this anyway because debugging with the integrated webserver can give you a very false impression of how your application will interact with the iis security model
if itcontains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting
generally speaking i get the impression that nant offers more flexibility compared to msbuild whereas with my relatively simple needs i ve been fine with the latter so far
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default
if you need to assert for example that the value of the small element is less than the value of the big element or even more complex business rules involving multiple field you probably want schematron or a hybrid approach
i also have been following the thoughts of stephen walther on mvc and i think this post is great to repopulate the fields with the datasubmitted for it to be changed before submission it again
algebraic data types in haskell support full parametric-polymorphism which is the more technically correct name for generics as a simple example the list data type
apparently visualsvn is much better but costs money
jeff wrote a post on this saying he favors var
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant
with modern compilers and processor i don t think there is really any speed difference so this is more just a matter of style
cmd-line options for mutt can be shown with mutt -h
or the would be stay with windows-xp pro
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity-framework
php is more well known and used than eruby but i like the ruby language so i tend to like using eruby
i truly feel that grails has brighter future than ruby-on-rails
it s a lot easier to build data models using visual studio 2008 that can be used for linq-to-sql if there are proper foreign key relationships
this isn t any more elegant than what you have stipulated so i wonder if any of the django or ruby-on-rails guys can provide any input
calling a cmd-line from a gui spawns external processes for each cmd and is more disruptive to the os
i think i was able to pull of our migration with less than 150 line of code
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal
relating to point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component view model controllers presenter and unit-test
relating to point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component view model controllers presenter and unit-test
i m looking to integrate a light texteditor in an asp.net-mvc application and i choosed the tinymce solution and not the classic fckeditor as this seems more lightweight and more jquery friendly
unless some mssql guru comes to the rescue i recommend submission the problem to the vendor
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier
i used an enum contains the sql keywords select insert ... and basically parsed each line iterating over the enum to determine if any sql was present
dr interfaces defines a list of methods that need to be followed think api while an abstract-class gives some basic common functionality which the subclassing refine to specific needs
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps
i suppose it may be a little more work than the valueconverter but it is another option
attributes can also be used in aspects oriented programming to inject manipulate objects at run time based on the attributes that decorate them and add validation logging etc
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid
red-black-trees solve that by forcing your tree to be balanced whenever you insert or delete
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et
linq-to-sql is an orm built ontop of the linq foundation but linq is much more
so if the smallest unit is 16-bit long what in x86 would be called a word then a 32-bit word representing the value 0xffff0000 could be stored like this
this can all be automated and can be considered an atomicity action
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method
finally you can kind of emulate a binary-tree with an array with the potential to have wasted space
when a file was upload this backend service sync d the data in the file system folders making it available to be served from either webserver
remote-debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a mac or a linux desktop
c# - performance wise its far better than either of the big three p s in lamp perl php and python
i really like thompson s haskell the craft of functional programming because it s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular
edit i ve now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 primes factors in play since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primess therefore a recursive algorithm is needed
this is much harder to do with procedural-programming not easy with functional but still easier
there are situations when functional programming is the obvious choice and other situations were procedural-programming is the better choice
inno-setup or nsis whichever seems easier to you
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46
i heavily prefer cakephp for php django for python ruby-on-rails for ruby
this allows better control over nested-loops
i have found that visualsvn is about 50 slower than running svn as a native service
quite the contrary i have been in the situation more than once where i want to extends a class but couldn t because it was sealed
classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example
also due to lsp liskov substitution principle one can use derived-class where base-class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base-class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code
how might i write an even worse big-o sort without just adding extraneous junk that could be pulled out to reduce the time-complexity
however you may create a kind of validation layer between controllers and model so that most of syntactical validations can be carried out on data before it reaches to model
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom
the data you can send is somewhat less that that because the ip packets size also includes the ip header usually 20 bytes and the udp header 8 bytes
i don t recommend oracle-xe
since this is more along the line of product support your best bet is probably emailing the support people
if you selected the conditional formatting menu option under the format menu item you will be given a dialog that lets you construct some logic to apply to that cell
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysqlis less correct less compliant but faster
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysqlespecially when it comes to fine tuning in the end
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scripts from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation script per object in these directory
better to compare postgresql to sql-server
the trace macro can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debugger when the code is compiled in debug mode
would match http or https just fine
if it will be used frequently and if it will be extended in the future i would almost recommend adding either python or lua into your code
once you get over the fact that up-arrow and down-arrow are replaced by esc k and then j you ll see that vi mode offers more than emacs mode for cmd-line editing in bash
using this method however leaves me with everything having the same precedence - it s evaluated left to right regardless of operators although precedence can be enforced using parentheses
vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text
note that ant properties cannot be changed once set so you override a value by defining a new value before the default-value
it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby
this means that the standard apache authentication methods can be used for access-control
when you compile without the debug flag set any call to writedebug will be removed as was assumed was happening with debug.write
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.
i have a solution in visual studio 2005 professional edition which in turn has 8 projects.i am facing a problem that even after i set the cmd arguments in the project settings of the relevant project it doesnt accept those cmd-line arguments and it shows argc 1 inspite of me giving more than 1 cmd arguments
with that setup the svn revision number of the metarepository could possibly be used for versioning the complete system
in the past i have run apache and mysql to match this install in 32-bit mode even stripping out the 64bit stuff from apache to make it work
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
it s highly customizable and imho easier than cruisecontrol.net
as for a runs-everywhere cmd-line tool to be used with commit hooks try narrange
some people also use artistic style cmd-line tool although it requires perl and works better with c c++ code than with c#
edit textchanged event is only triggered when the textbox loses focus so that can t be the issue
is as good as django or ruby-on-rails
some software companies create their own category so there may be non official category on some machines
but maybe using another way of interprocess communication is better
static functions often require you to use setter and getter which clutter a class s api and makes things more complicated in general
programming phase common-lisp development has more of an
the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysqlpostgresql
the brail view engine has been implemented to be used in asp.net-mvc
one word of warning - jdbc - access queries which bridge using odbc do not work on 64bit systems as there exist no 64bit access database drivers the driver is included into 32-bit copies of windows and can only be accessed by 32-bit processes
if the user is not valid the directory entry nativeobject cannot be accessed and throw an exception
maybe it is better to think to some solution without even citing the visitor-pattern and clean our mind
i see a lot of debate about getter-setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah
i won t necessarily have to implement this part but i need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these line
it s relatively involved for each but the linq-to-sql is the more flexible solution and also the easiest to implment
the textarea default font is smaller therefore the textbox is smaller
to me padding just sounds more inner than margins
unxutils isn t updated as often and isn t as complete as cygwin but runs natively just like any other windows cmd-line utility
cygwin acts more like a linux cmd-line emulator
the easiest way to generate elegant html and css is to use asp.net-mvc framework where you have much more control over html generation than with webforms
if i understand this right these operators can be used in types which i want to use instead of a boolean-expression and where i don t want to provide an implicit conversion to bool
edit i know my basic data-structures 101 and why a linked-list is better for adding removing and a hashtable is better for random access
but some of the data i have to show on some forms has to come from text files and by text files i mean human-readable files they can be csv tab-delimited or even a key-value pair per line since my data is as simple as this but my preference of course is xml files
some report that i ve been working on that used to take two hours simply to export have been cut down to under a minute
i d recommend hpricot for ruby or beautiful soup for python which are both excellent parsers for html
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line
i know this example is trivial but if i have a vector of complex data that is going to be always the same for all derived-class but is needed to be accessed from base-class methods
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
for column based security we could perhaps have secured to either assist in query generation or perhaps use an aspects to filter the information returned
for perl at least the first option is sufficient i m not familiar with php
the second since it basically says that for given z and first-order property p you can construct x z p x but to generate the russell set you would need z v the class of all sets which is not a set cannot be generated from any of the given axioms
it would be fine to use it for stack overflow which has three developers and i guess no more than 30k line of code
but instead of making a rectangular grid you can choose dividing line that closely match the line of the voronoi diagram this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing line
depending on requirements you use the mapped value to point at the result directly or to short list of the candidates which would allow a smaller map but requires greater subsequent processing - you re not in o 1 lookup territory any more
if it doesn t then the property code queries the database and computes it then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it s requested
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax
honestly if you want an asp.net-mvc framework for asp.net i would pick castle-monorail
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables
i find the c++ behaviour makes more sense since base class c-tors are called first it stands to reason that they should call base class virtual-functions--after all the derived-class c-tor hasn t run yet so it may not have set up the right preconditions for the derived-class virtual function
this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access
i believe linq-to-sql is designed to be fairly lightweight and simple whereas the entity framework is more heavy duty and probably more suitable in large enterprise applications
brian -1 is a good choice for the default-value since no real rows are likely to have identities less than zero
the application can be written in perl vb6 vb.net or c# but must be easily scheduled from a windows based server
i can say that the ruby-on-rails community is much larger i m talking about ruby-on-rails vs grails not ruby-on-rails vs java and very helpful
common-lisp code can be converted into scheme code with relative ease
usually flex is more suited for application that need a lot of access to data but for simple things in flash you should use some xml data sources and write the xml source yourself in something like php asp python perl etc
decrement loops can possibly be more efficient than increment loops depending on instruction set architecture arm given
openoffice has a basic interpreter which is largely compatible with vba
the following works in mysqlbut doesn t seem to be supported in oracle
if you look at the source-code for the likes of asp.net-mvc this is no longer accurate
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest method
it really just comes down to whether or not it is appropriate for you to set these default-values or if your objects should be specced out at construction all the time
for one thing gruby-on-rails is far more flexible than ruby-on-rails
if you re dealing with linq-to-sql and the orderby is an expression tree it will be converted into sql for execution anyway
this is no better than the equivilent foreach var item in somelist .
so start with asp.net-mvc and you will easily be able to move in to webforms if needed
right click on the trunk folder and choose either checkout if you want to update from svn later or export if you just want your own copy of that revision
finally i enclosed and this is dirty my apologies line 1417 to 1474 with a try catch block swallowing the exception
all those details may be specified external either programmatically in a service host or via the config file
an xpath style api might be better than a dom api in that case - it might you decouple thenodes from the tree a bit more and treat the mutated tree more intelligently
if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml
my two biggest problems are as awt events bubble up through swt there are some erroneous events fired and due to wrapping the awt frame jfreechart becomes substantially slower
after this you simply select any products belonging to any of these category
if they are on different drives and the drive contains the data fails you can apply the log to the last backup so you don t lose any data
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed
+1 for visualsvn being better than ankhsvn having tried both and +1 for the fogbugz add-in
i found some wild remarks that asp.net-mvc is 30x faster than asp.net webforms
i also recommend ffmpeg but the cmd-line suggested by john boker has an unintended side effect it re-encodes the file to the default bitrate which is 64 kb s in the version i have here at least
i set up a little ajax app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs
union will be slower than union-all because union will filter out dups
might perform better is with data-structures like a linked-list where random access means traversing the list
i do this because i still code in the flash ide and its debugger is so very painful to get working most of the time it s easier to just trace variables out so you can either use that for-loops to print the object names of the items currently on your stage or use a debugger program to find the objects as well
lost-focus will trigger when the textbox loses focus
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle
another aspects of the question was if either database is easier to work with when using python
it should also be pointed out that you can specify your controllers action and params to the .form helper and if they fit into your routing rules then no query string parameters will be used
does this mean that my executable can only be run on windows-mobile devices instead of any generic windows-ce installation
so objects that have to be finalized are moved to a special queue to be cleaned out by a different thread the finalize thread - which if you kill makes all kinds of bad things happen
there is no magic in the clr to call dispose methods automatically other than tracking objects that contain finalize and storing them in the finalizer table by the gc and calling them when some clean up heuristics kick in by the gc
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push
i m sure there s a codinghorror article about this. also many algorithms have degenerate cases where the code does more than is necessary using quicksort on nearly ordered data could be slower than a bubble-sort with an early-out check
i found that i can get around this by manually opening the project file in a text-editor and modifying the path to something like .. .. .. common source.cs but this is more of a hack then i would like
of course asp.net provides much better ways of accomplishing the same thing but it s still a bit of a loss and can make migrating an old site to .net a pain
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc
furthermore list comprehensions are generally preferred to map thus i d expect generator-expression to be preferred to imap
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames
about q4e i have been reading a lot of good stuff about it and seems the next versions will do a lot more than m2e with a better dependency management and even visual graphs
but the general opinion is that m2e is still better than q4e but q4e is getting better each new version and maybe will surpass m2e soon
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way
the seo guy mentioned that semantic valid html gets more points by web-crawler than jumbled messy html
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt
sometimes you don t want expectations on every method you re calling so some mocking frameworks will allow partial mocks that are like mock stubs hybrids in that only the expectations you set are enforced and every other method call is treated more like a stubs in that it just returns a value
is asp.net-mvc that much better than php with tools like cakephp
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris
a jump table would be used to draw characters because it would take too long to load a bitmap from memory and use a for-loops to shove the bitmap out
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo
so in that vein here s a very low level look at the math of modulo for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division
what s funny here is that the binary-tree search appears a little probably not statistically quicker than the cil switch instruction
for things like video streaming and multiplayer gaming where it is better to miss a packet than to delay all the other packets behind it this is the obvious choice
i have never hand-coded object creation code for sql-server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between sql-server and postgresql
amazon associates web service - used to be called e-commerce api or something along those line
i guess you could probably use javascript to handle aselectedion event my javascript knowledge is a little in disrepair at the moment and switch on the value of the combo box but this seems like more of a hack
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal
abstract classes cannot define mix-ins -- a class cannot extends more than one parent
in other words if i were working with this in expression-blend or mobiform aurora i would be able to select the chart from the logical tree or select any of the individual pens to edit their properties
most of the work i do is with what could be considered enterprise web-applications
if i have several of these windows open at once and i click one with my mouse when they disappear they cause my application to lose focus it switches focus to the app behind the current one
the cpu can be switched from 64bit execution mode to 32-bit when it traps into kernel context and a 32-bit kernel can still be constructed to understand the structures passed in from 64bit user-space apps
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task
the wcf class.netnamedpipebinding can be used for interprocess communication on the same machine
the long-term difference might be that stored procedures are many many times easier for a dba to manage and tune whereas hundreds of different queries that have to be gleaned from profiling trace are a nightmare
really though this is probably more a perl ruby python job than a pure shell script
flotr ++even prettier charts than flot +-uses prototype which i ve never worked with -no pie-charts either
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned int type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed int type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned int type
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users
similar things can be done in bash in just a couple line of code
this is possible since the exe is fully compatible between windows-server 2003 and windows xp
does anyone know of a better solution than my subclassing workaround
the issue before used to be cost but sql server 2005 express is free and there are lots of web-hosting companies which offer full hosting with sql server for less than 5.00 a month
yeah java has gotten better since 1.5 but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct
this is more of a psychological aspects as i prefer to have a neat structure in the repository which makes navigating it much easier mdash
also i don t see how xml s angle brackets are less human readable than json s square brackets curly brackets and quotes
to do this i m using ms vc++ .net 2003 and mappoint europe 2006 to do this but am having problems as when i select insert activex control no mappoint control appears in the list of options
in order to pull off some of the visual tricks of draging around the tree nodes it has to be copied into this clipboard with its source description
you do not lose linq you lose linq-to-sql
i just checked the timings using mysql5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql
i wonder if you set the page not to be cached through meta-tags will that fix the problem
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby-on-rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with
if you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable s size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more equals evaluations though possibly more realistic
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for
this is also easier to deal with than costants as you can put any type of value within the property array string int etc whereas constants cannot contains arrays
this version is for 32-bit ints but the logic can be extended for 64bit or higher
sometimes webforms and the rich third party control vendor availability will be preferable and in some cases raw simplicity and fine-grained html control will favor asp.net-mvc
interpreter languages have the disadvantage that syntactic or structural meaning calling a method with wrong parameters etc. errors normally will only be detected at runtime if you don t have a separate step in your build which checks for such errors with phplint
i used hibernate in my previous job to connect to both mysqland sql-server but i have since switched over to .net so currently i work with linq and i really enjoy it
the value of a will be equal to b since the comma-operator has a lower precedence than the assignment-operator
.net will throw a system.argumentexception if you try to add an item to a hashtable twice with the same key-value so it doesnt look like there is anything more specific
scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details
is there an easier way than subclassing the textbox and implementing icommandsource to hook up the textchanged event to my viewmodel class
cases union-all will be more efficient and should be used unless duplicates are required in the sub-queries
if you re determined to have rich-client style development and your audience is small for admins only then i d probably recommend wpf over silverlight as it currently provides a richer set of tools and controls
that beats sql-in a situation where given two dates how many workdays are there between the two dates
base-classes can get bloated with tons of behaviours that may be needed by inherited objects
i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article
a compiled c# .execontains platform-independent code that can be run in any .net-compatible environment including mono
the ado.net entity-framework has the added advantage that your database tables can be viewed as entity classes inheriting from each other or as columns from multiple tables aggregated into a single entity
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way
i want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records
i would recommend memcached or apc
it s not as clean as i d like it to be so i d still add comments but it s better than an if-statement or adding the first or last item outside loops
assume the textbox s text property is bound to a property on a business object and the binding s updatesourcetrigger property is set to the default value of lost-focus meaning that the bound value is pushed back to the business object property when the textbox loses input focus
when clicking on a button in a toolbar the textbox does not lose focus
use shift + v to go in visual mode then you can select line and delete change them
robocopy gui makes it easier to get your cmd-line options right
not sure if they keep track of the tree of process spawning i think it depends on what os you use but since when you kill bash or any shell all running children are also killed i think unix like systems do keep track of this
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it
on a linux or bsd system this should be vi by default although any editor should work
this approach is better than editing your .emacs file since it will allow you to have more than one shortcuts with more than one starting directory and it lets you have the normal cmd-line behavior of emacs if you need it
have used this for over a year on wordpress ip.board and mediawiki sites and have absolutely zero spam
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change
i find working on the cmd-line in windows frustrating primarily because the console window is wretched to use compared to terminal applications on linux and os x such as rxvt xterm or terminal
in order for the #make and #model divs to sit side by side with out the use of floats they must be displayed as inline elements so add display inline to both #make and #model note that this will lose the vertical margin on those elements so you might need to make some other changes to get the exact layout you want
performance is the main downfall with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it
i recommend python as it s not only a sexy language but also very widely used and easy to integrate with c++ through boost.python
ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on
4 vmware virtual-machines created with vmware fusion are fully compatible with vmware s latest products
you can set a simple rule described in your header file that any variables to be accessed external to the class must be accessed via the property or by using custom methods on the class to affect values
you should generally know why you re optimizing code as in a specific task in your existing codebase is taking too long not i heard php is slower than python
personally i feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results 1+1 should return 2 in a addition function trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function and forcing error conditions such as network failures
if the lineheight was increased same effect though font-size with less words per line this becomes less of an issue
do put stuff related to authorization access control in the controllers
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the array because they will give you dynamic memory allocation and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions
it can be configured to show what misra rules have been violated and it has a cmd-line interface
the problem we are seeing is that it expects the requests to be formatted using web-services security so we are doing all the correct signing etc
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex
it is also possible to expose whole c++ classes to be used in lua
so i highly recommend expression-blend for a wpf programmer
it is very tempting to try to validate entire hierarchies of models as a whole but as you said the place where that would be most easily done is the controllers which should act more as a router of requests and responses than in dealing with business logic
the downside is primarily performance xml-serialization will be slower than binary over the wire and web services do not handle large amounts of data well
object oriented programming is not inherently better than procedural-programming
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim
lua is more lightweight than python
it s faster the designer is vastly improved split view faster context switching it has better support for javascript and .when you re ready to target 3.5 you ll be ready to go
repositories stored on remote filesystems using file-access are going to be much slower than either svnserve or apache with mod_svn
although serialization is used here it is also common for this process to be referred as marshalling
open the file using whatever scripting language you prefer perl python and traverse the file until you find a match for your version
the api then at a later moment sends a callback and that methods might then traverse the table using the key which might be -1 in this example the error code
every industry expert i ve heard on podcasts blogs and interviews recommend learning silverlight first and then gradually moving to wpf which is a huge ui framework
i ve also read paul graham s ansi common-lisp which is more about the basics of the language but a bit more of a reference manual
according to yahoo s documentation for geoplanet requests are made in the form of an http get messages which can very easily be made using python s httplib module and responses can take one of several forms including xml and json
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++
if you have to get under the hood and make modifications i m also a firm believer that drupal is a more friendly and elegant system than joomla
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck
tuples are the cheapest kind of containers in python they are also hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys set members etc
in reality users have been trained at least in theory not to submit pages unless they see the little lock icon so even the form itself should be served via http to get this
https traffic is much bigger than its equivalent http traffic due to encryption and certificate overhead and it also puts a bigger strain on the server encrypting and decrypting
i prefer cxxtest because it has a perl python script to build the test runner
works to match any from line but i want it to be restricted to lines in the body anything after the first blank line
however if you ve got data that doesn t easily normalize the entity framework is more flexible than linq-to-sql but it does take more work to configure
this requires windows-server 2003 automated deployment services which in turn can only be installed on windows-server 2003 enterprise edition
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it
the problem can be done in a constant number of line of code and whether the code is run on an x86 or an x64 the way i describe is more efficient
i would suggest using a front-controllers based framework for this refactoring from personal experience i recommend spring and its controllers interface so that each controllers isn t a separate servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately
for the controllers it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal
i would recommend either nhibernate or entity-framework
the general consensus is that programmers prefer drupal whereas mere mortals prefer joomla
personally i like celementtree which is a faster c-based implementation of elementtree which is a dom-like model
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces
assuming you haven t worked in silverlight or wpf before i d take a look at our showcase 3 applications just to get a sense of what can be done with silverlight
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
is there a distributed version control system git bazaar mercurial darcs etc. that can handle files larger than available ram
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksorton average
if i was starting today maybe i would pick python or ruby but i don t know enough about them to make a judgement call
after finding questions with words from query we might want to calculate distance between words we are interested in in questions so question with phrases similarity text ranks higher than question with discussing similarity you hear following phrases... text
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n time where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas
this sample code makes use of the toolhelp32 library from the sdk so i would recommend turning this sample code into an unmanaged c++-cli library with a simple interface like suspendprocess uint processid
the last parameter to builder.node is array list of othernodes to be appended as children according to the wiki
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page
if things like spanning tree protocol are enabled on a switching then you may find that what may have been the router card to begin with may not be anymore
i find i can do more with nhibernate and even castle than with the linq to entities or linq-to-sql
the problem may be cause by vb.net c# projects using different naming-conventions for project assemblies and how the project namespace is used
i have not tried the entity-framework but i definitely would recommend nhibernate over linq to sql
linq-to-sql likes to have a lot more control over everything loading the object and maintaining all kinds of tracking information about the object
you can start a replication by creating a database from scratch and you can control either theupdatess will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database
so if the save button you are clicking on takes the focus then it will cause the update automatically because the textbox will lose focus
i personally prefer python but php will work as well
if its not possible under windows-xp is it possible under vista
is linq-to-sql or even ef better than raw sql
i recommend thinking-sphinx
thinking-sphinx has more concise syntax to define which fields and which models are indexed
i can however recommend itextsharp which is a .net port of the java itext
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free
you could use silverlight or flash or some custom plugin to allow managed uploads where you can display a progress-bar for example
what .net does understand is the idea of a delegate - a type that describes a method-signature instances of which represent either bound calls to specific methods on specific objects or unbound calls to a particular method on a particular type that can be invoked against any object of that type where said method adheres to the said signature
basically you are enabling your .net classes to be called through com activex from your win32 code delphi or c++
it has cmd-line options that can be used to create external tools in visual studio but i ve found that the visual lint addin is easier to work with
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab-completion
on a side note string + var is also more performant that the string.format approach generally that uses a stringbuilder internally when in doubt.
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow
this does even more because it works for each item separately and not on their common subclassing v
ruby has similar issues and although i do like ruby much better than i like python i get the impression that ruby-on-rails is roughly in the same boat at django when it comes to managing supporting the app
postgres is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam
after all i think your error-handling process will be much smoother with exception-handling than trigger_error and stuff
and if there isn t any re-use happening is a tiny scriplets really that much worse than the taglib xml
faster and easier to get to than a separate cmd and has easier copy-paste support
in practice though most of this falls away and rest usually just refers to simple http-request that return results in json while soap is a more complex api that communicates by passing xml around
in this case submission the http request is far more important than the string which is the body sosubmithttprequst x is preferable to x.submitviahttp
there is nothing useful in soap that can t be done with rest for transport and json xml or even plain text for data representation
i know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time
since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario
i recommend gcc because it s designed to be used on the cmd-line and you can compile simple programs and see exactly what s happening
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more
they both provide basic distributed version-control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git
for easier development the ncurses gives a higher level of control than simply sending characters to the terminal
as your question is tool writing and exploit development i would recommend ruby if you choose metasploit or python if you choose canvas
must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform windows nix php asp c# python django et cetera
your second solution of using ldap for authentication and a db for authorization seems more robust as the ldap data is controlled by the user and the db would be controlled by an admin
this gives more expressiveness for writing tests and also forces to think about the invariant expectations that your code should fullfill it s harder to write assertions
however what you re after is a little bit more than this - you want to know if the latest versions of any files have line written by a particular user
the man pages can be found be either using a cmd-line man sh or by searching the web for shell manpage
how can i clone or deep-copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object
note it uses x264 assembly syntax which makes it more portable to 32-bit vs 64bit etc
it has the stock standard set of features like code-folding and syntax-highlighting features etc but more importantly zeus is fully scriptable and zeus scripts can be written in java script
if for what ever reason you have to use a windows box i would say grab 2003 32-bit the signed drivers are really only a problem on 2008 but even in 2003 i can t really recommend 64bit unless there is a pressing requirement like exchange 2007
you can do some extra work to try and compensate for rotation and scaling too -- and in this case since comparing a few line is much less computational work than doing the same to entire images -- it won t be so bad
i would hypothesize that the amount of effort increases dramatically when we try to understand classes with more than nine instance-variables or methods with more than 9 local-variables
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44
so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is
with generics you can create a class that will be able to operate given any of the types that inherited from a given base-class or implement a given interface like so
especially if you have some flash background more interested in the interaction design ux i would recommend you to buy expression-blend than vs2008
data created on stack can be used without pointers
windows-xp was actually faster than windows 2000 in many respects
freeing a block from stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointers
the stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it a pointer integer is simply increment or decrement while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation
on windows i prefer nsis from nullsoft only because it s less objectionable than installshield or installanywhere
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object
i prefer java or xslt -based solutions ant will do fine but if there s an easy way to do that in rake ruby or python please don t be shy -
another case where you can see square-brackets or curly-brackets used - is in the special initializers where any symbol can be used like
then when debugging with vs2003 or greater you will be told of any leaks when your program exit it tracks new delete
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead
selecting any of the groups is optional so you could pick set a or b or both
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds
to the best of my knowledge you can do most of the stuff as annotations but the more complex mapping are sometimes expressed more clearly as xml
grails works because we can mix and match groovy with the existing java solutions
i would always recommend nhibernate over linq-to-sql
if i m exposing the same domain model in multiple ways web app web service ria client i ll lean to orm as then datamodel is then hidden behind my orm facade making a robust domain model is more valuable to me
note that for little endian processor that bytes words dwords qwords etc. map correctly to each other in memory main reason that little endian processor are better than big-endian processor ah i feel a flame war coming on...
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen
the distance can be used to gauge the similarity of your tracks
and as for what makes python easier than java you might check out this question java - python
as well an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via javascript and dom commands - getelementbyid for example
worse with unix elf linking these names will cause cross-linking between shared-objects .so a fooservice fault might be processed by the .soap_getfault for barservice corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different
wcf though has much better server throughput than .net remoting
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time
to support all the fancy syntax that people want in a language and preserve backwards-compatibility it makes more sense to add more languages to the runtime
but i think there are also genuine reasons for introducing new languages to the jvm particularly when they will be run in parallel you can use the right language for the right job a scripting language like groovy may be exactly what you need for your page presentation whereas regular old java is better for your business logic
i d recommend python or perl
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox
i m not familiar with ruby but there s almost certainly some function might be called system just a guess that will invoke a given cmd-line
a really good text-editor with syntax highlighting textpad from www.textpad.com and sql plus
ifconfig can be used to display the mac-addresses of local interfaces but not those on the lan
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via http it s the post back url that needs it most
also you need to take care that any cookies are set to be secure so they will only be sent via ssl
you can set it to another user account - for example crystal reports .net requires update and delete access to c temp - so we have a webmaster user with administration access and use that identity for those applications
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout
my personal take is that the wcf approach is more clean as you can do contract-driven services and focus on messages not objects i m making a generalization here based on the default programming models of wcf .net remoting
when all you are doing is sending a messages like you are with wcf it becomes easier to separate your concerns between communication and the classes infrastructure that a single node is composed of
we can say that we re stuck with js but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries
debugging is much more limited particularly problematic for server development is no remote-debugging
i ve read in nish sivakumar s book c++-cli in action among other places that you should use the __clrcall decorator on function calls to avoid double-thunking in cases where you know that the method will never be called from unmanaged code
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths
it s used by asp.net-mvc but can be employed in any asp.net application
if you use a wcf service with a.netmsmqbinding you can receive queued messages without having to poll
3 the project has more than 5000 line of code
i m curious what seems to be the point in data size or application complexity that transactions frequently start becoming the source of issues causing timeouts deadlocks performance issues in mission critical code etc which are more bothersome to fix troubleshoot or workaround than designing a datamodel that is more fault-tolerant in itself or using other means to ensure data integrity
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss
the python c api manual is longer than the whole lua manual including the lua c api
that kind of stuff sound like is lies more in the project-management domain instead of software used to track bugs
it s going to blow webforms out of the water - we ve already seen how valuable a true asp.net-mvc framework can be in the java world
the purpose and the goal of both solutions are different and aps.net webforms is more like a platform while asp.net-mvc is architecture framework so the question is a bit odd
i ve had a lot of success with pdflib it s a very powerful library with php and c c# perl etc bindings
there are plenty of other content-management systems but moss incorporated the functionality of the previously name microsoft content-management system which itself often cost more than moss alone
moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss
i created a vector so that multiple listener can be attached to this event
more queue processor can be added at any time
although the csla framework is written in .net the overall approach can be used in any language
initially there was some buzz that url routing is totally decoupled from asp.net-mvc and it could be used for webforms
in the following example the bbar for the panel is display 2ems narrower than the panel it is attached to it s left aligned in ie6 where as in firefox it is display as the same width as the panel
this also means support for wpf with a xaml designer although most people still prefer expression-blend for wpf interfaces
if you have visual studio 2008 i would recommend skipping ado.net and leaping right in to linq-to-sql
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest
in some cases i wanted to test private member-functionss of a class so i made the test class a friend-class to the object to be tested but hid the friend declarations when building in non-test configurations through preprocessor declarations
specifically it can be used for variable names that clash with reserved keywords you can t use params but you can use params instead same with out ref any other keyword in the language specification
now if you use primitive types instead like int or float and pass them as method parameters changes in object c cannot be seen by object a because object a merely passed a copy instead of a reference of its own copy of the variable
c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object-pascal is more of an exotic language
this would be done by having a content container with a top margins big enough to hold the navigation and a right margins big enough to hold the sidebars
just compare let s say average php or visual basic programs and solutions in smalltalk common-lisp haskell and the like
most lock-free algorithms or structures start with some atomicity operation a change to some memory location that once begun by a thread will be completed before any other thread can perform that same operation
a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest
gruby-on-rails is more domain-oriented while ruby-on-rails is more database-oriented
the back-end doesn t matter much but i do recommend using json as your protocol of choice over xml
partial classes are an option but if the properties i want to decorate with the datamember attributes is already defined in the autogenerated designer.cs file then i can t add the same properties definition to the partial class as this means the properties will have been defined twice
www.google.com is not accessible by http
each list has the same z number of elements so it will be impossible to make lists where z is greater than x and still fulfill the rule that no list may contains the same element twice
a suffix-tree can take slightly more memory still linear though than a suffix-array but is easier to implement to build quickly since you can use something like a radix sort idea as you add things to the tree see the wikipedia link from the name for details
so what else could be happening that would cause the http-request to lose contact with the asp.net session
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord
in general joomla s admin gui is considered prettier and more user-friendly than drupal s but joomla is in my opinion a less intuitive system at the programming level and makes certain tasks more difficult than necessary
bottom line joomla tends to look pretty from an administration perspective but drupal tends to outperform joomla and be a more easily customizable system to achieve many of the things you really want out of a cms
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack
also python and perl are older than java and c# from the days when it was illegal to export cryptographic software from the us
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.
keeping track of value passed in a form as a user completes a process like a site sign-up well that can probably be kept in hidden form field
it is possible for iptables i guess your suse has iptables firewall to be setup to let trough only ping icmp packets
any files that are dependent on a particular module will be rebuilt any time the module class structure contains in the .h file is modified
from a practical perspective i generally consider any select that ends up taking more than 10 lines to write putting each clause condition on a separate line to be too long to easily maintain
i favor gruby-on-rails over ruby-on-rails but learning ruby-on-rails will give you a more balanced perspective and actually open your eyes to overlooked things that are possible in gruby-on-rails
however we ve now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice the object is larger even in the production version and we ve added a new failure path for foo s constructor allocation can fail
having used both cruisecontrol.net and hudson i can recommend hudson as the easier of the two to config easily done via the web gui though direct configfile editing is also supported
both languages provide it but c# properties provides a better design for it in regards to setter and getter
a continuous-integration with a high code-coverage is better
using python is more than syntactic sugar unless you enjoy writing or having your ide generate hundreds of line of boiler plate code
someone with more knowledge of the underlying arrays vs linked-list implementation and how it ends up looking in the byte code could probably tell you whether appending to a linked-list with a tail pointer or inserting into an arrays is faster my guess would be the arrays
calling .selectall during the click event won t work because the user won t be able to select any text with the mouse
.when the feature is ready to be brought into main review the combined changes
but there may be times where using a factory function like this is better for instance if the insert is conditional on some othervalue and you would have to otherwise unconditionally construct some expensive temporary even if it wasn t actually needed
javascript prototype can be used to extend existing objects much like c# extension methods
essentially if you have getter and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public
getter and setter also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data perform a calculation and then set some other value in the object better known as procedural programming
so if the team want to choose erlang or haskell then management has the responsibility to the company to say no
it also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language php ruby which i imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use jaxer
in short private-members with direct getters and setters are little more than dressed-up public members
you can wrap the logic in jython in a ear.war and then the deployment group is just seeing another j2ee bundle to be managed like all the other j2ee bundles
i agree that the for-loop should be used whenever possible but sometimes there s more complex logic that controls the iterator in the body of loops
imo asp.net-mvc is much more dry than webforms
this is somewhat more nuanced than simply not exposing internal data - merely placing accessor methods or property getter setter between internal data and the cold outside world is no more information hiding than launching into a conversation about this friend of mine and his herpes problem.
javadoc or doxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation
the basic problem here as i see it is that an interop assembly doesn t actually contains any il that can be instrumented except for maybe a few delegates
exception-handling allows more easilly to separate error-handling of normal behaviour
found it much nicer than cruisecontrol.net and for our team size it is free
i m primarily an asp.net developer but i find asp.net-mvc is a better way of creating functionally complex websites typically line-of-business type sites since it allows for better separation of business logic and rules from the markup used to display data to the end-user
smokey similar to fxcop and gendarme based on mono.cecil
i do wish more mobile devices had browsers as powerful as mobile-safari
if your old site is vbscript it s probably easier to go with vb.net
since you ve done vbscript migration to vb.net is more natural - you can learn the new syntax then move onto the framework and bcl when you are familiar with those you can learn the c# syntax as weel - being bi-lingual is always good
they are most probably much less mature than any common-lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp
as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier
and somewhere in between it is likely that all of limp will be rewritten in common-lisp using the ecl interface making limp easier to maintain vimscript isn t my favourite and being easier for users to customize
row and col at first glance this seems more succinct than row_num and col_num and just as descriptive
reads as the row num ber is less than the max imum number of col umn s
at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary
better to use a list and show people all of the options at once and it s better to not navigate away after aselectedion and or require a different button to be pushed to get to where they want
refedit lets you select cells without actually selecting them it uses marching ants around the cells that you choose instead of highlight them and changing the excel.application.selection
using this trace method not only would i have to keep adding and removing keywords from in front of variables as i worked on different bugs but i don t think that it would be any real improvement over just adding good logging debugging messaging which is much easier to remove or disable when pushed to production
vb 9 has the if operators which is much better and works exactly as c# s conditional and coalesce operators depending on what you want
it sounds like you might be better off with radio button or if it s an explicit on off type of situation using a checkbox
priority-queues are data-structures that provide more flexibility than simple sorting because they allow new elements to enter a system at arbitrary intervals
whose key-value is smaller than any other key in the priority queue
i recommend hosting a cgi-bin which looks up the ip-address of a hostname and access that via javascript
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs
your application shouldn t pass sql into the database access should be controlled through packages stored procedure functions and values that are going to come from the ui and be used in a ddl statement should be applied using bind-variables rather than by creating dynamic sql by appending strings together
there is nothing worse than submission a form and getting back an error using ajax you can pretty much prevent this for everything but file uploads
doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database
obj-c is also quite fun to use once you learn how it works best delegates very different than .net delegates messages category and all the other oddities present
long story short innerhtml is much much faster than dom even on modern javascript engines
having to subclassing a winproc when you re more familiar with object inheritance is head-splitting and less than optimal
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using eventsmousedown mousemove and mouseup
deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter-setter previously the call of the execute
a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysqlmuch more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular
if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame
for example automation of authentication processes within an organization can quickly be developed without any code using sharepoint designer
does anyone have a regular expression handy that will match any legal dns hostname or ip-address
this approach would be similar to using json or xml but is more performant since hessian is a binary protocol
what s very neat about ctags is that it can be combined with vim with either the taglist plugin to allow source code browsing or with vim omnicomplete to enable code-completion
in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json
this gives you more flexibility allows you to more easily increase the number of ways cell can link to each other and generally more scalable
the ol rule of thumb was columns that are used a lot in where order by and group by clauses or any that seemed to be used in join frequently
an http-post is more general
http is much worse
most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset
for example quicksortaverage cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksortis typically much faster than heapsort
the downside is that release planning and velocity estimation is not as accurate as with scrum but this hybrid xp methodology helps developers focus on tasks .when ready and not waste too much time in meetings
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclassing implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
given the choice there is generally no reason to choose primitive c-strings over c++ strings std string
if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql
to increase performance the xml-serialization infrastructure dynamically generates assemblies to serialize and deserialize specified types
the tutorials i ve found online on using raw sockets all describe how to build a syn flooder but this is somewhat easier than actually establishing a tcp connection since you don t have to construct a response based on the original packets
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2
secondly they both protect you from sql-injection only as long as you don t use dynamic-sql that is sql that writes more sql and then executes it
the current version of vs does not allow changing the tabcontrol s template but it can be done using blend and there is a margins on the template
other problems like finding a path that crosses every vertex in a graph or getting the rsa private-key from the public key is harder o e n
another interresting thing is that a sollution would be harmfull for public private-key encriptions like rsa
a mix between authentication users authorization based on reputation not likely to be accumulated through flooding throttling how many you can do a day the occasional captcha and finally community moderation to cleanup the few that get through - all combine to provide a decent solution
for instance a binary search tree might have the invariant that for every nodes the key of the nodes s left child is less than the nodes s own key
on the other hand there are many php frameworks out there such as cakephp symfony and codeigniter that take a load it as you need it approach
it s easy to see that there s a basic algorithm that matches any 2 of these three insertion-sort matches 1 and 2 merge sort matches 1 and 3 heapsort matches 2 and 3 but i cannot for the life of me find anything that matches all three of these criteria
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library
also assuming you re working in .net 2.0 or later it s unlikely you ll ever need to implement a finalize because typically safehandle can be used to wrap your unmanaged resources
so i run a tail on the logfile and pick out the lines of interest
edit i can t think of a c++ library with the type of pluggable persistence mechanism you re describing but i did something in python that could have had this type of facility added
but using scp or rsync over ssh is probably better than ftp if you can
if you call getimage too early your component will not have been display yet and will still have a 0 width and height
i would recommend jmeter for making threaded calls to the http-request that your gui is making
oracle s connect by is somewhat more flexible as it doesn t impose nearly as many limitations on the query structure as cte s do but if you re using sql-server this won t be an option
any width less than the contains will work
until people have more experience with google google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
there are bigger issues for example common-lisp has a more powerful object system so you can t map it 1 1 to object in the runtime no mi for one
2 on projects where svn is not install my deployment script is more complex it creates the version.php file locally zips the code uploads and extracts it
a fully correct standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std ifstream s rdbuf into a std ostringstream and from there into a std string
tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus
you didnt mention which engine you were using which might be relevant in this case count is much faster in myisam than in innodb for example
there were some reports that this method is slower than preallocating the string and using std istream read
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time
i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel
the cells can be of different colspans so when the cell is dropped into the middle of another cell which is bigger the following steps should be performed
you really can t compare xml to csv because csv is an extremely limited way of representing data
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors
kernel modules in particular will be very compatible between solaris and opensolaris
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1
taken from regexbuddy s library will match any line that does not contains boon.ini and or http
they also claim generics provide better performance than casting between reference-type which seems to be untrue no one can quite prove it
be mindful that with the a-star algorithm at least you will need to figure out a admissible heuristics to determine whether a possible next step is closer to the finished route than another step
the logging application block has a instrumentation event that can be used to trace events you can find more info on the ms enterprise library docs
of course if you have very little config and are not concerned with multiple environments then app-config is more standard and is probably the best way to go
i strongly recommend working with a reporting tool that provides native support for export to pdf it is much easier for management purposes if you can start with a single format and report to handle both the printing and archiving of information
in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc
database migrations should be straightforward - dump the database on the server either at the cmd-line or through an interface such as phpmyadmin and export it back in similar ways phpmyadmin is recommended if you have no experience with the mysql cmd-line
depending on the device you are trying to communicate with there may be more parameters than the baud-rate number of data bits type of parity checking and number of stop bits to consider
as an example the following code snippet will save the results of a call to perldoc into a scalar avoids the shell and throw an exception if the page cannot be found since perldoc returns 1
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand
my experience is that assertions even if complex and time-consuming traversing the whole free list to check invariants are much less work and are more reliable than unit-testing esp
by breaking up the statements onto many line it becomes easier to identify the culprit of a bug in your query
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64bit int conversion
if you choose xhtml as a standard your markup will be more likely to be useful in an ajax environment
on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins
virtually every other aspects of your system is more likely to be compromised than aes
dhh has implied that he prefers namespaces with http basic-authentication but that has remained a simple implication and not one of the official rails opinions
cracking an aes encryption is already impossible with 128bit key length
you can then manually add servers that should be treated as intranet by clicking the sites button then advanced or tell ie not to automatically detect your intranet and selecting the other checkbox as appropriate
i never found parallels to be much faster or slower than vmware - it often would be a case of the state of the vm i was running the host machine itself and the app s i was running within the vm
although your development computer may not simulate complicated touch-events such as multifinger touches the simulator lets you perform pinches
i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby
but it would be great to have a resource with administration capability that does more than setup configure sites but the ftp account email account disk quota management etc
this kind of question is more about religion.war than objective aspects
i would tend to recommend this pattern be used for applications because it gives you a single place to handle things like authentication and often you ll need to integrate things at a tighter level where having new features be classes that are registered with the controllers via some mechanism makes a lot of sense
i wasn t trying to imply that linq is better than ruby python
i don t mean to push my own questions but this might help you a little especially if you are not familiar with expression studio or expression-blend what exactly is microsoft expression studio and how does it integrate with visual studio
the user can select any rows desired by checking the checkbox on the row and you can get all the selected rows easily inot a collection to process
both of which are perfectly possible with perforce but the git workflow has some advantages. so although tributary development would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing we d still maintain a master git-repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created
edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations
i suspect this has already been done but a simple implementation would be less than 100 line of code in your favorite scripting language
now before i started using an inversion of control container i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectsettings object for each of the objects that requires more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size
i m more likely to build an abstract-class if i think there should be a creational contract specifically that a specific type of constructor should always be supported by subclassing
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa
this is downcasting and there is no sane down way to handle it for exactly the reason you described subclassing provide more than base-classes - where does this more come from
the difference become bigger with more processor
rules like every function should be less than 25 line just don t work
perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expressions
there is no advantage to be gained by switching from perl to python
there is also no advantage to be gained by switching from python to perl
create sequences which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generates unique numbers when selected from as opposed to serial which generates the unique number when the row is inserted
if you honestly have more than 64 value in a single field your field might be getting more complicated
using rails v2.1 lets say you have an action for a controllers that is accessible from more than one location
making any change to a row probably takes just as much i o as writing the entire row except of course updating indexed columns also requires index writes so you lose out by making severalupdatess which hit lots of rows
some methods will be left private and tested implicitly as part of unit tests for the public protected methods
oracle people will tell you oracle is better sql-server peopele will tell you sql-server is better
imho oracle has better vldb support than sql-server for the following reasons
oracle has better table partitioning facilities than sql-server
oracle can be run on somewhat larger hardware than sql-server although one can run sql-server on some quite respectably large systems
it s trivial to find all the local variables in any given function and the size for each variable can be found either through the c standard for built in types or by calculating it for complex types like struct and unions
edit i should have mentioned that this is specifically for .net compact-framework 2.0 which doesn t support assemblyfileversion
writing a couple of line of test is quicker than debugging later on
looks like i may just be stuck with downloading editing and re-uploading the document
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests
i really feel that the caps lock button should be renamed free parking and oses should make a system-tray utility to quickly change the free parking button from escape to control to anything you need to type over and over again
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort
new projects in visual studio 2003 and later have the compile as c++ code tp option set by default so any .c files will be compiled as c++
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code
second if the set type is the better answer how do i key it to look at just the first element of the tuples instead of the whole thing
php offers a myriad of ways to handle this including magic-methods __get and __set but i prefer explicit getter and setters
validation can be placed in setter and getter for that matter
i prefer grouping my join conditions with my joins hence i use the inner-join syntax
the system.componentmodel.typedescriptor stuff can be used to add attributes to typesproperties and object instances and it has the limitation that you have to use it to retrieve thoseproperties as well
the stdinparse utility can be used to call it from the cmd-line
structured configuration files use declarative syntax as simple as key-value pairs to identify what a string or value of data means
how about union-if you are using it can it be changed to union-all
ssh encrypts all communications does everything telnet does and more
amazon doesn t support more than one set of credentials per account
when decoding the letters a truncated final block can be filled out with zero letters and converted to a 47-bit base 2 representation
i recommend visualsvn-server once you re ready to install.
16-bit arithmetic was faster than 32-bit arithmetic though the cpu could handle a logical memory space of up to 4 gib
my question is how this can be done in weblogic webspehre glassfish etc.
this would be the default scenario if you haven t done any tweaking of cmd-line options
what are your own reasons to prefer python over perl
so if you have a function that is called many times but only has a limited amount of code - a couple of line - you could benefit from inlining because the function call overhead might take longer than the execution of the function itself
i m from the school of thought where try-catch blocks should be used and exception-handling not rethrown
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability
at the very least you will lose stack trace information - the stack you will see will only extend to the methods in which the new exception is thrown - you potentially lose some good debug info here
how to convince people python is better than perl
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once
show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl
next understand that if you have added or removed a nodes you may have unbalanced the tree
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object
c# business layer - deals with taking user request submitted via http recived by an aspx page gathering the correct response based on the state of the database and returning it to the client via xml although i would recommend json
i m familiar with some of the basics but what i would like to know more about is when and why error-handling including throwing exception-handling should be used in php especially on a live site or web app
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hashed value as clear text
if the program loses focus for any reason call comes in user switches programs user hits the windows button then i want a popup dialog box to cover the puzzle and the timer to stop
for example when an element is appended by anything to the document i would like to be passed that element to act on it like
in a unit test file i m trying to grab this url using django.core.urlresolvers.reverse instead of just copying category dry and all that
one key is to understand that javascript dom call are way slower than html parsing
by default html elements are as tall as required to contains their content
i want to display a leading zero for all numbers with less than 2 digits
i d recommend setting category for the crashes blocking security php error warning vs exception etc
perl has constants multi-line anonymous functions and autovivification but python has better default object orientation
the subversioning versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server
you could argue that the iteration process is less efficient but a for _ each also introduces a function-call at each step which might be mitigated by trying to inline the function but remember that inline is only a suggestion to the compiler - it may ignore it
adding to the end of a linked-list is o 1 but the constant multiplier is larger than arraylist since you are usually creating a nodes object every time
the everything-is-an-object model in python is what made me oo programming really click for me - and as a former php programmer and doubly-certified zend engineer i strongly recommend exploring python s oo if you want to understand what oo is all about
in python under what circumstances is swig a better choice than ctypes for calling entry-points in shared-libraries
this approach works if your subset is smaller than your total size by a significant margins
if however you cannot modify the input list at all and k is much less than n like 5 from 100 it would be much better not to remove selected elements each time but simply select each element and if you ever get a duplicates toss it out and reselect
if you have followed a design pattern like mvp then it might be easier but if not then much of your business logic is likey going to have to be moved to controllers classes and much of it re-written
more details about managing the registry in powershell can be found by typing get-help registry at the powershell cmd-prompt
this makes things a lot easier and allows c++0x templates to be treated like a perfectly functional language using variadic-templates
and since they re simple text files they can be generated by any program such as scripting languages and if necessary even a text-editor
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility
you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important
even in scalar code loading 8-bit or 16-bit values is no slower than loading 32-bit since movzx movsx is no different in speed from mov
fewer line means fewer bugs
controllers methods should be as small as possible and all business processing should be done in model and view logic processing should take place in view
i always recommend darcs for this situation here s my answer to a similar question as its cmd-line user interface is a joy to use and joy is what i want from my own development
json is a more compact object notation than xml so if you re looking for high volumes it has the advantage
pypng is a single pure python module less than 4000 line long including tests and comments
it seems that for your situation it might be simplest to get pdftotext the cmd-line tool then you can do something like
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful
while you might find a solution that works for strings for numerical predicates you need to also make sure they re only passing in numbers simple check is can it be parsed as int double decimal
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue
now line entered in shell 2 will be written to shell 3 and vice versa and the traffic logged to shell 1 something like
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6
truncate can therefore not be rollback and a failure in the truncate process will have issued a commit anyway
mysqland mssql both provide this functionality iirc so i would be surprised if postgresql didn t
imageicon implements serialization and it can be used to wrap an image class
not every event will be recorded by selenium-ide
if it s a client app that doesn t use asp.net etc you may be able to use the .net client profile install which is much smaller c
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface
hopefully xsd is not the only way to validate a xml a much more simpler approach is to use relaxng and especially its compact syntax which is really more readable than what you could ever imagine with xsd
i think hudson can even be used to call ant tasks though a maven wrapper might be in order
for generic possibly malformed html there are libraries to handle that kigurai recommends beautifulsoup for python i know also tagsoup for java there are others
if the width is greater thenheight 3 4 screen.width then
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying
i ve made a few assumptions as follows there are no overlaps of date ranges there are no null value in any of the field and the start date for a given row is always less than the end date
dependencies can be injected into object by many means such as constructor injection or setter injection
more information about the original 1981 tcp-ip specification can be found in rfc 793 and the many other rfcs involving extensions or modifications to the tcp-ip protocol
in the enabled protocols list select tcp-ip then click properties
i don t know if anybody with enough rights to edit the answer will see this but while the answer is correct i would like to add that without specifying the collation explicitly the default collation of the database would be used in this case since it is implicitlyassigned to every varchar-variable without a collation statement
i ve had very bad experiences with cruisecontrol.net instability - going down randomly - so i like the simplicity of phing
all of these operators can be applied to integer values int long possibly short and byte or char
that being said i greatly prefer asp.net both asp.net-mvc and webforms myself - but i left asp development about 7 years ago
just remember that if you have a warehousing strategy of dropping indexes before updating a table then recreating them you will have to set the index up for monitoring again and you ll lose any monitoring history for that index
if you remove the generic constraint above where t entity you could make this a generic rules engine that could be used with any poco
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not
the groupcontains w which means non-word character and - so the regex should match any non-word character or any hyphen
you can also get this if you re loading c++ functions that need to be declared extern-c - c uses cdecl c++ uses stdcall calling-convention by default iirc
in php a string enclosed in double-quotes will be parsed for variables to replace whereas a string enclosed in single-quotes will not
for some reason using nmake from the cmd-line is slightly faster and linking the same application on linux with gcc is much faster
and use a component that has a prompt to show the prompt and enable input and a also follows the usual shell abstraction of having stdin an inputstream that reads from the prompt but can be bound to let s say files or so and stdout and possibly stderr outputstreams bound to the textarea s text
since system.valuetype s children live on stack there is no reference pointers to the heap and thus no way to do a reference check you must compare objects by value only
and just as a complete set of tax forms includes not just the main tax form but others that may need to be filled out additional schedules for example so a packagecontains not just the main classes but other classes it may need to interact with
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specification so that you can pick any servlet container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic
if its mainly cpu bound then i would create no more than 1 worker thread per processor core on the box
in some cases managed-code can actually be faster than native-code
i d say the python community is larger and more mature than the ruby community and that s really important for me
but the most efficient general way i could find is to use a foreach loops on the arrays shortcircuiting whenever a hit is found at least the implicit loops is better than the straight for
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven
another interesting pattern is the presenter first pattern by atomicity objects
in iis this will require you to either add each hostname manually however this could also be archieved through scripting or have a dedicated ip-address only for you site
c# readonly and java final are nowhere as useful as c++ s const there s no way you can expose readonly complex data a tree ofnodes for example in c# without tremendous work while it s a built-in feature of c++
the content type multipart form-data should be used for submission forms that contain files non-ascii data and binary data
note that it is possible in principle to extend an immutable class and change the base fields if the base classcontains a reference to an array the elements within the array cannot be declared final
i d have to check up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.
python s windows-support is much more mature than ruby s
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common-lisp so that narrows it down a bit
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs
when the constructor throw no destructor will be called in this case you don t show a destructor that frees the dynamically allocated objects but lets assume you had one
the onunload javascript event doesn t work every time the http-request takes longer than the time required to terminate the browser
looks like the new line are having a much greater affect than the spaces
the wrapper also provides better user experience through an application icon a native pre-jre splash-screen a custom process name and a java download page in case the appropriate jre cannot be found
think about project-management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant
you should use tls ssl https so that eavesdropping on the http traffic is harder to perform
i m not familiar with oracle but in mysqlyou can use use|ignore|force_index see here for more details
your web server should use compression for this extension and your code should check if the number of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet
in my experience servers that are heavy on dynamic content tend to be impacted less by http because the time spent encrypting ssl-overhead is insignificant compared to content generation time
3des is more expensive than aes for example
bottom line making lots of short requests over https will be quite a bit slower than http but if you transfer a lot of data in a single request the difference will be insignificant
you don t say what you want to do with the resulting data but if it s general queries for development maintenance then i d have thought remote desktop to the windows-server and then using the actual sql server tools on their would always have been a more productive option over any hacked together solution on linux itself
for cryptography purposes you should use one of the standard cryptography libraries out there instead such as openssl which will indeed use dev urandom when available
but if you only want to copy and not zip filesystemobject or wmi is better
a cmd-line version which allow to be batched or integrated with other tools cvs subversion ide ...
it matches any character which is not contains in the ascii character set 0-127 0x0 to 0x7f
this means that from the user s perspective pages with plenty of static content will appear to load slower after the browser is restarted and from your server s perspective the volume of requests for static content over https will be higher than would have been over http
i ve just started reading the art of ruby-on-rails which covers some more advanced topics such as meta-programming api design and rspec
i happen to like leading underscores for private instances variables it seems easier to read and distinguish.of course this thing can get you into trouble with edge cases public instances variables not common i know - either way you name them you re arguably breaking your naming convention
regarding maintenance imho is better to change a single line of code the regular expression pattern than understand lines and lines of parsing code or whatever the regular expressions purpose is
how can an object be loaded via hibernate based on a field value of a member object
this seems to be broken in firefox and ie but work in opera safari and chrome
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system-requirements and works better across platform than ogre in my opinion
i prefer having the option of using short local variable names especially for-loops variables
currently we pop-up a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletes but we need something better than this
its a good practice -- especially when you get to a point where the controllers will need to do more than simple delegation to the underlying dal
hence you will probably be better off by using non-static methods for the controllers
the reason is that the one of the other border elements with a templatebinding of borderbrush was further down in the visual tree and was capturing the mouse click that s why setting the borderbrush to null allowed the checkbox to correctly receive the mouse click
you may want to consider looking through all the documents that match category using a termdocs iterator
each child window can be maximized minimize closed inside this container but you wont find any of these in the taskbar
line that are longer than the width of the screen
you should be able to use a combination of labels and id attributes to pick out the correctproperties for your edit-in-place implementation to work
as much as 40 of your communication on the wire can be control flow messages and chat between clients asking for pieces
as you can see the form input takes up more space than plain text
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint
from the user perspective a form that just does the right thing by figuring out what i want makes me much happier than having to understand a stack of textbox checkbox and dropdown lists
i believe the aspstate database creates and destroys temporary tables as needed it does not have permanent tables you can query take a look at the stored procedures and you should find one along the line of tempgetitem you can either use this sproc directly or examine its source for more insight
you can t buy expression-blend and design for anything but the highest level on the license and that just ticks me off
10 years ago disks were so much faster than processor that you didn t have to worry about it so much
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky so you must have halved your radians or something
glut hasn t been updated for awhile but you can also try freeglut which is a newer open source replacement of glut and is included by several linux distributions out of the box
the rulescollection seems to have to be marked as serialization otherwise it does not retain its members
because of the more tedious way of adding hosts to be monitored in nagios it requires defining a host object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c++ and java
if you do choose this it seems like you d need to draw thin polygons rather than regular line to get any kind of interesting look as in the crayon example
personally i m fairly comfortable interacting with mysql s cmd-line interface and haven t used their gui tools very much but i just downloaded query browser and it seems like it does exactly what you re looking for
to me this is a lot clearer than the equivalent using repeated if else or a composite ternary conditional which gets very messy for non-trivial expression - brackets galore
can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criteria - maybe a lookup list
btw jax-rs can be run inside any servlet engine - you just build a.war and deploy it there are examples in the jersery samples - though jersey also comes with a small lightweight web server you can use too which is a little easier to use - again there are examples in the distro of this
furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access
you can programmatically build a select statement to see if any tuples point to more than one row
if that returns any rows your index is not unique since more than one row maps to the given tuples
the .net framework includes math.ieeeremainder x y in addition to the standard modulo
if you don t enclose the json string in parentheses property names can be mistaken as labels resulting in unexpected behaviour or a syntax-error
in other words how can i find records that match any of the flags in my mask that i m sending to the procedure
communication between your user-interface code and your service can be implemented using any rpc mechanism named pipes work particularly wellook-and-feelor this purpose
alternatively for greater control over the http-request you can use winhttp.winhttprequest.5.1 in place of msxml2.serverxmlhttp
this would return the size to the ajax and then a progress-bar would be sized and maybe display the uploaded size to the user
that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around
int is the better choice for the id column and better suited if you should use a sequences to generate the unique ids
other sql engines provide a better separation between the datamodel and the storage retrieval system allowing for quicker changes of data and schema
i checked the ..xoml.wfconfig.xml file and set the properties for required to true i set the content type to required and i used share point design to mark them as required
if you d be allowed to move to something java compatible yet has a syntax that s at least closer to perl than java check out groovy
i would also recommend using inner-join instead of table multiplication select from foos bars
generally the frameworks won t do authentication by default you either have to enable it by creating some form of acl or by extending some kind of security manager type interface
it s sort of a hybrid control...what i do though is add a combobox right before the text box with options the user then selects invoices and then enter the invoices number...more a user friendly ui but some of my peers says it s an extra click
we have a couple of small subprojects in other languages java and ruby specifically as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively lxml mysql drivers etc
this is faster than using division or modulo
it feels like sometimes my throw clause is more voluminous than my method content
stack allocation is much faster since all it really does is move stack pointers
at that point i d thoroughly recommend playing with linq to objects for quite a while before you start using linq-to-sql or the entity framework
it aims to be totally compatible with .net so you d end up using c# and asp.net just the same
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land
for that reason git gives individuals better local version-control
but it will not show you the differences in the structure of xml file - it will just match line that look the same
if you spread the parameters over multiple lines but have several on each line it makes it more difficult to find particular parameters when reading the code
however exchange server 2007 sp1 can be installed on windows-server 2008
maybe not as bad as where to put your curly-braces but it s up there
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer
first off the selenium-ide is rather limited you should consider switching to selenium rc which can be driven by java or perl or ruby or some other languages
the estimated query plan indicated that the basic inner-join would be 3 times slower than the nested sub-queries however when actually running the query the basic inner-join was twice as fast as the nested queries the basic inner-join took 297ms on very minimal server hardware
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation
assuming you are using .net you can set up a .settings file to store your configuration data - the data contains there will be stored as default values for those config entries so even if there is no app.config file your application will run with those defaults
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code
if i am writing a c c++ application that uses many numeric values that will always fit within the provided range of a short integer is it more efficient to use 4 byte integers or 2 byte integers
the linq code has to be converted by linq-to-sql into a sql command for the remote data pulls - anything that has to be done locally cannot be included
if you have more than 6 lines wihtout a blank line then that group is probably not a cohesive thought idea operation
when a user copy-paste a line from a file however that is bigger than my textarea the overflow-x property does not work instead the textarea wordwraps the long line
if you are cpu bound 32-bit operations on a 32-bit cpu will be faster than 16-bit
when you don t set a font mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single quotes
this icon allows you to select cell in the workbook to pull the data from
the ruby simpledb library is not as complete as activerecord the default rails db adaptor so many of the features you re used to will not be there
if i wanted to publish the results as a doctoral thesis i would make a bigger deal about this and i would probably compare gcc tendra ten15 llvm watcom borland visual c++ digital mars icc and other compilers
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..
i want to match line where there is a string of 6 letters but only if these six letters are not andrea how should i do that
i m guessing your consultant is suggesting use a status variable instead of exception-handling for error-handling is a better practice
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr
this is even more of an issue when the desired return-type is not void especially when used as an lvalue
i want to hear about why you would not choose linq-to-sql for a particular project - including what project parameters make it unsuitable
the relationship between the user table and the roles table works exactly as it would with form-based authentication and should be utilized to grant appropriate permissions to users that you trust
sleep.exe is included in most resource kits the windows-server 2003 resource kit which can be installed on windows xp too
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method
the repository aspects is easier because it groups all the repositories into one url for easier settings.xml configuration
well a camera is nothing more than where it is placed again a 4x4 or 4x3 matrix or a position and orientation plus some projection parameters field of view aspects ratio ...
that can be used by any of the business classes in the library but the front-end ui has no way of directly accessing the datamodel ensuring that the business layer always acts as an intermediary
i installed mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompiled asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net
of course if you stop using var then you get around the whole problem and your code becomes more readable ok thats subjective but for something like this it s more readable by other people
in your question you are using static-class methods b.foo d.foo this cannot be accomplished using inherited because the static methods do not have a dynamic nature they do not take part in the lookup system
lambda expressions can be converted to expression trees which allows for a lot of the magic like linq-to-sql
the next release of eclipse should be based on cocoa rather than carbon which is the current but that won t be until next june
mootoolssortables are actually better than scriptaculous because they are dynamic
when a new item is added to a scriptaculous sortable you have to destroy recreate the sortable to make the new item sortable
i m interested in command-line applications even those that i can just execute and have spit out an answer without needing inputs for things like kinematics planar motion newton s laws gravitation work energy momentum and impulse systems of particle rotational kinematics and dynamics angular momentum static equilibrium oscillatory motion wave motion sound physical optics electrostatics gauss law electric field and potential capacitance resistance dc circuits magnetic field ampere s law and inductance
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days
for example mysqland oracle allow multiple nulls in a unique column or set of columns because null is not a value and cannot be considered unique null
one catch is that the jvm does not unload classes by default the reason is backwards-compatibility - that people assume wrongly that static initializers would be executed only once
i work in php in the lamp stack so i don t have to handle bunches of external libraries the way i probably would if i was using perl and the projects i develop on lamp are usually simpler than my windows development
json becomes a javascript object pretty quickly and doesn t have to be parsed like xml does
there s also agile project-management with scrum which is more for the scrum master and product owner roles specifically
assuming that doesn t result in too many files for the shell to handle these will all be passed as arguments to cat and the output will be written to out.txt
instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font-size around
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems
if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy
here s an example of how you can get that information using python and here s an example of it being put to use as a django form field which allows you to easily validate an image s existence filesize dimensions and format given its url
an english sentence would be encoded into ...language-neutral atomicity elements of meaning ... which could then be reconstituted into any language with a structured syntactic form and grammatical structure
the problem is you can t really tell the user how many characters are allowed in the field because the escaped value obviously has more characters than the unescaped one
apache itself can be configured to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job
for php what is the default time after which an http-request is deemed to have timed out
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common-lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work
if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me
as for the read timeout that is trickier you need it to be low so you don t exhaust your pool of workers who are waiting for the remote service to return but you also don t want it so low that it closes the connection before reading a response
it is my understanding that when the crashed node comes back its transaction will have been rollback since it never got the commit message
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content
.when you re ready to submit use the check consistency file | more option to create a changelist on the basis of the modified files
actually changing the content of the image to a binary response from an http-post is much more involved - although you could look into base64-encoding the response stream and using the data url scheme to display the resulting image in your page
you can match any number of nested parens through brute force but you can t ever match an arbitrarily long set of nested brackets
log4net is a richer and more flexible way of tracing or logging than the in-built trace or even asp health monitoring
for instance one of the recommendations is to use elements when your data must not be normalized for white space as xml processor can normalize data within an attribute thereby modifying the raw text
the microsoft stack does favor sql-server when no other spec is given and lamp favors mysqlbut i don t see it as being that strong of a bond
i had a nice 4 processor machine that wouldn t use more than 1.2 processors at a time
join operations can be translated to binary-tree operations by merging trees
it does not control which interface will be used to send the packets the kernel s routing table will be consulted to determine which interface has the lowest cost to reach a particular destination
i agree with many of the answers above and also believe that null can be used where appropriate in a normalized schema design - particularly where you may wish to avoid using some kind of magic number or default-value which in turn could be misleading
for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default value of false and null not be allowed but this implicitly asserts that we know that the whatever is not ready when in fact we may have no such knowledge
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev
i prefer syntax highlighter implementations i m using wordpress-plugin implementation for my blog
however even with rdtsc you will be including the time your code was switched out of execution while a better solution than using time clock if you need an exact measurement you will have to turn to a profiling that will instrumentation your code and take into account when your code is not actually executing due to context switches or whatever
i would have thought that it would be clear cut whether memory allocation is faster in managed-code than in native-code - but there seems to be some controversy
there are many cases where procedural-programming makes more sense than oop an converting for the sake of converting could be as you said overkill
if you re truly using mvc then your controllers should intercept the particular action that should be taken invoke any data-related requests and shove the data into your model objects so that the model can then be placed into the view
will work fine in bash if you re aiming for portability across various unix environments where you can t be sure that the default shell will be bash and whether it supports the -z test condition it s safer to use the form if x some_var x since that will always have the intended effect
will content requested over http still be cached by web browsers or do they consider this insecure behaviour
i would highly recommend gallio formally mbunit for unit testing and unfortunately not free ncover for code-coverage
especially git is much more efficient but you ll probably need a little more time to wrap your head around the concepts of distributed source control and you have to live without fancy gui tools for now also the cmd-line tools have become much more usable lately
are you sure the frame fits completely within the screen and contentsize s width is not greater than the scroll view s width
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb
in visual studio open your project s properties and go to the signing tab select sign the clickonce manifests and create test certificate
in general when i keep line short it makes better decisions as to how to format the code
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property
it s pretty simple the core principle is that you create an image larger than the element set the image as a background-image and position it using background-position so only the bit you want is visible
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types
for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around
that being said output buffering might be just a tiny bit faster as the space allocated for the input is fairly large by default 40k according to this
my understanding is that this was an ie-only property that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped
the method getunittestclasses should be rewritten to add all project classes extending testcase except if the class name ends in integration-testing
however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code
most of the stuff can be done in interop but you need a driver to get the filename cause it lives in the kernel s address space
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#
i guess that will be released .when it s ready
to build business objects there is a lot of leg work that needs to be done and this should be tackled by a code generator. i m not using one though as i still want to get a grip of the framework the latest versioning of csla 3.5 cuts down the amount of code in properties and we have upgrade because of this
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
if the creation of orders customers will always be centralized an unsigned int would be fine
this is rather easier to program to and easier to read since you don t have to write empty implementations of listener callbacks that you re not interested in and yes i know about listener adaptor superclasses
note that the assemblyfileversion attribute is not available under .net compact-framework
logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file without touching the application binary
why this is better than subclassing an adaptor i have no idea
what i found annoying is that ctrl-space input will be stolen by windows-xp to switch the language bar instead of setting the mark in emacs
it s cmd-line and will eventually be run on mono
google google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers
unsavvy users might get caught by behaviors like vmware s player that changes mac and other ids of the virtual-machine when you move it presumably in a nod to this kind of issue
why binary-compatibility is better or...why you shouldn t do what we do
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome render the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderer versions may be different the java script engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror
while this is going back many years at a time when the cost of entry into a sql-server installation was as prohibitive as oracle one of my clients was using access to try to manage an inbound call center
the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris
coming from a rails background castle project ar will feel closer to what you re used to but linq-to-sql is better integrated with the whole microsoft ecosystem and you may find this is worth the extra effort to learn it
or and if you do not have access to the source or if this is easier you can simply pass the system properties above into the jvm by adding these options to the cmd-line
json is smaller and simpler than xml
xml has a bit more overhead than json because of the angle brackets and extra information and what not
so for this i decided to make a base-class which all other objects that will need to be rendered will inherited called gameobject
i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api calls than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide
of course java sintax is more like c++ than like delphi but i think that the object model is more similar to delphi
the following approach a inner join works in linq to objects but can not be translated to sql with linq-to-sql
even if you don t use that garbage collecting memory manager i would still recommend delphi over c++
for excel add-ins as you mentioned in your comment i would recommend delphi over c++ builder because it has better com support which i believe you need for excel add-ins
python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures
for anything more complex i would worry as mocks generated from mocking frameworks can be given precise expectations about how they will be used the numbers of methods called the precise sequence and the parameters expected each time
dag bruck proposed this extension calling the base-class inherited. the proposal mentioned the multiple inherited issue and would have flagged ambiguous uses
local collections can be used in linq-to-sql with the contains method
although superficially the syntax of c++ looks more like that of java delphi s object model is actually closer to that of java
edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -
when a bank account transfer of a large sum of money takes longer than a transfer of a small amount as indicated by the progress-bar showing increasing amounts being transferred
its syntax is quirky and it wasn t created with the abstractions necessary for projects of more than 100 line or so in mind
how then is tcp-ip supposed to notify the developer if packet delivery fails permanently the destination host is no longer reachable
a big fat open proxy is not good over http either but with authentication required it feels fine to me
http goes through a proxy -- i m not too concerned about my traffic being sniffed as it s ssh that ll be going plaintext through the tunnel -- but it s a lot more likely to be mangled than https which fundamentally cannot be proxied
go into window - preferences then select java - installed jres clone the jre used by tomcat and add the following to the default vm arguments
if you only wanted to trap selection of a single column of cells you could insert a hidden column to the right extend the selection to include the hidden cell to the right when the user clicked and this gives you an editable cell which can be trapped every time it is clicked
moss considerably more expensive than wss which ships as part of microsoft server licensing
happily you can use sql dcl begin transaction commit transaction rollback transaction etc to acomplish things not possible with dao nested transactions
yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi
in practice i ve found that even when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration
however if you are multiplying your currency numbers by floating-point types or dividing your currency values the rounding does need to be worked out one way or the other
specific performance tuning methods vary by database but in general avoid returning more records or fields than you actually need make sure all join fields are indexed as well as common where clause fields avoid cursors although i think this is less true in oracle than sql server i don t know about mysql
anyone have pointers for properly handling this situation so that the resources in unmanaged-code can be cleaned up and a usable exception can be thrown out to the managed-code which initiated the whole call stack
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application
i ll state my bias upfront - oracle is far more complex than sql-server
exceptions should be marked serialization
similarly error should throw further than runtimeexception and runtimeexception further than checked-exceptions
so i m trying to match balancing curly-braces where some of the opening curly-braces have an optional word followed by a colon
basically the design we have says that all such changeds have to be made in atomicity complete operations that are called do their work and return
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.
on the other hand if one project is 10 000 line of code and the other is 1 000 000 line the second project is significantly more complex in general
i heard that microsoft used to fire 5 of people every 6 months i always imagined it would be based on line of code written which is why windows is so bulky slow and inefficient
i personally recommend truecrypt for thumb drives and other portable media and windows-vista now include bitlocker which provides a different level of protection
these field may be stored either by value or by reference a pointer to a value
otherwise depending on your system encoding the request line and headers of your http-requests might be malformed wrong encoding
try finding out more info by logging asp.net application shutdown events
in flex and many other languages a function method of a class can be declared private or protected or public
however unlike anonymous types tuples have names and can be used inside public method-signature
any symlink to the file in bin would be broken by this but a hardlink being a link directly to the inode for the file wouldn t care
this looks like more of a limitation in the size of the arguments programs can receive because the in the for-loops works alright
jobs consist of a series of steps to be executed in order and when you add a new step to your job you can choose various types of step including transact-sql script
as others have suggested there is some significant difference in things you would do compared to sql-server if you just apply what you know from sql-server to oracle you ll likely kill performance
mathematically let s be cost of short-circuiting condition f cost of full condition and p be percent of cases where short-circuiting happens full condition is not necessary
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser
it seems that you are expecting internal classes used in the wcf service which you have marked as datacontracts to be exported as .net objects to your client code the silverlight ui
from memory solaris kept the mtoolkit as the default longer than on linux
if you want to use win32 ports of some unix utilities rather than installing cygwin i recommend gnu utilities for win32
if a 8-bit unsigned int were to be used for fixed-point math then the fractional part would be split into 256 evenly divisible parts
if creating constructors with arguments is bad as many would argue then making them with default arguments is even worse
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql sql and so forth
the situation where the two line have different behavior is when your script is not running in bash but some simpler shell in the sh family dash which i believe is used as bin sh in some linux distros because it is more lightweight than bash
it generates random words sentences using determinated rule you choose the sitecontains very funny things but in italian only the rules can be written in any language.
an in-process db like sql-server compact or ms-access is much more appropriate
personally i think it s very difficult to adhere to these types of requirements sometimes you just really need a method with more than 20 line but in the spirit of your question i ll mention some of the guideline used in an essay called object calisthenics part of the thoughtworks anthology if you re interested
if you do i would recommend mono which is a .net free implementation or java both platforms work well in windows osx linux
choosing between anonymous inner-classes and these named inner-classes is a largely a matter of style but i think this version is easier to understand and clearer when there are lots of actions
the application will be built on asp.net c# linq-to-sql server
if this is a factory on your data-access layer which will be used to populate business-objects with data from the database then yes this is the place to do it
keep in mind that there are not many differences between sqlmetal and the designer the designer is a more pretty ui for sqlmetal and hides many of the cmd-line switches
lines longer than 200 characters will appear in more than one line
making abstract classes before i had more than one subclassing in mind for them
you can either do it at runtime by getting a list of uuids from tableina and tableinb and working out which entries are new or you can have a table of items that need to be synced populate with a triggers upon insert update in tableina and run from that
after this time the only way strings were allowed to be changed was with permission from a very senior member of the project-management team
in some cases that s exactly what you want in others you might find that listening for .when the dom is ready is more appropriate - this event is similar to onload but fires without waiting for images etc
this is probably a bit better then grep -c as it doesn t try to match line to a pattern
on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processor limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up
temp in windows-vista are different from windows xp which should of course be taken into account when developing software that will have to run under windows at some point
a lot of companies are ignoring windows-vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows version when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows-vista
it may be of some use it s pretty short - should be less than 100 line of code in total when done..
this is fine for existing customers but new ones would see this hierarchy as needlessly complex and if i were designing it from the beginning i would not opt to implement it this way -- i have to or else i will lose backwards-compatibility
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull
assign the property to an initial value which can be distinguished from any other value that it might be set to null for reference types
thing2k s answer is pretty good but i d seriously recommend having code to contains child ui elements in the base uielement class
if you don t support this in the base class you ll run into major problems when you try to implement anything more complex than a textbox and a button
in general monkey patching is less used in python than in ruby
if you want a keyboard shortcut to be used from any control on the form without using a toolbar set
this really causes a problem if all the items are selected or the next item the user wants to select was part of the current selection
i think the biggest difference is that ruby is much more similar to perl in terms of useage
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration
i recommend downloading the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net framework 3.5 but if you don t have the network bandwidth or just want the samples then the last option should be the most suitable
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well
since it will take a while to work out the nuances you ll probably be happier with a dynamic language like python or ruby than with a static language like java or c#
is your own dsl and vm better than java or python
if you ve already done all that and more it s certainly possible you ll get to a point where you think i wonder if these few line of code right here could be optimized better than the assembly that i m looking at in the debugger right now
i would have expected static-classes to be unique to each request but it doesn t seem like that is the case
cobertura - an open source code-coverage tool that can easily be coupled with junit tests to generate reports
you should compare decimal to long-integer performance not floating point
that s why it s usually said that mysqlis best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
this is the section of code that describes how the object should be instantiated on deserialization - it sets the constructor arguments to three string values
the buffer being freed by wavecompleteheader is not the one contains the pcm data the responsibility to free the pcm buffer lies with the application and there s no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way
for example if the integer is less than shrt_max you can assume it s a short
four potential scrollbar are bad enough but if the overall page height is fixed higher than the browser window then it ll end up with five
i generally find new line more important than indentation
so xdebug is known not to work with many zend tools i know zend optimizer for certain i don t know about zend-debugger but i wouldn t be surprised if xdebug has a built-in check for that
i guess this might actually be a deeper problem with having to actually render html the contents of table cell but just to keep it simple - plaintext html table as an image
html table rendering is non-trivial due to the various ways that the sizes of the cell may be specified tables nested within tables etc
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
note that it will also match windows-server 2008
the rich text-editor must be implemented in java provide swing support and preferably be open source
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences
corfman finds that it is difficult to reduce his solution to less than 142 line of c++ stl
i m not overly concerned with the core-language of the package unless i d need to hack on the code for the system itself in which case i m reasonably comfortable with php perl and .net though i could probably pickup an other language s as needed
in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa
my team only ever needs to browse our svn repositories via a web browser and compare revision and for that we use websvn
i m not familiar with this error but have you verified that your security permissions are set correctly on the dedicated-server
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validate the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever
all my scripting is done in perl i can execute one liners at the cmd-line and perl regex seems way easier
i ve been using unix since 1988 and have probably written less than 1000 line of shell script
for example checkstyle has stronger support for checking javadoc and finding magic numbers to name a couple
when radio-button are being used the mandatory label won t be displayed form validation will complain if there s no value selected anyway
they can be included with any assembly and the most basic way to install components related to an assembly is to use installutil yourassembly.dll which would contains your code and custom installers
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference
another problem for those using linux is that the gnu tools have more options than the classic unix versions and you can lose portability not because of the shell programming constructs that you use but because of the command options you use
anything longer than zero line can be unit tested - usually to good effect
there are bindings for ming in perl via the swf module and i believe it can be used with php as well
wcf also allows more fine-grained control over the json serialization and deserialization if you desire it
doing de-referencing of memory pointers in the jvm can take a longer time with 64bit pointers than 32-bit
i think you can do this using the adobe acrobat-sdk a linux version of which can be downloaded for free from adobe
i would recommend csla .net framework by rockford lhotka
quicksortis worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.
i created a test application to compare the performance of both logging methods in several scenarios and i m finding that log4net is significantly slower than the trace class
windows drivers are under higher scrutiny under windows-vista and pretty much require certification imho
regarding serialization there is also a performance problem that i reported to microsoft connect the keyedcollection maintains an internal dictionary as well as a list and serializations both - it is sufficient to serialization the list as the dictionary can easily be recreated on deserialization
in addition silverlight supports a subset of xaml and the same control classes as wpf so your application can be ported as ria with minimal efforts
it s implementable in a few line of c and at runtime does little more than a couple test branches a little addition and bit shifting
edit a for loops on list t are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list t b looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list t c looping on arrays using for is 5 times cheaper than looping on list t using foreach which most of us do
i m not familiar enough with windows-vista to know if it programatically fakes out a harvard architecture for security reasons
i personally prefer this approach most of the time because you have more control over when the maven-plugin updates are done
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved
thus if you record a macros the best way to find these problems in 2003 and then run it in 2002 you will have run time errors relating to the new arguments that simply do not work in the 2002 vba editor
from the use case you ve described xml-serialization is the obvious choice datacontractserializer being more flexible than xmlserializer if you don t mind the dependency on .net 3.x
if you are targeting a business corporate market you ll find that some shops are strickly oracle or strictly sql-server and that your app might be ruled out in the early rounds of the competition based on the technology it uses
the following will match any matching set of tags
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django
so the first thing i do with a project is establish how it will be built java ant or maven
when multiple items are queued for the same group numbers they are guaranteed to be queued in sequence numbers order and will have the same priority
in addition to this type of selectivity higher priority items should be processed first and items that contain the same group numbers must be processed in sequence numbers order
mysqli am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem
when i select a node the label gets updated as expected and the treenode that i clicked on becomes highlight and the previously selected node is no longer highlight
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows
if you have columns that are very large such as binaries and images then it can make a significant difference which is why linq-to-sql allows you to specify delay loading for certain columns so that you can still select entire objects without performing select new projections
i d also add that a .net assembly has to be strongly named which requires it to be signed in order to be added to the gac
maybe restricting the syntax of expr is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example maybe all i really need is something that matches any expr that has balanced curly-braces
these commands should do the same things as the diagnose and repair for the network adaptor but is way faster
regarding memory issues .net makes it easier not to make the common mistakes of unmanaged-code but it is still far from immune
this style of notation is more useful when you mix acessibility for the getter and setter
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7
for a restful web service in which requests are submitted via http-get you really don t need anything more than a web browser
on os x this information is stored in directory services which can be accesed either through the apis in directoryservice.framework or by using the dscl cmd-line tool
once you re more comfortable with xml you will probably start to define rules that you ll use to determine whichproperties become attributes and whichproperties become elements
you might want to ask another question along the line of how do i use regex to match this pattern
the usual way is to loop over every element in the document for efficiency use a specific tag name if you know the class will only be applied to elements of a certain type and test the classname property of each noting that the property contains a space separated list of class names not a single class name
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass
i m not familiar with scons so i don t know the best way to get these settings configured for that tool but for standard makefiles there s usually a line in the makefile which sets a macro variable with the include directory path and that macro is used as part of a cmd-line parameter in the cmd that invokes the compiler
unfortunately according to msdn the scm s security can only be modified on windows-server 2003 sp1 or later
currently i document all public methods and anything more than 10 line
if you want to use a library for this i d recommend glib the utility library that lies underneath the gtk ui toolkit
what do you need to have in mind is that silverlight uses a smaller thus more limited library than wpf
if you can only teach one sort and have to do it quickly or the audience isn t really interested at all i would tend towardsselectedion because this is harder andselectedion could be taught quickly
the real rule is something more along the line of how readable it is
the basis of this book is that object oriented programming is highly wasteful memory-wise and that most source-code should not be written this way rather that you should use all inline function-calls and procedural programming
for reference i have code in a commercial app that can encode decode wma to from wav files in less than 100 line of c++ all wrapped up in a friendly .net class
there are some tricks like knowing that the order of the join does matter but i believe you ll just pick those up on the way
the items in the cell are wider that the cell width so the dropdown list is also wider than the cell so the user can see what top selected
this includes the more recent firefox and safari and opera browsers
the thing that gets me about the whole orm debate is that the same people who claim that using an orm will be too hard slow whatever are the very same people who are more than happy using linq-to-sql or typed datasets
often the functional code will be less than 100 line of code whereas the imperative implementation can be many more line of code
its not guaranteed to make any difference and if the dll is not used then it will have been swapped out and isn t part of the current working set
use | or | to protect it from shell interpertation and allow it to be passed to awk on the cmd-line
can the same thing be achieved with linq-to-sql
i d like to get sql to do the heavy lifting and only return data matching my criteria rather than having to select transfer and then process a potentially massive chunk of data
it competes with django and ruby-on-rails for rapid development but has a more flexible backend
put your startup.m in any of those directories and it will be found whenever you start matlab startup.m is also found if it is in the directory from which matlab is started but the technique above allows you to start matlab from an arbitrary directory and still have startup.m get run
with some exceptions hungarian notation i think consistent usage may be more useful than any arbitrary set of rules
so i understand that the scalability of the web tier of ebay and amazon should be much harder than the scalability of the google-search-engine where everything can be encoded restful into the url
my guess is that this would be accomplished by having the modal window as a user control which is loaded into a panel when displayed and that this panel is the one which would be animated somehow from the titlebar
for intance your fancy ecms might run on windows-server be written in .net you can t touch the core code but you can write scripts and plugins in vb c# and use an oracle database but publish a mixture of html and php pages to a cluster of linux apache web servers while you have a google appliance or lenya or some other product handle search
that there is more than just linq-to-sql and the features are more than just a sql parser embedded in the language
you could get fancy and allow additional subdividing of lines so a single line could eventually be broken into any number of sub-lines
as a result several people took up a huge interest in getting their contributions in and while kohana is based on all the same principles and ideas as codeigniter the implementation is much better and much easier to work with
it drives internet-explorer but is also functional with firefox and safari to some extent
a good article about writing filter-drivers is here i think you will need to register to read but if you want to write driver you should be registered on this site
and of course mono can be a great replacement for web services that you can create them on .net and you can host them on apache because linux hosting nowadays are more cheap than windows ones web services and other asp.net apps will work under apache with a mod_mono module that must be included in apache
if you need to be able to traverse the matrix row by row you can make the row map type a treemap and same for traversing the columns in index order but if you don t need those cases hashmap is quicker than treemap
the extglob shell option gives you more powerful pattern matching in the cmd-line
eventually with a large enough input set the quicksorton the slow hardware is going to be faster than bubble-sort on the fast hardware
when user will tries to login if we he failed to login n times captcha will be displayed so authentication will be using three parameters username password captcha
perhaps i could have given python django further consideration but it was time to make a decision and i choose ruby-on-rails
of course if you are a lightweight freak you can write your own routine for this should be less than 50 line
also see config general which claims to be fully compatible with apache configuration-files
i would expect the method to be called public string getvalue according to sun s naming-conventions
i have broken down the utility calls into smaller statements and tested manually using the cmd-line and all seemed to be well until i incorporate the sed statement
on linux ip from the iproute2 package behaves more predictably and gives easier-to-parse output than ifconfig route
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better
just for grins...you can also do this with streams just slightly more than 2 line of code
possible tendency towards wider acception jquery to be shipped with asp.net-mvc
an interesting comment in another thread compares jquery dojo prototype mootools sproutcore and cappuccino the question was removed
it converts between normal expressions and editableexpressions which are mutable and fully serialization so can be used with json xml binary etc
i m also very familiar with cruisecontrol.net and it s relatively horrific configuration format setup
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs
having a setter and getter isn t really any better than having a variable at that level of visibility
if not i recommend trying nginx another lightweight webserver that runs php in a separate process via fastcgi
edit as of 2008 2009 under the sap enterprise licensing agreement repaired objects may still be supported by sap
perhaps the linq-to-sql query is better optimised
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others
a preinitialised arrays would be faster than a hashmap
msbuild vs nant is slightly different as msbuild is bundled with either the framework or the sdk i can t remember which now - but i think nant is a more pleasant environment to work in
msbuild is clearly better for doing the raw build the solution bit - but you can invoke it from nant
a python or perl solution would be preferred but any solution would be a help
i d rather not have a proliferation of web services or helper pages returning xml json so if there s a way to use client callbacks or page methods can t you tell i m not particularly familiar with either - buzzword bingo
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is
these can be rerun whenever you like via a cmd-line tool
i should have mentioned that this is all already nested in a for-loops
they recommend separating out into a few main category including some you listed type layout color but going further to include various tricks to keep older browsers happy
with this in mind should someone who is approaching .net for the first time using vb.net and with a vb6 background be encouraged to get into the mindset of having to work with compile-time type checking because that s the best practice in the clr
live data can be read from ethernet ieee 802.11 ppp hdlc atm bluetooth usb token ring frame relay fddi and others depending on your platfrom
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories
i tend to prefer using zend-debugger for debugging and would love to find something like this that doesn t depend on xdebug
this is debatable because both of them have different performance pros and cons for example asp.net-mvc gives you control over the html js that gets to the browser so you can minimize the amount of data on wire to make the whole application weight less however asp.net-mvc routing have so much dependency on reflection which is relatively slower than fetching a file from the disk which webforms is doing
if you have a small number of category it s better to use solution a in bogdan maxim s answer
and similarly what weaknesses does git have compared to perforce
in any database system i ve worked with there is no harm in doing a rollback right after the commit so if you commit in the try block and rollback in the finally things get committed whereas if an exception or early return causes the commit to be missed the rollback will rollback the transaction
the projects share some assembly references the file systems are all structured to use the same bin folder making deployment of changes to those assemblies problematic since the ms installer will only overwrite assemblies if the currently install version is older than the one in the msi
keep in mind that anything you can do in nant can probably be done in msbuild as well
interesting question - i have a parser that can be compiled with bison byacc mks yacc or unix yacc and i don t do anything special to deal with resetting the grammar whether it fails or succeeds
you can do this and more with isapi-rewrite for iis
if you can ultimately only teach one algorithm at all i think selection-sort is even easier to teach and implement imho as bubble-sort
as per the wikipedia article on gb18030 gb18030 can be be considered a unicode transformation format an encoding of all unicode code points that maintains compatibility with a legacy character set. that is all unicode characters can be encoded in gb18030 but they will be encoded with different byte sequences than would be generated with utf-8 or utf-16
i am limited to an open source solution so it ll be mysqlor postgresql if that helps at all
there s nothing horribly wrong with having a simple post method for submission a file just the detail of tying the file upload to any pertinent meta data the other parameters to the method if it were bundled with the method
how can i create live video-streaming to be used for live video conferences chatting in a php application
filtering thegroupings bygroupings that have more than 1 element
has to provide an image of the spreadsheet that users can drag a select box around to select cell then click an import button and have the right thing happen
edit i think that cookies should not be sent on http-post in the above case
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam
of course if you are insert a very large number of rows then the risk would be that all of your live data is unavailable for as long as the insert takes to complete but overall this approach is far less destructive to indexes triggers or anything else that may be linked to the tables in question
the instances to be passed self
some of these panels contains jtables which i would like to be resized in line with any resizing of the jdialog
i have looked at few other vcs free and commercial and found most of them seems be made for linux guys and you have to use cmd-line for many admin work i know i m windows guy p
a lot of things that people mentions for asp.net-mvc can be done in webforms but with some additional effort
and the 64bit address space is four billion times larger than the 32-bit address space
i d only use doxygen with java if you re new to java and you ve used doxygen before reducing the learning curve you d experience with javadoc
also if you handle collisions in a sophisticated way each node is again a sorted table and you can perform binary search within these your lookup might still be fast enough if the table is loaded to 200 so you have twice as many items as capacity
the only time it might help is if your key-values were much longer than the hash
multiplication is faster division is more accurate
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol.net
the microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility namespace is exclusively for use by the vb6 upgrade wizard may be removed in future versioning and should not ever be used for new development
i m building a cms in asp.net-mvc and want to allow users to pick which page they want to be displayed by default when the user first visits the site
the above should be quicker than the equivalent sub-query and if you re referring specifically to exists - well where structure allows an inner-join will always be the preferred option
also permits default-values for unused parameters to be expressed closest to where they are actually used
in a live web-hosting environment it makes life easier both in terms of dns configuration and server configuration
in this example my checkboxes match category of a blog post
total cost of ownership of mssql-server is touted to be less than mysqltoo .net environment but maintaining an open mind could someone point out any killer features of mysql
consequently when the behavior of these functions need to change only a small part of the application needs to be changed the controllers and its helper classes
python is quite cool but unfortunately its debugger is not as good as perl -d
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select
in vba i can call it using named parameters for the required parameter the optional paramter can simply be omitted in vba unlike in c#.net for which type.missing must be used for all omitted optional-parameters
uml - nothing more formal than line and boxes on whiteboards
i use gprof and valgrind quite heavily you don t seem to have mentioned this class of tools
note that spaces in the needle string need to be placed between double-quotes and the wildcards should be outside
somehow the for-loops is mostly designed to run a number of times know in advance you can still use break to terminate early so the dynamic evaluation of the stop term is more annoying than useful if you really need dynamic evaluation you use or
on x86 for loopsing can be done on assembly level without making a while-loops
- for using ajax with asp.net-mvc it s better if you take a look at jquery or other frameworks
if you pursue this the messagebox will jump to the new position which is generally worse than not having it centered
carriage return line feed sequences will be translated to line feeds on input
forwarded types allow you to have more than one service implemented by a single implementation for a concrete example say we have two interfaces for working with treenodes of some sort
to be balanced every nodes in the tree must either
i d recommend sphinx for full-text search and aggregation and django-sphinx is good enough for production use
feature activation code deactivation code and feature stapling should be used when updating any contentupdatess
xml is somewhat subjective in terms of design - i don t think there are exact guidelines for how the elements and attributes should be laid out but i tend to go with using elements to represent things and attributes to represent singular attributesproperties of them
for more insight as to what s happening behind the scenes the for-loops can be rewritten to this
the sigaction function specifies more information than the signals
i worked on j2ee projects on health care systems that deal with enormous amount of stored data literally millions of patients visits forms etc and the general rule is not to show more than 100 or 200 rows for any user search advising the user that those set of criteria produces more information that he can understand
as i commented near the bottom of his blog it isn t clear how using http-patch is any better than using a patch document against http put
one should prefer using sigaction to signals if possible as the signals has implementation-defined often race prone behavior and behaves differently on windows os x linux and other unix systems
the first thing i looked at was sharpdevelop which does both #1 and also #2 in a basic way no insult to sharpdevelop which is admirable - i just mean more basic than eclipse-rcp
web-deployment projects can be used with either the asp.net web site or asp.net web application project options built-into vs 2008 and provide a few additional build packaging and deployment options for you to use
it uses a plug-in based architecture and gives you the ability to create anything from tool windows-hosting whatever code you want to actions items which can be tied to keyboard shortcuts and context menus and refactorings with an extremely rich context system and a language agnostic code generation engine
also data needs to be passed over http
i can do this with a for-loops of course but i m hoping .net has a more elegant way built in
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable
gregor kiczales once gave an interesting introductory talk on aop at google tech talks which i recommend watching aspects oriented programming radical research in modularity
no using pointer arithmetic is not faster and most probably slower because an optimizing compiler may use instructions like lea load effective address on intel processor or similar on other processor for pointer arithmetic which is faster than add or add mul
it is a distributed version-control system like git but integrates far more neatly and easily with windows
this is not possible under windows 2000 or windows 2003 running asp.net 1.x or asp.net 2.0 even with .net framework 3.5 installed
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though
if you re working with linux or unix this is even less of an issue
if i had to start a fresh new project and i had my say i would choose either stripes or jsf
the difference is that you must handle the switches manually whereas polymorphism is more natural once you get used with inheritance method-overriding
you must assume your application will only be deployed on windows xp or windows-server 2003 or later and then you can use what is called registration free com to make this happen
optimization should only be addressed .when the entire project is unit tested and ready for instrumentation
this causes more hashmap collisions which hurts performance but you are hitting a memory bottleneck and need to do so
so 80 of the cpu might actually be spent in c++ code anyway despite the fact that most of your project is written in say python
study moose mouse - it is modern oo system for perl it is much better that old oo system that was copied from python
there are several open source mocking frameworks out there i personally recommend rhino-mocks or nmock
i perceive a wrong progress-bar slightly worse than no progress-bar at all and there would be many people for who it would be wrong all of the time
this can be specified by either setting the global build.compiler properties which will affect all tasks throughout the build or by setting the compiler attributes specific to the current task
the header is only a file whose aim is to be included copy-paste by the preprocessor into true source files
edit realized that if you are comparing integer parts of double casting to int values first runs the risk of overflows should your double be outside the range that could be represented as int
in this example i want to make it clear that subscribe is a method to be used by external users of the class object while event is a method that should not be called from the outside but rather by subclassing implementations
this is designed to be side-by-side compatible with regular .net approaches such as xmlserializer datacontractserializer but is much smaller than xml and requires significantly less processing cpu etc for both serialization and deserialization
don t know if this possible - right now i write my own stored procs to do all the work plus i am desiging my database in a way so my use of linq-to-sql is easier
however the constant factor will be huge and if worst case performance is your primary concern use a merge sort instead which is only a little bit slower than quicksort on average and guarantees o nlgn time and will be much faster than this lame median quicksort
another possibility could be to create a log table that stores this information and it could be made to contains keep track of updates for any entity
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth
though it s more than just svn it also includes trac cruisecontrol.net and mingle
elements centric xml is more interoperable format in xml-serialization
of course this method can only be used if authentication is carried out by sending the actual user password to the server at login since database only desirably contains the hash of the password
it s too small to be of any size concern and doesn t contains any useful secrets that you might be concerned about sharing
large collections of sprocs can be segregated into oracle packages or management studio sql-server solutions and projects or sql-server schemas
in java interfaces can only be used to declare methods not the defined implement them
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request
for example if you had something like a shape base-class you could have some built in implementation that could be used by subclassing as well as interface methods that you want the subclassing to implement
aside from keeping out eavesdroppers having authentication operations be carried out over ssl allows you to use the secure http cookie flag
if python is much more natural to you than c++ it might be a good idea to learn pygame first
assuming you have more than one field in the fieldset then doing what you suggest doesn t semantically make sense -- you need to create separate legend text that describes the fieldset then a labels for each field
i d recommend hudson over cruisecontrol.net any day of the week
further to the other answers note that the equivalent head tail operation in python including python3 s extension of the syntax is generally going to be less efficient than haskell s pattern matching
i m embarking on a project now for an entity that has a fuzzier connection to the unviersity a student group that runs a charity event that has the potential to be sold outside of our university and thus it doesn t really fit into my normal naming-conventions the department is only the first customer of potentially many that might use the project
but i get e16 invalid range though i am certain that foo.c contains more than 1000 line
environment variables could work however we could be running parallel tests via a single test assembly so i wouldn t want settings to be overwritten during execution which could break another test
i d prefer something that can be developed on linux using c++ java python scala
if anyone wants to do the osx or linux versions of the jni part of jintellitype i would be more than happy to add those to the jintellitype library
a somewhat less na ve approach would be to use a polygon fill algorithm and then select points from the fill line randomly
install an instance of this custom configuration class as the com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.xni.parser.xmlparserconfiguration property so it will be instantiated when dom4j s saxreader class tries to create a jaxp xmlreader
django could be an option but doesn t seem as flexible as turbogears
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc
according to the description in the link above loops should be broken out of when the squareroot of the last element in the arrays is greater than the current prime - mine does this one before
i would like to know .when java 6 can be considered ready for prime time not the choice of ui library
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first
the way to do this is to set the object s wmode to opaque and use the css z-index properties to set it to a z-index lower than the z-index of whatever elements you want to float over it -- you can do this in css or just with inline attributes
first set a user variable to zero assuming this is less than any rowid in your table
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server
another feature is that for these kind of functional document it should be locked while editing
curly-braces required if you have more than one step of indentation
the other thing is if you are able to loginto the machine running sql server with an account in the administrators group you will be mapped to sysadmin when running management studio using trusted authentication
i don t immediately jump to if - else because a lot of the time the conditional operators makes more sense contextually
one can reasonably argue that methodology is more important than the platform although there are principles like simplicity andselectedion and control of dependencies that might preclude the use of certain platforms
server-side language vb.net people might choose to use single-quotes for java-script so that the scripts can be built server-side vb.net uses double-quotes for strings so the java-script strings are easy to distinguished if they use single-quotes
for in loops on arrays is not compatible with prototype
a function may be called from any other function and stack pointers value may have any un-aligned value
generally the use of hex numbers instead of decimal it s because the computer works with bits binary numbers and when you re working with bits also is more understandable to use hexadecimal numbers because is easier going from hex to binary that from decimal to binary
while somewhat more lightweight than its java counterparts it has the basic concepts of a model holding the data a view rendering the data in response to events propogated from a controllers
this is more to do with smart card aspect of the architecture and not http though
i keep getting an itch to make my own on-chip basic interpretor but i wonder if there s need for basic now that lua and python are easily embeddable and just as approachable as basic
and once you have a decent set of web services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term
imho the dictionary approach will be much faster than linq so if you have an arrays with a lot of items you should rather use dictionary
is what you want to use because it stands out more than meta-tags to most search engines
java constructor are special functions that can only be called at object creation
whenever the set has more than one rectangle you have overlap and if you make sure to add remove all rectangles that have the same top bottom coordinate you re currently looking at multiple overlapping rectangles would not be a problem
wcftestclient tool doesn t seem to work if the size of maxnametablecharcount is greater than default-value 16384
subversion has the ability to rename and move files without losing history supports atomicity commits has a more robust repository format has more modern access methods has better third party tool support and the list goes on
if this isn t scaling well enough for you you need to consider major design changes like perhaps tracking those whosubmitted more than 10 submission in a separate table that you update through applications that populate the submission
it s a parameterized query generated by linq-to-sql so that the query plan can be cached by sql server for later reuse
if the content of the textbox is smaller than the content of the textbox the window is as big as it needs to be to display the content of the button
preferably in javascript and in internet-explorer although it would be nice if it could also be done in firefox safari etc.
my understanding is that this means yes it is compiled only as far as il no it s not limited to either 32-bit or 64bit but i m not entirely clear
i prefer asp.net-mvc to webforms so i would choose that but you need to work out as a team where your core skill set is and whether or not choosing mvc will
choose asp.net-mvc if you.
the only downside is that it will be necessary to keep reading lines from the netstat output until the right line is found since there ll be more than one line of output
this is important because if you need to have your stored proc use indexes postgres required that the types match exactly between join conditions edit for equality checked too i think
any sessions older than the timeout period are set to status timed out
that said rather than explicitly changing the state of one instance i would recommend builder-pattern to produce a new object
this can work like a set and actually it gives better performance than set implementations which are implemented with hashtables or balanced trees
ignoring how well a browser may or may-not handle a gb-sized xml file the only real concern i can think of off the top of my head is if the execution time to generate all the xml is greater than any execution time thresholds that are set in your environment
i m not sure about how this can be done portably except of course for using malloc and free
actually asp.net mvc is more a port from other succesfull framework to the .net platfrom
bottom line is if you want to change behavior based on which subclass an instance is then the methods should have been virtual methods on the base-class not static methods
i used to do build a lot of uis using gridbaglayout but for years i ve never seen an office-environment ui that couldn t be built with nested borderlayouts gridlayouts and the occasional boxlayout or flowlayout
do allow null to be passed for optional-arguments
just wondering if there are any good server-side libraries for ajax prefer json rather then xml but anything is good for classic asp vbscript .
ftp is much better suited for large data transfer and can be automated easily via php or perl
for instance i am building a shopping-cart system and i think that allowing the adding removing etc of items to from a cart could very easily be exposed via gets since even though you can change data you cannot do anything critical with it
each name will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match
is it possible to run more than one website on iis 5.1 windows-xp
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days
the application is planned to be built using asp.net .net remoting ms sql server
generally it ll be used around orm s - older and some current ones require you to inherited from a specific base-class which ties you to that product
speaking personally i use remoting because i prefer amf to soap xml for the simple reason of speed and packets size
upgrading is as simple as downloading the new.war file and restarting
approach 2 of passing a global information object through your various constructor is easier to control
otherwise you ll have to get more creative as sql express does not have the sql-agent that comes with the full versions of sql 2005 as well as msde
you can make your code independent from template engine just by writing simple adaptor that uses magic methods
while using the linux toolbox takes more line you only have to know the basics of a few commands to do just about anything you want
i have had more joy with lwjgl than jogl but they should both satisfy your needs
this additionally makes more explicit the need for elevated-privileges in your script instead of hiding it inside popen
it just runs the procedure and shows the output using a gridview control less than 40 line of total code including aspx markup
i prefer working with json than xml for my data layer
ajax + json is much lighter and faster and easier to deal with than soap + xml
knowing that methods with lots of parameters are considered a code smell that ought to be refactored out i m wondering if there is a different way to accomplish this or if i m stuck with a controllers method that has a one-to-one mapping between form parameters and method parameters
it s also lesser known than python perl or ruby
i know i could use a multiset but its big o notation performance is worse that why i want to use the priority-queue
well i m using this library in delphi 7 on windows-xp but the component inside is just a wrapper around some win api calls createfile writefile etc
as the dictionary adds and checks existence of each item it uses bothequals and gethashcode functions but has to rely on theequals function when the hashcode is less unique
a login authentication service may be centralized ldap based
it will leads to a really bad situation where it is both hard to manage transactions throughout the application and too many connections are opened and closed i know about connection-pooling it is still more expensive to look up a connection from the pool than it is to reuse an object
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.
once theselectedion is shown in the html of firebug right-click on the html element in my case a div class yrsjge and choose copy html
error ranges can be of help here because if the only thing we are interested in is if we are in the presence of an error or not it is simpler to check an hresult error-code greater or equal to 0 is success and less than zero is failure
the entity framework has turned out to be quite contreversial but i think that is partly due to the fact that linq-to-sql has a better programmer experience today
entity framework will catch and surpass linq-to-sql because it is the orm mapping tool of the future from microsoft

entity framework will catch and surpass linq-to-sql because it is the orm mapping tool of the future from microsoft
this will match any string such that if itcontains page it must be followed by a number not consisting of only zeros
often it makes sense to subclassing but often it can be avoided using categories
these category define and implement methods that can be added to any class you want
most importantly cmd-line programs can be automated and chained together in scripts much more easily than guis typically
immediately i began wishing that updatesourcetrigger allowed more than just lost-focus because if you click the tab without tabbing off of a control the linq object is not updated before validation
lua has fewer libraries than python
if i watch the progress tab a nodes is added to a tree for each iteration thousands total and this gets slower and slower as the process goes on
instead of the installer approach i think a better way than having a single script that does it at install time is to have a building system which generates .deb or .rpm files suitable for installation on each system you have to support
i also recommend this book because despite his net-famous flame.war with linus torvalds few of his biases come through in the book
7 inner-join of less than 7 join in depth certainly isn t unheard of but sometimes people hear 7 join and think the no-no is 7 join not depth
on most modern computers windows-xp sp2+ vista dialog what do you want to do will be displayed for security reasons but what you have in autorun.inf will display as the selected default with as icon and as description
i guess gcc version will be depend on vxworks version and probably on target-platform
graphical programming is the most fun and even a fairly large program like calculator tic-tac-toe or ping pong can be explained to children
develop in your local machine with the same exact configuration as your development environment that is apache mods php extensions and so on using a version control system i prefer svn to keep track of modified files and what not
scott guthrie told me they would not kill linq-to-sql
json is much better than xml for browser application and the size is smaller than xml as well
using reflection it is further enforced that child object has no public methods nor any package or protected methods except those inherited from isolatedobject nearly all of which are final
official w3c doctype without the correct url the second string in the tag selects quirks-mode
i ve personally tried cruisecontrol.net and hudson and prefer hudson
no way is scala going to bend your mind anywhere near as much as haskell will
the main reason to choose scala over haskell when learning fp is to give yourself a more gentle introduction to the dangerous wilds of monads functors and higher-order goodness
this results in cleaner code since it is now less cluttered with dispose calls 10 fewer line of code in this case
and once you have a decent set of web services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term
4 is it possible to have a json image with all the image details regardless of numbers and use no 3 above to load 10 of those images is it possible to use ajax to only read 10 line and keep a pointer of the last one it read so the json file can be loaded fast short refresh and images either side are cached via the browser
the base-class can be used to execute a function of the derived-classs and it will be properly call the correct function
i ve done some python programming but being more familiar with java groovy comes a lot easier to me
basically you update the button alt tag every time the textbox loses focus
simple messageboxes and input boxes can be created using easygui a small library using tkinter which python comes with
you now have a sql script that creates a trace that has much less overhead than running through the profiling gui
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the windowheight
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
dictionary is faster for insertion as far as i know whereas sorteddictionary is built on top of a binary-tree search algorithm and is faster for reading back
if a class implements an interface and does not implement all its methods it must be marked as abstract
it s a bit more complicated than this in practice you have to deal with potential overflow values for example and some types of delay line have to be run in reverse which is always a pain in c-style coding of course
is there any reason why i should pick json over xml or vice-versa if both are available
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old
specifically when i pasted into the spreadsheet i had to select paste special and choose the format text. otherwise it tried to paste everything into a single cell even if i highlight the whole spreadsheet
when it comes to php the one reason i choose xml over json is because even in php 5 there is no officially supported api for traversal
in the worst case scenario you could go one level lower raw-sockets where you have better control over the packets sent but then you d have to deal with all the nitty-gritty of tcp
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysqland you re using an orm you should probably use that
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql
the cms still lacks the vast amount of plugins and modules if you compare it with joomla or drupal but their code seems more advanced
for example serialization isolation level will prevent lost updates when the code runs concurrently but read committed the default in sql server management studio will not
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well
the remoting way is all together easier as nice people have written aselectedion of free remoting packages
qt either on c++ or python is fully portable between mac win linux
since managed directx is not being supported any longer by microsoft this is a good way to use managed code with direct3d
i m not sure gruby-on-rails fits that bill though because it is java perhaps the enterprise will warm up to it moreso than ruby-on-rails
but from performance aspects i must say json is better to use with iphone application
server backend can be programmed in any technology you want just set common data format at server and browser side json format may be suitable
i will probably be bashed by css purists here but using a table with 100 width andheight works in any browser and does not require browser-specific css hacks
prior to that it used a slightly different naming scheme for getter and setter which naturally can still be used with properties or for plain old attributes
what is the command to match brackets in emacs the equivalent of the command in vim
if everything that can be accomplished in mxml can also be accomplished in actionscript and many things are easier to accomplish in actionscript loops conditionals etc why take the time to learn mxml
it s less sexy than linq-to-sql but more widely applicable imo.
my assumption was that i didn t need to do any more overriding as the parent treeview controllers would handle the postback events
a combination of css and javascript can then be used to show and hide portions of the hierarchy of the tree or menu
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more
i should emphasize that those artifacts will be completely invisible on the final contour rendering since the difference in magnitude between any two adjacent interpolator cell is less than the bit depth of the rendered image
because of this it becomes necessary for either the administration s session to be hijacked or for their authentication credentials to be captured in order for someone to ever exploit the hijack function within the application
codeigniter is a significantly smaller framework than ruby-on-rails as far as features go
ideally suited for programming scripting html writing etc. the raize font can be used in any ide or text-editor
alternatively you could throw them into a dictionary but this doesn t help the caller any more than an arrays does
the controllers layer can be made to get the data for the view in either way that you choose whichever is more efficient
if you want to implement a cache soft-references are definetly a better idea than weak-references but it puts your entire cache removal policy in the hands of the garbage collector
jquery is more popular but dojo allows you to declaratively define widgets in html which sounds more like what you re looking for
depending on your language of choice i would recommend asp.net webservices it s excellent for easily creating and consuming webservices particularly if you re using .net actoss your platforms
nodes of a tree that has child nodess
if you d rather be using a light text-editor instead of a heavy ide then i d highly recommend going with gedit with some additional plugins
any chance that this can be used in linq-to-sql
now that the open id connection is set up it is no more difficult than any other site i deal with and the magic is that i did not have to add yet another account to a site that i had no idea i was going to use ever again and would probably forget the username or password for
is there any way to at least allow existing git commits contains submodule data to be committed to svn without the submodule data
xhtml markup and provides better
i did some tests and my tests seems to point to linq to entities performing better than linq-to-sql
i believe the overkill statements that i ve heard are made because linq to entities can do much more than linq-to-sql and it does require more configuration about 1 more line in the web.config
also there are small things that linq to entities does differently from linq-to-sql that might make someone feel as though linq to entities is more complicated
but once you learn how to do things it seems linq to entities is no more complicated than linq-to-sql
i prefer null unless the field is not nullable then i prefer zero unless zero is a valid limit then i prefer -1 unless -1 is a valid value in which case you need another field say a bit field to signify unlimited
the exceptions to this are functions returning types larger than 32-bit specifically 64bit integers long long double s and structs or classes
another method involves 10 steps and would have to be adapted to oracle-xe
the controllers is halfway built into the browser ui but can be extended with javascript
things like choosing your sex where there ll only be two options in the foreseeable future i much prefer radio-button since it s quick for you to see your options
i think this basic concept is actually easier to understand in the old sql syntax so for example we cross-join tables a and b
i would also suggest memory-mapped files but if you re going to use boost i think boost iostream mapped_file is a better match than boost interprocess
these should be triggered whenever a selection is changed no matter how it is selected
we re working now on the design of a new api for our product which will be exposed via web-services
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui
for these purposes i ll use the following definition makes effective use of indexes and join in a sensible order which is probably as good as any
i think we inherited our exception classes from comexception and set the correct error-code which should be translated as hresult in unmanaged code
on linux or solaris is there a better way than hand parsing proc self maps repeatedly to figure out whether or not you can read write or execute whatever is stored at one or more addresses in memory
this is more work than my other solution but is theorectically a better one since as part of your restart your jar may want to do other things as well clean restart other resources log the fact that it s being shutdown stuff like that
in a binary tree each nodes can have 0 1 or 2 subnodess where in case of a binary search tree the key of the left nodes is lesser than the key of the nodes and the key of the right nodes is more than the nodes
a binary search tree can be implemented in any fashion it doesn t need to use a linked-list
you can use bst to represent a data such as family tree but that ll become n-ary search tree as there can be more than two children to each person
you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo
3 .when a client wants a connection give them one of the ready ones making it active then immediately open a new one if there s now less than n ready but don t make the client wait for this to complete or you ll lose the advantage of pooling
4 .when the client finishes with an active connection return it to the ready state if there s less than m ready connections
in this case i d recommend building a virtual machine with sql server 2008 and then you can play around as much as you like without jeopardizing the environment you need to get on with your normal work
.when a client wants a connection give them one of the ready ones making it active then immediately open a new one if there s now less than n ready but don t make the client wait for this to complete or you ll lose the advantage of pooling
.when the client finishes with an active connection return it to the ready state if there s less than m ready connections
for a.getclass a.clone .getclass to return true super.clone should be called instead of simply new subclass since super.clone presumably would correctly instantiate the class of this object even in subclassing and copy all internal state including private fields which couldn t be copied by subclassing using a copy constructor due visibility rules
shared memory or named pipes gives less overhead than tcp-ip however do windows even support named pipes
i have a website that draws rss feed and displays them on the page
when the number of items in the hash reaches the size limit a culling function should be called to get rid of the least-retrieved key-value pairs in the table
granted this is more geared towards using their rates serviceselectedion service as opposed to worldship
it should be noted however that perl s changes are much more extensive than python s and likely will be harder to detangle
if you have various bits differing you still may have largish differences but if you re more likely to have large numeric differences that correspond to usually one or two bits differing you may be better off with a scheme where you create ahebyte array - use the first 4 bytes to encode the first integer and then for each subsequent entry use 0 or more bytes to indicate which bits should be flipped - storing 0 1 2 ... or 31 in the byte with a sentinel say 32 to indicate when you re done
following your link the user helios makes an excellent point that using 100 http is far less confusing to the user
whenever the user enters text and dismisses the text field the controllers will be sent this message
i highly recommend this book if you re interested in understanding how to rasterize line fill polygons writing 3d code without the benefit of using directx or opengl apis
incidentally you can set this property so it can be used to set your screens-orientation also
is there any setting that can be configured in wcf application s web.config or in iis in order to customize the wsdl generated contains host address and put public address instead
you may have trouble if you lose stack pointers alignment and mix external objects generated with other tools
another possibility although messier than either of these two is to set up a while-loops that calls std string find and updates the position of the last found token to be the start point for searching for the next
has anybody come across an elegant and efficient .net spam filtering component that can be used in asp.net applications
as explained in the rfc the uid is the same and the sequence numbers is one greater so i expect outlook to update my previous event entry but all it does is insert a second one
the custom method can be written in the code behind file but has to be declared public or protected
unfortunatly iis 6 needs a file extension to map the request to the right handler which means you will have to use the .mvc suffix on your controllers names such as controllers .mvc action
note that this aggravates specially in java where the syntax is not as terse as it could be compared to scala for example
the component will need to be repainted every time that the panel is obscured ie frame minimize another window put on top
other than the fact that asp.net-mvc web application has more clarity in its implementation of the mvc pattern and that it strictly follows the mvc pattern how is it different from asp.net web application
i ve personally found ef to be very clunky and hard to use compared to linq-to-sql which feels very natural
if the query tries to insert a pre-existing value to a field you php will be notified about this constraint breach
simple solutions can be found for complex problems and are typically better than just throw enough line of code at the problem and it ll sort itself out
so i have two guys one has written 20 more line that the other one but those 20 more were unnecessary complicated line loop-unrolling and otherwise useless stuff that could have been refactored out
files can be considered to contains a set of records each either of a fixed length or ending with a delimiter
for ie you need to do the same with the left margins - either completely remove it set to zero or make it something smaller than the default
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions
also its memory management mechanism which tries to bridge c++ memory management and python gc is way more flexible than swig s
however swig has much better documentation no external dependencies and if you get the library wrapped in swig for python you re more than half-way there to getting a java perl ruby wrapper as well
here is a common scheme used in most search engines store deltas of values and encode the delta using a variable byte encoding scheme if the delta is less than 128 it can be encoded with only 1 byte
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism
i think that if you a programmer taught your boyfriend vba he would develop some understanding of programming and also have to hand an extremely useful tool for work far in advance of anything that can be achieved by recording macros
i found the learning curve on websphere to be considerably steeper than weblogic and our building deploy test life-cycle was so time consuming that we used tomcat in the development environment
in ruby most use ruby-on-rails so thats what you hear and django for python is mentioned more then not
vista still has bsod s but they re less frequent because the new driver model has less drivers in kernel mode
if you mean that you want to start eclipse with some command line arguments there is no file where you can add those to be used as default
what we have done is export the data from our native format to a csv file which can be opened in excel
for one customer we even had to export data from sql stored procedure into csv-like tab-separated format but named file like xxxxx.xls - this way excel opened that file in more correct way than csv file
it is fantastic to be able to see the output breakpoints error list object browser and resharper windows at the same time without having to make them tiny and dock them in the main window which leaves less spaces for code
how can this be done in asp.net-mvc
i m not sure if a macros can be run on double click but my vba experience does not come from visio
and last you re asking what we think of this ui and i think that a comma separated list of category is easier to code an to fill in
currently we treat all warnings as errors fail the build if any fxcop rules fail except a small subset that we disabled fail the build if simian detects any code duplication of more than 5 line across all projects
the interface i m thinking of would need to know that kind of thing so the user-defined attributes suggestion is more along the line of what i m thinking
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform look-and-feel fidelity swt is the best choice
i think it all depends on the coupling typically inter thread communication and synchronization think mutexes thinkg shared memory is much more simpler than interprocess communication think sockets think networking think pipes think mailboxes so when you re logically grouping functionality i would go for threads
the glib manual provides more information
i have messages coming in on mta threads that need to be serviced on sta threads
forms are handled like models they have their own class so their field list validation rules and display logic is no more scattered throughout the view the controllers and the helper
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter
also perl has a lot of inline classes that allow you to write code in other languages to be called in perl including one for c++
quick update on this turns out the problem was on twitter s end--the account in question had tighter than normal api limits imposed for some reason
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull
does ruby has bigger appeal to you than python
so my question is without getting into the issue of preventing a code of line from getting too long in the first place how would you recommend wrapping lines of code
i would recommend couchdb instead of mnesia
if you prefer generator-expression to the map function
this means that hitting the website root correctly results in the error the incoming request does not match any route. and any other requests no longer get routed through to your controllers classes so result in a 404
no but the cpp preprocessor or m4 can be called on any file on the cmd-line or using a building tool like make or ant
note also that the padding set on the contains divs should be no less than the width corner radius of your images though it can certainly be greater should you wish
this can be done in any language using for-loops
if you are using asp.net webforms then for handling user authentication verification i d recommend asp.net membership services because it does some of the heavy lifting for you and also helps you from making any elementary security mistakes
a few line that are generic for any object is more efficient than having to manually create a clone that involves possibly private constructors field assignments etc
if it bothers you you could use default arguments to use given arguments first then search for get post values if none are provided though that might be a security risk
perl might be able to do a lot of things awk can do but offered the choice in this day and age i would choose python here
additionally there is pdftextstream which is a commercial java library that can also be used from python
i know that resorting to java on the server side would be a solution but i just can t imagine that this can t be solved with apache + python
i also recommend textexpander which makes the process a little more intuitive and generalized such that the same snippets can be used across text-editor
my reasoning is more along the line of removing a lot of software installation and configuration hassles especially when working between different languages platforms frameworks projects
i was just going to say radix-sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksortthat switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort
the improved support for mvc is linked to this as you can set ii7 to route requests without extensions to .net so you can have urls which are cleaner such as without having any extension visible which reveals what type of server technology you re using and is very untrendy these days
i would recommend using gtk which binds to python via pygtk and has the glade gui designer
this step verifies the bigger questions of do we still have a deployable product for each of our target-platform
it was a good enough solution but i don t like the fact that the time needed to convert the stream into an image object with the bitmap constructor is far far far larger than the time needed to download the stream
like lubos hasko outlined above with asp.net mvc linq and the new features in c# and even the ability to write .net web service that can be consumed by silverlight i have gotten excited about it again and think you could do well getting into it
what s especially annoying about this is that when you change the left part of a line that is longer than all the other lines you need to line up all the other lines all over again
ruby is slower than perl python and lua
i prefer jquery so that is my first recommendation but i worked with yui mootools prototype and extjs before making my decision
when there isn t a particular line to be found lines are taken out of the start of the queue one by one to be processed
i used ioc quite heavily but dynamic object creation is still better dealt with using an abstract-factory-pattern
that s why predicate conditions on aggregate values must be placed in having clause not in the where clause and why you can use aliases defined in the select clause in a having clause but not in a where clause
while i haven t used either of them in python and it seems ncurses is better supported in c at least i m switching my code to s-lang because of those issues and because deep down i never really liked the ncurses api
thanks everyone for all the answers most of them make the same point groovy integrates slightly better with java then jython or jruby
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hash urls
this is currently how mainstream browsers do this - it s necessary to ensure that example.co.uk can t set a cookie for .co.uk which would then be sent to any other website under .co.uk
for example insertion-sort has worse algorithmic complexity than quicksortat least in the average case but in almost all implementations insertion-sort is faster than quicksortfor small n and so quicksorts break out to insertion-sort towards the end
iirc the balance characteristic of a red-black tree is that the deepest nodes is no more than twice the depth of the shallowest
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances
now if you want something like this for a free project and you know c++ you may try any of the many open source engines out there such as ogre or irrlicht
i am working on an algorithm that will try to pick out given an html file what it thinks is the parent elements that most likelycontains the majority of the page s content text
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do
is there a way to quickly delete in the server all directories that match this pattern using the cmd-line
you could also look into the routing library that was built for asp.net-mvc in one of the previews they split those classes off into the system.web.routing namespace and from what i ve heard it can be used with webforms now
does anyone know where in which event handlers should setscreensorientation int angle be called to set the screens-orientation on application start restore orientation on minimize set the orientation on maximize and restore the orientation on close
on one call to the sort methods you might pass a callback function that compares by object name and another time pass a function that compares by object weight or whatever.
it s this last step that can be circumvented by administration by returning true to basically all account verification requests but in most cases if the user has intentionally entered a bad address it s already been caught
for me the number one reason to favor web-applications over desktop-applications is that they are so easy to distribute
it s a very light database -- much lighter than sql-server express or otherwise and it is easy to implement
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp
the guy proposing to base all other numbers on a rational-numbers primitive has never heard of transcendental numbers like pi for example which cannot be represented in this manner
one person on cppunit s sourceforge page claims to have written a subclassing of testcase that will run a particular test an arbitrary number of times although in a slightly different manner than the repeatedtest class offers
while i m intrigued by it i m also worried that it will be overused like generics and linq-to-sqlclr etc
i must admit that i am not familiar with oracle but i am more or less beaten by sql dialect of sql-server
this depends entirely on your target-platform which is more or less a business decision
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable
it doesn t appear to be built into boost-asio as of current boost svn but if you re willing to write your own classes to simulate the boost asio detail socket_option ones you can always follow the examples in boost asio socket_base.hpp and do the following
generally this shouldn t be modified by any user code so expect it to contains the standard functions and nothing else
python is making oo click much better than php ever has and i m reading more and more on oo principles to enhance this better understanding
i gives a nice briefing about what scrum is all about and how it can be used from project-management
also your example doesn t have a doctype - a valid doctype is essential for getting browsers to correctly interpret your code without one you ll be stuck in quirks-mode
in which case do what cade recommends and pass the data as xml for example or whatever format you choose json binary etc.. then build your sql right before you actually run the command
i would recommend using ajax to postback silently every 10 mins or so to keep it alive or increase the timeout of the session as you suggest
denormalization data is much more often found at places where not enough normalization was done
if you mean that the compare in class b or c should always be passed an object of class b or c no matter what the signature says you can work with pointers to instances instead of instances and try to downcasting the pointer in the method s code using something like
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git
make sure you read the basics of the two types of asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc and pick which makes more sense to you
as the questioner pointed out there are many more urls that should not be routed through this controllers than otherwise
unfortunately i m currently using rad rational application developer - ibm s commercial version of eclipse and it is not fully compatible with m2e and i can t use q4e as i m using maven 2.0.7 with no way to upgrade to 2.1
is anyone out there familiar enough with itextsharp s or itext itself barcode components or with code 128a barcodes to tell me how to make the itextsharp one look exactly like the barcode.4net one
however if you allow the size to be inferred like this and you recycle the parameter object in a loop you did say you were concerned with performance then the size will be set by the first value and any subsequent values that are longer will be clipped
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider
as to the client side implementation i would recommend investigating sqlite-net or another embedded db
java doesn t have static-classes which don t have any instance constructors and can t be used for variables parameters etc
so you can say you only want to set a value to an integer field if the value is greater than x otherwise throw an exception
fields may be used for out ref parameters properties may not
as everybody said groovy has tighter java integration
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the join in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them
personally if forced to make this choice i would choose either php or ruby on rails but there s no valid reason for that outside of a random and subjective choice
once you have built a star schema and if you have chosen your dimensions well named your columns wisely and especially chosen your granularity well using this star schema with olap tools like cognos or business-objects turns out to be almost as easy as playing a video game
i ve seen in the past that the psi project server interface within microsoft project didn t override the timeout and so the default of 100 seconds was applied and would terminate anything talking to it for longer than that time
i don t know how much faith to put in those types of articles and iirc it beat out lamp by some really small margins
amongst other things it means that people could use the cpio program for packaging the files instead of tar and then use the compressor of choice once upon a time the preferred compressor was pack later it was compress which was much more effective than pack and then gzip which ran rings around both its predecessors and is entirely competitive with zip which has been ported to unix but is not native there and now bzip2 which in my experience usually has a 10-20 advantage over gzip
i understand that windows authentication is more secure because you don t have to store credentials in web.config and send them over the wire when authentication to sql server but is that a secure configuration for production environments where the network service account is a db_owner
the export does this to try and match alignment in excel with the original report
thrift has richer data-structures map set
and can t be changed for backwards-compatibility
apr is a larger library than glib with lots of useful stuff in it hash tables argument parsing file i o stuff memory-management shared-memory routines signal handling etc.
although calling c++ libs from python is more normal - you can call a python module from c++ by bascially calling the python intepreter and have it execute the python source
if you want to change it from nullable to not-nullable you must provide some value that can be assigned to rows with null value in that field
i think you need a rule along the line of if the next event is x higher priority and the gap between now and the earliest time is less than y seconds wait and then start the higher priority event
if we compare xml-rpc and soap the latter will give you better data types handling for the former although you will be dealing with simpler data types but you will have to write a layer or adaptor to convert them to your domain objects
the goal of xhtml strict is that the xhtml markup should be used to describe the structure of the content
it does more than a text-editor which is what i ll carry on using for perl until i find something better
while you can get more fine-grained than this if you choose you need to be aware that any greater detail will likely be lost on the target-platform
when you right click on your controllers action you can choose add view at the top of the context menu
then when fetching a record from the database if this field s value is more than 5 minutes old you can re-cache the data from the restful api you re not using couchdb are you
do you know how to add define more than one worksheet in excel file written using html
i recommend lxml over xmlproc because the pyxml package contains xmlproc is not being developed any more
in practical terms id attributes should only be used one per document class attributes can be used on more than one element on a document
i would recommend using either the lost-focus event on the textbox es that set the acceptbutton or create a gotfocus method that all of the controls that don t use a specific acceptbutton call
that way you can directly work with a javascript object which is friendlier than navigating xml dom
another approach is that you put a constraint on the default route so it only matches methods you know exist on the controllers
this library provides more flexible increment and decrement
it could be related to wpf eliminate transparency between grid cell which we never really resolved
i think there is no trivial solution to this problem and my approach is likely no better than the priority-queue approach
so i am specifically looking for a selectedor to selected a class button to does have img -child elements and another to selected a class button -elements that do not have img -child elements
please note that when using dependency-injection patterns usage of the facade pattern is far less common than earlier
as an aside the profile-type ones are run for a login shell only whilst the others tend to be run for any subshell created
even a server side solution can be bypassed by sniffing the traffic
there is an almost equivalent way to do what christhomas123 suggested in sql-server but not oracle which is to say
i am not familiar with postgresql but is there a database like master in sql-server that you could initially connect to and then later use a different database
null dereference is handled more gracefully in java c# python etc
i have been looking into better solutions than the denormalization table i mentioned above
it could be stored in xml json or some serialized format that could be read by your application
for me the shortcut in the windows start menu worked better than running startx from a cmd-line because the default configuration is much closer to what i used in the past
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor
basically if the repository revision is larger than your working revision someone has committed changes to that file and perhaps you shouldupdates your version or you may end up with a conflict if you try to commit your own changes at a later time
ruby-on-rails has many more options than django but has no standard user model
the binary-tree would be structured like a 1-d version of a quad tree
i m wondering if there is any way to create a user account on a windows-xp machine that can be done through scripting from an activex control on a webpage
the solution is to modify another element that s earlier in the document and has been loaded completely where browser already saw closing tag for it
you can also pass an object array as a second parameter to getbean which will be used as arguments to the constructor or factory
in vb.net which is better to use function-overloading or default-parameters
though i m not a moq guy i prefer rhino-mocks the idea behind mocks is interaction testing.
however this is more like ant or nant rather than maven - it is an xml based scripting language designed for software builds rather than using the convention over configuration approach of maven
must i only interact with xml json services
it s written in c but it has wrappers that allow it to be used in c++ php python ruby and perl
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet
i choose m2e since it is stable and have all that i need
secondly i don t know in advance what kind of query might be run this form lets me just type select count name from dbusers against a dozen databases without having to first think about replicating the dbusers table to a master db
someone seems to have had success rendering th cell but did not appear to disclose details - any other suggestions would be gratefully received
if you ve never worked with unix or linux then i d say that learning to deal with rails on windows would be easier than learning unix linux from the ground up
current support for spring.net controllers dependency injection can be found in mvccontrib
the depth of a multiway tree is much less than a binary tree for the same elements meaning that few seeks on disk are required to locate a nodes
i generally prefer where possible to use the default-value of value types to determine whether they ve been set
i had to track a problem with such a query that was using inherited classes and i found out that my pidly-little esql of 4 line got translated in a 100000 characters monster sql statetement
after registration the atomicity class can be used with isinstance and issubclass
2 if we are talking about logging an exception thrown in code for sys admins and developers to read then the matter becomes more of taking the exception s message and stack trace to be recorded in either a log file an e-mail or the event viewer so that it can be handled differently depending on how urgent is it that someone looks into this
on the one hand the copy-constructor should create an instance that is as close as possible to the original instance so that it can be swapped out in the display context
i think this is more of a question for an aspects oriented programming approach
some people prefer distributed version control systems such as git mercurial or bazaar
my guess on that aspect is that the id file stored on the server will still be used for authorization but the successful active directory authentication will be used to unlock access to it
the jquery constructor accepts a 2nd parameter called context which can be used to override the context of theselectedion
is it so small that you could end up with the system still working on the first batch .when another version is ready to be sent out
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter-setters are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method
if the product owner is from the business unit there has to be guidance as to what amount of time should be spent on datamodel etc
shouldn t take more than 10 line of code
there has to be guidance as to what amount of time should be spent on datamodel etc.
calculated fields on forms can t be used for sorting filtering and can be annoying in how slowly they display in some situations
i m currently working on a pet project and need to do c++ development on windows mac linux and solaris and i ve narrowed it down to netbeans and eclipse so i was wonderig which is more solid as a c++ editor
personally i prefer netbeans - the project-management is excellent and i was up and running quicker than with eclipse
if i login twice then logout and login again i don t need two login i seem to have traced this to the fact that the cookie exists
that combination can also be used in asp.net if running on .net 3.5 and windows desktop apps again .net 3.5
unless you can fulfill the entire superclass contract and i know only of several classes that can prefer composition rather than inherited
a const_iterator is an iterator that points to a const element so while the iterator itself can be updated increment or decrement for example the element it points to can not be changed
even worse you can have more than one radio button and checkbox with the same name.
to clarify i recognize that ib can be used for basic di but i m looking for a framework with more complete functionality including separate production and testing configurations along the line of groovy or springs
if you need larger than 32-bit you could consider using 64bit integers long long or use or write an arbitrary precision math library gnu mp
linux is no better at this either i have a default ubuntu install with dual-booting and it takes about a minute
harder to line up with other elements since the positioned element is no longer in the document flow and also because of the level of precision required
therefore if the value expression references such an object then the table will be considered to contains just one elements - the collection itself
the numbers of times this sequence has to be repeated before this problem happens is variable
as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types
setup a ssh key so that you don t need to use passwords and tweak the .ssh authorized_keys file on the mysql system to only allow it to be used for port forwarding
measure transactions per second or even better requests per second with a web server stress tool like the grinder which can be scripted in jython with both mysqlbackend and postgresql and afterwards see if that makes a difference
the primary difference is that asp.net-mvc is more like regular web development that the rest of the programming world uses whereas standard asp.net was designed to make it brain-dead easy for windows developers to become web developers
asp.net-mvc is much more oriented around standards compliance unobtrusive javascript and separation of concerns than regular asp.net
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too
alternatively if you ll have ms office openoffice.org star office or some other compatible office program available at every site a spreadsheet works splendidly for this type of thing
labels are better than category
that is to say allowing an item to belong to several categories is a better approach than assigning one category to each item
don t get me wrong it s not that easy if you want to learn programming you need to put a lot of effort into it but in my own experience rails can bring you some instant results while letting you get deeper and deeper over time
now if your program still consumes too much memory with tstringlist you can always use tstrings or even istrings in you program and write a class that implements istrings or inherits tstrings and does not keep all the line in memory
don t think that moving to sql-server is going to improve performance of your queries ms-access often does a better job of optimizing the queries for you it knows what needs to be displayed and does lots of caching and optimization
the reason i chose perl in the first place is i m very familiar with perl more than php
i am running into a very strange issue with php 5.2.6 w iis on windows-xp have tried both cgi and isapi
i would prefer spring.net framework transactions available for both ado.net and nhibernate versions because i believe they support better aop-based aspect oriented programming separation of concerns you will not have to couple your code with transaction code and mostly because these guys have been doing transactions in java for many years and i just trust them that they know what to do
silverlight is more of a subset of wpf and it s missing a few things which means your design style needs to be slightly different
for ruby and rails autotest provides much faster and responsive execution of the tests -- when i save a rails model app models foo.rb the corresponding unit tests in testunit foo_test.rb get run
workflows can be modelled using state-machines petri-nets or various other constructs including plain old scripting languages
you have 2 options or binary serialization as pirx said or xml-serialization for performance the better is binary but i prefer xml-serialization for its readibility
keep a reference to each of your action sheets as an instance variable in your controllers class and you can compare this to the actionsheet parameter in your delegate methods to decide what actions you need to perform
so as to whether you should use the regular python implementation or jython i d say it s a matter of whether you prefer having all the java libraries available or all of the python libraries
one way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variables boolean statuses and have statuses i false mean that the thread failed this could be extended to capture more information
i do this all the time on the cmd-line where i pipe a regex that gets a superset into another regex that ignores stuff i don t want
to clarify for those who may not have understood - this is what i am looking for in publishing it is quite common to layout an inset picture table figure etc. so that its bottom lines up with the bottom of the last line of text of a block or page with text flowing around the inset in a natural manner above and to the right or left depending on which side of the page the inset is on
if you select a word it will highlight all of those words in the current document makes it easier to find misspellings without having to hit ctrl + f
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos
in my opinion this is much easier than trying to figure out the overly complicated visual studio project-management scheme
the parrot is an upcoming virtual machine that will be used for perl 6 along with other dynamic languages such as ruby php python to name a few
afaik jar files can be run on any platform that can run java and i would like to use a windows compiled java program on mac without using any extra virtualization wine vmware
if you have no problem with a very sparse syntax and assigning variables with set that take tcl ich you want a richer very powerfull syntax with lots of metaprogramming power and you don t mind to put everything in round braces and always begin with the operator like + 2 3 and not 2 + 3 than you should choose lisp
i would also recommend triggers to prevent more than one root nodes null parent per tree and to keep related nodess from belonging to different treeids but those are a little more trivial than the above.
to get functionality similar to what i was used to i needed to put in the revision that created the branch-head
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords
without an external perl module you can use instead the built in sha1 function not as good as sha256 but better than encode decode
i m assuming there is a way to pack unpack the string using the struct package but unfortunately i am very unfamiliar with this process
your query will be a projection so what you ll get back will be an arraylist of tuples contains the results the content of each elements of the arraylist will depend on the query but for more than one value will be
also every time you start a try block setjmp has to be called to set up the buffer contains the saved registers while when using dwarf2 the compiler already provides all necessary information at compile time
regarding your second question - in my opinion the programming model of wpf and silverlight allows for a clearer separation between designer and coder microsoft expression design is for designers .net 3.5 is for coders and microsoft epxression blend is somewhere in the middle
since i don t need to set any of these properties at design time the hidden attribute is probably more appropriate
actually it sounds like you would be happier with asp.net-mvc since this is easily doable there by simply setting the form method to get in the view
the adaptor functions as a kind of translator to implementations that could be considered legacy
cases where you would absolutely need to define your delegate types include methods that accept more than 4 arguments methods with out ref or params parameters or recursive method signatures delegate foo foo foo f
another perhaps far more complete than lightbox even if it ok i recommend overall if your not using jquery or any other library
i prefer using conditional and or operators when needed instead of nested ifs
there are other .net languages which are amenable to scripting - there are the dynamic languages such as ironruby and ironpython and also boo mostly static but with duck-typing where you want it
presumably you could also use the svn etc revision to flag a build error is an instance file is older than a base file but we haven t implemented anything that clever yet
question 2 if a constructor must be specified on the base structure how can a union be implemented to contains that elements and ensure a 0 initialized base elements
phing can do everything shell python ruby scripts can do and can be extended in php which is its major draw for php developers
the beauty is that if you later decide to swap it out to ssh or anything more secure than telnet you can with little pain
i personally haven t used dielevel but apparently when it s set to a value greater than zero it can force stack unwinding and tends to hopelessly destroy any program that takes its exception handling seriously. quote from here
if something causes the block to be exited early longjmp the debugger can hook that and figure out how far it got into the blocks when it happened and increment only those line
i think that silverlight adoption will eventually drive wpf adoption back on the desktop - or maybe there won t be a desktop as much of what can be accomplished with silverlight will replace many previously desktop applications
no there is no way to force a file in a browser caching to be deleted either by the web server or by anything that you can put into the files it sends
if the integration is more human oriented documents approvals etc app workflow will do or bpm used as workflow if they already have the tool
i haven t added anything more than a folder to the views folder called feed
it can be used to draw all kinds of shapes line rectangles circles etc
is it possible to construct an mvc route that matches this so that i get the path in its entirety passed into my controllers
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac
on the other hand if you specify a particular endianness for your files only applications on platforms with non-matching endiannes will have to do additional work and it can be decided at compile-time using conditional-compilation
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity
in any case the adjacency lists can be built in time o number of nodess by simply adding each nodes to the children list of its parent
in an asp.net 3.5 site we have a relatively standard payment checkout progess that contains a number of pages that need to be visited in sequence shopping basket payment details etc
it will require a little more work than uptime on osx linux since you would have to total the numbers from the first column or omit the process name and simply total the value form each line of output to get the total in cpu usage
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested
since no encoding was specified imho this method with no argument should have been deprecated long ago the current system default encoding is used which is usually not utf8 and then the array is again converted as being utf8 encode
i d recommend using a regular expression to capture all of the variants of how 0 can be specified with double-quotes without any quotes with single quotes with extra whitespace outside the quotes with whitespace inside the quotes how you want the square brackets handled etc
like curly-braces should be on a new line if something spans for more than one row
edit note that the code here could easily be abbreviated by having a private constructor taking the tax rate and the name
php is supported more by web-hosting companies if you re looking for cheap low requirements hosting
turbogears is easier to use grails gives you access to the vast space of java web-frameworks hard to beat
however some systems also implement a petri-net or state change based markup system for workflow which might reasonably be described as declarative but they still have an imperative mode of interaction with the underlying system
it is definitely not what people usually mean when they talk about declarative-programming even if it some sense can be called declarative
can it be done without having to create many derived-classes of event i don t want to create so many empty subclassing
say you have 2 views that both have a button for edit this widget both of them would have to have logic to get a widgeteditorpresenter and show the associated view
im using a fileupload control for my asp application and it throw a httpexception when the file upload size is bigger than the max request length
unlike c# where you don t need any syntax to denote managed heap objects c++ cli differentiates between stack objects picturebox pb pointers to heap objects and handles to managed heap objects picturebox pb
as for the data type smallint is as small as you are going to get sql server really isn t designed to hold individual bits of data and manipulate them but it can be done via bitwise-operators in binary columns but even the smallest of those is much larger on disk
the second method reading line is usually more memory efficient because the input byte buffer for decoding doesn t need to contain the entire file
having done a rename asp to aspx and change until it compiles port of an application to asp.net i would say that even asp classic style programming in .net is better than asp classic
debugging 100 line of code is a lot easier than debugging 100 000 line of code
my .class and properties-files and the contents of my meta-inf directory are showing up in the . build directory but my web-inf lib directory seems to be referenced in-place and the jar dependency doesn t get copied in to it to show up as part of the web app library
the additional final step is to establish a java ee module dependency between your dynamic web project and the shared library which causes the utility s classes to be placed in web-inf lib during deployment and even during export of the.war
you could do the whole job in perl or python - indeed the cut work could be done by awk
you may also need to change the asp.net version you can do this on the asp.net tab -- choose either v1.1 or v2.0 whichever cruisecontrol.net requires
if you are looking for an alternative oracle application express is a fairly powerful web based app that can be run on oracle-xe
i am not sure if having twice the number of controllers is better than those if-else statements around a single controller but i guess it s a question of personal preference
i would like something as simple as security trimming of the web.sitemap that i have tried with asp.net webforms
yes the compiler may optimize it away but it s generally very conservative with floating-point optimizations and it may treat fp values read from memory differently from ones read from a register which means it can t eliminate your arrays lookups from loops conditions so it s often best to do even simple optimizations manually
also asp.net-mvc is built so you can mix and match the view engine orm javascript framework although i recommend jquery and what not to the one more of your liking
if you don t have a preference start with python as it is easy to learn and use and if it is too slow with python perl and ruby probably won t be able to do any better
in my experience with hibernate it s safer and more flexible to annotate getter-setter methods instead of fields anyway so i suggest sticking to that design if you can
for example if int is only 16-bit wide in a particular implementation then jan can t be represented anymore like you intend it char must be at least 8bits while a character literal is always of type int
to logon as the console user the one to be used for logging in locally then you use a parameter for mstsc.exe from a cmd-prompt type in mstsc h to see the help
in this case you re never resetting the font size so once you set that font size on a cell it will be used on any row after it that re-uses the cell
many webservers support some form of ssi server-side-includes this feature lets you add some tags into the html as a very limited form of scripting much simpler and faster and older than php
it is a matter of seperating responsibilities ienumerable is a class that can be iterated over ienumerator is a class that does the iteration
this can be used with any decent editor such as vim emacs or many other editors and ide s
how can this be done with asp.net-mvc
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs
once a packets is received its data can either be copied out or thrown away
if that page was a form the form may then be submitted the controllers handles validation creates the necessary model and uses it to save the data
i find this difficult because you can test the layout on your screen and not know how it appears on someone else s and for ex. a 20px margins has more of an effect on a 768px or 960px fixed-width layout than it does on a 1280px-liquid computer screen
even if uuidcreatesequential does work for this it s a pretty obscure way to get the info and hides potential issues like a computer having more than one adaptor
opens source code for crypto hash implementations md5 and sha can be found at mozilla code
if hash functions such as md5 were reversible then it would have been a watershed event in the history of data compression algorithms
if you can use .net 3.5 and sql server 2005 or 2008 i would recommend linq-to-sql
common-lisp seems more about integrating good ideas from oo fp and other paradigms than about pure fp
the missing piece in silverlight that affects more to the model-view-viewmodel pattern is that it doesn t implements commands like wpf
draw a string on a control then match mouse click to the character positions on the form
that compiles however i get a runtime error local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator.
database persistence is much easier with frameworks such as hibernate and ibatis than with entity beans even in the new java ee standard
i can change the field settings on the time data to return grouped values such as count or max but am struggling to see how this can be setup to show max time - min time for each id hence why i m thinking about heading to sql
we had a number of applications that were tiny one or two tables no more than 50k rows and instead of using oracle which at the time wasn t allowed due to licensing we developed on mysql
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysqlwhich i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested
it does not appear to support more than 12 line
a in true object-oriented fashion it s possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclassing
many compilers accept more than this character set at this time but there isn t any guarantee
another list of reasons why mysqlis bad can be found at this excellent comparison versus postgresql
the xml needs to be changed from bag to set for all collections and the entitities themselves were changed to implement icomparable which is a requirement of a set for uniqueness to be established
if you wanted to subclass the list type in python code you were out of luck and so various workarounds were used instead such as subclassing the pure python implementation of lists in the userlist module instead
this is much less prevalent now mysqlpostgresql sqlite etc
methods and calculated fields anything in the partial classes are not transmitted over ado.net data services - if you are also using ado.net data services anything you expand the entity-framework objects on in partial classes will not be transmitted over ado.net data services
i prefer openmp or pthreads also known as pthreads
which needs to pass known subtyping of icommand to an apropriate handle specificcommand command method implementation and do some generics handling of unknown types
to retrieve a single item tables must be joined one-to-one select from items inner-join pictureitems on items.id pictureitems.id where items.id n
activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine
as the number of possible input files is larger than the number of 128-bit outputs it s impossible to uniquely assign an md5 hash to each possible
native-code is often synonymous with unmanaged but is not identical
you d be better off with ruby python perl java or even php
xslt apply-templates is much richer and deeper than xslt for-each even
also since sometimes i work with asp.net webforms how is this done with webforms as well
however the column can be managed just like any other blob column in sql server so administration can use the manageability and security capabilities of sql server to integrated blob data management with the rest of the data in the relational database without needing to manage the file system data separately
better you use the w3c dom api which is standardized and provides a clean way to build up a element tree which can be appended to any child element into the document tree
but from my experience it just can t beat the commercial alternatives especially accurev but also clearcase perforce etc. which will give you much more than what svn is capabale
and the three new points can be found using scalar multiplication and vector addition
i have fond feelings for mysqland their being able to compete with oracle and sql server
first i do not like sun and second sql-server express is significantly more robust and enterprise than mysql
it seems that for db simpletons like me sql-server express is easier to setup and use and is faster and more stable
personally i prefer sql-server over mysql
particularly i want to not be tied to mysql a database or preferably any given software i d really like it to be trivial to wright a program that can read it back in something like a few dozen line of c or perl
deployment is very easy with asp.net-mvc and with the changes coming to visual studio 2010 for easier deployment of web sites via packages. i currently maintain 2 asp.net-mvc sites and find it with bin-deployment to be just the same as a regular asp.net webforms site
if there are custom actions involved requiring elevated-privileges they need to be configured as deferred in system context
the maximum packet age is dictated by network properties an example being that satellite lifetimes are higher than lan lifetimes since the packets have much further to go
it does depend on what type and size of application you re building but i think there are good reasons why many people choose php ruby and python for their personal projects where they get to choose what language they build web apps in and not their superiors
you could also look for any record contains e or or any other character that could be interpeted as numeric according to the sources already given
trying to make a web service call to an http endpoint in my silverlight application results in this error could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding wshttpbinding
a 64bit binary will be larger than a 32-bit binary due to code side differences static data etc
i am using zend_config_ini config adaptor i prefer ini for base configuration
virtualbox also seems much faster at launching a vm and much better at translating the graphics keystrokes to and from the vm both on ubuntu desktop and on windows-xp
you might be running afoul of uac which is more stringent about checked the security permissions required for various actions
once the student outcomes and their parent category have been added there is very little reason for them to be modified in any way
this can be done in linq-to-sql but it s a manual process that s far from the default configuration
add a new row untilheight is greater than width
add a new column until width is greater thanheight
i should have mentioned that this is for an internal application and i expect 99 of users to be using outlook or other client but never hotmail or gmail etc
however this will only last for the lifetime of the current http-request so i m not sure how you make it work - the request for the bugzilla page from your browser frame will be considered completely separate by apache
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process
if constantly jump between mouse and keyboard you lose this advantage
but none of those is something you want programming languages are different and the only way people have found to unify them is by compiling them to a common machine model that s the idea behind microsoft s clr even more than behind the jvm because the clr is really broad you can do unmanaged-code compile c++ to it efficiently.
the nice thing about this is if you have a boss who prefers excel or a content-management system that uses html its not too difficult to change this format into some other output destination format
i had a parametrized insert statement that was working well and i needed to add a select statement and wrap it all in a transaction in order to get data for one of the fields for the insert
this was frankly painful in java because closures were so wordy starting with java 8 lambda expressions can be implemented like in many other languages c# lambda expressions or groovy and this special case is handled since java 7 with try-with-resources and autoclosable streams
notice that it can be done top answer but also notice that the second-place answer by a short margins says more or less the same thing as i mention above
if it s set to lost-focus then it checks whenever the control loses focus
if i declare them with recompile anexecuteution plan will be generated each time
maybe there s a better way to do it but in my experience loading the movie player takes time
ultimately any project-management plan is better than none and the sooner you realise there is a problem the less impact it will have
define serialized field starting value of 1 increment by 1 insert leading zeros
moreover scrum and agile-processes are more than a set of practices there are underlying principles
the reason it s safe is that the string it returns will only contains the digit characters 0 through 9 not any fancy unicode digits so the conversion to ansistring will not lose any information
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for
in this case populated is defined as not null having a length greater than zero if a string or not equal to 0 if an integer
indeed i do the above plus deactivating zip support regsvr32 u zipfldr.dll activating the underscore on alt shortcuts advanced appearance replacing courier new by andale mono replace with your favorite font in all program settings after installing it of course installing my favorite utilities unxutils sysinternals scite filemenu tools which has cmd-line here and lot of other goodies etc. and so on
packet capture functionality requires kernel mode support hence you will at the very least need to have your application require or install libpcap winpcap as will dean pointed out
one reason for this is that git exposes the lower level functions that most users will ever need as cmd-line tools
edit for any view controllers combo not sure you ll find anything simpler than this
putting it alone in its own transaction is probably unnecessary as updates are atomicity
most recent newer than 2.5.68 32-bit linux systems use vdso page aka linux-gate.so.1 and 64bit systems will soon start as well 64bit vdso was introduced in kernel 2.6.24
and the result is a perfectly centered pair of tables that responds fluidly to arbitrary widths and page re sizes and the align center table attribute could be hoisted out into an outer div with margins autos
for me the quality of m2e can be judged by this simple example if you run eclipse on a jre instead of jdk m2e shows a warning that some of its features rely on a jdk
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv
in access 2007 it can be changed from long-integer to replication id
first they use some fairly general search pattern to pick out everything that could be an address and then they use their map database to lookup that string and see if they get any matches
while not big enough to be an issue it proves what we were already seeing from the previous benchmark results 32-bit code runs slightly slower in a 64bit environment than it does in its native 32-bit habitat
can anyone recommend any programmer-friendly extensible frameworks or systems for performing network level packets fuzzing
however if you use apache it is probably easier to use php ruby or python whereas if you use iis or weblogic or domino it will be easier to do it in java c#
property file if the data can be represented as key-value
secondly you can have more than request-replay messaging patterns including asynchronous notifications from server to client impossible with pure http and thirdly abstracting away the underlying transport protocol from xml messaging and thus elegantly supporting http https tcp and other
if a html page could set the file to be uploaded using javascript for instance an arbitrary html page could upload any file from the client computer form submission can be triggered via javascript
php ruby on rails are optimized for crud and both perform slower than java java ee or c# which are both common enterprise standards
once you ve used all this advice to convince your boss that you won t lose out on anything by using lamp if you crunch the numbers and show your them that it is going to take 6 man-months to build the site in java and only 3 to build it in ruby python then that s really what it comes down to
after all if you couple a project with linq 2 sql ef asp.net mvc and potentially dynamic data if you need that sort of thing i really can t think of any compelling reasons to choose rails over .net however i can choose reasons to select .net over rails - after all hands down the rich debugging experience with vs.net rich intellisense and watcher quickwatch support plus the asp.net mvc framework supports html action helpers model binders support and encouragement for unit testing and now with the inclusion of jquery and json results you re virtually unstoppable
actually i recommend boost serialization and boost iostreamings which includes a compression streaming that transparently can compress your data too
if you want to select more than 1 row you can use either an explicit cursor
that feels cleaner to me than trying to shell out to a process and working with that plus it only will pick out the exact line with clientlogin email that you re looking for
all rss feed can be read with silverlight
bear in mind that the clr isn t going to try to pack multiple variables into a byte so having one on its own would be no more useful than boolean
however if you don t find one in the flea market or happen to have on in the attic i d recommend bit-arrays because with the incredible advent of 64-bit your boolean will become as big as double the horror
now using print statements that can then be read from ado.net by implementing a handler for the infomessage event i can simulate a trace for stored-procedures
i prefer oracle and consider mysqlto be a toy database although mysqlhas got few useful features that don t exist in oracle
in my current case i have a bunch of classes generated by linq-to-sql which cause a lot of fxcop issues and obviously i will not modify all of those to match fxcop standards as a lot of those modifications would be gone if i re-generated the classes
but don t expect to see anything as big as sql-server or oracle in that area anytime soon
how do i create a system-tray component in vb.net that can be used to monitor the progress of the service
make sure favicon.ico points towards the webroot rather than the local directory or else requests will be generated for controllers action favicon.ico rather than favicon.ico - and thus trigger your action
i would say use open id for single-sign-on where the security isn t vital blog forums etc and something more like microsoft cardspace for things where security is more important ecommerce
conventional website authentication performs a comparison with data held in a private database so your username and password can be used to login to this website only
there are turnkey wamp packages out there or you could install to a linux box vm i recommend virtualbox for virtualization
i agree w the accepted answer by craig h however i d like to add that in school i was taught that white space comments and declarations shouldn t be counted as line of code in terms of measuring the line of code produced by a programmer for productivity purposes - ol 15-line-per-day rule
does that mean the sql database will reserve two bytes for each integer or that each integer can not have more than two digits
this would probably be better than oracle or sql-server as it is specialized for this type of work
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html
change this to save to a file in whatever format you prefer csv tab delimited xml etc.
just in case anybody wants the larger context i am building get and put operations for an atomicity queue that can be called from shell scripts
your regex will essentially match any part of the string that ends in and does not contains another for instance in it matches and in it matches
to work around difference when classes don t share the same inheritance tree using helpers makes it possible to have have generic count and items properties for example
you configure the program using a text file containing rules that match http-request and then write actions to perform once a rule is matched
php perl ruby python i have worked with perl and to a lesser extent with python
i often get a pdf from our designer built in adobe-indesign which is supposed to be sent out to thousands of people
setting up async operations on your wcf service can be done as ninja posted by setting asyncpattern true or it can be done on the client side by telling svcutil to generate the async end points by setting the correct cmd-line argument or by checking the generate asynchronous operations option in the gui version of svcutil
is there anything special that needs to be done in order to respond back over http in this way
if you re starting a new project now i d recommend sticking with asp.net webforms and make use of a the built in asp.net ajax the toolkit and jquery as needed
if your application generates a lot ofupdatess you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam
this example is in delphi but can very easily be converted to c++ it s all win32
before windows-vista you could have configured your service to interact with the desktop
is there a specific reason you re using floating-point for currency or would things be better off with an arbitrary-precision fixed-point number format
here you haven t given either div a new width or any additional instruction about where in the layout they should now go so it pins itself to the left margins and it s top margins finds the nearest block element to pin to still the body
as long as you are only using an internal rewrite not an http-redirect you should not lose postdata
one of the features of a radio input is that an item in a radio set once selected cannot be deselected except by another member of the set being selected unlike a checkbox set
our source code is mainly c with python c# and gnu makefile and a little c++ and bash
the same can be achieved from windows-xp on with
i see in the sidebar of your question a similar question converting pdf to html with python which points to a library poppler which is apparently written in c++ perhaps can be accessed with jni jna and to a related question which offers even more answers
to prevent overlapping you can test each new polygons against each existing polygons and reject the new one if the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processor
before windows-vista you could have configured your service to interact with the desktop
side note the objective-c language does not support multiple inherited a class can only derive from one superclass but much of the same functionality can be provided by protocols because a class can conform to several different protocols
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq
you can assign click event handler to control whose surface will be used to drawrectangle
udp has less overhead for headers so that one packets can carry more data so the network bandwidth is utilized more efficiently
theoretically quicksort should work faster than insertion-sort for random data of medium to large size
unless you ve hit one of quicksorts pathological cases often a list that is already sorted quicksortshould be o n log n substantially faster than insertion-sort s o n 2 as n increases
update 2 since this was posted back in 2008 i have switched to dedicated-servers from serverloft where i get dedicated hardware for less money than shared vps at serverintellect.
windows messages can still be used in windows-vista
besides all of this in any given application there s likely to be a much bigger bottleneck than processor caches for shared data in static-classes
i agree with annakata that this question needs some more clarification but here is a very very basic example of how to setup an onclick event handler for the radio-button
the exception message is could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding basichttpbinding
there is a dropdownlist in one of them and when user selects any item from dropdownlist it can pass the selected value to the other user control which includes gridview to show related data of selected item value from the user control whichcontains the dropdownlist
the second option should be preferred for code-readability
itext is more feature rich than apache-fop as far as pdf is concerned you can add annotations create acroforms digitally sign a pdf document
but the intellisense still makes it better than most text-editor
to minimize the amount of time the user needs to wait you could also consider implemented two category of classes those that need the entire dataset to function and those that can function once a subset of the data has been loaded
if you need more than one value you can also use a generator-expression and grab a few at a time
i had taken a look at apache s guide and am fairly familiar with dlopen and dlsym and dlclose
each user only has one blog each blog has many categories each category has many posts and each post can belong to more than one category
it s more simple than javascript and just a few line of code you can use jquery calendar on your page
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery
if plugins will be developed in delphi or c++ builder use packages + interfaces
also i think dojo and mootools have faster animations than jquery at least in my experience
if that s it then all asp.net web controls depending on viewstate postback cannot be used in asp.net-mvc right
postback is a term that gets introduced very recently by asp.net programming as dreas explained whereas callback is more generic and has been used way before web development exists
that could be done using tail or awk or perl depending on the commands you have available
that being said i agree with everyone else that the method should be broken out into single responsibility methods instead of hundreds of line of code
i d recommend visualsvn server to get set up and running quickly
your first regular expression will not select any links that contains other tags such as img or b
the insertx updatex deletex methods are called after linq-to-sql has determined which objects will be included in submitchanges
everything sed and awk do can be done in python or perl often more simply and sometimes faster too
by doing things in python or perl your implementation depends on fewer languages with a resulting increase in clarity
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system
in a language like java or c++ which conflate subtyping with inherited your use of polymorphism may be restricted to subclassing of a particular class
there were supposedly some classes in the linq-to-sql provider model that were sealed--but i never really figured out exactly which classes need to be unsealed in order to use it
put semantic violation in a separate validator class this date field has to be after that date field this can be null if that is greater than zero and call the validator from the controllers passing errors back to the view for display
be warned that this returns you an object which may be encode use decode to get a body with usable data
wpf uses directx for rendering which is much faster instead of the native windows gdi
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics
i found that it was much easier for me to develop code in eclipse compile it with ant using etaras rapc ant tasks but they seem to be gone -- blackberry ant tools seem to be a suitable replacement and use the jde for debugging profiling etc
even if you kept the cursor which i do not recommend cursors are a very bad way to do inserts as they are very slow compared to the set-based solution that pete gave your code could not do the insert to the first table if column d is the identity-column which i would guess it is since you later try to assign d to the identity value
in a windows-server 2008 domain with fine grained password policy this get s more complicated though since you can have different password policies for different ou s
i d guess if you need a thousand or more cell values this is probably faster than just looping through different cells and polling the values
you are trying to be normalized and denormalization at the same time
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram whentity-relationshipe you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description
if any two consecutive buckets have more than zero elements each maximum difference between them is
basically unicode can be encode with many encoding and encode strings can be decoded to unicode
how do you think objectcontext should be managed in asp.net-mvc to both avoid lots of opening disposing and prevent race conditions
pfattributes meansproperties will be stored as attributes of xml elements
if the structure is intended to be thread safe then the methods should be made instance methods only if they do atomicity operations else static methods should be chosen
both quoting and mis redirection are my main gripes and that s why i moved to sh scripting staying as close as possible to posix sh and for scripts with more than 20 line roughly i move to a real language ruby in my case
but lookup in a sorted list may be faster than any of these others structures i ll explain this shortly so you may come out on top
as in linked-lists and binary tree each entry is a node storing more than just key and value also separately-allocated in some implementations so you use more memory and increase chances of a cache miss
you d still have a slightly higher possibility of a cache miss though since the node objects would be necessarily larger than the key-value pairs
indexing a text value guid in textual form or a 128bit binary value which a guid is is far more expensive than an integer
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache
i recommend having a look at asp.net-mvc stackoverflow is built with it
it s not old hat by any means but your example takes the use of category to a rather bizarre extreme
a few years ago someone challenged me to do a delphi port of a tiny ray-tracer less than 200 line of c code
the problem occurs when the result of method geta which at runtime actually returns an is assigned to a reference of type - this statement throw the classcastexception because object cannot be cast to double
this becomes more important if you have more than one method call in your method that throw the same exception
if you don t want to use c++ than it can be done in python
i ve been on lans where the performance of svn is worse than http connections to the internet
if the structure is intended to be thread safe then the methods should be made instance methods only if they do atomicity operations else static methods should be chosen
note that this behavior can t be observed with double values on common processor as most x86 instructions have a version working with 64bit chunks such as movl
i use glib and as such know that i will be spared having to deal with this nonsense as ulrich drepper lead maintainer for glib said about the topic
there are other libraries with possible different properties ignore attributes name i personally prefer this one since it s very flexible in json converter extensions etc + it can easily serialize anonymous objects
the combination could be used to populate a table with an appropriate set of value for the date time field and then do the loj against that table or more precisely from temp_table left outer join main_table ...
i personally prefer reflection instead of code generators but i agree that code generators are more flexible and resulting code obviously faster during runtime
this is much more palatable than my original solution where one controllers updates all views -- and thus has to know which views need special care and feeding to avoid loops
i have the flowdocument turning blank when i add a paragraph that is more than 450 line to the paragraph
i m not sure whether to consider topics like fork join wait notify lock order memory model basics just the basics and so forth to be part of what every reasonably seasoned developer ought to know or whether these are topics that are more for semi-specialists developers who have made a conscious decision to know more than the average developer about concurrent programming
forget about proprietary apis such as jdom or apache ones apache xerces xmlserializer because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards-compatibility which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new version of jdom or whatever parser you use
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.
this can then be converted to pdf although you ll need to install a latex distribution such as miktex
it ll require registration and login to leave comments but guest access just to read and i d like it to be pretty excuse me while i remember damning customers for providing similarly vague requirements specs - but not necessarily infinitely-configurable with skins themes etc
i still can t figure out how to cleanly make some of these mixin methods private or protected though only the display and number_of_displays method should be included as public methods
git is probably the most popular but i would recommend trying darcs - as it is compiled into a portable single binary file unlike git which is a mess of shell-scripts perl scripts libraries and c or c++
i ve been doing c c++ for a long time but never really pegged myself as either win32 mfc directx wxwidgets qt boost sdl allegro etc etc
if you rely on codebase to distinguish code a http url is better
this is sort of off topic but having been down the route of creating a cms with xsl t and the pain that caused i d recommend asp.net-mvc for other reasons than intellisense
so yes the integrity of the sequence will be preserved and numbers will not be reissued
on the other hand what if there are more than two line in text
when an audio or midi clip is played triggered its name needs to be sent using osc to another application
if the getter-setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x
so either opt for oss apache + php perl python ruby etc or choose iis + .net
having been a hobbyist programmer for 3 years mainly python and c and never having written an application longer than 500 line of code i find myself faced with two choices
however if you ve never written anything longer than 500 line then there are a lot of things you do need to learn such as how to write your application s code so that it s flexible maintainable etc
so in essence 3 1024x768 resolutions and if i want to do something so simple as stretch a cmd-prompt across 2 or more monitors i can t
dynamic-linking .so can be much much faster than static-linking .a
since more than one jtable or other component i m guessing can share the sameselectedion model it doesn t make sense to ask for the associated jtable from the event
i would pay attention to script loading time more than line of code
i agree with dave that the desired result probalby can and should be achieved using built-in constraints such as unique-indexes or unique-constraints
i have limited knowledge of java-based technologies and for business enforced reasons i may need to decide whether weblogic integration wli or oracle-service-bus osb is the better choice for integrating a small number of standalone systems together
both products seem capable of similar tasks though in one case wli the integration is more technically driven where the other osb is more business-process driven
when doing an inner join it is better to use sql-92 explicit inner-join than cartesian products
because object-type parameters cannot be given a default-value in php i have to do it inside the constructor
strong-typing generally means that there are no loopholes in the types system whereas weak typing means the types system can be subverted invalidating any guarantees
what is really nice about it is you can mix and match groovy classes and java classes
since i use a repeater could have been a listview or any other templated databound control i can t use the radiobuttonlist
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority
this approach can be extended to include the ability to set up a new database based on a full dump file and then applying any necessary patches to it to upgrade it as well
i also want this to be recalculated whenever the value of trigger changes so i select the refresh field on keyword change option on the trigger field
similarly knowing about security principles is more important than knowing the latest buffer overflow in some webserver
also you can add debug assertions inside the setter routine and the getter routine though this is less useful to make sure the object is in a valid state when setting the value
i recognize that this is more complicated because of character encoding of the file so if i have to specify that on the cmd-line that s fine with me
i ve more than one asp.net 2.0 web site on iis 6 and windows-server 2003
my experience is that any time you saved by not typing curly-braces is more than lost by the extra time it takes me to figure out what you meant
for example int does not match bigint or int unsigned
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomicity changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash
furthermore your questions seems to be confusing two different concepts virtual inheritance which means sharing one base class between two intermediate base classes and virtual-functions which mean allowing derived-class function to be called via base class pointer
ordinarily text editors identify this bom correctly notepad does as does notepad++ i m not familiar with textpad
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac
one thing to add i know it can be solved from perl or awk i m interested in a better solution in bash not in those languages.
each node should have left middle and right nodes where the left nodecontains a set that is strictly less than the node set the right is strictly greater and the middle has overlap
if you are dealing with more complex object that have a significant constructor it is better to use the second push_back based method
using arrays on stack is also discouraged because you don t have range checking and passing the array around will lose any information about its size array to pointers conversion
in case this field is found its value will be settled to the the domain name of the user that requests the report and will be printed out
then when the controllers gets the form for a view if the form needs to be populated i call populate on it and everything appears properly populated
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code
and stack object automatically destroyed when variable obj_class goes out of scope but object created on heap lives for ever.so to destroy heap object c++ gives you delete operator that takes pointers as argument and destroys the object the pointers is pointing to
you can implement the client-side in a few line of regular javascript which will be lighter than any framework could possibly be
obviously this brings in more external jquery code which you are concerned about - but i would suggest a well written and stable plugin would save you lots of work time line of code
it is shorter and more concise than what can be written in perl or awk
in order to index your content using lucene.net you ll have to create some mechanism service of triggered which will add new rows and remove deleted rows from the lucene index
have created a c++ implementation of the hough transform for detecting line in images
i suggest json be used in any ajax-like applications where xml would otherwise be the recommended option
note that by and large you use a sql-server express database engine the same way as the full sql-server product the difference is more in the tools you get with it and some limitations in the express engine
json is less verbose than xml and will usually take up less space
the only way i can think to improve performance if critical would be to use an sp an sp can be accessed through linq-to-sql
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk
either move to asp.net-mvc if you want more control over the markup or consider not using asp.net server controls this way you can include multiple form tags without having to ensure the controls are within a form tag with the runat server attribute but then you dont get the granular access in the code behind and have to start using the request.form colelction to retrieve the postback values
i have been extremely disappointed by cruisecontrol.net
check for any uses of reflection as classes can be loaded and methods can be dynamically invoked at runtime without knowing at compile time which ones they are
since you are already familiar with pygtk why not use gtk
if gil prevents only one thread can be executed at any atomicity time then where would be the stale value
i have the following line in my .vimrc seems to be installed by default with my ubuntu 8.10
i d prefer this happen through msaccess so i don t have to have a searchme table sitting on mysql-server but any good result is acceptable
when i select this checkbox all checkboxes in the html page must be selected
it s not very clean and can lead to obscure bugs although my var leads to more in my experience and it sometimes eats a lot of memory but many repeated expensive initialization statements can be avoided this way
the c api for python is more complex than that for tcl or lua but isn t infeasible to build by hand
as others say - any computation intensive algorithm code that depends on bit-stuffing some memory constrained computation - can be done in raw c++ for cpu memory saving or any other tricks but the whole user interaction logging database handling error handling - all that makes the application actually run can be written in python and it will maintain responsiveness and decent overall performance
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer
for someone starting on web development coming from the asp.net side i would strongly recommend asp.net-mvc like the guy before me did it is closer to real web development than webforms and it promotes though it doesn t guarantee a more elegant architecture
with many non-us keyboard layouts typing square-brackets or braces is even more cumbersome than typing parentheses anyway which makes programming in most languages very strainful so consider yourself lucky
through experimentation i have seen that the iphone will refuse to draw a frame that is bigger than 2000 pixels in either height or width
you don t explain what should happen if more than one result matches any given set of parameters that is reached so you will need to change this to account for those business rules
indexing a field really only works if a your where clause is selective enough that is only selects out about 1-2 of the value
it allows you to update the ui thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress-bar to show realistic values something much more user-friendly than having a marquee style progress-bar
it s probably being used more than wicket but less than spring mvc at least from conversations with my own peers
it allows you to update the ui thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress-bar to show realistic values something much more user-friendly than having a marquee style progress-bar
and yes there are more than one free ones squeak dolphin smalltalk x and visualworks non-comercial
when the listbox loses focus however the selected item s background becomes systemcolors.controlbrush
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from
for example cisco ip phones can be controlled using tapi and jtapi integration into their call manager pbxs
windows-vista is a better story and you can probably expect to see 13-15mb for an empty template wpf app
now i m assuming that you will be building a webforms application because webforms technology in asp.net is more mature has better third-party support and has far more documentation
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other
writing a service is somewhat more involved than a regular desktop app though - you may need a separate gui client that will communicate with the service app via tcp-ip named pipes etc
if the pricing is due to licensing costs why don t you see more host with windows and .net but with alternative databases such as postgresql or mysqlavailable to keep the pricing to a minimum which providing basically the same functionality
also as a general rule i don t like methods with more than 10-15 line of code
a good example where this is using the css control adaptor toolkit for asp.net 2.0 which changes the way .net controls render changing the default method to render controls to use pure css
now that s not to say that you can t do any of these things with webforms but asp.net-mvc makes it easier
rails s approach is similar although the logic is a bit more explicit and less magic. a view page in an asp.net-mvc app is usually simpler than a webforms page because they don t have to worry as much about routing business logic or data handling
however it certainly doesn t qualify as an example of good naming or easily understandable code and it is much harder for new developers to pick up than webforms this isn t just opinion i had a summer intern learn webforms last year and asp.net-mvc this year and the differences in productivity were pronounced - in favor of webforms
however if you ll be doing more than crud and or you are reasonably competent with architecture then asp.net-mvc may feel like a straightjacket until you really master the underlying routing model which is considerably more complex than simply routing in a webforms app
then a polling process that is waiting to own access to the field can observe that the timestamp has not updates in some time t which is much greater than the time of the updating loop s sleep interval and assume that the previously-owning process has died
i also read that asp.net-mvc is able to serve up more pages faster than webforms and probably related to this the individual page size is smaller than an average webforms page
i get the error-operator cannot be applied to operands of type t and t
maybe you could organize the controllers action such that the url is more like and it displays the edit form for the currently-logged-in user
i think they re talking about the ms .net pet shop - which was created as a benchmarking application to compare .net sql with j2ee oracle - they may well be working on an updated version - i can t seem to find a reference to an asp.net-mvc pet shop on scottgu s blog
so the first time they run this app they won t be able to login because they haven t entered the ad domain name so want i want to do is check the web.config to see if there is an adname value in there if there isn t forward them to the settings page if there is then they should be asked to authentication and then forwarded to the index page
i do not think that a while being used like that will be quicker than a union-all
this has other advantages over var in that it could be used in field declarations as well there are also some other areas that it could be useful as well but i won t get into it here
of course in the 32-bit and 64bit windows oss a flat memory model is used and there is no distinction to be made between pointers in these oss though pae adds something conceptually similar
but if you have the time and energy perl and ruby have enough similarities that a lot o the ideas from rails could probably be implemented in perl
i wasn t the only one who thought this was obscure and knuckleheaded sometimes i started with unix in a nutshell and sobell s practical guide to linux commands
now these reasons don t really make asp.net-mvc any better or worse than webforms in a black-and-white sort of way
otherwise i ve had very good experience with yourkit profiler
i only recommend using abstract-class if you want to refactor out the boilerplate implementation for a particular interface implementation such as using a base-class to do your generic crud persistence work
in c++ your main function can have argc and argv parameters which contain the arguments passed on the cmd-line
it shorter development cycles than compiled languages like c and c++ but is higher performance arguable but i ve always been anti-java p than interpreted languages like python and perl and you don t have to work with unofficial implementations like mono that may from time to time not support all of a language s features
a png is almost always smaller than the equivalent gif and will not lose quality like a jpeg file
the build-process can very well be managed by maven or any other ant nant tool you want
on the other hand programming in haskell is much less interactive than lisp and the tremendous amount of reflection present in languages like lisp just doesn t fit the static view of the world that haskell presupposes
additionally my experience in other higher-order dynamically typed languages javascript and ruby yes javascript is a more powerful language than php in terms of language features left me a knowledge with many ways to solve types of problems easily but being restricted in such a way i had no way to use these powerful features
true perl has it quirks but the language comes from an understanding of things that is very close to mine so i m much less comfortable with python and to a lesser degree ruby
still the main argument of generics arrays are problematic is still valid in my opinion and collections should be preferred over reference-type arrays
at the end of the day a few benchmark trials showed me clearly that the java program was some 20 25 slower than its python counterpart
dom by itself does not have nice selectors for javascript and other scripting languages but toolkits like jquery allow you to select elements by class name nicely
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb
i use a lot of lists and arrays but i have yet to come across a scenario in which the array list couldn t be used just as easily as if not easier than the linked-list
so even if you don t know the number of elements in advance an arrays list may still be faster than a linked-list for adding elements as long as you are adding them at the end
accessing elements in an arrays list is also faster than a linked-list even if the accesses are sequential
well it has first-class-functions style primitives with delegates and has gained better syntactic support for the style with anonymous delegates and lambda
while i am pressing a button #b more than this onclick of the button i have to open another popup window
a document that provides more of the advantages of shared-objects but written for.solaris by greg nakhimovsky of happy memory is at
15k line of code won t matter to them any more than 300k line of code will
i think a few minutes doodling on a board would be better than showing line of code
the question of whether haskell is as good as erlang depends on what people want from a language
this might be a problem with my understanding with ncurses more than with perl but please help me out
you have to specify the path to the libraries this can be done by either using a cmd-line argument or putting it in a configuration file
while i agree that haskell is a more solid language and nicer to program in erlang is much easier and has many libraries specifically intended for uses like these
from the cmd-line rake is used in the same way as make so i was wondering if there was some emacs configuration i could enter to allow rake to be used by flymake
edit mark brackett s excellent summary is more apt locks are required when you want an otherwise non-atomicity operation to be atomicity
now this can sorta be done with get parameters like an md5 hash token but i m interested in url mapping as a general solution to many problems
ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route
i tend to favor php simply because it s available on just about any webserver especially shared host but i m looking for other good reasons to make an informed choice
these occur after the evaluation of a full expression one which is not part of a larger expression after the evaluation of the first operand of a ||
thanks to the magic of the aop scoped-proxy tag the static method getuserdetails will be called every time a new http-request comes in and any references to the currentuser property will be resolved correctly
it may suit your current application however a datamodel that consists of a mapping of roles to privileges is more general and suits most purposes
the limit is bigger with long running processes and smaller with short lived processes like cmd-line applications
regarding readability bear in mind that for many languages even one-liners can be broken out into multiple line
if you don t like java s generics at all then you might prefer groovy which is dynamically typed
if you like the idea of generics but find java s implementation of them confusing like i do then you might like scala which handles generics more sensibly
delphi is also much faster than .net you can not notice speed if you develop database applications but if you work on image processing or other intesive algoritams delphi code is faster comparing to c# vb.net
microsoft c++ is only compatible with previous versions but coding in c++ is horror i know its powerfull but can t be comparad to delphi when time is critical for those who did t use delphi just search google for vcl components and see how big is delphi comunity
i put forth the effort because coding in python is much more enjoyable to me than php and after you get the apache config right once you never really have to mess with it again
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share
you generally have to buy db2-connect from ibm to get these files and i suspect it would be a similar situation for the .net framework
there should be a way to beat this thing some secret which probably only windows-vista developers know
now i m pretty comfortable with delphi pascal sql c# and java
i understand that firefox addins can be created in javascript and google-chrome
how can it be done on windows-xp and vista
c++ for example is a very expressive language - but it s development costs are higher than say lua
adding a scripting language as a component of a larger compiled system is a common pattern the compiled part of the system is optimized for speed of execution but is harder to modify because it must be compiled and reloaded whereas the scripted part of the system is optimized for flexibility it will run slower but can be quickly and easily modified by anyone with a text-editor
for arcgis-server software and for me i can only recommend arcgis-server administrator and developer guide that is afaik included in the ags installation box - there are many examples of code for both c# and vb
the parts of the network should be created from line or curves
george marsaglia has written an excellent random number generator that is extremely fast simple and has a much higher period than the mersenne-twister
is this an example of where it s more appropriate providing the app with a central sql authentication login whilst users get read only rights for integrated security
i would like to take a set of controls input select textarea which are contains within a div and send their values as json via ajax to a server
it has to be done in windows-xp without using a firewall
as for the topic we have not much experience with multicast over wan however my feeling is that pgm + wan + high volume of data would lead to retransmission storms
it s more of a stylistic difference in the same way that some people prefer count over count 1
there is also one plugin that translates the c++ api to python plugins can be written in python
postgresql is more oracle-like in syntax and in some of the features indeed it has been occasionally called poor man s oracle
if you are not comfortable with hosting the clr then push as muc hof your app code as possible into dlls and then write a small c++-cli app that brings up your unmanaged ui
i prefer asp.net webforms because i think it allows for extremely rapid web app development but i am sure you will receive recommendations for
sql-server express is made more for developers with middle of the road knowledge of databases
other inputs if you click the text it will focus the input textarea text file this functionality isn t as useful as checkbox radios
a really nice system done entirely in python is plone if your more comfortable with python vs php
this expression is an archetypal example of how to select rows which overlap counting meets and met by see allen s interval algebra for instance as overlapping
grails is already setup with hibernate and spring
evaluating a thing like 1 + 1 ought not take more than ten line or so
on the other hand if nant target framework is set to net-3.5 only for nant 0.86 beta 1 msbuild should be taken from .net 3.5 folder
with the acquisition of g2one by spring source one of the expectations is more support for groovy and grails in eclipse
pay attention to whether a line is much shorter than the maximum line length in the example above you might have text that s being hard-wrapped at 79 characters plus you have address lines which are only 30 characters long
i would recommend selenium as wellook-and-feelor the user-interface testing
xml serialization is less brittle because it s platform-agnostic and leaves unmarshalling quirks to be resolved by the client
they can be used from delphi even from visual basic there are interface units modules for both
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation
i suppose that a similar setup can be achieved by downloading a vhdl verilog core of your cpu did you try opencores
aside from paging any time you want the most or least insert metric here row from a table ordering on whatever metric and limiting to 1 row is ime better than doing a subquery using min max
deployment is more than just copying files we need to stop start services call an exe file that executes database scripts initiate a number of setup.exe install etc
code-readability has higher preference
where it can be written in java or .net or assembler if you can get your assembler to emit xml or json
moreover it does not need to check pointers or keep around instances that should have been destroy
it could be reduced to less than 50 line
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width andheight of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle
these will require more than 15 line of code but those seem key to me
the above div is show on click of a textbox.i want that the user can choose any of the child div and its selected value appears in the textbox
that s all the structs and simple types that are possible in c too such as short broadly speaking is by using such library functions as memcpy or memmove
you might like to add events that hide and show the div when the textbox gains or loses focus
you generally have to buy db2-connect from ibm to get these files and i suspect it would be a similar situation for the .net framework
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie
a better comparison is delphi vs c++ where delphi is much faster to compile
even if you use ssl a user can perform a man-in-the-middle attack the security is handled by the browser so if the user overrides the ssl-certificate it will be allowed to get access to your data protocol
i have no idea about osx except it is more likey to follow the linux pattern
as a simple example many small controllers computers have very small os es and some may simply be considered a monitor offering little more than easy access to a serial port or a terminal or lcd display
i haven t benchmarked it but i d bet that the biggest performance gain comes out of the fact that parsing json is much less cpu-intensive than parsing xml
at the least you can pull the sql out from java code that most likely uses stringbuffer and appending or stringconcat into xml where it is just easier to maintain
for third-party libs you can either set up a single eclipse project contains and exporting all of your jars i don t recommend this or a separate project for each third-party lib exporting the jar
this is really nice because it doesn t use any more space than an int and when you are looking at the source data you don t have to link the lookup table to know what the heck the value is
audio may be reduced from 16-bit to 8bit or even 4-bit and stereo can be converted to mono
notepad++ is based on the editing component scintilla - for which at sourceforge there is a response to a request for this feature no need for this to be included in scite as you can add this command to the tools menu using the parameters dialog. so is it possible to do multi-line replace in files in notepad++
some parsing operations can be performed on streaming as the bytes arrive rather than copy into buffering and parse
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns
i can t seem to be able to choose from python and ruby they seem very similar but apparently ruby is more functional and object-oriented which are good things while python is more like perl a simple scripting language
now for web development python might seem like a more scattered option than ruby with the plethora of python web frameworks available
a lot of ruby s syntax was borrowed from perl though and i haven t seen much python code that feels similar though again i have little experience with python
and sure python s syntax is arguably better than ruby s
a common thing that you will hear is this the platform is more important than the language and python has a better platform than ruby this argument works both ways so don t vote me down all you rubyists
afaik python s support for unicode is better than ruby s especially since python 3.0
i will admit that i ve used python much more than ruby but i wouldn t say that i have any great preference between the two apart from familiarity
ruby is more flexible in the perl way and you can do a lot of hacks
among the two ruby is syntactically more similar to perl than python
python is a good language and i enjoy working with it too but i think ruby is somewhat more lispy in the degree of freedom it gives to the programmer
python certainly isn t more perlish ruby is essentially a smalltalk perl mashup some of its less-used features are pulled directly from perl whereas python is only distantly related to either
however i believe the relational model provided by sql is infinitely more powerful and useful and products like oracle and sql-server deserve their success in the marketplace
i personally prefer login logout but i know lots of software that uses login logoff
with tcp-ip we use mss-clamping to protect against large packet issues but this cannot be applied to any udp transmissions or anything secure protocol that uses an authentication header
however i d like to know if it s possible to match line that don t contain a specific word hede using a regular expression
i feel like the getter-setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are
the regex above will match any string or line without a line break not contains the sub string hede
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think
moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc is more difficult
or an easy way to run for example lua python in a sandbox no filesystem access no creation of objects etc and be called from ruby rails 2.2
dealing with json is much easier than xml from the javascript side.
please avoid discussions of whether ruby or python is better which is just too open-ended to answer.
if a web framework is crafted properly a re-usable core should probably not be more than 100 line
there are also several 6-pixel wide x11 fonts that are less than 13 pixels high often named clear so you can get more line on the screen
rails dominates ruby - there is no single application that dominates python mainly because the python community is somewhat bigger than the ruby community
silverlight just by nature is a little less secure than an asp.net-mvc application
gwt is conceptually similar to swing but is more a replacement for jsps than anything else
for instances a mix of public private and protected member variables could be laid out such that each access type is contiguous
things get worse with virtual inherited where the virtually inherited base-classes can be layed out anywhere in the memory allocated for that particular instance
i prefer using this approach instead of using python perl haskell java etc
a lot of people would probably agree that the django ruby-on-rails cakephp approach is better than the older approaches but as the older language python has a lot more legacy frameworks that are still trying to evolve and stay relevant
i believe the use of try-catch exception-handling handling is worse than the use of simple return codes and associated common messaging structures to ferry useful error messages
so my thoughts are that big dividends will be seen during maintenance when you re needing to change the way you re handling logging exceptions by having the flexibility to change configuration easily and still have the same one line of source code
while most of the structure and flow of asp.net mvc is more or less identical to django and ruby-on-rails the one part i m not sure about is the apps methodology django employs to make code reuse easier
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim
the code has #if blocks based on different symbols to control logic - so for example binaryformatter isn t available on cf wcf is only available with .net 3.0 delegate.createdelegate isn t on cf 2.0 etc
if you want to rewrite several line there is nothing so portable as ncurses there is libs for it on practically every operating system and you don t have to take care of the ansi-differences
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl
the solution explorer can t be configured like the text-editor
changing a one page document is easier than changing 5000 line of code
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one
int s are atomicity good but ints aren t necessarily ordered which could destroy any lock-free algorithm including my above scenario
we have run into the problem albeit on itanium processor where the instruction reordering is more aggressive than x86 x64
can be seen in haskell and python for example
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill
assuming you prefer asp.net-mvc to webforms it s worth it for a system that s in active development maintenance
imo asp.net-mvc is better for web sites while webforms are better for web applications
the reason i ask is because every e-mail that i get with a link attached i keep getting platform version 1.9.0.4 not compatible with min version 1.9.0.5 max version 1.9.0.5
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems
note because a readonly field can be initialized either at the declaration or in the constructor of a class readonly field can have different value depending on the constructor used
other than the fact the controllers has more power than the logic layer
i would not say that the controllers is more powerful than the logic layer
in the overall i prefer django over ruby-on-rails because of the django apps
when an object has various formats xml csv it can be represented in where should one store knowledge of those formats
however all of my new asp.net projects will or should be developed using asp.net-mvc as it is a much better and more flexible framework
i would go so far as to recommend learning python pygame and start building games with that tool rather than c++ which complicates the design and implementation process
when it comes to floating-point types in the iphone processor arm11 with vfp hardware floating point 32-bit floats are somewhat faster than 64bit doubles
f# is first class .net language and it s the first functional language that comes with really big foundation not that i say that lisp haskell erlang scala ocaml do not have lots of libraries they are just not as complete as .net is
furthermore if the file is greater than a few kb the reader throw an exception stating the stringbuilder capacity argument must be greater than zero presummably because the size is greater than int32.maxvalue
edit having one set of property files per dialog etc makes it easier to see where any particular string is coming from but it makes it harder to reuse the same messages etc
how can that be done in linux unix systems
people don t do that necessarily to be able to put the product in a box at any day sure there may be routines that have to be done before release but the idea is that any developer can get the latest code in the server and it will build in their machines
is your only problem that your view components feel cluttered by getter setter and constsructors with many parameters
instead javafx script makes swing easier to use
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysqlsecond as your database of choice
mysql5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql
i ve run websphere for zseries on a vmware virtual-machine with no problem and websphere is more resource intensive then any php stack
it occurs to me that this is a common issue with all dynamically compiled interpreted languages since the runtime will have a lifetime longer than any particular application that the runtime runs ruby or python and applications will share the same library load state
under category select swing gui forms and under file types select japplet form
it comes with xml serialization deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary serialization for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact
the actual model is much more complicated then the example and the classes have many references between them using eager-loading or adding joins to the queries is out of the question for performance reasons
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well
i would recommend using junit in conjunction with a code-coverage tool such as cobertura which is easy to set up - it will help you to understand how much code your tests are covering and is an indicator about how effective your tests are
if you have more than one condition though then the short-circuiting rule apply
it would be extremely natural to use and much more lightweight than having to deal with a keyboard and mouse
wcf is a communication stack that allows services to be exposed over http like asmx and tcp like remoting as well as named pipes which is really an intra-machine cross process call msmq and with .net 3.5 rest
i know redgate has such a product but i d rather not have to pay for something which in my opinion should be built into ssms
asp.net ajax however is based on asp.net webforms and as such it is not compatible with asp.net-mvc
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction
it s a typical scenario of a hierarchy table of category that can themselves be divided into category that db experts tell me is called the adjacency model
dispose method can be executed in finalize but it is safer to call it yourself
i generally prefer static-typing due to compile typechecking better documented code etc
multiple inherited is much harder - in that case in order to case between base-classes other than the first you need to manually adjust your pointers based on the proper offsets which is really tricky and error-prone
mbunit is totally compatible with nunit so you could still use tests you ve already written with nunit
was there any reason why the designers of java felt that local variables should not be given a default-value
seriously if instance-variables can be given a default value then why can t we do the same for local-variables
i myself like seam but for lightweight remoting spring has more viable solutions and support
it seems that the types int boolean and string will be good for just about everything i ll ever need in terms of variables except perhaps float could be used when decimal numbers are needed in a number
i think a name like trustedsourceint32parse or guaranteedint32parse or something along those line is a better name
all of these can be done with listeners but in coherence for example listeners have to be cheap which leads to things like a map having a listener than writes something to another map and this can chain on for awhile
this is also can be used in asp.net-mvc s outputcachedpage
olap-cubes usually originate from a data-warehouse which is nothing more than another database - but typical warehouses contain data that came from more than one and often dozens of other application databases
is it possible to build components in c# using .net which can be reused in asp.net
so what actually happens is three category essential and expected to remain essential if this is not done on time we will be forced to release late treated as essential for now but we may change our minds as the release date approaches and treated as not for this release for now but we will pull it forward if time permits
that will make it a lot faster no converting to unicode string no splitting the strings in line no splitting the line in substrings no parsing the substrings but you re going to lose maintainability
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly
if you just want to get started i would recommend asp.net-mvc because it has more people and resources behind it and go for fubu if you don t like what you see
in view of recent news from microsoft i believe it is a better choice than linq-to-sql
due to the need to keep an atomicity counter they re a bit slower than auto pointers
culture around c++ is more varied than relatively newer languages used on web such as python ruby newer versions of php notable exception is perl which is about doing things differently thanks to its general scope and age there is not an obvious it should be done like this way which a newbie can pick up quickly and get started
i would recommend dynamic view for those initialization phases where you need to import a lot of data you can quickly see what your view looks like without making anyupdates like without updating your workspace
if you check out the great language shootout you ll find that for some benchmarks like binary-tree the ocaml version is faster than c
continuous-integration says that this build-process should be repeated every time there is a significant change event to the code like a check in if at all possible
in day to day programming you probably won t use more than algebra and logic for if-statements and loops conditions
it also uses a lossless-compression that is more effective when large areas have a single color and ineffective for detailed images or dithered images
web browsers at the moment only display jpeg png and gif files - so those are the ones that can be shown on web pages
for example it doesn t make much sense to compare django to something like drupal because django is something you use to create things like drupal
then you only have to maintain the one configuration file and a file of environment settings - i think this makes maintenance easier and clearer in the long-term
for example if the picturebox is more widescreen in relation to the image see screenshot it means the picturebox will stretch the image to its ownheight and center it horizontally showing its background-color in this case red to the left and right of the image
even if an inner-join is faster you wouldn t use it if you needed the results of a left join which includes even the records which don t match the second table in the join
default-value or be left out altogether
so is there a clean and simple way to solve this problem in c# akin to how it could be solved with objective-c category
the result set is always a single row which has the datetime value equal to user max_date that is it returns the row thatcontains max date if no more rows have been added with more recent dates than max date
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes
i always make very short methods never more than 6 line of smalltalk code automatically formatted so i really don t have any trouble saying what this method is about
if you go with wpf silverlight then there s a slightly different paradigm to pickup called mvc model-view-controller which is starting to become the next big craze
at this point asp.net-mvc is more mature and has had more testers and eyeballs looking at it
you will find that sympy is much easier to explore since you can use it interactively from the python cmd-line
so don t create a massive controllers file where only a small portion of the code will be executed per request
if you want more dynamic handling stax approach would probably work better than sax
sql server compact edition can be used with linq-to-sql or entity framework
so in short it does much more than convert a string to an integer applying specific rounding rules to fractions short circuting unecessary conversions etc
that saves running all the way around the houses creating custom attributes and attaching them to your enums or using lookup tables to marry an enum value with a friendly string and best of all it s self managing and can be used on any pascal case string which is infinitely more reusable
i want to use msbuild for my build-server since everything is already set up that way thanks to vs but i m also looking for tips on how files should be laid out how projects should be laid out in a solution etc
should my test fixture contains tests for every possible validation error that can occur in the validate methods or is it better to leave that for a separate set of tests
i have got round this by having an enum viewtemplate associated with the category and then return the view with the same name but this doesn t feel right firstly because i m not sure i should be logic like this in the controllers action and also i am still making the same database calls which is fine for some stuff but if a category has 500 products i am still pulling them out the database even for the category2 when they won t be used
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs
i haven t seen a single platform for web development as easy as asp.net webforms and this is only because of great webcontrol support which requires viewstate
but i think asp.net webforms will remain a great technology where it s more applicable
specifically about data access asp.net-mvc usually requires more code than webforms counterparts
for presenting tabular data i.e where gridview is applicable i think asp.net webforms is the easier way to accomplish things
like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing
to do that the css property overflow can be set to scroll and it will scroll if the contains elements size is larger than that of itself
if you set ld_preload to the path of a shared object that file will be loaded before any other library including the c runtime libc.so
in order to do this you will have to click on the down-arrow on the right side of the add button and choose add as link
i m guessing that sql-server has a better optimizer and they might be close to equivalent there but in mysqli expect a significant performance advantage to distinct
but for a large data set the number of indexes required to match any possible combination of queries would make the index grow exponentially
if you don t create the foo object on the heap and the internal array of foo isn t a pointers to which you allocate memory with new in foo s constructor then that internal array will be created on stack
clearly there is plenty of scope for ambiguities in such a language but if it is statically typed with type inference then most ambiguities could be eliminated and those that remain could be considered a syntax-error to be corrected by adding brackets where appropriate
the alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack automatically frees itself and also blows up with sigsegv if it s too big
in other words it paste pure text from the clipboard without any of the markup that might have been copy-paste onto the clipboard with the text
for housekeeping purposes you should include an expiry datetime field which is set for much longer than any realistic logon period a week for example
you should make sure that memory acquired by malloc should be freed with free so delete your instances like this
the beforesend handler can be used to show a hidden div containing your loading text or image while complete handler will be used to hide it no matter whether the call succeeds or not
it s a little more verbose than the linq example and some of my line could have been combined but to my eye this is easier to parse
also the tools can actually be used standalone to perform the various functions scripting building comparing upgrading and packaging if you want it s just that using them all together provides a full end-to-end process thus making the overall value greater than the sum of it s parts
the uiview folding can be approximated using core-animation perhaps by adding perspective to the catransform3d of the uiview s underlying layer to distort the uiview into a trapezoid which gets sucked into the trash can
if you are relatively inexperienced with rest you haven t built a full scale web api yet i would recommend that you buy or better get your boss to restful web-services by richardson ruby
also note that modern cpus use the same fp unit for both single 32-bit and double 64bit fp numbers so unless you are trying to save memory storing a lot of floats there s really no reason to favor float over double
i could ve used the getter-setter method approach but i don t use them anywhere else in my code so this would be out-of-style
items of secondary importance can be added as key-value pairs
gruby-on-rails still feels so rough around the edges that it s almost a joke to compare it with ruby-on-rails
a little more context i m writing an email to the professor asking if the course can be switched to ruby or python from perl
it can be written in any text-editor
i would recommend trying out rabbitmq amqp and using protocol buffers xml or some other data format such as json to taste
updating gem can cause you to run out of memory but this can be solved by downloading and compiling rubygem from source
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example
but the project uses a ajaxcontrolkit which i guess is not available by default in asp.net 2.0 and hence it throw an error that a reference library is missing on conversion and compiling it in 2008
i realise that my problems could be solved by either relaxing my constraints using post and not caring about the surplus parameter or by using asp.net-mvc but are my requirements really unreasonable
by promoting the nsinteger to the long long type and using the lld specifier you make sure that you won t have truncation issues in the future if you compile for 64bit and your nsinteger value requires more than 32-bit to store
on a modern system can local hard disk write speeds be improved by compression the output streaming
believe it or not it can be faster than using malloc and free
the documentation describes this in more detail but the short answer is that you can select your attributes in the datamodel designer and choose copy obj-c 2.0 method declarations from the design menu
python pygame seems much more advanced than sdl bindings to any other language and one huge advantage compared to c++ is that don t have to compile code and with some simple hacking can even modify a running program and see the feedback live
if you have any problems you can get good stack trace and debugging your problems live that s not really possible with c++ once you get a memory corruption or a segfault
i think it cannot be too hard as pygame is a pretty straightforward but very nicely made wrapper for sdl and python c++ mixing is supposed to be easy enough
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme
if a person where to fill out this form and selected more than one checkbox in either number 1 or number 3
filtering the code to properly change to or would work but this is easier done than said with multiple quotes on a line or quotes spanning multiple lines
but as you only have to specify a simple where-clause in your mapping there isn t really much difference between hql and real sql
but i seriously doubt you should make a model where researcher has subclassing paper and author it seems more like researcher is related to the class paper in the role of author
within the constraints of the dva it is fairly well written in that there is no significant program logic in the user interface and anything that can be done using the user interface can also be carried out programmatically using a com ole-automation interface
multiplication and bit-shifing should be faster than division but probably are not precise enough
if you want to have checked enum value it s not clear when exception should be thrown in this case - zero value may sneak to you code when you for example create an instance of a class containing this enum as a field
it becomes very frustrating even when reading a class with just 6-8 methods and not more than 100-150 line of code
setxkbmap was added to solaris express and opensolaris solaris versions newer than solaris 10 but has not yet been backported to solaris 10
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them
if so which would be considered the better practice when submission more than one object to the view
the goal here is to allow my jquery code to figure out which elements need to be validated this is already done and still have the markup be valid xhtml which is what i m having a problem with
however if you re leaning towards a dynamic language rubycocoa will let you use ruby which i think you ll find easier to pick up than python
in theory this is more secure -- but in fact we re needing to execute a cmd-line one way or the other
given that kernel developers like christoph lameter and ingo molnar on the scheduler have tuned the kernel to work well on 4096 processor and given the amount of optimizations invested by intel itself in the issue with multicore specific tuning both for performance and energy saving i bet the kernel is by far more optimized than anything any of us can write in userspace
the most upvoted comment on the accepted answer is this answer is the better one this way resharper can still validate that the action and controllers exists
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process
boost-test s auto macros mean it s an absolute doddle to set up test cases easier than cppunit
cocoa can currently be used with other language bindings such as python or ruby and used to be used with java as well
the evaluation is delayed until you actually invoke some extension that requires theselectedion to be performed like count or tolist or enumerate the elements of the result
sql statements in addition to being correct should be as easy to read and expressively concise as possible because they represent single atomicity actions and your mind needs to grok them completely to avoid unintended consequences. sometimes an expression is more clearly stated with a right outer join
i find that asp.net-mvc frameworks make small projects even easier and larger projects a lot less painful than oldschool asp.net did
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division
i m not familiar with java hashmap but could you try using a cell arrays to store the data instead of a struct
somewhat related is the possibility to use ironpython with asp.net and asp.net-mvc which is probably more mature
i currently use delphi 2007 so i m very comfortable with c++ builder s ide its the same as delphi as well as the vcl and rtl
pointless testing testing the same basic case more than one way or testing things so trivial that they really do not need to be tested like auto-generated getter and setter
because it wouldn t natively have leading zeroes although the cell could be formatted to show them. i expect oledb is asking excel what datatype and excel thinks they are strings
are there any other security settings that can be provided set
std auto_ptr will be declared deprecated in the next version of the standard where it will be recommended the usage of std unique_ptr which requires rvalue-references and move-semantics to be implemented that s a fairly complicated feature
completely portable between linux solaris hpux and windows apps run out of the box without a need for a single change
i know that this doesn t exactly answer your question but i would seriously consider whether an asp.net-mvc architecture will truly make your customers happier than a webforms architecture - especially since they ll never really notice
in general from a shell script cmd-line arguments can be accessed like
introducing unmanaged-code in this is not any more inherintly dangerous than any of the other file or i o related calls in .net since they ultimatley all call in to unmanaged-code
this question is probably better phrased how does running a java server on a hypervisor such as vmware esx affect the java heap
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql
for the answer to this question to be yes all int within the range of an int have to be exactly representable as double and floor must always return that exactly represented value
please contact the application s support team for more information. unlike usual this dialog only has an ok button but no debugging button so ie then terminates and i m not left with so much as a stack trace or even a hint of what part of my code could have been so buggy
i can only repeat what other peoples here already said if you choose python for the domain layer you won t gain anything quite on the contrary using php for the presentation layer
php has native zip support via gzip may not be enabled by default
for example i know the memory is divided into global-variables call stack heap and code for c++ yet i don t know if the heap s address is higher than the stack s or if that depends on the implementation
if it is a value that might or will change some time in the future and you cannot guarantee that all other assemblies are rebuilt simultaneously a readonly field is more appropriate than a constant
similarly if you declare a class as final which prevents it from beingextendsed -- prevents it from being used as a base class for inheritance you are implying that you know more than any future programmer might know about what is the right and proper way to use your class
if you are just holding a block of data you iterate through without any special lookup append remove or splice needs i would prefer vector which makes your intentions more clear than std string which many libraries and functions will assume holds a null-terminated c-style string
my main goal is to allow easier debugging with modular configuration while still preserving code-readability
one could argue that java is more fully sandboxed than python but both ultimately provide access to the underlying architecture via a native c interface.
you can specify subtypes for your class-members that will be enforced when set by accessor or constructors the same system can be used with the moose methods package for functions
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysqlusers used to avoid
i slightly favor java because it is a typed language but my good friend favors python because it is more concise
or you can pick django on jython to get best of java libraries and python s speed-coding
and by stable i dont mean that it has fewer bugs than python or ruby i mean that it doesnt change as much
there is strcmplogicalw but it s only available starting with windows-xp and only implemented as unicode
and that allocated using malloc should be deleted using free
it might be called something like customer with a protected property that instantiates the table adaptor and a method getdetails maybe for finally retrieving details
json yaml is less verbose and much easier to parse than xml
my table view does have multiple cell and a header frame as well and i do need it to be scrollable because it has many rows
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis
you need more than a text-editor and a compiler linker
pre-increment is faster than post-increment
using a dictionary seems to be out of the question since i found it to be around 320 times slower than an arrays
one thing you might want to think about are the number of css files - some people suggest that you should minimise this to just one file site-wide or per-template or area of the site to minimise http-request to the server and avoid delayed css loading and funny looking styling up until that point
defining objects like #2 is more along the line of classic oop
if your users have had to log into the system you are using http taken precautions against xss attacks then sql injection is a smaller issue
it is a data model that is used in circumstances where the number of attributesproperties parameters that can be used to describe a thing an entity or object is potentially very vast but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest.
these methods take object arguments so if you pass them an int it will be converted to an integer and will never match any item in your map because they will all have short keys
you might as well return an enum instead its a lot faster and significantly easier to read error return code than litter everything with 7 line of code instead of 1
all the configuration can be done within app-config instead web-config of asp.net
i am very familiar with php and mysql and somewhat familiar with python and ruby so a php solution would be preferred
i have set the employeeid is primary key.i want that employeeid field will be incremented automatically whenever adding any new records
thinking sphinx is a better alternative than ultrasphinx which seems abandoned but in general xapian has a more powerful engine than sphinx and is easier for implementing realtime search
i d like to know if there is any personal source controllers i d like to have a repository on my machine without going through setting up a server also i work with tex files not any particular language and i d like to have backups of my files the way sub version does
otherwise srcattribute values like would be ambiguous as they can be interpreted either literally as or replacing the sect entity as
anyway i would recommend using cruisecontrol.net for this as it is capable of keeping track of the build number separate from subversion
also note that i ve explicitly specified the code instead of using the ordinal value - this makes it easier to change the order and add remove errors later
json is way easier to parse than xml and there are a lot of options to do so
xml is heavier than json so it uses more bandwidth but powerful for validating and transforming data
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up
the visual basic 6.0 ide will be supported on windows vista and windows-server 2008 as part of the visual basic 6.0 extended support policy until april 8 2008
and this leads to some problems the younger folks with modern processors dont think about such things because an integer divide is both supported on their processor and can operate in a single clock cycle back before we had divide or when divide was dozens to hundreds of clocks but a shift was a single clock you would do all of your power of 2 divides or multiplies using shifting intead
left outer join the same as an inner join except that if there is any row for which no matching row in the table on the right can be found a row is output contains the values from the table on the left with null for each value in the table on the right
when freed pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free
inner-join tend to make result sets smaller but because records can be duplicated this isn t guaranteed
it also is considerably shorter for example 99 of getter setter can just be left out in favor of directly accessing the fields
if the glassfish admin console can be accessed it can be used to upload and deploy.war files
but in addition to that things allocated with malloc and family can be resized using realloc
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need
if you re happier in java you could also look at groovy + grails a very similar framework with a java slant groovy is kind of like a cross between java and ruby and you can mix and match java and groovy classes in the same project
the ncurses can be used for this purpose
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process
if it s just a personal hobby thing i would recommend either going with .net asp.net-mvc rails or zend there may be some good java frameworks out there but i m not familiar with them
in common-lisp this could be written like this
php doesn t have a cron scheduling any more than ruby does
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest
i do have specific cases where i tend to create huge amounts of sets maps which contains usually less than 10 elements and i do really want to have less memory pressure
this is more convenient in libraries where you might not want a global signals handler for sigpipe
i am not familiar with sox but instead of making repeated calls to the program as a cmd-line is it possible to set it up as a service and connect to it for requests
they ll use the last vertical and horizontal position specified and need the dimensions to be specified using width andheight
parsing screensshots generated by java.awt.robot is neither platform- nor version- or even configuration-independant and in general i don t think screens is locked is a well-enough defined concept to be used in this sense - on linux there can be more than just one screens x server you can switching to console terminals you can have applications running one or more machines display their guis on another machine over the network.
this in turn lets us build these as immutable object so long as they can be wired via constructor injection which is a very good thing to do anyway wherever possible
you can also easily wrap your communication in ssl or tunnel it over http which can be wrapped in ssl
i have a linq-to-sql query that was working just fine with sql server 2005 but i have to deploy the web app with a sql server 2000 and when executing that query i get his error
look at this makefile it has some sort of primitive progress indication could have been a progress-bar
default-values can only be used for input parameters that is by value and const
visual studio 2005 elevated-privileges seem to be needed for debugging and for incredibuild to work
what i mean by is clojure as powerful as lisp is that i read someplace here on stackoverflow that common-lisp is lisp-2 and clojure is lisp-1
for wpf silverlight layout is it better to use a grid with lots of rows and columns or tons of stackpanels
edit the method using max case ... often also seen as sum case ... for count values does perform better in some cases depends mostly on your volume of data whether the performance increase is noticeable - sometimes it can be a big difference
in the case mentioned in the comments i think a pid algorithm is simpler than 150 line of if else code
i can t believe anybody thinks 150 line of anything is simpler than 20 line of something
the key here is to not make another instance of string and work with the data in a way where security is easier to manage when dealing with this data which unfortunately is unmanaged-code right now
i m working on something that pulls in urls from delicious and then uses those urls to discover associated feed
so in this case where everything fits in cache the virtual function-calls were about 20x slower than the inline calls
xml datastream will be bigger than json for the same data
i would reccoment json as it s more pythonic than xml
web application will be deployed to windows-server 2003 shared vds hosting
all this common code can be placed in base-class s constructor and it will be called implicitly from the constructors of each of the derived-classes
protected the abc probably already has some pure virtual methods and therefore already can t be instantiated except as a subclass
my experience opinion is that ruby-on-rails is much more flexible and has a more diverse ecosystem and is developing faster while django is more stable slower changing better documented
to answer your second question the term virtual-machine is an older term from the hardware world ibm s virtualization of the 360 in the 1960s that used to mean a software hardware emulation of the underlying machine to accomplish the same sort of stuff that vmware does
scaffolding by itself can seem to hide a lot but once you understand how to create a project without it ruby-on-rails seems to be as highly customizable as django
this sieve is more efficient than the sieve-of-eratosthenes
the metadata is used to validate every request to the server in various aspects permissions valid field field value etc... we are heavily dependent upon this metadata
try-catch and exception-handling handling is better to be commented
although comments should be kept to minimum there is no need to comment a for-loops definition when it is obvious
and of course the base-classes won t be marked serialization
a hashmap is often faster than a normal map for lookups regardless of how many elements are in it but whether it is actually faster depends on what the key is how it is hashed what values you have to deal with and how the key is compared in std map
i have some images of old linux distributes in flat file format they can be used by bochs virtual-machines but i need to run them with sun virtualbox
my experience is that the amazon-web-services uptime is better than most traditional hosting options even full-blown redundant rackspace setup...
and you ll also need more than 4gb ram especially if you run virtual machines so i don t really see any reason to choose a 32-bit os over a 64bit one
i don t think controls from the ajax control toolkit are fully compatible with asp.net-mvc
int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double
message security can for instance be used with http while transport security would require the use of https or other bindings
if that works though this can t be done in windows-vista because of session 0 isolation
we must therefore make sure the template parameters of the class-template appear in the type of any friend-function defined in that template unless we want to prevent more than one instantiation of a class-template in a particular file but this is rather unlikely
length will be evaluated every time you go via the loop however since length is constant time o 1 it doesn t make much difference and adding a variable for storing this value will probably have a negligible effect with a small hit on code-readability as well as breaking the code if the string is ever changed
in sql-server it s the same to use 1 or but on oracle it s faster to use 1
some of my classes have final fields that are populated from the constructor as well as properties that can be assigned from getter and setter
an unquoted file.gif is not parsable as javascript of course a syntax-error results
edit #1 note that the post details a method of how to provide default values however this no longer works as the actionmethod property he uses to access the methodinfo has been removed in the latest version of asp.net-mvc
when i verified i must have confused a 32-bit window for a 64bit window after all they look the same
in contrast to what tim indicates both binary and xml can be transferred through http and https
i would also probably use selenium to more fully test this on the client and the controllers test is more of a sanity check
the number can be used inside loops for example to access a field of an arrays
usually you should prefer std string over plain char-pointers
the eventhandling of webforms should not be used in asp.net-mvc instead your controller classes and their action methods will handle loading your data into a model that gets passed to the view
gruby-on-rails just looks like ruby-on-rails ruby but it uses groovy which is simpler than java
if you know python you could use pyqt it s as powerful as the c++ qt but python is easier than c++
where reflection had failed in this instance is that older database records of mymodel were no longer in sync with the new model as the old data had null values for some of the new attributes orproperties of mymodel
i m reasonably familiar with shell scripting but i m not having much luck finding a cmd-line method of printing photos while specifying the target dimensions
asp.net-mvc framework also requires software developers to be accustomed with model-view-controller pattern
this is probably more to do with the listboxitem themselves not taking up the full width of the listbox
back to proposal 2 build a complete report will all expected data to be displayed then hide show the different sections of the report
then in the option-window you select text-editor then the language of your choice c# for ex
cross browser applications can be used by opera and safari as well
in most implementations the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code meaning that the destructor of the base-class will be called but not the one of the derived-class resulting in a resources leak
unless you have a compelling reason such as an existing user base already familiar with python ruby or boo bringing in another language just adds complexity and training cost
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object
there are plenty of usage scenarios in which ruby will beat python hands down
i think we can all agree that ruby and python will always beat php though
i don t know if ht has gotten any better with newer processor like the i7 but i m not optimistic
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler
you could then in the constructor for the configuration object attempt to override the default config values with values from somewhere such as app-config a database configuration table etc
i ve never seen an in-place radix-sort and from the nature of the radix-sort i doubt that it is much faster than a out of place sort as long as the temporary array fits into memory
if it can run unattended but it may need to be shutdown and restart manually or it can t just be terminated at shutdown then use the xyntservice as recommended by enocnroll
if you are so fortunate that you can read the data asynchronously that is you can post some kind of read request and be notified .when some data is ready and then you can build a chunk of the heap while you are waiting for the next chunk of data to come in - even from disk
xaml can be reused for silverlight wpf xbap
it means the function getregions can t be translated into sql by the linq-to-sql provider
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
my personal expierence is that silverlight is easier to work with wcf than xbaps as the security model is better defined than the sillyness of running xbaps why not just use click once + wpf and you get the exact same as xbaps without headaches - i ll get off my soap box now
if it s running a recent solaris 10 update release or patch set or a release newer than solaris 10 such as solaris express or opensolaris try kbd -s -- on older solaris x86 releases try kdmconfig
i suppose an application could be considered enterprise ready .when it is stable enough that a large company would use it
now the question is about libraries - they contains functions that may be used in any class and sometimes they use some other function from another library and sometimes they need to access some core class
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric
i recommend pyqt now from nokia which uses qt-designer
maybe it s better to use public static void authenticate string string which throw an exception if something goes wrong return false in original method
i m a fan of the aaa syntax so i ll probably switch to moq for my next project it s a bit newer than rhino-mocks
using python how can information such as cpu usage memory usage free used etc process count etc be returned in a generic manner so that the same code can be run on linux windows bsd etc
scrollbar can be disabled in iframe but then user won t be able to scroll
if you are not familiar with windows messaging it is a way for win forms to communicate with the os for things like drawing keyboard events mouse events and everything else
perhaps this is more complicated than what you are looking for but it seems that perhaps you could setup a base-class for your bins and have subclassinges of video or clip
for example just tring to adhere to font recommendations in windows-xp you have to know the system default font should be tahoma verdana should be used for title bars in floating windows and trebuchet ms should be used in the title bar of windows....sigh...i assume its all different for vista -
ctrl + k ctrl + c for commentselectedion and ctrl + k ctrl + u for uncommentselectedion they may be mapped to ctrl + e ctrl + c and ctrl + e ctrl + c in some standard keyboard mappings but the first two will generally still work...
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones
was hoping someone who s a little more familiar with django-forms could point out where i ve gone wrong
actually i d be tempted to turn it into command-pattern along with composite
one option if you have a checkbox would be to have to take action button on the screen with each having a implied value that you would have used a checkbox for
adobe just two days ago announced that it will be publishing and provide open licensing for rtmp so you should see more products with rtmp support in the near future
because they both use webkit and safari runs on both windows and mac as the default browser safari is more important to test for by a small margins
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
a recent culprit is pattern-orientation wherein singleton patterns little more than initialized global variables and factory-patterns a way of parameterizing construction but often implemented when not needed are overused
this site gives more details on how to check information on the controllers as controls are handled in the view
i d also suggest that you may want to use attributes to decorate theproperties that need to be copied and ignore others
in actionscript 3.0 object are usually created through class but object may be created like in javascript through constructor functions
and can it be triggered via web requests as opposed to the cmd-line
if you re looking for the behavior where when the user clicks attach file and the file browsing dialog automatically popup that can be done via javascript but doesn t work in firefox which has the security precaution of requiring the user to invoke the browse button directly rather than programmatically through script
if your unmanaged-code holds onto a pointer value that had been pinned on the way in then there is very real chance that the memory will be moved or garbage collected or both
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible
quicksort has worst case time-complexity of o n 2 but it is usually considered better than other sorting algorithms which have o n log n time-complexity in the worst case
however in the context of current and future computing platforms an algorithm which can make use of a few think multicore few hundred think gpu or few thousand think supercomputer processing elements will beat the pants of the sequential version in wall-clock time even if the total time energy spent by all processor is much greater for the parallel version
you should be able to create a simple batch file to run qtp which can then be invoked via nant and or cruisecontrol.net
in both implementations the worker processes use thread pools so they can work on more than one packets at once since there will be a lot of database querying
the really cool thing about groovy in particular is you can mix and match java and groovy in the same project and it all runs on the vm
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist
do keep in mind that while all development tools you can run on bsd are also available on linux the opposite is certainly not true especially since linux has gained more commercial traction
i have very little experience with windows apis but from what i ve heard they have good pthreads support so you should be able to use fcntl as long as they support pthreads.1-2001
you can try writing the file to a temporary directory and then renaming it since the rename is more or less atomicity depending on the filesystem
move the checking for site and also the assignment to owner to before_filters if this is done more than once inside the controllers
but it might have worked except that afaik virtualhost can only be identified by the host header in the http-request - so only works for the real request
radix-sort has time-complexity o n for fixed-length inputs but quicksort is more often used despite the worse asympotic runtime because the per-element overhead on radix-sort is typically much higher
if you cannot do any server-side processing i would recommend having the javascript set the class tags for each row rather than manipulating the styles directly
i open the sql server configuration manager _ expand sql server network configuration - click the instance i want to change - and select tcp-ip
the main problem is that the double-quotes around the ldap query need to be doubled single-quotes
should i use docbook or is it better to stick with tex latex
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere
merge actionlistener and ejb classes actionlisteners can be ejbs in seam
you ll find that asp.net-mvc is much different than webforms
i want the tree to display a representation of the model be able to send messages to thenodes inside the model and be told to redraw itself when the model changes
c if you want your intellectual property to be truly secure then the only answer is to not let anyone have it in the first place write your application as a web app i recommend using django and only your web-hosting provider has access to your code
keep in mind that serial ports are much slower than tcp-ip connections
the jquery documentation itself doesn t refer to the term monad but talks about builder-pattern which is probably more familiar
i always prefer using private-members within a class instead of properties unless i need the functionality property implementation provides
with sql server management studio 2008 if i select windows authentication the login password boxes are autopopulated with my current credentials and if i try to login it says
the login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with windows authentication
nant is more easily hand-editable in my opinion - particularly if you already know ant
i think you ll have to compare id3-tag song length and filenames
doing so with interfaces pure-virtual classes is often easier than for base subclassinges
all you need to do is define your common page sections what you might be tempted to call fragments as functions in your base controllers
therefore small functions that are as simple as get set i often use to put in a separate file as inline-defined functions and then include that file where i use the extension .inl into the .h header file
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects
outer joins often perform slower than inner-join so you can get some better performance by using a simple inner join
the entire sql query must be given via cmd-line since i want to limit where i select rows from
or suppose that there were a few very complex conditional which could be composed with operators a and b c and not d etc. into even more cases
only serialization objects can be cached with velocity
learning more than one set of design-principles and learning when to use which set is the second stage of learning to be an expert
open source developers wanted java to be supported on bsd and on linux platforms other than x86 and sparc powerpc
gtk+ and qt are two api s that come with their own widget sets button lists etc. whilst wxwidgets is more of a wrapper api to the currently running platforms native widget set
to put it another way is there any way to get db create and db migrate to be run without root access perhaps automatically or something
get all of the code and associated data that you have so far and put it somewhere publicly accessible such as github or sourceforge
however i m trying to think of some places where xml would be more appropriate as a protocol format that doesn t include soap because soap could theoretically be done with json anyways
this question is very similar to when to prefer json over xml
much faster performance with union-all
arraylist is like an array except that it has the benefits of being able to grow and it can be made generics for extra type-safety
if still no just strict c then i would recommend variadic-functions instead
2 report services can serve up web pages or be used in winforms with full paging sorting subreport totals etc etc - that s really hard in xsl
also when starting from java the shared library can be loaded via jni in order to display the splash-screen
itcontains a list of names of elements which are affected by a certain bug and should be repaired on-the-fly when opened with a newer version
well there are certain well known practices like stringconcatenation is way slower than # value but in order to find out where you script is consuming most of its time or more time than required you need to do profiling
by the way wcf is more flexible and unified approach to communication in .net 3.0 onwards
we ve been experimenting with python but is seems at least on fpu-less arm architecture to be as slow as php
right now there is several formatting options that can be chosen rounding truncation the number with the specified precision added prefix e.g or postfix grouping thousands applying commas adding numeric abbreviations kmb
in other lisp dialects that don t require this like common-lisp i don t see recursion used any more than in any other language
they ask for api key because you could have more than one api under same account - in case you have more than one site which are use same api
this is because you re more constrained by the dbms than you are with your own code - building a compromised datamodel is more likley to cause you pain
i strongly prefer git with its elegant and powerful datamodel but mercurial offers functionality similar to git and it is written in python so it might be easier for you
in addition iteration via foreach on an list rather than ilist is faster due to the arraylist s enumerator requiring a heap allocation
i used to prefer auto increment columns ala mysqlsql-server and others until i got heavily into jpa
earlier versions of php may have had a difference - i personally prefer single-quotes to double-quotes so it was a convenient difference
the syntax is very similar between php and perl
arguments none if the file reference remains undefined after a call to new the file is to be considered not parseable by this module and one should issue some error message and go to another file
see this post for a description of how this can be accomplished using ajax for asp.net-mvc
if you keep all of this in a database with the hostname you can compare execution times for the same run-time environment to previous test-runs
the reason why we do this is because numeric values sometimes should not be defaulted to zero as this is very very bad
if you have more than 3 spi devices consider using an hc138 as a decoder to produce the individual device cs lines from a set of address bits and a master chip select line from the microprocessor
it s also slower than spi and has open-collector line so its power consumption + noise immunity are related to what you use where for pullup resistors or current sources
i think this could also be used to add default-values to optional elements like
stored procedures can be written in sql java perl php c++ c# or vb.net
if all you want is to easily extract the the posts from the db and format them in an rss feed you can give up on wp completely and do it all with a file with less than 30 line of code
i m writing a new daemon which will be hosted on debian linux
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers
the key points being to make sure that the input and output streams are in binary mode as you ve found the pdf needs to be interpreted as binary data throughout the chain
although binary -- if available in c c++ java c# would probably be used more than octal
usually my decamelisation methods are a bit more complex as http-request should become http request rather than h t t p request and different applications handle digits differently too
also i cannot join all the selects together they have to be done in order with a commit after each loop
a document named suppliers.xml thatcontains many supplier elements
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can
or may be i need to extract subclassing from server protocol and then the client protocol will be derived from this class
but if it s streaming you want and don t need pipelining of multiple filtering stages stax is simpler than sax
aside from the fact that there are slightly more than 365 days each year you need to add 97 leap days each of the values that are multiplied to make up your constant are integer literals and therefore until youassign them to the uint64 it s all done in integer space
edit memcpy is very likely to be faster in any architecture strcpy can only possibly perform better for very short strings and should be avoided for security reasons even if they are not relevant in this case
std string can be manipulated by boost string algorithms in addition to the ones in stl
c or c++ would be the preferred language but if this is more easily done in any other language let me know asm c# python etc
the runtime library also provides a family of functions execl execlp execle execv execvp more or less which are derived from unix heritage and offer more control over the process
however if you are just wanting to have a java gui but would rather wait for more polish on javafx - i would recommend grabbing miglayout go with swing on java 6u10 or later
for example it seems that lisp could be used for more bottom programming like in building websites or guis where haskell could be used where compile time checks are more needed like in building tcp-ip servers or code parsers
the handshake is simpler than tcp but seems sufficient
i posted an answer to another stackoverflow question which requires some digital logic to be implemented in verilog or vhdl so that it can be programmed into an fpga
it describes a logic system which will be coded in verilog or vhdl and eventually implemented in an fpga
i do not see how cl should not be as useful as haskell for tcp-ip servers or code parsers -- rather the opposite but my contacts with haskell have been brief so far
to see why this is consider that at the time the controllers action is executing we don t know what view will be chosen to render
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit
while the time aspects is pretty well covered filip s and josh s answer the space issue is more complex as the code in question is liable to release any memory and resources it used on completion
merge sort also has an average time-complexity of o n log n however its space-complexity is much worse n
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via randomselectedion of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort
flex can be used to tokenize an input and bison can be used to parsing the tokens and transform them into an syntax tree
scala provides wrappers for java collections so that they can be used as scala collections but not the other way around
you can set z-index of your_content to value less than overlay z-index
admittedly this is easier to throw together in xml because it s free-form text and there s no real validation unless you write an xsd schema but in those cases you re doing the same kind of work as defining types and relations in code classes
in the c++ community it is often considered good oop practice to prefer free nonmember functions over members because these functions don t break encapsulation by gaining access to private-members they don t need
extends functionality on third party objects whether commercial or internal to my company but managed by a separate group which in many cases will be marked as sealed
cutting lines at boundaries of tiles so you can render individual tiles results in less than perfect results - often what is done is lines are rendered beyond the tile boundary or at least the data of the line end is kept though rendering stops once it finds it s fallen off the edge - this reduces error that occurs with lines looking like they don t quite match as they travel across tiles
insert must be used like this mapvar.insert make_pair key-value
it be honest it is not really the best example to compare java against ror and python
some brief information about this can be seen here windows-server and azure appfabric virtual launch may 20th
this function moves backward from the end of the list to the beginning calculating the exponential moving-average for each value by working backward until the weight coefficient for an element is less than the given epsilon
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclasses __init__ method
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
just remember that anything that s available for java can be used by groovy due to groovy s unparalleled integration with java
you can encouncer problems if the app s own admin interface does more than simple crud such as updating denormalization fields in other tables and so on
that is there is really little to no overhead in having a core in the waiting ready to be used .when you need it
the submission of data to be provisioned was as a list of our data types which were put into a priority-queue in our application so they could be written to the database in the correct order due to dependencies
if the class is extended the thread can be started before subclassing constructor is executed
since that particular constructor is only supposed to be called when loading a particular object after selecting it from the results of a search procedure not finding it is either a bug or a race condition which would mean another user deleted the object by key
the template that stephen walther used can be found here asp.net-mvc test framework integration
sometimes the assembly language is better able to express a particular aspects of a solution assembler s close mapping to the hardware can make programming i o or device management clearer
today this approach is far harder as the compilers are far better and it is so much harder for humans to improve the compilers code - since processor got so complicated and fast code has become about keeping the caches and pipelines full
i know perl better than python so my choice would fall on perl
some of the category should be logged by default but some not
since sql server is a 64bit process and my assembly would be hosted in process - i loaded the assemblies from the framework64 folder and system.identitymodel and system.identitymodel.selectors from program files as opposed to program files x86
so is there anyone having a partial xsd that describes the metadata portion of the xml that can be saved with delphi tclientdatasets
either use the hidden field method i wouldn t recommend this or add it to the url route value
i d recommend sql-server express or other database
we decided to choose php instead of asp.net in part because we didn t want to get stucked in a unflexible paradigm webforms everything-automatic-but-not-so-flexible but i believe a php framework could put us in the same situation
if you insist on doing this yourself this can be done in either perl or python - use the one you know best
both can do it but python requires an oop approach and it just isn t as easy as perl s inline regex syntax
strings in .net cannot be coerced into any other type in the way perl awk and many other dynamic languages allow they can only be treated as string or as their parent class object
a simple browser fileselectedion should be possible in less than 50 lines of code
of the frameworks i ve tried cakephp and codeigniter i prefer cakephp
i would add more step beyond the private constructor
the way the site may be configured on iis is via their virtual directory setup that may not be including you js folder
similarly pointer operations can be made atomicity on most platforms so they can often be your savior in multithreaded code
wcf tries really hard not to be coupled to .net
how every it would have been nice to just make a simple control adaptor that would just step in at the right place and just tell the control not to render the default styling
so it s not that you can t do these things in a statically typed language if you have runtime reflection it s just more complicated
the iidentity interface can be implemented on any number of classes which know how to lookup users from a data-store sql server active directory etc
i suspect your web flow controllers pardon my abuse of terminology i m not familiar with web flow is setting the last-modified header while your regular facelets page is not
but cakephp is really an exercise in futility its authors wrote it so they wouldn t have to learn ruby even though learning ruby and ruby-on-rails together is probably easier than figuring out the monstrous mess that is cakephp
since y all asked my biggest complaint about cakephp is how it manages to totally butcher the conveniences of object-oriented programming sure it implements the active record pattern just as much as ruby-on-rails does but it makes you pass around data structures
people say ruby is slow but my own ruby-on-rails apps run faster than their cakephp equivalents last i checked
another point to use the current version is that dublin microsoft new app server will be built on wcf wf .net 4.0 but will gladly host 3.5 wf s
even thought the canonical use-case for the dto is more serialization object that can be passed over the wire in this case you are really referring more to presentation-transfer-objects or view-models
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection
so this is an ultralight but rather complete version of how jquery authentication could be done in asp.net-mvc
i like your naming-conventions and i agree entirely with using content such as your example in property getters if you re delivering an api to be used with binding
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other
one of the more subtle differences between the two is that the as keyword can not be used for casting when a cast operators is involved
so if you are using these to compare base-class and derived-class which inherits from base-class then
reset.css - a reset css file can be used to reset all the default browser styling which can help make it easier to achieve cross-browser compatibility
for example firefox safari chromium or google chrome and my other next-gen browsers do not lose focus when using a scrollbar
instanceof can only be used with reference-type not primitive-types
this will also work if you are expecting your enumerable to contains exactly one elements - however it will throw an exception if it is either empty or larger than one elements
the .net serial port object throw more exceptions than any other .net object i ve used
bsd ftp doesn t give you a return code for error conditions necessitating all that parsing but there are a whole series of other unix programs that can be used to transfer files by ftp if you or your administrator will install them
i was working on implementing a quicksortyesterday and then i ran it expecting a faster runtime than the mergesort which i had also implemented
i had been taught that quicksortis almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this
previously discussed on so why is quicksortbetter than mergesort
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort
fifos can be built using doubly-linked-list an array vector with a begin and end pointer with circular arrays etc etc.
on arrays quicksortcan be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contains a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great
the kind of commands i d really like to be able to use are wc tar cpio ps kill cat at .
not a pointer ++i is definitely faster as it doesn t involves a copy to a temporary which may or may not be optimized out
socontains is likely a wee bit slower than calling indexof directly but i doubt that it will have any significance for the actual performance
in the while-loops the method next is invoked and i should be incremented every time by 1 next should return i++ and the value of i in the while loops should be incremented by one
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned int type has rank greater or
javascript seems to have found a nice balance between flexibility and security it can trivially interact and alter the pages html css do safe networking has a decent standard library which has things like json xmlhttprequest sih networking dom manipulation and so on
but the mechanics of driving the gui and testing the results could be handled using autoit s built in basic like language or by using it in conjunction with a language like ruby and testunit rubys built-in unit testing framework
i haven t done any nio programming but according to the javadocs sc.write will not write the entire bytebuffer if the socketchannel is in non-blocking mode as yours is and the socket s output buffer is full
when to choose checked and unchecked-exception
i m in the process of looking for a dedicated-server to host my soon to be released web apps
in a more complex case it may still make sense to sort by one of the halves of the pair if the pattern is such that locality for those values is more important if for example these are key-value pairs and you are doing a lot of searches locality for the key is infinitely more important than for the values
i know that the ms validation application block can be used with asp.net-mvc but i m not sure if i should
ruby the language is better than php
also scripting languages such as php python or perl would allow you to do something like this easily and possibly give you much greater flexibility than a shell script
but even in the first i have difficulties i can send a json string but it will always be surrounded with xml information
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter
in other words it is much easier to write a upper filter-drivers that sits above the file system drivers than playing with the actual drivers that handles physical access to the hard disk
the standard windows-like os x gnome kde etc set of window management metaphors really break down when you have more than one window you want to see at the same time
personally in the current incarnations i would always choose asp.net-mvc over webforms
use software with incompatible licensing so the product cannot be released gpl is good for this for anything that actually gets distributed
what are the steps that are easy to express in english but require say more than 10 line in c c++
the gpu is just like the cpu except it s less general purpose and more a data paralleled processor
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim
the following type designates an unsigned int type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type then converted back to pointer to void and the result will compare equal to the original pointer
usually sizeof void depends on memory bus width although not necessarily - pre-risc as 400 had 48-bit address bus but 64bit pointers and int usually is as big as cpu s general-purpose register there are also exceptions - sgi c used 32-bit ints on 64bit mips
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc
the question is does it make any sense to spawn more concurrent threads than processor there are in a system or it is a waste
edit could a stored procedure be more efficient than any set based query in that case
textboxes dropdowns checkbox radiobuttons listbox can be accessed by request collection
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar
the parentheses don t to anything here as the operators has higher precedence than bitwise-xor
this should require only 16 bytes to be stored as binary values instead of hex digits
but notice that after evaluation this expression 100 million times the total difference is still less than 1 second
the same technique can be used for styling cell
i run firefox on vista xp and a macbook pro regularly and aside from taking a while longer than safari or chrome to start up it s fine and seems to use less ram than either
ironpython python for .net is faster than regular python cpython on the same machine
now the entire function reading from right to left is a pipeline thatfilterings only alpha or separator characters splits it into words breaks it intogroupingsfilterings thosegroupings with more than 1 element and then reduces the remaininggroupings to the first element of each
for sql-server is it better to use an uniqueidentifier guid or a bigint for an identity-column
examples of these are scite which has a built in lua interpreter nedit which has a homebrew macro language of its own or gedit which is substantially written in python which can also be used for scripting it and has a plugin api
i understand xml is better suited for this but i read that json is faster and preferred
json is a perfectly valid way of storing structured data and simpler and more concise than xml
nor does it contains any save functionality as ms seem to have forgotten to include a save button with the document viewer
this is basic stuff but i m somewhat unfamiliar with vba and the word access object models
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it display correctly in the viewer as landscape
it ll still contains the full text matched in element 0 in general you can have more than one set of these parentheses
it won t work on anything lower than windows-xp though
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit
it includes gui elements is much smaller than most full-blown engines like irrlicht or ogre optionally makes use of 3d hardware acceleration and has been tested by popcap on millions on computers
when your application is not cocoa but carbon plain-c you may have to directly process the apple event i m not familiar with carbon but in cocoa apple already catches the most important apple events for you and converts them into delegate calls or notifications your application can listen to
unless you are doing a full integration unit test there usually is no need for large unit tests like say more than 100 line
the xaml designer built into visual studio 2008 is junk expression-blend is better but it is very designer oriented
filemaker is certainly cheaper than some enterprise solutions in licensing costs
the development life-cycle is typically orders of magnitude lower than other enterprise platforms whatever the licensing costs of those platforms
i think php would easily be able to cope with such a project like leon said its support for multimedia might not be quite as good as perl but for the rest of the stuff it should definitely be good
if you choose adplus you then load the dump in windbg
it has to be either fully manageable with text-editor or already have rock solid tools for editing and managing on these platforms
going further up the reasoning you should not rely on receiving a mouseup after you processed mousedown user may have moved the mouse and released the button somewhere else think drag n drop in which case you don t receive the mouseup event.
further values will be created bei loops and written into the arrays
borrowing from the code in the other question and assuming that all your user controls can be made to inherited from the same base-class you could do this
this says that all requests for http uris over tcp-ip should be addressed to tcp port 80 on the hostname www.example.com
it says that access to protected members can be made via this or any object of the same type as the class thatcontains the method
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction
this account is far more limited than local system or even administration but still has the right to access the network as the machine see caveat above
on 32-bit architecture only properly aligned 32-bit or less data types should be considered atomicity
if you move to delphi 2007 msbuild has a bigger advantage over nant since the delphi projects are in the msbuild format
i am prototyping a ajax based web application running up against asp.net where i need to have general authentication to different parts of the site and also have to make sure that various web methods web services can t be called by unauthorized users from a rouge html page for example
you can even use dmax in the default-value of the textboxes which means that the number will be suggested every time you create a new record if the record is created the suggested number becomes an actual number
you d be better off using something like pyglet pygame cocos2d - if you are doing something more elaborate than this and will need visuals or ncurses if you are going to work with the terminal
one that immediately springs to mind is that whilst what i have done is all well and good for my thread it will not apply from what i understand from reading on here and around to any threads which are created either by my app unless i set the currentuiculture on those too or worse by any components which i use which may create their own threads
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long
you might also consider partitioning your table according to the id field especially if older records with lower id value become less relevant over time
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries
commit transaction they are not guaranteed to be atomicity so you could theoretically get more than one process who think the lock is off and proceed
i get warnings if i compare signed with unsigned int and much much more
xmlhttp-request must be initiated by external service
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo
since you won t be needing hexidecimal values with a length of more than 2 hex characters for each color you won t be needing a fancy algorithm to convert decimal to hexidecimal and back
in my experience having been on both sides of this issue this is usually more about economics than it is about programming process or project-management
you can use them similar to crystal report and they can be setup to export to pdf excel word etc
there are several things that need to be done to get upgrade to work with msi s if you want to automatically remove the previous versioning
it can be extended to dynamic report and that you can provide a quote if he would like to know the specifics
here s a blog-post of mine that gives more details on this simple usage of jaxb it also mentiones a more classy jaxb-based approach -- in case you need better control over your xml schema to guarantee backwards-compatibility
this is more of a style issue but if you have a boolean variables don t compare it for equality with yes or no it just makes the code harder to understand
scite s api though does not seem as extensive as komodo edit s api
see this related question is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder
i have a set of options some orthogonal can be combined in any combination some exclusive only one from the set is allowed and need to pick a set of enum values so that they can be combined with bit-wise or and extracted with bit-wise and
.when i think of synchronous i think of steps having to be followed in order
your original example of range b11 iv11 actually indicates the union of cell b11 and iv11 and thus would only have affected two cell
windows powershell is now included as part of windows-server 2008 and can be evaluated in windows-server 2008 beta 3
the sql generated see exception is working and returns what i want strictly speaking it should have been an inner-join
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade
can a triggers be used on insert and update to do a round on the column
i didn t know that the old notepad was utf-8 compatible i didn t take the time to check but anyway notepad++ is better for our purposes because of its color highlighting
a string of text will be treated just like a single line of input from a file the string must be enclosed in double-quotes or single-quotes with usebackq
recently i ve had a quite good experience with django wich in order to update create and filter the table you just need to call .save .create field1 field field2 213 and .filter filterfield value
seeing as javax.persistence already defines annotations that can be used for mapping properties to a database i d suggest instead that you let the users make pojos for their model objects with annotated properties
well haskell is only 1.8 times slower than gcc s c++ which is faster than gcc s c implementation for typical benchmark tasks
and how is to say xml wont be replaced by json which will then be replaced by something else
getting the functional style can be done in python easily enough although you wouldn t get the internal dispatching features of erlang for free
and i find the code much much more readable than bitwise-operators
edit to answer the comment that volatile guarantees the atomicity of the read write operation that s well true in a way because the volatile keyword cannot be applied to fields that are larger than 32-bit in effect making the field single-cpu-instruction read writeable on both 32 and 64bit cpu s
it s much less comprehensive than cygwin but is mature and stable and has a good cross-section of the basic unix commands sed etc. it will play nicely with windows command files you can do piping and redirection and there is a port of zsh with it so it will also run shell scripts although zsh is not totally compatible with bash
eclipse provides ftp and ssh services and i ve been familiar with the interface for longer than any other ide and that is why i use it
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs
you d want to use checkbox in the case where you can have more than one value selected or only care to get the value when selected
if you re just experimenting and want it to work in xcode choose project edit active executable and there s a panel there in which you can set the initial working directory to the project directory the executable s parent directory or any arbitrary directory
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better
oracle documentation the relational model permits the value of foreign key to match either the referenced primary or unique key-value or be null
i dont think there is a documented way to be passed a shell item id on the cmd-line - explorer does it to itself but there are marshaling considerations as shell item ids are pointers to binary data structures that are only valid in a single process
one of the things i had to do to make things work was to make sure the application-pool for the asp site was using the same identity as the anonymous user by default it uses system user or something like that
a stored procedure could be used to increment the number and return it but they cannot be set as a default-value on a column
quality opengl driver both windows linux nvidia tends to care more than ati about it
i prefer awk ruby shell scripting but both python and perl is acceptable without heavy uses of external libraries as i ve got no right to install them
do you believe that unit testing and test driven development must be done under any set of circumstances or should there be some exceptions
i once heard somebody say that if he writes more than 10 line of code without tests then he begins to be unsure whether the code he just wrote will work right
maven may be the choice for you as it is java centric and more high level than ant
cloning an object is in general more expensive than copying a struct as it involves allocating the memory running the constructor and deallocating garbage collection when done with it
allowing users to choose javascript libraries prototype jquery dojo extjs etc.
but it was to prepare any current ftp script to be run via sftp when needed
i recommend xml because that is easy to parse from as3 but json and plain text should work as well
putting commas at the beginning of the new line makes it easier to build dynamic queries
if you re adding objects to a displayobject i would recommend removing listener when the event.removed_from_stage event is fired and adding them when it is added to stage
it might have been where you further subclassing fire but fail to create a virtual destructor see below
flexible allow reasonably precise control over positioning padding and or margins and styling
category are a nice way to add functionality while at the same time conforming to an object oriented principle to prefer composition over inheritance
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc
while i prefer jquery for almost everything i know some people whio swear by dojo or extjs

if you expect it to be converted into sql you ll need to decorate your gig class with appropriate linq-to-sql attributes or configure your data context some other way
if you re familiar with how a href rel nofollow noreferrer expect a allows passthrough to interactive subprocess with specific key sequences from the user or strings received from the child process triggering matches and sending control back to your program the same thing can be done from python with a href rel nofollow noreferrer pexpect a
although that class has names and values properties that make it attractive as a class for working with key-value pairs it won t be completely compatible with java s property files
the commonly cited wisdom is that bsd is more useful for a server os and linux is more useful for a desktop os
also i find the bsd manpage to be more comprehensive and contain more examples than gnu manpage since gnu tends to prefer info pages which i despise for examples
however this doesn t provide any consideration for how new line and multiple spaces will be interpretted markup whitespace
if you were using a uinavigationcontroller as the container then viewwillappear viewdidappear would be called whenever you push pop a new viewcontroller
there are certain parts of silverlight that are not really compatible with wpf for example all of the html dom bridge stuff would not make any sense in a wpf application so it is not there
an instance of this class should be created for each networkstream and the process function should be called whenever new data is received in the callback methods for beginread before you call the next beginread i would imagine
unlike others it does not bring a ioc mechanism of its own but rather thinks of ioc as a service that can be provided by spring framework guice etc
the larger the price of the product and the longer it takes you to make it really work the less chance they will actually buy .when you have it ready
if your get requests are idempotent they can be cached in squid or some other reverse proxy-server
it would also be possible to do this relative to the stack pointer but since this moves around during evaluation of expression it is more difficult to keep track of
vs.net this project has gone through all four versions of vs.net must have added the properties app.manifest file i see in solution explorer but this file does not contains the trustinfo elements i would have expected to disable virtualization
sealed methods you might have liked to extend
for people that would require the authentication functionality of the site they would require to login and be redirected to root login.aspx
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648
i d like to get rid of the x is never assigned to and will always have its default-value 0 warnings so i can more easily pick out the other warnings
it should only be used to show hide the submenu
you can see what libraries need to be compiled by boost jam and what libraries don t by looking at this page - if a library does not need a lib file and therefore does not require you to mess with boost jam first it will say build link header-only whereas if a library does require you to precompile a lib file it will say build link automatic linking
scene is protected meaning it can be accessed from any class that derives from the class it resides in which in this case is screen however you haven t declared sceneitem which is the type of scene to be public
i have added this transport-guarantee tag in the web.xml meaning that certain pages can only be accessed by http
granted it still technically violates some security issues because the web server can contact the app server but having the app server exposed through a single ports to a specific ip in the dmz is better than having it exposed to the internet
which of those is preferred depends in large part on whether you are dealing with chemistry in which case the symbol is the hands-down winner or sub- nuclear physics in which case the atomicity number is probably more important
incidentally did you know that the as yet unisolated elements with atomicity numbers beyond 100 have 3-character abbreviations
the new features should be factored into this code base or built on top of this code base with as little change needed in the execution environment of this application as possible
add a timestamp field and do not throw an error if the timestamps are closer than a defined value maybe the process didn t have time to update the cache
what is a good way to identify in advance a project that would be better served by a procedural-programming approach
my biggest sql-server mistake was assuming it was as capable as oracle when it came to concurrency
even with no text inside a container element say for a bottom cap on a stretchable container ie6 will still size theheight of the box no smaller than the font-size even with an explicitheight set.
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does
my ta implied cygwin s gcc is a less reliable compiler -allowing for much sloppier code to run- than the one found under gnu linux
would the conclusion that cygwin s gcc is just as good as gnu linux and it s the underlying operating systems sheer luck that my buggy program runs under one and not the other be pretty much correct
you ll have to set the locale first with setlocale to utf-8 so it chooses this implementation of multibyte support
the com objects are all 32-bit the os is 64bit thus my .net application needs to be targetted to 32-bit
in their raw forms asp.net-mvc is likely faster than webforms but years and years of tools and experience have produced a number of techniques for building fast webforms applications
is not easily distributable with windows-xp - this is a shame and maybe one of its biggest failures
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly
i created a build task that picks out todo line from my code files and generates a report i include in team city
however there are available api for the entire javascript machine for c++ but no python bindings and i don t see any reason why these can t be bound for python
i have a function in my controllers that has grown longer than i d prefer and i d like to refactor it to call a few discrete functions to make it easier to manage
on a usercontrol in asp.net webforms why do the controls within the usercontrol textbox dropdownlist etc. have to be declared as protected in the code-behind
i am not familiar with glassfish but you could do this in websphere or weblogic using a commonj workmanager
because iasyncresult does not implement idisposable another place must be chosen to free the resources
this method will tend to perform worse than the inner-join with a group by method given by mr
you are better off having a high-quality jpg or png in your library then right-click it and select properties
the string will be interpreted by bash and then interpreted by tcsh
i would have made the jquery do a .post as a security measure as guy suggested but jquery would give an error rather than .posting
if they are in need on enhanced features in the browser deployment model i would generally recommend using wpf via xbap or writing a silverlight application
the controllers now becomes bound more closely to the view
with the bin obj directories gone you don t need to exclude all exes xml files etc - which is handy as it means you still get to put in the ones you want you might have sample xml files etc.
i have recently had some problems that i think might be helped by debugging my asp.net-mvc application in iis instead of with the default asp.net development server
sending password in plain text over http is clearly insecure but this example could be extended to add more security for instance running on https or sending hash of password + one-time guid + timestamp
even if that packets gets acked right away tcp cannot send any new data because cwnd is still less than the flightsize
our c# vc++ brethren choose unchecked-exception
powershell will be installed by default on windows-server 08 r2 ws08r2 and windows 7 according to ms
have commented out line in order to test.try to make it work
while the suggestion that you could simply use is true i simply prefer reading this kind of if statement from left to right if this value is equal to any of these instead of if these values contains this value
what you are looking for is probably more along the line of a user-defined function that can be used in sql just like any other built in function
if you use tdd it is alot easier to test a controllers than it is to request alot of different websites
currently - if they are wider than the window - they are broken into two line
column a a8 then the data of cells a8 to f8 should be copied to cells c18 to h18 of the targetsheet and cell j8 of the sourcesheet should be copied to cell b18 of the targetsheet
if cell b18 to h18 of the targetsheet are occupied then the data should be copied one row underneath
because oop designing is somehow slower so on the short term development is maybe faster with procedural-programming
for desktop-applications i recommend designing interfaces jennifer tidwell and for web-applications i recommend designing web interfaces principles and patterns for rich interactions bill scott theresa neil
i d recommend nginx for the webserver
i recommend vmware or a similar virtualization product
i want to be able to produce a single msi from vs08 which can be used to install demo staging and production versioning of the same app on the same website in the same iis
two using blocks one for the command one for the adaptor would be better imo than explicit try finally blocks
there s a simple iterator protocol that can be applied to any kind of object to make the for-loops work on it
trying to figure out what vmware products i was allowed to use and how i was allowed to use them would have taken more time than getting everything set up in virtualbox did
on the other hand asp.net-mvc allows you to reuse some of this logic while making your application much more maintainable and with the appropriate architectural pattern your application can be developed and refactored much quicker than any webforms project
in these respects it matches asp.net-mvc a lot closer than webforms
i would prefer not to have to upload the entire file to the webserver as i expect some rather large files to be used in this
localization it s easier to translation text than images
i m not familiar with kernel driver development so i want to know if there are other easy ways to add a virtual driver like cd emulation in windows explorer
technically a native-code emulator can be written in managed-code but it s not running on bare hardware
pure python would be fine since it can be compiled to java with jythonc
i would have expected both line to give an error since both controls are within the same repeater and should therefore not be directly accessible outside the repeater since there is no one unique instance
it s pointless to test your private and protected methods since those will be consumed by public methods that you should test in your subclasses
i have asked my superiors about re-writing the user-interface in c# but i ve been told that allook-and-feeluture development efforts are to be done in java spring
now that you know the novel you have to write a summary with no more than 50 line
granted it s not required that lisp code be formatted this way but it s a fairly standards convention that people use and can rely on
that dtss had a rudimentary ide which was nothing more than an interactive cmd-line
in the general case use a varchar column and format all numbers to five or more digits with leading zero spaces right aligned
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple
you use a command line tool called xsd.exe to turn an xml sample into an xsd schema file tip make sure your nodelist has more than one node in the sample and then use it again on the schema to turn that into a c# class file you can load into your project and easily use with the system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer class
depending on the organization this can be called the suffix-tree or suffix-array
from a randomselectedion of cards i need the algorithm to pick out which cards would get me the highest number of sets
i need a regex that looks for and grabs either 1 the body of the tag or 2 the contents of the srcattribute
i would like to call this tool as part of our automated build-process and report back when someone checks in new code with less than x code-coverage
a new purchase order is created and it needs to be approved the first buiness rule a requires 2 higher levels of authentication before performing business rule b
but i do not recommend doing this since what if the value of var changes then you can no longer print out the 3rd line in this code
this is usually only encountered when the file needs to be locked in order to write to it but i m pretty sure it will mark any read only file with the grey checkmark not just ones that have svn needs-lock set on it
its simpler if you use jquery otherwise you will have to start from document body get its children parse their ids select matching elements and continue down the tree
spring is more all-encompassing than wicket
i find c# s attributes python sproperties too a really nice idea and i guess their direct ancestor might have come from java s annotations but i m curious as to where this concept originally came from anyone has any clues
this also makes it easier to change if for whatever reason you change your mind and want to standardize timezones or something along those line
i recommend using git or any other version-control system you might like
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups
java python and perl seem to have achieved this relatively well and i m sure microsoft has the brainpower to do the same for .net
the best paper on this is hammer and macleods ruritanian oil tankers paper which describes a semantic datamodel notation imaginatively called sdm
first and foremost all non-final instances variables must be declared private if you want to retain control
nokia sony and motorola don t support their old symbian phones any more
note that this expression does not attempt to match brackets
if it failed to read any integer in the first place then the fail or bad bit will have been set
if you need to match matching nested brackets then you need something more than regular expression
this is more generic approach compared to using separeate sql query for calculating subtotals which imposes liability of syncronising where-clauses on both queries
if instead the properties is declared with the copy attributes then the value will instead be copied every time you assign to it and you will become an owner of the new object
instanceof is less safe than using typeof because it will fail when passing objects between frame boundaries
here i m referring to pieces of wisdom like it s harder to read longer line that s why newspapers use columns -- but then width should be given using em and ex
as you can see reflection is more than just runtime self-inspection
i truly want to understand if sql-server between is less functional than the oracle between
of course if you want to avoid visiting every nodes in your tree when you count and processing time is worth more to you than memory you can cheat by creating your counts as you build your tree
but returning an array ref can be handy if you re going to pick out individual elements
maybe i don t understand your question but your above example should work just fine with asp.net-mvc rc
it s best to get the second file from the sqlite website and extract it to the ruby bin directory as you shouldn t manually put dll s into the windows or windows system directories any more
the preference for sed is only because i assume it must be faster than a python or perl script
i prefer bash for interactive shell however
columns 73-80 would be given a sequence numbers and there were machines that would sort punch card decks into sequence numbers order
i recommend common-lisp
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost
as i have explained in this other clearcase so question you could also use the cal interface com object but i have always found cleartool the basic cli -- cmd-line interface -- more reliable especially when things go wrong the error message is much more precise
this provides a more accurate representation of the atomicity clock s time than using a web-service over http
and then you can move on to boost which is more or less the second standard-library these days
structs can be represented as tuples allowing iteration over their fields
there is not really a best practice personally if i would choose between json and xml i would use json
we generally prefer xml because it has some advantages over json like
xml can be validated while json has no validator
where a dynamic language is more appropriate use ironruby or ironpython
other classes can still subclassing derived and override the apply method but your implementation class is no longer one of these classes
if you want to do a data munging job you might be better off with a scripting language like perl or python
using i as a loops counter is more common than ncount or similar especially for arrays indexes
though i love ruby and rails and would not part with them for web development or perhaps for a domain specific language i prefer heavy data lifting of the type you describe be performed in java or perhaps python or even c++
i would want to basically create a normal win32 dll with normal functions but these functions would be coded in python instead of c++
ruby s object model is closer to that of objective-c than is python so i suggest also learning ruby but not until you have your objective-c skills down solidly
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match
but in my opinion it s better and easier to use json instead of xml it s more easier to work with it last line of get function
typical business application with lots of controls their behavior rules with enabling disabling them in response to the events fired by other controls would be a lot more complicated task with asp.net-mvc while with webforms you can do it during a coffee-pause
at the time i haven t decided if the application will be a smart client or an asp.net application but one part of it is more than likely going to be done with asp.net-mvc
so right at this moment linq2sql is great and you can get up and running with it quite quickly without necessarily having to dive into the inner workings of it expression trees etc. but for the future i d recommend entity-framework nhibernate as i believe these two orm s will be the ones in majority use over the next few years by most .net dev teams
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start
i still cannot recommend it for writing java -- eclipse netbeans intellij are so much better than any mere text-editor for that -- but for configuration file editing c coding scripting emacs provides everything you might want and more
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine
1 in this question emacs could be replaced with vim or any other cross-platform editor
actually i think some 8bit controllers will have a longer lifetime than their 16-bit counterparts
pros and cons ruby is a little cleaner language-wise than python
this works for finding the distance from each endpoint to the other line segment constraining the calculated parameter u to be no less than 0 for a line segment or ray and to be no more than 1 for a line segment but it doesn t handle the possiblity that an interior point on one line segment is closer than either endpoint because they actually intersect thus the extra checked about intersection is required
maybe i want my super large struct to be passed by value so that i can do something in the copy-constructor
if you already have a solid understand of the sql-server database engine then i would look to develop this level of understanding with mysqlstarting off by looking at the different database drivers that can be used to drive the mysqlengine such as inodb and myisam etc
this is purely a coding standards question but for what it s worth i always explicitly mark private-members as private
if you put styles in external css file and set a caching expiry of say 1 month then during this time all users will have very low start delays because only the content that has changed will be downloaded the styles will be reused from your browser caching
this way your filter will not even be tied to asp.net-mvc and your attribute is merely a piece of metadata - the way it is actually supposed to be
i d like to slice the nurbs surface with a slicing-plane thats on-axis not as advanced as 3dsmax
outer join usually perform slower than inner-join
you can use a while-loops which will likely be faster than a logarithm because this uses integer arithmetic only
i m more familiar with silverlight than the full wpf
as long as the prime is greater than the numbers of values in the list then you create a sequence which runs through all of the numberss 0...n where n is the numbers of values - 1 but in a pseudorandom order
i would first try to make sure that all the methods are relatively small not more than 50 line
it looks like this is another case of backwards-compatibility wisely nobody wanted to risk breaking something as fundamental as let
i think this isn t quite what you are after however i m guessing you want to find the line of code which makes st7 inf for this you will need to place such break points on every line with a condition st7 inf it will then be easier to pick out where the change is being made
either will work though the copy-constructor is technically more efficient though the copy assignment operator is often optimized to do the same thing
fossil may be used like svn or a dvcs
wxcocoadialog is a multi-platform port of the cocoadialog application for os x that allows the use of common gui controls such as file selectors text input progress-bars yes no confirmations and more with a command-line application
unordered map tr1 is similar to map except it supports better iterator
this bug report seens to suggest that my issue can be resolved by export to a file writen in binary mode
gets the opportunity to be cached near affinity cpu
xml as arguments and return-values have uses in a few specific cases with structured data but in general a flat tds stream grids is far more efficient
you can do the latter without bytecode weaving look at dynamic proxies for arbitrary runtime implementations of an interface and if you re doing the former i don t see how having a class and mechanically calling the getfoo method through reflection is better than just calling resultset.getstring foo - it will be slower more clunky and less type-safe
there are already .net ports to unix linux and there is no reason that ms access can t be emulated there either
3 i m not familiar with cakephp but adding a process_request middleware is definitely a good django way of preprocessing each request
the actual number of cell updated in model update is significantly less though - perhaps only a few hundred
this causes the page which relies upon the session var to select either asp session id at random from the two that have been created - one with the session var set and one without
we have a web service that we will be hosting on a public web server and it will be contacted by web-services hosted on webserver within the walls of a hospital
the object you pass to the constructor or set can be implemented with factory
edit return array of key not new array with key-value
i would also recommend this for any other varchar 1 fields you are representing in linq-to-sql if the field is nullable as you cannot have a null char
as i request less rows the line blur more
i don t know what the overhead is for a try catch but i suspect it s far greater than evaluation a boolean expression
for all other controls just use normal code expressions inside a data-binding expression - it s much faster and more intuitive than eval which relies on runtime reflection
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints
it understands the c and c++ syntaxes among others and can be searched for variables and functions using cmd-line tools emacs and vi among others
on the other hand i would choose msbuild as while the tasks are very procedural it gives you the flexibility to extend this build-process later on to handle more complex tasks
the conditionalattribute that is applied to the trace and debugging class methods causes all calls to the methods to be removed if trace or debugging are #undef d including the expensive parameter evaluation
aspects oriented programming is so much more than just logging reporting et cetera as you will see if you have a look at postsharp s web site
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill
it helps that .net generics cope with primitive-types better than java does.
php5 is pretty good with backwards-compatibility and you should not run php4 on any publicly facing webserver if security is even a little bit important to you
i don t literally think that you should have heard of them but i do believe they re an interesting example of what kind of complexity you can achieve with bit tricks --- namely o log log n exponentially better than binary-tree
memory allocation every pointer new ed should be deleted malloc free should not be mixed with new delete when to use delete instead of delete why the c functions are still useful expand realloc
the redirect they will see is quite similar to experiences that they are more familiar with like credit card or paypal authentication so should be easy to explain in these terms
php is more specialized you hardly do anything else than web apps with it so if you wish to expand your knowledge with more practical languages i would suggest python and for web apps boosted with django
python is quite general purpose and useful language to anyone s toolbox - and if needed it can be combined with java using jython
since you re already familiar with java and probably spring i would recommend grails
use calllater or an flexevent.creation_complete event-listener -- this is less reliable but it is definitely not a hack
i m working with netbeans and i m not very good with ant and my deadlines don t give me time to figure it out so i made a little shell script that cp s all my files into the exploded.war directories
i recommend entity framework for your dal repository
i also think yaml is easier to read and work with in a text-editor but that is really kind of subjective and it wouldn t really matter if this is not a normal usage scenario
also for learning common-lisp you d better start with practical common-lisp as an excellent and free book
heaps a tree where the parent of a nodes always maintains some relation to the children of the nodes for instance the parent of a nodes is always greater than each of it s children max-heap
however on submission the form i get a error 500 no getter method for property. when i add the following to my form object i no longer get that error
apparently oracle installers for 32bit and 64bit don t recognize each other so if you first install 32bit version and then install 64bit version the 64 bit version will be installed by default to the same directory as 32-bit version
the team went with groovy because it was somewhat more familiar-seeming than jruby but offered more flexibility than java
i would have designed this differently making public bool persistchanges call a virtual method that is overridden in each subclassing
this matches any correctly parenthesisedsubstringing as long as it begins and ends-with parentheses
this is why most video games continue to be written in c++ and inline-assembly
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost
in a merge or heap sort indeed when the sort is completed you will have compared every duplicates pair unless both elements were already in their final positions which is unlikely
but luckily many javascript libraries came out with new cool controls to be plugged into asp.net-mvc
for windows i would recommend notepad++ or programmers notepad
you might be able to convince your supervisor that what you really need is one wiki using multiple category as it sounds like that is more what he actually wants
the backend written is using linq-to-sql but can be adapted with linq to nhibernate
this is also reflected in the language the range-based for-loops in c++0x next c++ version released very soon will be based on free function calls
i admit i ve not really given this problem much attention except to compare openlayers to google-maps after i had already chosen google
you don t just have to pick between common-lisp and scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common-lisp
since it s an update to the model it s easier to go through the model s controllers
i use oprofile to try to find hot spots in optimized code i find that it often works a little better than gprof and it can do things like look for data and instruction cache misses
update i ve found that perf works way better than oprofile
it should be noted that clearfix can get a little sticky with ie.
to maintain the tree as a heap you need to ensure that each nodes is smaller than or equal to its children
would really prefer sql-server as the backend - or a webservice interface if it has to be mysql
in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents
but returning an array ref can be handy if you re going to pick out individual elements
in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents
using git for your own locale revision control for the same kind of things you would have used rcs is i would argue easier than using rcs
in real world applications xaml should only be used for declarative-programming
in this situation the xml document might be viewed as infinite with chunks being processed as the appear long before a final end tag for the root element has been seen
i like common-lisp better than clojure because the syntax is more regular and it s not tied to the horrible imho java apis
that way memory is saved the construction of the square object in app can be delayed to whenever needed or they can be done in the constructor of app default or otherwise
eclipse is far better than kdevelop but eclipse do not have support for developing kde application
note that you can lose data which you put on the local disk if an instance goes down - if you re running a database you should use ebs which is very easy to set up and gets you persistent fast storage which can be attached to any ec2 instance
step 3 above can be achieved if line contain pointers to existing points
the rewrite rule change is probably best but you may find rel tag is quicker
then of course you ll have to select max id from union of these two tables
this check will be limited to the time of login as the authentication ticket will be stored either in session or as a cookie on the user s machine
it took enormous time as bad as binary-search-tree skewed
this question is older and i just started recently with asp.net-mvc when the rc was already out but for those who find this question later like me this might be interesting
i have a legacy cvs repository which shall be migrated to perforce
an object can be treated like a map or associative arrays with strings for keys - i believe that s what you want to do
i am developing a number of forms which should only be accessed via http
as a consequence any prerequisites must be installed by a separate bootstrapper by the way the installation is no longer transactional - the prerequisites won t get uninstaller if your msi installation fails
the differences here with optparse and your spec is that now you can have command line like
trim leading zero then if it s longer than 10 digits it s too long
grails 1.1 has a newer version of spring s web-flow which solved a lot of these problems
identify modified rows by using a datetime timestamp column or by comparing all field value
while i m not certain if the library would work on wince or whether it directly provides what your looking for it may serve as a framework for any packets analysis that would need to be done in order to facilitate bandwidth use measurement
so while i m not expecting something the size of scriptaculous it s certainly more than 6 line of code
if you have any dynamic or text fields with embedded-fonts be careful you are embedding only the subset of characters you need if you are using bitmaps make sure you are using appropriate compression lossless is actually better for computery images lots of solid colors or simple gradients
this work folder as its name sayscontains classes used for work sometimes access to some of these files can be blocked for any reason
i could have used sieve-of-eratosthenes but you said
the only legal way is going through their javascript-api which as you found out is harder to do in cocoa than to simply send an http-request
it should be pointed out that split is a questionable approach for parsing csv files in case you come across comma in the file eg
application security is more demandind when it comes to access control authentication
you can t compare this with learning processor or assembly language first
there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width orheight of the destination image respectively
share of ownership can be implemented by having a copy-constructor
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysqlto support them
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql
lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there and its not so much slower than c++ for some sort of programs on par when doing pidgits 1 1 however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c++
lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there and its not so much slower than c++ for some sort of programs on par when doing pidgits 1 1 however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c++
however they can be used with private-members
asp.net-mvc is harder to code initially but is so much easier to develop than webforms
the flip side of this is that you can t use all of the handy out of the box controls that you get with asp.net webforms and you ll probably end up doing more client side javascript development so the initial development budget would probably need to be greater if you choose asp.net-mvc over webforms but you would have a superior solution for the long term
for windows i ve used dev-c++ in the past but nowadays microsoft visual-c++ seems a better solution
as can be seen the request never reaches my controllers code
one problem i have is you re showing us the submission form but none of the controllers code that s more than likely where the break is
my feeling is that this is possible with lgpl license but is it also possible with gpl license
i m not familiar with php enough to know its regex features but given your choices i would go for python
i found maven to be a horrible tool so build everything with ant
for accessibility purposes i need to make the scrollbars for all scrollable controls lists list views wider and the scrollbar arrows bigger
as suggested by tomalak this can be used to detect if the script was started from the cmd-prompt or by double clicking in explorer
profiling s trace files or trace tables by themselves won t say here s what you need to fix in order to avoid this error any more than a dump file will tell you here s the bad line of code - you ll still need an experienced dba to interpret the results
there are several different algorithms for comparison so if the default doesn t work for you try syntax aware or some of the other algorithms now i am using versioning 8 and haven t upgrade to versioning 10 so ymmv but i doubt that the xml diff has gotten worse
for your predicament you might be better off with a scripting language that others could get behind perl like you mentioned or others like ruby or python
sql-server express does not require licensing but has a smaller set of features
just treat your point selectedion or rectangle selectedion if you draw a bounding box to selected multiple items as another rectangle to be compared as overlapping to the others
depending on the threading model if you leave yourself as a mouselistener then you will still be notified if mouse events occur
another thought if you re going to use the xargs formulation offered by other posters cut might well be more efficient than awk
i ve heard that clisp is easier to install and is more portable than sbcl which has lots of processor-specific optimizations but if you re using linux they re both easy enough to fetch from the package manager
if you do not specify the network library in the connection string a connection to the database will be established using tcp-ip by default
right-click adaptor and choose add query select new select update sql statement then enter
and renderaction is planned to be included in asp.net-mvc version 2
to explain more by click my button i want to simulate the effect of a mouse click on a datagridview
how do i encapsulate the saving of more than one entity in a transactional manner using the repository pattern
i don t really care what underlying technology will be used nhibernate ef ado.net linq etc. i just want to see what some calling code might look like in this admittedly contrived example of an all or nothing operation
will stored-procedures be faster than plain ado.net insert statements
most routers also expose a universal plug and play interface upnp which can be used for port forwarding and nat traversal
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better
so as you can see the random binary-search-tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists
i should imagine that setting a 1-px all-round margins will make sure that no div is less than a pixel from another
in perl and other languages a conditional ternary operators can be expressed like this
the reason that i prefer log4net to using trace one of targeting - with log4net i can independently instrument different layers of my application data access services business logic etc and different subsystems authentication processing etc and turn on off the logging of each subsystem independently
we have a local 1-click build that is required to be run before checked in an integration build also runs in a separate environment every checked in...
writing queries like this where implicit tuples unpacking is used to work with the result set has typically been more effective for me than trying to worry about matching python variable names to sql column names which i usually only use to drop prefixes and then only if i m working with a subset of the column names such that the prefixes don t help to clarify things anymore and is much better than remembering numerical column ids
dimitrov above you ll have a good beginning at getting some semantics into your system since prolog gives you a very simple way of maintaining a database of knowledge and belief which can be updated through question-answering
it s a term which can be used to describe a variety of things it is commonly used by critics of asp.net webforms where if you are making heavy use of pre-built webcontrols you have little control of the generated html which in many cases appears bloated large and unclean messy etc
or if you have to use double in the order array you need to decide how to round any non-integer value that may be found in order to a int
if possible i would prefer dynamic-linking not static-linking as used above
under building environment such as code blocks you can use those commands in the project settings however i am not familiar with xcode - but worst case you just need to copy the compiler and linker options that the wx-config script lists
first thought was to have installed the main intranet system on company local network and have subsystem for members access on remote web-hosting provider side
if you need to parse text files that are more complex that simple key-value pairs i highly recommend boost spirit
this is also true to some extent even if they get your intial software via http or digitally signed - as most users can easily be persuaded to click ok on almost any security warning they see on that
is there a better way than a web-deployment project to modify the web.config for mvc apps
in term the ui object implements a ui_view interface and registers itself with a view controllers that is situated lower in the object hierarchy
if you choose eclipse-rcp defiantly get this book it is invaluble when just starting out with the framework
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average
i d recommend using something like the ie developer toolbar if you prefer internet-explorer or firebug if you prefer firefox to inspect the html output and find the id of the radio button you want to manipulate in javascript
most code generators aren t very helpful with this so try to just make a single minimal edit to get at what you need from external classes think mvc where the genned code is your view and the code you edit should be in your model and controllers
would be a good choice in terms of simplicity - in this case the actual code would probably take no more than 30-so line
new roms could be added at any time so the method should not assume that it already has a complete set
all the scripts seem to be made for display content in a static width div element
basically if you re after a true object oriented language that encourages beautiful code and the best design practices php is always going to lose out to the likes of ruby python and c#
if you look at pylons you can see their idea of best-of-breed wsgi components and a framework that makes it easier than django to choose your own components like templating engine
template constructor participate in overload resolution with other constructor including copy-constructor and a template constructor may be used to copy an object if it provides a better match than other constructor
as it was pointed out in other answers var keyword is more responsible for scope of a variable than its declaration
like a lot of other questions in that league which is the best approach for this and that which language to choose orm or not it is hard to answer without knowing about the details of the old app the new app the datamodel relational and oo ..
the other way i was thinking of doing this was having a row in the products table correspond to the regular product entity single and then have the related table with other package levels for that product and on the ui which i haven t given any thought to yet as i m trying to architect a proper datamodel do an auto suggest type of deal where if you type acm1234 it will display that along with the bx and ct variants and you can choose the one you want and get the appropriate values populated by it
some of these elements contains a lot of data to be passed as arguments to subreport
since the code in your example has an overlapping part it will be filtered out when the actual line of the polygon are drawn
changes of.war ear descriptors and deployment options can be all specified in rad 7 using.war ear editors setup of ldap has to be done using was administration console
also for textual markup xml s traditional forte like xhtml docbook xml is better
another one is shrinksafe that is part of dojo but may be used stand-alone either in a build script cmd-line or at the website
gets longer than 5 line i extract it to main function
i am now working in ruby php and actionscript the least dynamic of the three instead of languages that i would prefer like java and c#
can you build a faster fundamental datastructure linked-list hashtable set skiplist bloom filter red-black tree etc. on a multicore machine by taking advantage of the fact that you ve got more than one cpu
making it easy and inexpensive to transfer small messages inter-thread communication looks more like function calls with parameters and less than shared memory
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s
question assuming all the target users have excel or openoffice.org or can be told to get a copy has anyone out there tried using a spreadsheet as an input form for a live web application
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow
in summary json which can be thought of a subset of javascript is a lot leaner than xml
json is smaller than corresponding xml
from the comments json is considered faster to process than xml
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net-mvc is
these cas are entities that have a set of cryptographic keys that can be used to sign any certificate often for a fee
imho putting these two function calls on seperate line is much more readable anyway and even if it was possible there would certainly be no performance increase
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson
on the other hand if your program is a shopping-cart it s probably better to simply fail completely rather than potentially send the wrong item or charge the wrong amount of money to the wrong individuals
honestly for vertical centering issues and well any vertical alignment issues with the items aren t fixed height it s easier just to use tables
in some cases p tags should contains other elements such as anchor a image img and other in-line elements because they relate directly to the content of the rest of the paragraph and it makes sense to group them that way or the text of the rest of the paragraph provides a more in-depth description
for mssql 2005+grouping_concat can be implemented as .net custom aggregate
changing a pdf is much more difficult than generating it so you need to use a pdf editor like nitro pdf untested or why not acrobat illustrator indesign
also in a 64bit machine the kernel space may be larger than the 32-bit machine and eating some available memory space that was in the user part of the memory space for 32-bit o s
in this case the protocol would be inherited for pages not handled explicitly and inconsequential pages may be accessed via http
on the other hand if the options themselves differ by only a few words and lose meaning if they are truncated a list of options like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich with carrot sticks and soy milk and peanut butter and boysenberry jelly sandwith with carrot sticks and 2 milk maybe you would be better served by displaying all the options sequentially accompanied by a checkbox or radio button as appropriate
i am trying to use inno-setup to bootstrap a number of prerequisites to my windows installer installation package and am having pretty good luck with this
you need all of your actions to be atomicity so this sort of method is better than one where you try to do more things
this allows much more centralized handling of exceptional conditions than the getter-setter example i gave above
there are examples in php ruby rails python which can be adopted for perl
your initial code with nested-loops is clearer
although it s probably a lot more complicated than this in the standard you can think of it as the compiler knowing about struct cell on the first line of the typedef but not knowing about tcell until the last line - that s how i remember that rule
of any table we are able to generate a checkbox list containing fields of the selected table and allow user to select field s of his choice.on pressing show data button we are able to show the corresponding data in grid view.now my question is how can i am able to display this data in crystal report using asp.net c#
do automated web acceptance tests using watin or selenium - this would still be written in your testing framework of choice mstest nunit etc
as alessandro mentions in the comment there is a javascript active and since mshtmled.dll is related with dom element manipulations may be that javascript does trigger those mshtmled calls
when user selects any item from master table we should set updetails.visible true
on most cpu architecures 32-bit is faster than 64bit all else being equal
the thing i want to do is to create a static method on a superclass so the subclassing can be converted to xml
while there was some consideration the official stance as far as i know is that cpython is not only a python implementation but it s meant as a reference implementation and it won t include stackless functionality because it can t be implemented by jython or ironpython
if you already know php it s a better option than learning ruby first
i recommend you to use a php framework like symphony if you want to use php or rails if you choose ruby
a clr wizard might correct me but i believe those two approaches are functionally identical but you could make an arguments that setting the default-values in the constructor is more explicit and obvious but also a bit messier
if i could get theheight of the rendered content the whole scrollable area i could just set theheight on my frame to match this but i don t see where i would get that information
differences between libraries and platforms are more significant a good xml parser is faster than bad json parser and vice versa
however some simple benchmarking shows this is dramatically slower than the pid_exists function on unix-based platforms linux os x freebsd where we re using kill pid 0 with a 0 signal to determine if a pid exists
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs
we have a rule in our shop that we never ever ever provide deliverables to a customer that were not produced by a fully automated zero or one step build that means that it took no more than 1 mouse click by a human to baseline build package and release the thing. these fully automated one-step builds work by recognizing when a change is made to your source code control system and automatically triggering the build script.
if the radio-button is selected render background-a else background-b or use a sprite
the visual basic 6.0 ide will be supported on windows vista and windows-server 2008 as part of the visual basic 6.0 extended support policy until april 8 2008
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter
moreover a user accessing the internet from behind a pool of proxy or using tor may be kicked out by your system every time a different proxy or exit node with a different ip-address forwards a request
the ++ -- operators may not be guaranteed atomicity but they are good enough
one disadvantage i see is that it adds another layer of code and my understanding is that it has slower performance than using stored-procedures and ado.net
i agree with matthieuf a progress-bar is a better option
javascript doesn t have a type system like c# does that guarantees you that a variable will have certain members if it s created by a certain constructor because javascript is a pretty dynamic languages and anything that an object gets from its constructor can be overwritten at runtime
note that the first two line also simply could be changed to count k
i would recommend building a user defined function that calculates the datedifference in business hours according to your rules
in my opinion debuging linq2sql is much easier than both stored-procedures and ado.net
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int
in fact all the languages which come under .net umbrella can be used with asp.net
about int vs.double may be gpu does faster arithmetic with double then regular cpu but i doubt it does double arithmetic faster then int since int arithmetic is just registers arithmetics
i prefer field access because that way i m not forced to provide getter-setter for each property
you can only use xpaths that return nodes in msxml other xpath functions can only be used in predicates that ultimately result in aselectedion of nodes
i m not familiar with rhino-mocks but i can tell you how to do this with nunit s built-in mock library nunit.mocks
take into consideration that the set is not sorted it is a set after all and this is the given each isinset n operation takes o n as well bringing you to o n 2 for the entire operation if you choose any algorithm for prodding the set at certain places.
in that case i d like to wrap it onto multiple line so find that a regular if conditional is more readable
another way if it s all the same color is to make a background-image in gif that is more and more transparency and set a background-color of your choice
the trgbquad elements describes a single pixel but the bitmap does of course contains more than one pixel
sp_reset_connection seems to be called by sql server connection-pooling to ensure that connections reused from the pool have most of their settings reset
when the command is called the destination folder files are wiped and replaced with the result of the new build assembly file are created as well as some marker files .as my website is getting bigger and bigger i have to transfer to the server all the assemblies in my bin directory and keep in mind which other files i may have modified
java is becoming more popular - many processor have added instructions that pertain primarily to java and similar languages .net
i wouldn t recommend c++ for writing complex windows guis - language library combos like c# or delphi are so much more productive
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc
i ve looked at pystone s code and garbage collection doesn t seem to be turned off but i would expect java s gc to be at least as good as python s.
my question is what is the best way to retrieve data from the model to be displayed in the main layout when the request could be handled by any controllers rendering any view into that layout
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
each shell is basically a command interpreter that understands linux commands gnu unix commands is more correct i suppose...
as the nodess are constructed in reverse topological order you are guaranteed to have constructed the children of a given nodes before constructing the nodes so creating an immutable representation is possible
perhaps the if-statement expression evaluation is slightly more expensive than the simpler try-it-and-fail
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build-process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy
you can set up a directory contains the flv files on your webserver that can only be accessed by php then in your php script you can authenticate the user as usual and simply send a header to the browser telling it to expect an flv then echo the raw flv data
for build we re using hudson and ci much better than nant or msbuild
the advantage of using either vim or emacs as an editor is precisely that it s available on virtually any decently configured unix platform and this includes more esoteric systems as well darwin os x
c# how can you regulate a windows form to only allow to be resized by width and not byheight
i am sure the code is less than 20 line and i am wondering if someone has already written it
instead do something as simple as enumerate services and go through central controllers - activatetask 12
i recommend downloading firebug and experiment with changing the pixel widthheight
both these can be stored as a 4 byte int and if space is really tight can be combined into unix time seconds since the epoch 1 1 1970 as an unsigned int which will be good till around 2106 as
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done
i see that wikipedia states that the 64-bit version of windows xp and windows-vista have a unique environment variable programw6432 so i m guessing that d be empty on 32-bit windows
my logic for this approach without turning this into a when to throw exceptions discussion is simply that the business objects are responsible for checked business rule constraints and throwing an exception that can bubble up and be caught as required
or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter
you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever
sadly on a live system where debugging is set to false the yellow screen of death is quite unhelpful even with stack trace enabled it does not show the line where the error happened which seems obvious since there should be no debugging information
the cell can be edited inline no need to go in a separate view
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell
the host plug-in therefore provides an extension-point that may be called listener and a corresponding interface that may be called ilistener
sharpdevelop naturally focuses more on integration with other free tools like nunit and wix but for editing refactoring and debugging i would say that visual-studio express is still better feature wise
note that in a html document the id attribute must be unique so if you have more than one element needing a specific style you should use a class name
i have a treeview where on selected a node the attributes and values has to be displayed in listbox
in treeview1_afterselect the text parsing code depends on the textual representation for a nodes in the tree view which can be changed at any time and break the entire logic of list display
this strong dependency between the tree view and the list display should be eliminated by bindingnodes in the treeview tonodes of the xml document so that the raw xml data can be used to display text in the list.what should i write here
setting it to true ensures it will appear in the output of your building so makes it easier to deploy to the target environment
but nothing worth doing correctly comes in at less than 1000 line of code
it may run on unix and it will be used for email searching dovecot postfix and maildir
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysqland postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich
as an alternative to java s own shared-memory approach to concurrency you could also look into actor-based concurrency using scala on top of java which provides an easier model for concurrent programming
this was nice since they need not be entered each time but caused a lot of headaches when one of the developers or some other process would connect to a svn repo from that machine using different credentials than what cruisecontrol.net was expecting
if you can get contiguous memory regions with an array or and avoid the potential of a page fault you re much better off with modern processor and main memory caching line
all of this can be done with getter-setter methods but the verbiage is much higher and the usage is much less natural
packaged inside the zip is aselectedion of stuff based on their other interactions some of which may be partially complete from the same page this is all done via ajax and i don t want them to leave the page as they would lose any unsaved changes
in terms of what is a special character well you could decide based on unicode category
often it will recommend you add a covering index with many columns in order to speed up a single query you ve asked to be analysed but this may have adverse effects on your database overall when you look at all queries against that table
if i try the first 2 answers i get an error local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator.
sometimes you might want optional parameters for instance -- then you can have it start with some default-value for those cases where the optional parameter is not explicitly passed easier than having a default-value passed separately in
after this i select nodes in that tree to display the attributes of selected nodes
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int
people working with the kernel are aware of different cpu s architectures multicore issues cache line etc
it reads the whole file in a tree structure that can then be accessed using xpath or by browsing all thenodes
a trick i ve done in the past is that if your datavalue field is going to be a numeric field such as an id you can assign a range validator object to it and check that the value itself is greater than 0
this is not possible it is possible in wpf with but silverlight is more limited
this writes it out to the resx as a blob using an instancedescriptor for the object type s default constructor this loses any property values you might also want to include
if both programs have message loops that are being processed and you are sending an integer you could use a call to sendmessage through the p invoke layer as well but that s only because you are sending data that is equal to or smaller than what sendmessage will allow
i then compare this to the site name in the url itself and if they match i set a variable which is accessible to the rest or of the script not a global variable it s just readable by my controllers which decides if a user can see a particular page if the two site names don t match the user is redirected back to login
for instance you may have found an implementation of the c standard-library without documentation but the c standard has been around long enough that there are hundreds of good reference books available
i want to create something similar to a double linked-list but with arrays that works with lower upper bounds
i generally don t have files with more than 200 line of code and i prefer them if they re under 100
functions bigger than 40 line or so should make you consider how you can break it up
then automate retrieving what you need from those resources using rss feed comes to mind such that they can seamlessly be used offline
instances of which appear in c++ code and can almost be used just like primitive variables data-members
that way you will not be muddling the model with worries about urls or maps and you will not have future worries about having the same function spread out in more than one controllers
most programs regardless of the language paradigm can be broken into atomicity units which take input and provide output
they have two data feed one is more current than the other
i also used versionone a few years ago but i think rally is better
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum
using asynchronous methods is of no use here as the caller would otherwise have to be notified .when the data is ready which requires a push from the webservice to the client which requires the client to stay connected to the webservice as long as the fetch takes anyway
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
but yeah strcpy is as good as strncpy in any situation where you are allocating memory for the destination buffer and have already used strlen to find the length
this is not an issue in linq-to-sql because linq-to-sql does not support automated updates from the database at all
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode
and frankly there are quite few differences between gorm and ar eg in grails you model your domain-objects and gorm will infer the database structure whereas in ar you have your table on the one hand and your object on the other
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode
i don t know your platform but look into connection pooling - there must be a library or utility available either in the base system or as an add-on or supplied with the database drivers that will provide the means to pool several active connections to the database which are ready and raring to be used .when you obtain one from the pool
and just as bad it was equally as difficult for anyone to deploy a building to more than one environment
i find that working on documentation or reading long web pages is easier on the portrait screens
there are some applications where portrait is still better though if you have to show a document in large resolution or if you have some monitor as in network monitor running and want to see more line at once
this is also very useful is far better than having 100+ line on the screen
i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation
none of the studies that reported decreased cost decreased error rates or both with larger routines distinguished among sizes larger than 200 line and you re bound to run into an upper limit of understandability as you pass 200 line of code
can i downgrade the version level of tortoisesvn to match subclipse or upgrade subclipse
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object
also you may use a llvm backend to gcc to compile to lowlevel bytecodes which can then be interpreted in java
starting with php v5.3 you can use ini_set to restrict the open_basedir to a specific folder so that files outside of that folder cannot possibly be read with fopen include fread etc
doing all assignments in repository seems easier but now the distinction between my database and domain-objects is not apparent
that being said short pdf files should be pretty impervious to most compression methods - images should be compressed during rendering and jpeg zip in this case - but if you have a lot of text gzip can help
having said that i m there a significant number of websites that do not set any cookies until you do something that needs to be remembered login adding a product to a shopping cart setting a preference etc
as mentioned in chapter 1 one way in which scala is more object-oriented than java is that classes in scala cannot have static members
it may be a lot of work but if it s an important form users may prefer that over manual text entry orselectedion from a list
i suspect what really needs to happen is that guiregionvertical add guibutton should increment the ref count of the guibutton and then guiregionvertical s destructor should decrement the refcounts of all of its contents though i m not sure how this should be done with swig
once the finalize of the object has been called the object is no longer in the finalize queue so it s just a regular managed object that the gc can remove
memcpy memmove are compiler intrinsics and will usually be inlined to rep movsd or the appropriate sse instructions if your compiler can target that
it s just that python s syntax has been stricter stabler and more well-defined than historical perl
it would be slower for normal access just as concurrenthashmap is slower than hashmap where there is no concurrency
as mentioned by cletus and supported by jon skeet this is more like asking why .net strings were built differently from java in this aspects
enum s also have the ability to be used as bitwise-operators fontstyle.bold | fontstyle.italic would give you bold and italic fonts
if there is an index on the particular column it can observe that the particular value is large or smaller than any value in the index min max values take constant time to extract from indexes
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug
why stringbuilder is better than string.format
please check this is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder to see why.
i heard that .length property of array in javascript engines in fact uses invisible setter and getter to achieve functionality of ecma-s standard that says whenever the length property is changed every property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted
either upgrade the versioning of svn you re using on the command-line i prefer macports or use an older versioning of subversive that uses the 1.4-era working copy layout
this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd
it sounds like you do not want the methods that you have to override because you are implementing serialization to be made public
so if evaluating using sin and cos lookup tables for two coordinate-set pairs distances yields a certain ranking one distance appears greater than the other based on the approximation and the difference s modulus is greater than the threshold above then the approximation is valid
in conclusion although a sloppy implementation of operator delete may required explicit null checked in the client code this is non-standard behaviour and should only be tolerated in legacy support if at all
example a mouse driver accepts continuous input but doesn t lock the system if programmed correctly and a network adaptor is probably more similar to your case
regions can be specified as polygons distance from a point circles distance from a linear feature such as a road all points on one side of a linear feature etc.
also you might want to look at wildcard certificates providing a blanket cert for http .example.com - even usable for virtual hosting should you need more than just this one cert
my current thoughts are that when the data is at rest encryption is an aspects of the repository and the service class using the repository should not be cluttered with this encryption code
if you don t need the old arrays i prefer map
frankly you can continue to use your old libraries as they continue to be kept for backwards-compatibility although microsoft has said that they are going to actually start taking out some of these older functions
i need to be able to pick out individual key-value pairs from the json response either with jquery or plain old javascript
the only exception to this rule that i know of is a web shortcut -- within mobile-safari you can select add to home screen and a shortcut to the bookmarked page will appear on springboard
that s why some programmers like c language even the flexible standard functions printf scanf can be implemented by any competent programmers
if you want to read directlry from the file make use of the java.nio.channels.filechannel class specifically the map method - that will let you use memory mapped i o which will be very fast and use less memory than the copying to arrays
i want it to be certified for windows-vista so it has to crash in a way that causes windows error reporting dialog the one that asks do you want to send report to microsoft
for example it might be deployed with sql-server oracle
when you use linq-to-sql you d be pretty much stuck with sql server as far as i know
i assume that reliability is as good with linq-to-dataset as with linq-to-sql never had problems performance seemed to be good enough never could really profile it though
i m not familiar with awt swing but based on knowledge of other gui frameworks i d say something derived from a say jpanel that draws the video when a repaint request is made or a new frame is available. i would like to be able to process every new frame and loop on x y over all the pixels
x percentage will be added for project-management and technical management risks and overhead
my question is can http-post and get requests be enabled per web service or web method level rather than per application or machine
so in the example below the rows would be considered duplicates if we only sorted on the first field
which you do not want to do as it will double your memory footprint and add an extra iteration over the inevitable iteration that needs to be performed in order to output the data to disk
when it fails the first thing it does is popup a dialog saying the feature you are trying to use is on a cd rom or other removable disk that is not available. the dialog provides a text box to enter a path and a browse button to find it so i provide the path click the open button and get this error error 1706.no valid source could be found for product microsoft .net compact framework 3.5
in your text editor set your tab width to a value larger than any of your fields
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython
jython isn t fully compatible with cpython or whatever you would rather call the original c++ python interpreter but wherever either differs from the language spec is a bug
64bit machines have a bigger word size an yeah bigger usually means better here so that most operations can be carried out faster as for example double precision operations where double usually means 2 32-bit
remember gitolite manages authorization not authentication ssh it can be used without ssh but its natural deployment is through ssh and the forced command mechanism
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython
if you had things that were subclassing of other things in the lookup or you wanted to support multiple inherited you d have to pick out the one that was the first in mro
your best bet is to probably have a sorted dictionary of coin sizes and then loop through them checking if your change is greater than the value add that coin and subtract the value otherwise move along to the next row in the dictionary
the hasownproperty call can be added to this function to refine it a little by only allowing direct properties of window which act as global-variables including the ones you set explicitly and not of any of its prototypes
although one could in such cases recommend having the forward migration automatically save the data or keep it around in the eventuality of rollback as an alternative to outright failure save to yml copy move to a special table etc. you don t have to as the time required to test such an automated procedure could exceed the time required to restore the data manually should the need arise. but even in such cases instead of just failing you can always make the reverse migration conditionally and temporary fail pending some user action test for the existence of some required table that has to be restored manually
in windows x64 for example an application can be run either as a 64bit application having a 64bit mahine word or as a 32-bit application having a 32-bit machine word
you could draw them with tiles so you d be drawing four sprites for each of the big images in this case or you could manually figure out what x y width andheight to use for those sprites
i ve heard that in silverlight 2 this process is more complicated due to the fact that it is required to use a policy server and that could slow down my application not to mention that each string passed through the socket would have to be checked with the policy server
.net remoting is more or less deprecated it has been dissolved into wcf
i would personally choose php or perl for a few reasons
you can try to create your own hash it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable
but the server also had to connect to a device on the network that only understood ascii over tcp-ip
since you re using a dual-core machine i d highly recommend checking out the python-multiprocessing module in python 2.6
or kate which is a fancier text-editor with some extra features session management a builtin terminal panel automatic invocation of make and several plugins including a c c++ symbol viewer
is a psql directive not sql so it won t be understood by dbi or by the postgresql-server at the other end
it is mainly the controllers objects which have to be rewritten in this approach
keep in mind that good java web-hosting isn t usually so cheap as php hosting jvm simply needs more resources memory to run than php
right click on the project you want to release and choose publishing menu item
windows7 is going to be a little bit smaller than windows-vista
often creating an overload which takes fewer arguments is a more flexible and cleaner solution so c# s designer simply did not see a reason to add the complexity of default parameters to the language
this is more efficient as you only have a worst case of two if statements checking the angle whereas the other approach has a worst case of twelve 6 for each component when checking the other three corners to see if they are greater than the current max or less than the current min i think
try positioning a transparent div on top of the form elements this shouldn t be too hard with jquery and make that div capture your mouse click
i m using intellij idea which allows you to browse decorated methods and will refactor spring xml config together with method name changes but this is not always sufficient adding a parameter to a method in the wrong place can affect whether an aspects fires for example
isn t the logic like this find the max of the first half and the second half and then add them to see if the addition is bigger than either
that python 3.0 support may not be forthcoming too soon but i m not sure i agree that it will come sooner than perl or php
the programming model for wpf is more open and flexible than windows forms is but like asp.net-mvc it requires a little more discipline in terms of correctly implementing model-view-viewmodel patterns
i m not familiar with perforce s jam however bjam allows this - and it s trivially easy
many would suggest autotools for project configuration i on the other hand recommend cmake rather nice language no more m4
you re returning a stack-based pointers a pointers that resides in stack of the called process that will be released whenever the marks name method ends
anyways browser-detection is a seriously flawed strategy for writing cross-browser scripts that s just to be used when browser-feature-detection fails
we can initialize more than one variable we can check for more than one conditional we can iterate more than one variable using the comma operators
i added this code in the -titlerectforcontentrect of a uibutton subclassing but the code can also be placed in drawing routine of the uibutton superview which in that case you shall replace all references to self with the uibutton s variable
...that would work in mysql but ms sql is stricter and requires that everything is either enclosed in an aggregate function or is part of the grouping by clause
nb there s more than one checkbox in the page to allow multipleselectedion so the false value is of no use as i need the values from the hidden field to know which items were ticked and which weren t as non-checked checkbox values aren t posted - only the hidden fields are
my professor asked us to create a java program that would be able to run in cmd-prompt but could also be opened using netbeans
is there a generic ip device name for windows similar to eth0 used by linux and solaris
also maybe there s a better way to tell mobile-safari the character encoding of html files equivalent to the server s http content-type header
lott many differences between perl python
this exception-handling leads my app to crash goes to main method in debugging and could not be caught by try-catch
at the end of the day though you can make good web applications with all 3 but if you are dead-set on dropping php to try something new i would recommend python and the django framework
these mechanisms let users share files more easily by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files
so that it can be given a width and aheight
for some reason it seems the add operation on a hashset is slower than thecontains operation when the elements already exists in the hashset
existing systems if you re a .net shop asp.net is probably going to be chosen over php for example
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn
if you choose this option but then invoke git from a windows cmd prompt all of the unix-y cmd-line utilities that git relies upon will not be found
for a web app i would choose php because i know it and there is a ton of documentation although i hear ruby is pretty good
maybe this is more along the line of what you are missing
i d prefer not to remove the documentation for silverlight altogether since i will need it in the future but some way to choose between wpf and silverlight help would be great
this avoids outer join which are not as fast as inner-join and may therefore be quicker
in my opinion perl is faster on the draw at the cmd-line than python is
running the query returns one row and when i attempt to use the iqueryable.single extension method it throw the exception stating there is more than one row returned
use a factory only when you need extra control with object creation in a way that couldn t be done with constructor
the parentheses that opened and closed the if-statement could be red the parentheses that hold the foo statement could be blue the brackets that hold the arrays index could be green and the curly-brackets would be light-brown
do note that browsers usually have issues with transparency flash movies so usually specifying a background-color is the better option
it would be nice if this library would allow compound elements to be expanded and hidden and of course ensured the resultant xml is compliant with the xsd
quite flexible with configuration allows multiple projects source code management integration for svn git cvs all the common ones integrated wiki forums files etc
for me this means python-code is much easier to maintain which on the long run makes python much more attractive than perl
in general you will find that the entity framework supports many more complicated mapping scenarios than linq-to-sql
you could also have a look at jira which is more useful for project-management
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up
anticipating that fields might have changed when submission and either setting defaults rejecting accordingly
looking for an application that allows me to connect to an sql server select any number of tables and then generate insert statements for the data contains in these tables
it generates a single sql script file which can be used to recreate a database both schema and data in a shared hosting environment where the only connectivity to a server is through a web-based control panel with a script execution window
assuming that the database will always be updated using ado dao commands from within excel-vba does that mean i can have multiple excel users using that one single access database and not run into any concurrency issues etc
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition
assuming that the database will always be updated using ado dao commands from within excel-vba does that mean i can have multiple excel users using that one single access database and not run into any concurrency issues etc
for changes to a database any of us developers can make the change in the development environment and then pass along the script to a dba to be done .when it is ready for production
when you serialise an element you lose any non-attribute-based information attached to it including javascript properties event handlers and listener
indeed microsoft even recommends calling dispose from your finalize in some instances
the question is now about storing lots of data which can be represented using primitive types like int in a map
an inaccurate progress-bar is worse than none in my opinion
i believe that the only thing that can go in the system-tray that is larger than an icon is the clock
then you can have a loop that blocks your method from returning while the collectioncontains the key with optional logic for adding a timeout or any other additional ways where you might want the method to be able to return and not be blocked forever
computers must be told a sequence of instructions on how to generate random numbers
nvarchar max varchar max etc. of course this is worse when you are actually using sql-server express which doesn t allow for exporting other than creating your own scripts to create the data
is there any way to write a regular expression to be used with grep that matches field from consecutive line
can it easily be combined with jquery asp.net ajax asp.net webforms other frameworks
cocoa is better faster and simpler than carbon
php 5.3.0 gives a shorter version of the ternary operators conditional
the reverse question if i make clr35 and clr20 configurations is it possible to select target-platform based on this
this has vastly better performance than the line class so this is what i ll be using for horizontal and vertical lines
i know twisted much more than django or pylons
if you declare the instance as a normal static member or as a normal global variable in the source file you ll probably have an easier time because the constructor will be called before main execute before you have a chance to start other threads
which will match any url starting with http and contains only the characters in the - a through z 0 though 9 -
it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates time it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.
the concept you re talking about is widely used in a smaller scale between words and line
maps contains similar factory methods for instantiating other types of maps as well such as treemap or linkedhashmap
here you go - less line than any misuse of table tags can provide
the strongly typed languages themselves also tend to be more verbose than the python ruby where you can take advantage of functional programming techniques such as clojures and lambdas
this works if i do either the first or second query but when i add them together with the and it starts complaining about more than 1 row in-subquery
space for the pointers will be allocated on stack but it will be popped off at the end of every iteration so you don t need to worry about it
i m currently working on a multi-threaded application that would be deployed on arm and powerpc architecture
it provides the logic described above and can be used from java ant or maven
the etc hosts-file can be used to override dns definitions to point an hostname to a different ip
generally i prefer http pull feed but what weaknesses does using http have
the failure should easily be traced either through some sort of debugging output or stack trace
so it is not really sensible to compare ruby on rails vs python
since your datamodel is not properly normalized this is uglier than it would need to be
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp
i would like to do the same in wpf but i can t find a way to pull it off short of hosting a winform progress-bar which seems counter productive
in this case your application controller would still be responsible for initializing and managing the relationships between the data controller and view controllers but it wouldn t be cluttered with model object specific code
i ve had this before and making the box bigger with margins or padding makes it work ok
about the client profile it can only be installed on x86 client machines that don t have any version of .net installed so it won t install on vista it already comes with .net 3.0 any windows-server version nor any x64 ia64 os
on a decent file system writes can be made atomicity by writing to a temp file and then renaming the file
unfortunately ikvm s graphics2d implementation throw a notimplementedexception in drawglyphvector it needs to be fleshed out with a .net implementation or by reducing it to calls of other ikvm graphics2d methods which are implemented
one reason to use curly-braces becomes more clear if you don t have an else
ruby gets more attention than python simply because ruby has one clear favourite when it comes to web apps while python has traditionally had a very splintered approach zope plone django pylons turbogears
it makes it hard to embed python in html files to make templates in the way that php or c# can be embedded in php or asp.net pages
if you re in a small company that s more entrepreneurial i can see where it s more likely that they re taking a chance on a technology like ruby python etc
on similar line is it possible to have some engine which takes natural language input describing about the pattern one needs to match replace and gives out the correct almost correct regex for that description
do not use includes if you want to achieve an inner-join includes implies a left outer join which is less selective and less efficient than inner-join .
i know in sql-server you can drag the columns over from the object browser wouldn t be surprised if oracle had something similar
in a managed wrapper over a native library i have to accomplish certain operations which to the user of the high level objects should be considered atomicity and consistent
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish
there are a couple of things missing like a datepicker and having checkbox on tree controls you can actually template this out but it s not as simple as winforms in that regard
this philosophy produces a better all-round toolset but at the risk of instability - because it means throwing away backwards-compatibility if and when better libraries appear
except these all other features can be used in asp.net-mvc
delphi s exception handling is also much more advanced than c++ s
clozure cl is a fork from macintosh common-lisp but has be changed to unix conventions pathnames ... and does not include the special graphics code of mcl
now you would think that it would be as simple as checked for the presence of these three properties and in particular the appisolated property because that s the property used to indicate the application isolation type in-process 0 out-of-process 1 or pooled 2 - and every application required this property
more flexibility from uinavigationcontroller such as the ability to push pop views thatselectedively don t display the navigation bar but using the same animations and stack or more customizability over the navigation bar button labels and behaviors
the class needs to be serializable so it can be sent over web services and the data exposed by the get set methods needs to be serialization too
when i selected another control the treeview loses focus it is no longer highlight
i agree with franci - vb6 is no longer sold or supported so vb.net would be the way to go for compiled code
so better to give some kind of percentage completion or something to enable the end user to develop much better application with progress-bar and all
you may wish to consider using asp.net-mvc as it gives you much more control over the final html rendered
in the ideal case the deprecated objects would be marked while updating the schema but then during the nextupdates our backup script would simply not select the objects which have been marked in this way allowing us to eventually phase out these parts of the schema
a if yes then definitely a raw tcp-ip socket is more elegant solution
the code snippet will fail if any of the rows contains objects that can t be converted by int
ideally you will have as many threads as processor
this is a bug in the microsoft c++ compiler - in your example std map iterator might not be a type you could have specialised std map on key-value so that std map iterator was a variable for example
note that sftp should not be confused with ftps
asp.net-mvc is much more in tune with the technology on which it is layered
it can be used to visualize several different formats this is a python script to convert the output from prof gprof oprofile shark aqtime and python profilers into a dot graph. this is what the output look like
i am not familiar with postgresql but i would think that like sql-server it has meta-data tables views that describe the schema of the database for sql-server 2005+ i d be referring you to sys.tables and sys.columns
i prefer windows-server due to fact
this could be done in javascript if you know the aspects ratio of the image
maybe phrasing the problem so that the actual algorithm is unclear - by describing the paths as single-rail railway line so the person would have to infer from domain knowledge that backtracking is more costly
in theory those encoding could be used to encode any number within the range the encoding supports - but of course these encoding were made to encode unicode code points
windows-vista security is quite better than earlier versions of windows
if you specify 32-bit then it will be compiled into 32-bit and then converted as if it was 32-bit machine code running on a 64bit os
preferably such a tool would be comprehensive enough to deal with all relevant aspects of the protocol client server so that the high level protocol description could be serialized out to an xml rdf file where it could be used to dynamically create application code to implement the protocol in python
c++ provides better constructs than member function-pointers for your purpose
they can be declared with single-quotes double-quotes or in certain circumstances with no quotes at all
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this
about ado.net data services - as i understand ado.net data services can t be configured over remoting net.tcp binding
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree
i d recommend mantis or trac
it could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it s better to just get on with it
objc messages which are sent to nil and whose return-values have size larger than sizeof void produce undefined values on powerpc processors
for example a method is a first class programming construct because you can do xyz with it xyz is not what the method does but what a method in general gives you i can t remember what xyz was now but in .net 1.1 delegates were not able to be passed into methods because they were not first class programming constructs i read something along these line
mixing webforms in an asp.net-mvc solution is an ugly solution but at this point looks better than the alternative of trying to write my own month week day view appointment calendar ui
in .net 1.1 delegates were not able to be passed into methods because they were not first class programming constructs i read something along these line
joseph.ferris obviously works in a large organization where the cost of switching platform is going to be very very expensive so the cost of paying the licensing costs is much less that the cost of switching
if you declare a method public protected then it can be overridden by children outside of the package
now the big difference with a static object is that the control-point count is no longer a class-level attribute but an instance level one
a tiny library that could easily be replaced by groovy or java if things turn ugly might be the exception
i know several people who graduated from cs without ever writing more than 50 line of c c++
to handle exceptions you could implement ierrorhandler which will be used whenever one of your service methods throw an exception
this is more out of curiosity that a real requirement but i m wondering if it s possible to treat javascript as ideally a first-class .net citizen or secondarily have some way of invoking interpreting pure javascript functions that don t require the dom in a desktop setting
the parent tree seems not to be updated for any changes once a nodes has been expanded
my statement isn t 100 true as there is a thiscall calling-convention which can be used with dllimport as an aid in calling c++ methods
int is more efficient to use because the cpu on x86 has 32-bit registers
i ve diagnosed some of the reasons it s partly due to std string being mis-used the author should have used const std string wherever possible - don t just use std string s as if they were java strings but it s also because copy-constructor were being constantly called each time the vector outgrew its bounds which was exceedingly often
or do vim or emacs have auto-completion as good as xcode
unless the copy-constructor is complex it is normally very efficient - after all you are supposed to be doing little more than merely copying the object and copying memory is very fast these days
i would stick with rijndaelmanaged or tripledes as those are stronger than des
the use ofselectedions we didn t implement this as it was a text mode editor that used vi-like commands such as 3d to delete 3 lines or 6x to delete 6 characters could be implemented by having a tuple to mark positions in the text and use two of those tuples for aselectedion range
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features
the redefined getcopytooutputdirectoryitems can be created by copying the line 2 438 ndash
if c++ code is usedfor these functions c-wrappers are required for jni unmanaged-code around and this makes things more complex than solely using c
the potential function y assigns a number to every vertex in your complete bipartite graph in such a way that the sum of potentials of any vertex from s the set of all people and any vertex from t the set of all jobs is smaller than the value of the edge connecting these vertices so smaller than the cost of the person doing the job
mystring is not allocated with malloc or calloc so it can t be reallocated with realloc or freed with free
if you re using c# you can also marshalling it to a native buffer yourself to have better control over serialization
i guess it is slighly better than fopen + fclose because
in my totally noninformed view i d guess that the first definitions favor sqlite or mysqlwhile the last few favors oracle
i have noticed that internet-explorer is more aggressive at caching ajax calls than firefox is
if the exception-handling are only thrown in rare circumstances then you re better off with a try-catch to avoid the overhead of branching in a tight loop
under any other circumstances the user will be prompted for credentials username and password for an account within the active directory domain
is there a way to specify more than one app-config file in one nunit project file
for pdf generation i highly recommend jasperserver which can be used from any environment via http-request
the boost-serialization archives can be constructed with any stream
but many developers tend to put computationally intensive or relatively long-running code in the getter and setter where they would be much more appropriate as methods
windows-server 2008 is the first one for which using rdp directly is as secure as ssh
i found that sctp can be tunneled over udp with the only problem being tunneled sctp is not interoperable with untunneled sctp
so it s possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to grab authentication details by simply altering the initial http page with the login form
i m not familiar with any such convention in python perl java php javascript or bash shell scripting
it can be saved via notepad for example in a file with the extension .com and it can be run on ms-dos most clones of ms-dos and even in the ms-dos compatibility mode of the windows command prompt including on vista but not on any 64-bit windows since they decided that compatibility with 16-bit real mode was no longer a priority.
the functionality i need to provide is drawing a line drawing multiple lines on a imgae iside the cell select any one line and move it expand it delete it
i am currently in the preparation phase for a new project that will be developed with .net compact-framework 2.0 or 3.5 we ll see and will run on a custom windows ce 6 hardware
if they are only familiar with asp.net webforms drag-and-drop-with-some-code-behind then they will have a whole new paradigm to learn which will take time
fields can be used as input to out ref arguments
properties support different accessibility for getter setter - fields do not but fields can be made readonly
the collection could be split into category such as
i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world
well i ve always preferred c and or c++ because there are multiple flavours msvc glib etc it runs on many different platforms mobile devices windows linux and devices and it can be written cross platform different processor architectures and even for high end graphics directx
this would be a lot less tedious than typing out all of the fields and concatenation them with the comma
i have a vb6 application that needs to be installed on windows-vista as a standard user
in general divisions are usually slightly more costly than multiplication on most processor
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple
with most processor it s faster to multiply than divide
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication
even though streaming are buffering it s usually more efficient grabbing a chunk at a time
nhibernate is certainly more robust in many ways and there s also the whole entity-framework migration going on
leaving off initializer for a field could either mean that the coder knew it would be initialized to default value or that he knew it would not be initialized and didn t care or else he didn t think about it and his code just happens to work
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools
finally some thoughts on what should be made fibers typically your mainupdates loop is one fiber updating and drawing all objects and then calls yield
command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file
another thing you can do if you go all out is to only allow digits to be entered in numeric fields only allow digits and - in credit card or phone number fields and so on
so i encouraged my self to create a set of requirements analyze them and come up with design decisions about how they can be met using eclipse-rcp as the base framework and eventually implement them with eclipse-rcp
i haven t used django but it has some industry traction not as much as ruby-on-rails
this may be too late for you but i needed to migrate from a sharepoint 2003 site to a sharepoint 2007 site and keep not only versioning but also the file metadata from all of the document libraries
erlang as a functional language can be very concise beyond ruby or python
since you can t control the spaces between letters and words nearly as much with css as you can with indesign it s a lot harder to justify text and not have rivers of whitespace run down your rows which happens when the spaces between words exceeds the spaces between line
i specify an order in the activerecord finder or in the model associations because sorting using sql is faster
it won t be updated whenever yourselectedion changes
i realize that the method to do these conversions is quite simple however when you factor in internationalization and localization support this becomes less trivial
use pointers when you don t want your object to be destroyed when stack frame is emptied
i m not familiar with asp.net-mvc so i don t know how to actually accomplish this but that s the solution
i might have fifty thousand line in the other program and want to filter out all of the line that don t match a list of three thousand line in excel
i ve been reading that static-classes should be stateless...but this class has state the in-memory dictionary right
type hinting throw e_recoverable_error which can be caught by simpletest since php version 5.2
as a rule of thumb it s better to have one package-management in the system so you ll be better off packaging everything in rpms and managing it via yum
by default the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in permgen but this can be enabled with optional java command arguments
a crash dump with an exception that says you violated threading rules by doing this along with stack trace is much easier to debugging then a report from a customer on the other side of the world that says every now and then the app just freezes on me or it spits out gobbly gook
i m not aware of a processor that takes any longer to do negation than to do any bitwise operation - and that includes some 30 year old processors
the routes will match by default left-to-right so domain home index will match first to lang domain controllers index action default to index id default to 0 null
in asp.net-mvc gives you more control of the markup or at least more easily gives you control of the markup
also i d like to add that you can mix and match webforms and asp.net-mvc so its not a all or nothing situation
tfs is more than just a source-control tool think workitem-project portal etc.
i m involved in a project that uses wcf rest on iis but of course i d recommend having a look at the framework i built openrasta is a .net open-source stack that makes implementing rest much easier
by the way iis7 cannot be installed on windows-server 2003
compress data that can t be generated on-the-fly - then decompression into ram at startup for fast access
there should have been 4 spaces in the resulting output
if the radius is anything less than 100 when mouseleave happens the from property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a mouseenter
if storing your data in xml format is important for you since you work with xml maybe it has more sense to use a xml native database such as exist which lets you access and transform your xml data in a xml-friendly way xslt xquery xpath
as json is easier to read and write then xml
some areas you just can t or is pointless to have test coverage thats where nocoverage attributes for ncover come in handy you can mark classes to be excluded by code-coverage
i believe this is more of an asp.net issue and not a jquery-dialog issue
if you have an environment where the product manager stakeholder who yells loudest or most eloquently got their stuff built six sigma can be applied to fix that unhealthy aspects of your development process by putting some rational measurement behind the prioritization process
the w matches any word character letter digit or underscore and the 1+ matches whatever was in the first set of parentheses one or more times
also a number of styles appear to be calculated next to the ul when it is show or hidden
tjvpluginmanager requires that the plug-in dlls export a special self-registration function that the manager will call when it loads the dll and the function must return an instance of the tjvplugin class so the plug-in dll must be written in delphi or c++ builder
you can select any control and get or set any property on it
the issue is that function arguments can be evaluated in any order so if your function arguments have any side-effects such as the increment and decrement operations you can t guarantee that they will operate in the order you expect
the main difference between the jsomename classes and their previous version is that the j-ones where designed to be used with swing or any other graphical toolkit while the others are from this time where only awt was available
have dug the listbox properties likeselectededitemsselectededindex etc but no luck
as for this scenario i do not believe you will lose any code performance for having empty line however it may affect your compile times albeit negligable
meta name description can be used to display a short summary of the site in search-engine results although that s not strictly seo
i have just worked on a wpf project that in hindsight we feel we might have chosen silverlight for
i would recommend silverlight over wpf when
query execution depends on more factors it s possible to fully customize the engine environment to take advantages of various features like deffered execution future queries queries executed in a future moment multiple queries and last but not least session management involves in this area
silverlight 3 looks great but for this application i would still have chosen wpf
next the host name will be resolved using dns
clicking the rebuild codesense index button in the project inspector s general pane is probably easier than issuing command-line cmd that do the same thing
currently i m still slogging through the pile of quirks like no 64bit drivers for ms access and i ve noticed that my startup time for eclipse is a lot longer than it was on 32-bit vista
doing this makes adding more sequence numbers generators later fairly easy
can be incorporated into any internet enabled swing or web application environment jsp servlet gwt spring mvc etc.
i m thinking about the singleton pattern in php right now and have decided that although the singleton pattern can be coded in php it is not really implemented since the instance is not shared across requests or stored in the process memory which is the case for web server environments like asp.net java and ruby on rails
and most classesare not designed to be inherited from - to create a good base-class requires more than making its functions virtual
if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes - public protected private - everything becomes fair game
on python 2 you might need getcmdlinew to get unicode characters from the cmd-line that can t be represented in windows ansi codepage such as cp1252
i feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for dynamic data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and ruby which is a good thing
100 asp.net-mvc is better than webforms and it does no matter 2.0 or 3.5
i prefer this way because it forces the methods out of the listener which means i only have one place to look for the code not scattered throughout the inner classes
as an undergraduate we were taught vba for excel and matlab but c matlab labview is more common
generally oracle pl sql is far more powerful than sql-server scripts
a #include is nothing more than a copy-paste operation inserting the contents of the included file at that point
this reminds me of the knapsack-problem more than the traveling-salesman
the parentheses around are necessary because the operators has lower precedence than the function call operators
i figured that this would be faster than one panel that has to drawrectangles all the time
i would recommend python or ruby bindings of a high level toolkit as a perfect environment
the four i ve narrowed it down to have been c# python ruby and php
usually the windows-hosting will run a bit more than linux without even considering the flame wars reasons
if you go with c# for web development depending on your experience with web technology i d heartily recommend starting with asp.net-mvc before asp.net webforms
if you just want to filter out line matching some text grep is the better tool for that
it seems odd that you re creating a bitmap of the same width andheight as your input yet the generated bmp is much larger
let an object which can only be done for atomicity types
is python slower than java c#
code blocks is less used because it isn t extensible as emacs vim
some python run-times cpython for example will be slower than native-code c++
it is not really correct to ask why python is slower than java c#
do not be tempted to declare all your oracle tables as index organized in an attempt to emulate sql-server
technically these are equal but how could it be determined without evaluation the ienuemrable returned in each expression
as others have said asp.net-mvc is probably more inline with other web frameworks rails for example
if you can stretch to other languages then lex yacc or flex bison is the standard for c although i wouldn t particularly recommend either of those combinations steep learning curve showing their age a little now
i m trying to wrap the patricia tries perl s net patricia to be exposed in python
i actually would prefer doing this with linq but i couldn t find any examples that used csv files that had quoted values for values that contains commas in the value itself
stop conditional is a single test here it s just i and incrementer is an expression to be executed each time after body the comma operators lets you have multiple sub-expressions which all get executed
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautiful soup
kill this job and nn is the relative sequence numbers for killing or
useful alternative to out ref parameters when you need to return more than one value from a function
scala allows import aliases so it s always less verbose than java in this regard see for example java.util.date and java.sql.date - using both forces one to be fully qualified
member-functions can be implemented as function-pointers in a structure
public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a private protected backing variable to a property but that is slightly unrelated to your question
if you re concerned about security plain ftp certainly isn t providing it and sftp requires ssh anyway so you could use ssh scp to synchronize with repositories this works much better with git than svn as most version-control tasks do
this way a post can be associated with any number of category and topics
without writing extra code there is no way to prevent certain event-listeners on a single element from firing and even if you could you couldn t be guaranteed the order the event-listeners would be fired in
if you want to be able to select cell you ll have to use a gridview
in general with an area of functionality as well-visited as controllers filters if you can t do something it s probably because you re looking at something the wrong way
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency
to me it seems that spring python is more of a way to allow python apps to interact with java apps using spring
my blog uses blosxom written in perl but a similar thing could be done for php where each individual entry is a separate text file
the whole thing seems to be related to windows-vista
then you can see if these line are being executed when the form loses focus
some browsers let you focus and select readonly field and some even let you paste into a readonly field though they revert to the original value onblur and onchange
picklist value for standard field cannot be edited in spring 09
i was wondering if template could be used for this since the packets class is just a generic class whose type can be pretty much anything
sadly you can only compete with perl php python ruby and i would love to see this problem solved in other not so traditional languages
any orm like sqlalchemy sqlobject or the django orm are implemented on top of db-api and i recommend using any of these over direct db-api because it can give gramps the flexibility to run sqlite in embedded mode for local desktop users and then also share sometime down the road a postgresql mysqldatabase connection with a web based version of gramps
i d recommend wcf on .net 3.5 if possible though
this made is much easier than trying to grab each field with js and then setting it to it s default value
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win
if this size is bigger than the client size then wx will show scrollbar
quicksortis also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
i d also prefer c++ delphi windows libraries because that would make them easier to integrate but .net java .
if you re using a shell such as bash 4 then is essentially a recursive version of which will match any number of subdirectories
let s say controllers is ok but which user have that privilege is i want to decide in security layer if it pass this layer it goes to business layer in which complex query will be executed like business rules
however in my opinion the java naming-conventions is a better choice than the ibm naming convention and not only in java for c# as well and any oo programming language
the algorithm should be stable and the time-complexity should be o n with constant space for additional variables which means sorting should be done in-place
basically i need the results of the two for-loops to be inserted in json
i have a wss 3.0 system using ssl where every page is supposed to be served as http
the problematic method writeobject should be declared as abstract as well and you should leave it up to the concrete implementation in a subclassing how it manages the desired goal
i would recommend having a generic locate string criteria method as the basis and only defining specialized method-signature for the ones you know you will use frequently
any other value indicates that three is more than one set of distinct values in the table
if whatever assembly you are referencing were designed well then all the types members that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately abstract virtual sealed but indeed this is unfortunately not the case sometimes you can even experienced this issue with the base class library
you can t have a single sendto generate more than one packets you would have to iterate over all interfaces and either use raw sockets or bind the socket to a device using setsockopt ... sol_socket so_bindtodevice ethx to send each packets bypassing the os routing table this requires root privileges
c implementations discussed in the context of character arrays as c dynamic string length used malloc realloc and free but these should be avoided in c++ code
they all have a numeric id called document number but they weren t assigned sequentially for reasons that no longer apply meaning from now on when my web site records a new record it needs to assign it the smallest possible document number greater than zero that has not already been taken
if i have a text and href on the navitem and ensurechildcontrols is called when either of them are set then how will the other s value be placed into any sub control
if it renders longer than two line it will just display ... at the end of the string
xml being based on sgml is better than json as a document format
the new row gets inserted between 1st and 2nd row it picks formatting rules from the row above or cells to the left of the cell
if you wanted a more interesting report than this you ll need to provide data for the report and or subreport
but for java development i would choose linux windows or solaris
the file has to be opened in output and binary mode using the flags ios out output mode and ios binary binary mode
in some processor the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a device and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select pin
to get the first frozen or visible column getfirstcolumn must handle bitmasks different way getfirstcolumn could get the first column that matches any of the flags set but this is not the case
things that can only be done once like creating a specific invoices processing a specific delivery ...
research shows that the standard doesn t really defined forward declaration nor does it explicitly state that enums can or can t be forward declare
these files can only be served out to authenticated users over http which is why i am serving them through a servlet instead of just sticking them in apache
the function is intended to be used like this or as an inner-join
we will developing something which performance and scalability is of more importance than reliability of codes
and to answer the other part of your question i ve found that using json results in a far smaller payload than xml while still having decent support within wcf
the xmlhttprequest object can handle more than just http-request supposedly but at least in mootools it s not meant to
essentially these operators allow an instance of a type to be used in boolean conditional logic such as and ||
larger numbers will have larger distances between floating-point representations and will thus have fewer digits of precision following the decimal-point
it still keeps a small white margins at the right but its far better than the default
the table is the central type in lua and can be treated as either an associative arrays hash table or dictionary or as an ordinary arrays
therefore everything must be made serialization
the only downsides are that it install jruby 1.2 and i needed to install jruby 1.3 manually to get something working i can t remember what and i have been completely unable to get deployment working with either capistrano or vlad the deployer to work
a not very serious suggestions a line editor can be implemented without ncurses
as for an alternate faster method i think usingsubstring to parse will be faster than a regex
my site now frequently gets trapped in a loop in which the onresize logic activates a larger style sheet which creates scrollbar which then triggers another resize event that cannot be filtered out because the clientwidth has changed due to scrollbar appearing or disappearing
had i used another adaptor to connect to for instance a sqlite database id would ve been set to 1
rsh originally existed under unix and so is also present under linux
as the server is a windows-server i would normally use a batch file but the head dev insists everything must be done in ruby as some members have macs and may not understand windows batch files
scr the service component runtime which is anextendser bundle implements the new and improved osgi r4.2 ds - declarative service - specification will
when a javascript event click ocurrs i am trying to set a value in the hidden field so that the value can be retained on postback and remembered for the next rendering
from my experience doing top n queries in sql-server seems a little easier than oracle
but problem being my client application needs to do a seperate http-request to download the html file incase response xml version is greater than clients version
i ve started to write unit tests before the code for all my personal projects bigger than 20 line of code
tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.
remember the user might be pressing backspace or the cursor might not be at the end of the field or the user might have part of the value selected to be replaced on next keypress and so on
whenever you need to treat a block of 2 or more statements as an atomicity unit
using an explicit inner-join is both safer and easier to read
i d prefer static-classes with any number of methods as already mentioned
i would recommend checking out wcf instead of .net webservices - it gives you more flexibility more options reliable sessions which will deal with short network hiccups and it gives you easy support for mtom encoding for large messages and even supports streaming if you plan on serving up video or other content
multiple line also makes it easier to step through your code using a debugger
when you select config a b you are selecting all children of b which includes three textnodes and two elements
it does not select any textnodes processing-instructions or comments that are children of the top element
this is less desirable as my form and model has manyproperties and i don t want to have to create and maintain a command that has each and every model attributes as a text field
for the main reason that it s not allowed to have more than one controllers per file autoloading
i d tend to agree with you that asp.net-mvc is faster but why not make a friendly wager with your friend and share the results
php doesnt lend itself well to large complex applications nearly so much as asp.net-mvc it s that simple.
edit you mentioned using the other bit fiddling instructions on modern processor multiplication would not be microcoded like this
i have concluded that implements an interface does not achieve this methods are instance only and that static methods can not be marked override virtual or abstract
run through the file once more and pick out the line at the selected positions
maybe another way of getting a non-rectangular form shape you might not have thought about set a transparency background-color on the form and work with that
your widgets will all be fast c++ qt widgets you can sort your messages with thinly-wrapped native qt methods and hold it all together with a bit of python perl whatever
that called me to implement an observer pattern on the service so that it would notify my application .when new set of results are merged and ready to be used and send them to the application
even if you re looking for something more complicated say if you want to create some fancier animation than a progress-bar you might be able to start with fbsplash and modify it to suit your needs
walking through memory with can be used for any sequenced container linked-list skip list vector binary tree b tree etc thanks to operator overloading
i don t really want to put an windows.controls.image property on the person object because this it will be coupled to silverlight wpf and i might want to use this object with some other technology in the future asp winforms the next new thing etc
silverlight is more than happy to make regular old-fashioned time-tested http-post s
nant has more features out of the box but msbuild has a much better fundamental structure item metadata rocks which makes it much easier to build reusable msbuild scripts
nant has more features out of the box but msbuild has a much better fundamental structure item metadata rocks which makes it much easier to build reusable msbuild scripts
nant has more features out of the box but msbuild has a much better fundamental structure item metadata rocks which makes it much easier to build reusable msbuild scripts
one of the guys went and changed all ints to shorts to speed up our code since grabbing 16-bit from ram was quicker than grabbing 32-bit
things that are only possible with asp.net webforms
user controls are not available with asp.net-mvc
i dare say this is partly due to my background in ant but i found building a nant file for protocol buffers to be a much simpler job than building an msbuild file for miscutil
finally - for use with jquery you might also consider for the next project returning json from an asp.net-mvc route - it will make things a lot simpler than using asmx
telerik has a new go at asp.net-mvc this looks much better then their first go at it
all new development will be done with asp.net-mvc
since it uses pattern matching rather than the visitor-pattern we don t lose any type-safety and the code is very easy to read
i can answer it the other way around if you don t have control over the datamodel and thus facing some legacy database ibatis is the better choice
i prefer cobertura over emma
or use a background-image on the body but that s less scalable and can t be used for percentage width
if however and this is more likely the case you are trying to get this to be dynamic why not just use a div element like so
like martin said quartz.net is really powerful for writing scheduled services and gives you more flexibility than plain scheduled-tasks
the externaldataevent args and the events should be marked as serialization
oracle s sqldeveloper works with mysqlalso with a little bit of config
all other browsers work fine but ie8 requires http to be used when loading the .ashx file due to the security issue
i want to compare rows of two gridviews.gw1 and gw2
this means that any readily available dictionary is useless since the likelyhood of it contains the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it contains the hash for dog this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric string
what i m trying to achieve is a method of tracking the progress of a bunch of tasks which vary greatly from 20mins to 5seconds by the one progress-bar tasks can be added at any point in time
linq is much more than linq-to-sql
we have an automated backup system that grabs any directories off our our machines which we specify so i add any repositories and working copies on my machine to that last including both git and cvs repositories
typical examples of these are arrays which can be accessed directly regardless of their size and linked-lists which must be traversed in order from the beginning to access a given item
the standard specifies relationships between the types such as a long-integer will be either the same size or larger than an int
this isn t really necessary and will lose any references or event-listeners associated with the elements and their descendants
you d need to loops through all of the elements in your arrays so it s probably not a better solution than any other
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication
if you use oracle you also have to buy toad but the included manegement studio will do for sql-server
when the listbox loses focus it s really hard to tell what s been selected because the selection colour changes from blue to a light grey colour
then for each acceleration measurement you make whose magnitude is greater than 1 subtract the last known acceleration of gravity - this will need to be a vector subtraction - and use that as the kinetic acceleration
just wondering what the best way to incorporate it in a asp.net-mvc project so that the design can be done using expression web
so far i ve learned that this can be done using either the xinput library from directx or the input framework in xna
in this url you can see that the documentation mentions that it can be used with swing or swt out of the box but no html mentioned
you can use the ace jet ole db provider and an ado connection object s openschema method to get schema information as a recordset which is arguable better than a collection because it can be filtered sorted etc
they are very separate things jquery is a javascript framework that has the ability to do some rudimentary ajax functionality while asp.net ajax is a more fully-featured ajax framework that encompasses .net controls and server-side aspects as well as client-side aspects
is there a way with wpf to force application windows to scale themselves larger as resolutions pixel density changes
then on a standard post product create controllers needs to get the chosen userid then grab the user entity of that id and associate it with the to be created product
in essence a mocking stubs framework is nothing more than a way to easily provide implementations for type definitions for known inputs
for example para is short for descendant-or-self node child para and so will select any para element in the document even a para element that is a document element will be selected by para since the document element node is a child of the root node
json is not a perfect fit -- it s still data not objects no identity can t do full graphs -- but it is more natural than xml
much more robust functionality generally goes in my code-behind and i don t want my developers to be cluttered by having to sift through a bunch of initialization line when trying to understand it
castle activerecord works really well for small-to-medium projects based on mvc - i m using it on a couple of projects at the moment and finding it a very good fit with asp.net-mvc
still not a simple alter but it is certainly better than 5231 line
what s the best easiest way to have the stepper s value be updated whenever the text field value is changed
gruby-on-rails is also great although it s a lot buggier than ruby-on-rails and if you want to do anything complicated you re going to need to learn a bit about spring hibernate and java
it s typically used to for-loops where you want to initialize more than one value
what would be perfect is if someone could reply with a modified version of the #if telerik code below which places the stacklayoutpanel on the form such that the form s scrollbar appear when the form is sized smaller than the panel
every application when built for a 64bit processor takes more memory than when built for a 32-bit processor
if you want to make sure your function won t be interrupted by signal use sigprocmask to mask and unmask signals although some signals cannot be blocked like sigkill and behaviour for blocking some signals like sigsegv is undefined
if you want each controllers to be notified whenever the other update the value of the strings you can use notification mechanism
i d recommend seam for ejb3+pojo
or if you prefer inner-join syntax
integrated with livecycle lcds you could have server push data to flex clients rather than pull based mechanism
in this very simple asp.net application visual web developer 2008 express can debug the javascript code fine but the full version of visual studio 2005 cannot debug it namely when i click on a line in the main.js file it gives me a red circle with a question mark on it the mouse hover revealing this break point will not be reached no symbols were loaded for this document.
each of those would have a method to grab line from one file and overwrite the line of another
the java 6 processing api is better imho but i just haven t had luck with java 6 processor doing what i need yet
it would be best to try and match any character that is not allowed by negating the allowed set
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git
you need e because the argument to like is a regex and regex escape char is already e.g e w would match any string contains a printable char
i m not very familiar with plesk but you could get arough idea of what is happening by just running the top cmd and looking for processes that are using a lot of ram or cpu i m assuming you have a linux server and cmd-line access
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested
the instruction set will be no more complex than a 386 family so learning assembler on this system is probably as good as any
i got it working for the most part some odd exit statuses will change the color to something else but i m ok with it but when typing a command which is more than one line and causes the terminal to scroll the prompt disappears
just about anything that can be executed from a cmd-line can be executed via hudson
if your flex app can be built via ant from the cmd-line
even on a single server the machine key should be configured because any recycle of the app domain will generate a new key when it is set to auto
perhaps the ado.net entity-framework is a better choice
none of diane s arguments provide a reason that using a singleton is better than an application subclassing all she attempts to establish is that using a singleton is no worse than an application subclassing which i believe is false
for using this approach the std istream and std ostream must be opened in binary mode
also i note that a 64bit sbcl appears to use literally twice as much memory as 32-bit
wouldn t it be simpler to concat the strings using a place holder ###placeholder### count the chars of the string minus your place holder trim it to the right length withsubstring and then explode by placeholder
having the whole site as https is another option but this appears to be quite a bit slower than plain http and so is not really ideal
pre-existing solutions exist which are secure and which are capable of more than this for example logging in someone at an https login form and maintaining that session while transferring them back to http
the execution plan does not contains any sort anymore and the number of steps in the execution plan is less than half of original which i hope is also faster.
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest
telerik has rad-controls for silverlight the contextmenu control can be attached to tree views
i would recommend asp.net mvc if it were not for your .net 2.0 restriction
through django you produce your xml responses although i suggest you to use json which is easier to handle on the web browser side
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int
one developer seemed to have a rule that no method should have more than two line of code
yes this ruins the ability to do numeric sorting and you won t be able to do a cast or convert on the column any longer since text will be intermingled with integer values but i think any other method would be too complex to maintain properly
if you mean one or more groups of numbers followed by a period then this is more along the line of your requirements
on os x i would recommend textmate as a text-editor or eclipse with pydev as a more full-featured ide
to get more control over serialization i have converted a class from datacontract to serializable implementing both getobjectdata and the special deserializing constructor
object is more like hash it is a collection of key-value pairs
if you imagine xy trend then data fields will be y coordinates category fields will be x coordinates and series fields will be values for grouping data in different line
soap adaptor can be problematic i would recommend wcf if your using r2
write a custom axis2 handler that backward-converts the newer ws-addressing stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the service
i could have chosen to subclassing the model but there wasn t really enough of a distinction to warrant that complexity
i prefer winmerge which can recursively run though two folders of files has options to ignore whitespace differences and blank line and even runs well under linux using wine.
and when you run your code that variable is undefined with in the scope of your code and will be assigned the default-value
now when i got a new case i create a similar array then compare it with previously stored final true case and if does match except filtered line it s a true case if other line are massively changed there is a tolerance value then it s false
this is more efficient than using is and then casting each time as both the is and the cast required execution-time checked
scala is faster it seems but the groovy folks are really pushing performance for the 2.0 release
groovy is syntactically influenced by java but semantically influenced more by languages like ruby
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta
the computer language benchmarks game ranks scala as being between substantially faster than groovy ranging from twice to 93 times as fast while retaining roughly the same source size
i would currently choose asp.net-mvc for 2 reasons 1 i want to learn to master it
i believe i can build complete beautiful apps in asp.net-mvc much faster than in asp.net and i ve got some years of asp.net under my belt
i am not sure if the checked for length greater than zero is required nut it is easily integrated
i think more than 90 people will choose asp.net-mvc rather than webforms
edit to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page can t be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you can t have the time until the page is done rendering
to further nitpick about his solution a set of radio-buttons should be used and within the form a button or some sort of clickable element should be used to send the values to the server via an ajax request and the values sent to the server can be analyzed and the status of the answer sent back to the page
this is much more flexible than using inheritance because we can stay with the theme of using composition and parametric-polymorphism without locking down brittle hierarchies
i have an ide named vxworks 653 2.2.3 development shell which needed to be invoked all the time when i notice any change in my source files.so i had invoked this shell through a vb scripts which invokes two more .bat batch files to get this shell popped up for execution.now i feel that since my ide can be invoked by cmd-line it can also be invoked through nant scripts using the statement like
a device could have a range of possible configurations baud-rate data bits parity bits stop bits that must be detected at runtime
c++ guarantees that all objects on the stack that have been successfully constructed will be destructed this includes constructors of base-classes and members even if the superclass constructor fails
and it is phenomenal because with vmware fusion or parallels i think parallels is better in the most up-to-date versions the mac is an excellent machine for doing windows development on
i know could theoretically make a faster parser using an xmlreader instead and it would not only allow me to do my own string pooling but also to process data during mid-import so that not all 200k line have to be saved in ram until i ve read the entire file
for example you might have developed a website using microsoft s asp.net-mvc which just went rtm yesterday or built software against sql server 2008 rc 1..etc
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysqland postgresql
could you be seeing a finalize which takes more than 2 seconds to run
if you re familiar with html and javascript or other asp.net-mvc frameworks like rails asp.net-mvc makes much more sense than the old webforms
it appears that perhaps the behavior i m seeing regarding win32 win64 subkeys reflects the fact that some type libraries can be used in 64bit and 32-bit programs because there they contain no bit-constrained read pointer parameters
linq-to-dataset makes it easier and
however for very large values the integral type s approximation will actually be better than the floating point type s consider the value 9223372036854775806.7 which is only off by 0.3 when represented as 9223372036854775807 as a long but which is represented by 9223372036854780000.000000 when stored as a float
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope
if you have 5 blocks of 5 characters you have 36 25 combinations which is bigger than 2 128 so could use one of the standard digital signature algorithms which generates a 128bit then convert that value to base 36
i have found that although a physical sketch can get you started on the right track for a design you can make far better looking layouts within adobe-illustrator which is much easier to move elements around in than photoshop
is the field duration going to be assigned an undefined assigned value since statustime is getting used and assigned in the same statement
updates the signature signs everything in the signedinfo element so if you go updating that element after the fact then the signature is no longer valid
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs
one of the simplest most basic things he talks about is that methods should be small he goes all the way as to say that they should not contain more than three line
no more than 3 line
in this mode asp.net httpmodule s basically have nearly as much power as an isapi filter would have had and asp.net httphandler s can have nearly equivalent capability as an isapi extension could have
overall gruby-on-rails is much more rough-around-the-edges than ruby-on-rails is partially due to its immaturity and partially because it relies on two insanely complex frameworks under-the-covers spring and hibernate
note that this requires sq to have a number of elements which is evenly divisible by n because seq.take and seq.skip unlike linq s take and skip extension methods require that the sequencecontains at least n elements
always be prepared to draw the appropriate area of your view when drawrect is called
i am adding functionality to an asp.net webforms application and we ve decided that new development will be done asp.net-mvc with a view to move all functionality over eventually
msil isn t called msil any more as a public standard it s cil common intermediate-language part of the cli common language infrastructure standard
to able to identify other websites in a host you need to build a massive database and store as much as dns record as you can then correlate ip addresses
the program uses sqlite s functionality through simple function calls which reduces latency in database access as function calls within a single process are more efficient than interprocess communication
set up a table in a db with a tasks queue that would be populated by php requests and let some other process on the server watch the table and process any waiting tasks
percentages can only be used with grid cell values so another option is to create a grid and put your textbox in one of the cells with the appropriate percentage
i would choose webforms for local intranet applications with rich business logic and asp.net-mvc for public internet site blogs forums presentations simple services
for example i might want a triggers to be fired insert data into another table after one particular type of update query but not others
sftp is not to be confused with ftps
after setupapp has run once the app_windowselectionchange event will be triggered whenever theselectedion changes
if they re both integers then the line initializing angx and angy will be evaluated using integer arithmetic
also is there a way an attributes maybe to enforce that not null arguments wouldn t be passed to methods andproperties without adding
lisp is a better choice or lua or javascript they are also functional but not purely functional so for your case try lisp
you can choose where you buy your ssl-certificate
i have an image file of a map and a curvy road marked with bold red line wider than 1 pixels there is no other red objects on image
after installing python it is as easy as typing this in a cmd-line in the folder to which you extracted django
that all works fine in ie fx opera - the code registers a document.onkeypress event handler when the box is shown then tests the event keycode to see if it s the escape key or not keycode 27 but this doesn t seen to work in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari 3 though other keys can be captured this way
i use cmake which generates visual studio solutions on windows but there are others too such as scons
on the other hand hosting development-environment can be managed by administration of any level especially when there are such easy to use servers like ubuntu
but the c implementation doesn t help you choose between linked-list and arrays list
that guy s algorithm is interesting but it needs to be pointed out that it does require o log n extra bits of space to traverse a binary tree with nnodes
the data for the response back to the client may be packaged as json or xml or something
technically this is the task of your view layer though if your application s definition of a view layer is nothing more than an html templating system rather than processing and formatting anything that gets sent back to the client whether it s html or something else like xml then your xml or json generation may need to go into a new little section of its own
if writing a struct it is more common to override equality not least to avoid boxing but it is very rare you write a struct anyway
i have started a new web site for our own product a week ago and i couldn t be happier with asp.net-mvc
if the argument is nan or less than zero then the result is nan
if the argument is nan or less than zero the result is nan
a simple model view without the controllers is easier to understand and easier to implement
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this
it s always safest to lock on a separate private instances object because you know that object can t be locked by any other code than your own which isn t the case if you lock this or the streamwriter object itself
this may be as objectionable as innerhtml to you but it has the advantage of working in some cases ie where innerhtml or appendchild do not like some table nodes the text of style and script elements and the value of form field
code that looks up a value in a config object is much simpler than instantiating a subclassing
should i used separate controllers or separate module to contain admin section
php is sexier resume fodder and lets you do some very cool things on the front end but in my experience when it comes to writing server-side code perl simply blows php s doors off
it should be noted that this version of the adaptor was developed using both the ancient 0.0.23 version of dbi up to the current stable release of 0.4.0
the good news is that if you were using a very old dbi with ado technically this adaptor will still work for you but be warned your path is getting old and may not be supported for long
app-config must be copied to where the output executable is and you also must rename it to executablename .config so if your executable is myprogram.exe config must be in myprogram.exe.config
lastly if you have a legacy datamodel that you have little flexibility with hibernate and jpa will give you more headaches than maybe worth
still there are some areas where asp.net-mvc approach would be much more complicated and create more mess than webforms would
when you get the cellcomments back from the dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier call you need to call loadfullcommnents again - cell are reused so you ll only have as many created as show up on screen
in fact we ve often found our 32-bit apps run on 64bit vista better than on 32-bit vista due to the newer os memory manager
if you re already familiar with something like ruby-rails and or django asp.net-mvc makes much more sense
a typical json packets can and should be compressed using gzip by the web server to approx
i also use subversion along with tortoisesvn but i don t bother with the vs integration although i did buy visualsvn i don t use it
the most common use of reflection is an extension of what used to be called rtti runtime type information and was primarily the domain of c++ programmers
most of the reflection library focuses on type discovery and creation that can be invoked at runtime
your ui shouldn t contains any logic that does more than presenting output to the user
if you know the low level details of how your code is executed in perl or python both of which are written in c you can code around several inefficiencies --like knowing which looping construct is faster how memory is retained released etc
if you are using a complex type for u then that needs to be marked serialization as well
lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugin whether you re doing nunit or mstest
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it
there s also a nice overview of what can be done with wss moss and the copymove-product
i am trying to set-up an apache installation with forward proxy and authentication and even though i am close to make it work i wonder if there is maybe a better way as the configuration is fairly esoteric
i have a website with items that can be divided into category items have one not like tags
according to the code igniter documentation location is faster but on windows-servers it can sometimes be a problem.
then any modifications to data in the view object can be saved and linq-to-sql will handle the commit correctly as long as all the relationships are clearly setup defined in both the database and in the data context
you need to have the java console displayed run javaws from the cmd-line and select this from the preferences dialog then hit v
upgrade_250 the wordpress 2.5.0 upgrade will be run if the database versioning is less than 7499. each of these functions run their own data migration and population procedures some of which are called during the initial database setup script
does anyone know where the permissions need to be modified in order to be able to allow the restricted account to add remove groups from user accounts
the specific question is how can a set of cell linux gnu compilers for the ppu and spu processor be built on windows using cygwin
it could be validation error where validating against db can t be avoided or authentication error we do that in 2 places one of which is db or a sql error
at least with oracle and i m quite sure with sql server as well the result of calling a stored procedure which throw an exception is a raised exception which contains far more information than this silly p_error field possibly can
the datacontext must keep a list of records to be inserted on submitchanges - can i access that list
i m sure someone will say that erlang is better but scala is actually usable by normal programmers
also it is obvious to me that dependencies are a pretty big deal with tdd as one has to think about how to inject a stubs mock to the said method for tests
i click edit button and can now change the individual textbox not the datagrid and change it to test changed value
haskell erlang etc are not options in this case as there is a significant quantity of existing legacy c code that will be ported to the new system and porting c to java c# is a lot simpler than to haskell or erlang
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow line
to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get aheight that is greater than your actualheight
if it is smaller than int say short int then the operands are converted to int and you get -4000 but on a 16-bit system uint16_t could be unsigned int and conversion to a signed type would not happen automatically
managing disk quotas in windows-server 2003 and windows xp has more information about setting quotas programmatically
in firefox and google-chrome they line up fine next to each other but in ie the select box sits higher than the text box
add your external url to your hosts-file which can be found either in
it works but there is one major weakness carenumerationinitializer must be instantiated before any reference is made to car enumeration otherwise carproperties are null meaning that car s properties can t be set when car is loaded hence the illegalstateexception thrown to at least make it crashes in a predictable and documentated way
by the way can i still use resources with asp.net-mvc
no that s not possible since assigning it to a derived-class reference would be like saying base-class is a fully capable substitute for derived-class it can do everything the derived-class can do which is not true since derived-classes in general offer more functionality than their base-class at least that s the idea behind inheritance
our queues are transactional so i don t think that adding sequence numbers and resequencing at the destination is going to work as that would lose out transactionality
normally i d recommend jquery for this kind of thing but you re already using dojo so you should probably use that
the method-signature for setobject forkey accepts id as both parameter types and is much better suited
as soon as an exception-handling is caught for the first time any finally blocks on the stack beneath the try-catch will be executed by which time it s too late - another exception-handling may be generated and this means that the original exception-handling is lost
thus it would likely be easier to purchase windows-hosting for any asp.net apps you have
i am not very familiar with oracle so am avoiding sql-server specific approaches other than the table variable for sample purposes but a way to solve the problem as stated would be to create a subquery that unions the four columns and maps column names another subquery that retrieves the max for the 4 values and an outer query that returns the joined result
you might be interested in having a look at common-lisp s condition system which is a sort of generalization of exceptions done right
a hashtable is nothing more than an array usually sparse one of vectors which contain key-value pairs
the maximum size of this array is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hashtable
usually the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large number typically much larger than the spaces you have in your table
i really recommend learning jquery as it would save you loads of time and it is easily extensible by jquery-plugins
the set of instructions created as a result of compiling your code can be interleaved in any order
even in c there is a need for some code to be run before main is entered if only to transform the cmd-line into the c calling convention
we had it in some files that came from cvs and number of line of log statements was on the order of 10x longer than the executable code in file actually was
note that i know audiences can also be used to hide show web parts but that is not something i am interested in
to make it work you must both embed some object type information in data where it is only useful for deserializing and usually use external schema definition which otherwise would not be needed like xml schema for xml
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password
for instance numbers should be stored using integer or floating-point types not strings because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings although it s easy enough to parse a number into a string that this is not a big deal
of course it could be done by json or xml
that said i would suggest carefully examining any case where you consider declaring a non-final static variable aside from a singleton instance and see if it can be refactored or implements differently -- moved into a singleton container or use a final reference to a mutable object
remember that header must be called before any actual output is sent either by normal html tags blank line in a file or from php
if that is the case get a faster disk but first check that you re getting the most out of your existing one...some linux distributions don t optimize disk access out of the box hdparm stage the data into memory say by copying it to a ramdisk ahead of time or be prepared to wait
i kind of like the python language better and it seems to be more full-featured than ruby for statistical scientific and networking let me know if you think this is wrong
i have in fact done pretty significant work with asp.net-mvc - a lob app for medical equipment servicing and i loved it
that is all you need to get a hello world up and running while in rails you would need to generate a whole project structure set up a controllers and a view set up routing and so on i haven t written a rails app in a while so i don t know exactly how many steps hello world is but its certainly more than sinatra
the only catch is that you will need to add code to manually look up the url in your add-on s overlay startup code as unless you addeventlistener before ff starts loading the first page on new window you will have added your event-listener too late to reliably catch that initial page load
ie was forced to choose backwards-compatibility with it s previous versions or to adhere to this new standard they absolutely ruled the browser market so the choice was obvious
how to create a gridview like view to the wpf listview if i dont know the column names at the design time because the collection will be created at runtime and the collection will be of type datatable and it may contain a no.of columns.i can do it with wpf datagrid but i want to achieve this with wpf listview and i want to achieve this without code behind
i like django better because it s less magic with ruby-on-rails i feel they pushed the convention over configuration principle too far so i prefer the more explicit nature of django
once you have done that if you re in vs.net 2008 you can click on the windows forms category and then select inherited form
in the extreme case matrix with a billion rows and columns with only 10 cells used a hashmap can be more efficient than any arrays implementation
i recommend learning ocaml f# or scala and familiarizing yourself with immutability with those languages
regardless its a tremendous framework and i fully expect that mvc will continue to support it as it allows them to compete with ruby python java in the mvc space
categories can also be used to override a method or two when a subclassing is not needed and wanted but usually if you want to add functionality to a class you make a subclassing
i always get local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
it generates an exception if the listcontains more than one elements
also lets you export result sets as csv xml and html
in more recent versions of safari you should also be able to choose show web-inspector command-option-i from the develop menu
i have a web application .net if it matters where when one of the pages is loaded a file on the users local machine needs to be copied upload to the webserver
in any case if you really wanted to do it and you have full control of the client kiosks you could install a windows service on them that can manage file uploads downloads and be controlled via tcp-ip from the web server
i wanted to have more than one controllers and view for same object model in asp.net mvc but it turned out to be a little complicated than i expected
create a custom controllers class that overrides the view method or any other ones that needs to be overriden for this purpose and makes sure the correct view is returned
the controllers takes a larger role in this environment even though the only input it has to deal with are browser requests
child is a subclassing of parent so that means that child can be substituted with parent
child is not a subclassing of parent so that means that child can t be substituted with parent
but if you would have used setter you would only have to change the setter to initializer the object with the provided string
in linq-to-sql that can be achieved like this
now in some sense getbalance may not be relevant enough to argue that getter and setters are good because it doesn t or maybe shouldn t have an accompanying setter and speaking of which a function called setbalance float f could be bad in my opinion because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the class which is not a good thing
i suppose this was part of what you found whereas this is more targeted towards laptop multicore processor
i add another problem the latency wich may be higher than with a dedicated-server
this is much closer to dynamic-dispatch than dynamic-binding
xslt apply-templates is much richer and deeper than xslt for-each even
just an fyi this is more a limitation of a 32-bit os rather than being a windows-xp problem
what files actually have to be copied for asp.net-mvc web applications to run
i have created a wn32 project with visual-studio 2008 and visual c++ language it uses the ws2_32.lib library and then i compiled in release-mode
thing is ultimately anything that s encode has to be decode before it can be shown and any sufficiently-talented hacker can trace their way through your decoding routine and figure out how it works
vmware created pocket ace edition for this exact scenario of enabling virtual-machines to be run from usb drives
if you re a linux user and you also use gnome then i would have to recommend gedit
alternatively do a deep copy of your list into a new _displaycollection list and enumerate through this separate collection which will not be written to except being filled before the display process begins
if an outside constraint requires that the file really be read a line at a time for instance if you need to handle line-oriented input from a tty then fgets probably is your friend as other answers point out but even then the getc approach may be acceptable as long as the input stream is running in line-buffered mode which is common for stdin if stdin is on a tty
if the input streaming ends up unbufferinged then using an explicit buffering of some form will always be faster than getc on a raw streaming
looking through the source code i find large code files more than 2000 line most of them are generated dialogs with lots of code-behind
then you can switch to eager-loading selectively just for items where that is more efficient when you come to the optimisation stage
a misused exception-handling is worse than no error-handling at all as you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception-handling to find the error in seconds
as you ll be able to see at this demo page everything pretty much works at least in opera and firefox save for the gradient being ever so slightly off at the end hover to be shown the hex value
if you don t need to enumerate the widgets in sorted order don t use the sortedlist it will be slower than the dictionary o n log n insertion deletion retrieval vs
more than one initializer in a for-loops
more than one increment in a for-loops
in term the ui object implements a ui_view interface and registers itself with a view controllers that is situated lower in the object hierarchy
if it contains a syntax-error then that error has to be diagnosed at instantiation
at the web host layer we will create a windows communication foundation service and generate a compact framework client proxy to send the gps tracks to a host webserver - where finally the gps trail can then be viewed using linq silverlight deep zoom and virtual earth
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms
you have two routes one is the empty string no parameters which matches controllers home action index
the other is your hash route which matches controllers home action requestlink
you will be pleased to know that binary-tree have an interesting property they can be represented as arrays
java works better than c or c++ but it still requires many more line of code to implement an application than scala does
conventional thinking is that unmanaged-code is marginally faster than managed-code so it s strange that you perceive a performance increase in going the other way around.
that is why when you are trying to tokenize and parse a large file parsing is expected to be used while regex can simply find special pattern s inside the file
something can belong to a more than one category subcategories make sense most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an is-a relationship for example a windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their my documents folder because a resume is a document it would make sense that it s in my documents as well if you think of the folders as categories
remember that oracle s implementation is closer to postgresql than to sybase genesis of ms sql server so performance will be different for each on different tasks.if you can avoid the hustle of tweak for performance on systems that can swap able back-ends go for least common denominator if you need to work with both
ive been looking everywhere for something that could manipulate animated gif files server-side preferably through php but simple cmd-line tools that could be executed via exec would do also
this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw developers and it intends to provide a minimal set of unix-like tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on windows
in case your program needs more than positional arguments when the cmd-line usage is important you should consider options and switches
in my current project i ve noticed that when writing java most of the classes will be less than 100 line long and often when the size approaches 200 line the class does many unrelated things and it is possible to split it up so as to get more focused cohesive classes
features like publishing are only available in moss so your cms localization requirements may not be satisfied with wss
the built in date class handles overflow very well this can be used to add or subtract time
any addresses that aren t specified can either be handled per message or just default to whitelist or blacklist again user specified
i would recommend using vml canvas via the excanvas library which allows you to write code using the html5-canvas element which is automagically translated to vml in ie trident browsers in addition to the new canvas-text library
the text mode takes much less memory and on linux you can easily start a run from the cmd-line and put it into background
i believe that there was a comment somewhere that implied that accessing local-variables is faster than accessing class-variables
the nice thing about using nsoperationqueue and nsoperation is that they handle the background threading for you so i d highly recommend having a look at the apple docs for those classes and also at the apple threading guide
it can store just about everything so long as each memcached key-value pair is less than 1mb
imagine if user can ask a heavy report that may take some minutes to generate instead of click and wait he can choose send me the latest report .when it is ready
i set up my true business objects as close to mutator-free as humanly possible then i use a set of dto objects that are designed to be serialized public properties blank constructor etc. it s not an ideal solution but i have found that if you try and mix very rich object sets with serialization it can get ugly
performance was about 10 faster than 32-bit and was nearly identical whether you were just using 64bit types to reverse bits on two 32-bit ints at a time or whether you were actually reversing bits in half as many 64bit values
however it cannot be called a copy-constructor
which is artificial intelligence a rule engine that uses the rule based approached to implement an expert-system and is more correctly classified as a production rule system
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework
from my initial reading of brokered kerberos authentication once the user credentials are provided then a kerberos security token will be returned and authentication is not required for each web service call
i recommend switching over to another searching plugin like thinking-sphinx
such namespaces are best practice they ll add less than 1 line of boilerplate to any xpath calls which you can turn into a helper method and require about 15 lines of helper code to generate a prefix uri map but that is the only downside and you won t always encounter it
set arguments to the double quotes should be included otherwise any spaces in your path will muck things up
engine default is aes128 it s not compatible with windows-mobile 2003 or windows-ce 4.2
you can return more than one model but it will require a compound model for the view and the use of prefixes when binding the controllers parameter
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a popup
of course as with anything like this your mileage may vary and since i only used joomla briefly i can t say that drupal is necessarily better than it
apache has a built-in proxy module but i ve heard that squid has better performance
test at a lower level by having the emailtosms.php script as a simple wrapper that processes the cmd-line args and then pass off to more testable class
i haven t done any vba coding for several years but i recall that access-vba had an eval method that could be used to evaluate code represented as a string
the original developer apparently feared objects would be cloned like primitive types if ref was not used and did not bother to research the issue before writing 50k+ line of code
i mean a shell script or perl python ruby tcl whatever to do that is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of work
one thing to be aware if you re animation text dynamic text looks better animated when you ve got the font embedded also if you plan to animate rotation or alpha you will need to embed fonts otherwise you won t be able to animate those properties
in this case more than one selectedindexchanged event is raised one for the shift-click which selected the item that was shift-clicked and one to select all the items between the original selection and the shift-clicked selection
a heap is a tree where a parent nodes s value is larger than that of any of its descendant nodess
to begin with i want to be able to select cell diagonally apart from horizontally and vertically
unless you really really want to develop for kde only and are determined to use kde functionality that goes above and beyond qt i would choose qt-creator
as someone who s used asp.net for a couple of years and zend framework for a couple of years php itself for many years and asp.net-mvc briefly i would definitely choose php and zf
if the frame is no longer minimize i want to restore the other frames too
the reason i m doing this is to better debugging a windows service and allow easier profiling of the code
actually groovy also has optional static typing so i ll include it as well but most static-type uh types seem to prefer scala
if the requested size is zero then you get back whatever malloc 0 might return which is often usually a null pointer but might be a non-null pointer that can also be returned to free but which cannot legitimately be dereferenced
for example in c# a property can be given setter and getter like this
in the relatively unlikely event that you re working on an oracle windows environment oracle on linux is more widely used in low-end oracle deployments good windows distributions of both perl and python can be downloaded from activestate
cell columns issues can possibly be solved with css if you take ie8 into account but it will be many years until its wide spread even ie7 in 2-3 years hasn t reached the desired market share
i haven t found a satisfying explanation of multiple hashing specifically why combining two different 32-bit hashes is considered better than a smooth 64bit hash
personally i d recommend avoiding mfc in favour of wxwidgets
so that you can declare a collection or a method parameter as some base type and include pass it a mix of derived types and yet when within the code even though each object is assigned to a ref variable declare as the base type for each one the actual implementation which will be executed for any virtual method call will be that implementation defined in the class definition for the actual tyoe of each object.
when developing with mono for an app to be run on windows and mac osx and maybe linux which would you suggest winforms or gtksharp for the gui and why
since the .net runtime will only load assemblies when they are actually needed the winforms assembly should never actually be loaded through any usage of system.web
lots of highly useful tutorials are to be found here asp.net-mvc tutorials
if you wish to enable disable show hide controls based on the role this would be nothing more than security by obscurity since switching off styles or setting a browser to a specific css file to override what is actually served would easily display all that is secret
this is a gcc-win32 development environment that can be used to building python and a wide variety of software
the object will stay in memory non-deterministic memory management for a while longer but the file will be closed .when you say so ready to be opened again right away
i read another post about using the pdf ifilter driver installed with adobe acrobat 9 which can be referenced through com
i have a table view which cell can be clicked to get to another tableview which is populated by nsxmlparser
finally i was ready to deliver it and be done .when they asked if i could just make it run on the web first
once you upgrade to a new versioning of visual studio you will be forced to upgrade your project files as well
if i bind gridview to sqldatasource then the first time page will be created gridview will display columns retrieved from data source
note that your target range can be more than one cell when using copy-paste so you need to handle and test this case
if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net
i definitely recommend getting selenium-ide if you don t know what you re doing because it does most things automatically and gives you an intro to how you would use selenium remote control
you should provide a base argument as paolo mentions for otherwise it may be interpreted as octal if it has a leading 0 or hex if it has a leading 0x
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb
the ide doesn t have to be sophisticated text-editor will do
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist
however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each request if it is different than what the server expects an entire list will be sent instead of a list of changes
edit thanks to a commenter whose name is probably not null for pointing out that union-all is faster than union .
amazon flexible payment service stands somewhere in the middle offering more flexibility than paypal google checkout but still having the third party account limitation
as far as being out of luck when the cloud is down that was true if my dedicated-server went down - it never did but if there was a hardware crash on my dedicated-server i am not sure it would be back on-line any quicker than rackspace could bring their cloud back up
linq is so much more than linq-to-sql
a couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql mysqland a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining products - i like one or two vm s because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road off-site as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small vm s
the reason i choose this instead of other systems i prefer coding in python for instance is because deployment with tcl tk is close to unbeatable
if you are connecting to other sites besides localhost the host field will have to be updated usually hostname ip-address or www works
if you want to run notepad inside your app you would probably be better of with a text-editor component
i have a c# project for which i need to automate the build and i am trying to choose between nant and msbuild
however if there are more than one textbox ie doesn t auto postback the form on enter press instead it fires the button s onclick event
if the conditional operators is more efficient than the equivalent if-else assignment why can t if-else be interpreted more efficiently by the compiler
it would be plausible for a non ieee754 double precision 64bit floating point number to have less than 32-bit of precision
you might introduce a renderer level between controllers and page
that function will be executed .when the document is ready
i think the biggest reason why composition is easier to test is that implementation inherited tends to create very coupled classes that are more fragile fragile base-class and harder to test in isolation
i m mentioning this because in java you ll probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing using http get for download and post for upload with less than 100 line of code
one difference which i am sure will be rectified over time is the expansive amount of reference material and examples online for webforms versus the relatively sparse amount for asp.net-mvc
the federal enterprise-architecture can be viewed as either an implemented enterprise-architecture or a proscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise-architecture
your web-config app-config file must be changed in order to include the following
edit even after uncommenting the line to clean up the leaks the leaks utility complains even more than it did when there was leaks
i recommend using vmware to create virtual-machines and separate the mysql server from the web server
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public
wxwidgets was fairly easy to pick up had everything i needed and was way easier than mfc
to make it worse packets with push flag sometimes come first so i just pass them along to parser and then packet that preceds it comes and parser just discards it as corrupted
if you don t have to use c then i would recommend perl or python
this can be put in an onload ready function if you like but if so the var script must be calculated at include-time and not in the ready function .when that executes more script s will have been parsed
of course i have only written the tiniest of iphone apps and am not very familiar with javascript or the dom so i could be way off base here
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app
the author of deconvolucy appears not to have supplied a default-value that was consistent in type with the inputs.
adding the required controllers ending makes it less likely that you would accidentally expose an object through mvc routing
i know that could be achieved with windows-server 2003 windows-server 2008 or similar
rather than show you my actual schema which is much more complicated i ll show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and datamodel
this is one area that silverlight is much harder to use than wpf
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl
in my experience the only way to reliably test this process is clearing browser caching closing all browser instances to get rid of the session cookie then opening the browser and going straight to the page you want to test
i am trying to get gallio to be called from msbuild in a teamcity build configuration
we only used the standard nxt software with the kids because of fll contest rules.if you prefer using procedural languages the nxt is still a great platform for learning but you d need to switch to an alternative development-environment like one of these
from this wikipedia page i see the following disk encryption methods that are can be used on bsd freebsd or netbsd
in what ways is it better than either the kernel used in bsd and or linux
previousselectedion survives long enough to be recorded on click
if you had a button you had to name rather than the menu to store this would export is shorter than save as be sufficient criteria to selected one over the other
you can be notified of navigation controllers changes but i don t believe you can prevent them from happening uinavigationcontrollersdelegate protocol
in brief all integers are promoted to at least int size which may be 64 bits before any arithmetic operations and to the size of the larger operands for binary-operators if this is of greater rank than an int
if python is more readable and more maintainable than c++ for your job and you don t need what c++ offers then certainly stick with python
you ve gotta remember that this article was written for c++ which is nowhere near as advanced as delphi on the memory management front
in any case this option works much better for me use visual studio tools menu select options -- text-editor -- xaml -- miscellaneous
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning
sure this is much more initial work than inserting a confimation messagebox but instead of shifting the responsibility it attempts to solve the problem
normally when compiler reports use of an uninitialised value -wuninitialized in gcc you check for inline unrolls as your uninitialised value can be declared and not initialised for example 10 levels of inline function-calls or template unrolls higher than actual gcc report
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base-classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state
the kernel has a more low-level view of the hardware each cpu is a separate object very different than how it looks like for user-space processes in user-space cpus are almost invisible
something similar be done with code-coverage tools like cobertura
merge sort algorithm aside nested for-loop with iterator s is just as valid as nested for-loops with two variables i and j
is it good form to compare against std vector iterators it iter for my last two if-statements if the for loops might change them on its next pass
suppose i have the following xml document which has no default namespace defined and information element is not prefixed with any namespace prefix
custom attributes are meant to be accessed at runtime using reflection
also are you sure when you profiled your code the code-coverage was enough to cover all the code-paths which might be executed on target-platform
if you need to write much more than 10 line of code to pass one new test you probably are doing something wrong
i can t remember the exact steps in 2k8 as i ve only had to do it once but in 2k5 you had to open the sql server configuration manager select sql native client configuration client protocols and enable tcp-ip and named pipes - it s a similar process for 2k8 as i recall
i ve tried showing a form and loading the image but when the preview form show i lose focus for the listbox which means that when i move the mouse the preview image does not change when i go to the next item in the list
if i recall correctly linq does not call any property procedures but directly sets and reads all the private field value directly which can only be done via reflection as far as i know
i m working on a windows application and i want to show some status messages at cmd-prompt while executing the windows application how can i do that cmd.exe can be run through windows code.but i don know how to show some message at cmd-prompt or if there is any way to do something like console.writeline message through windows application
i believe that constructor injection is far more commonly used right now and property injection is widely seen as a fallback for cases where it is not feasible to get the di container to perform object construction for you asp.net webforms
if you want to generate a .py file that people will actually use maybe so that they can fill out a form and get a useful .py file to insert into their project then you don t want to change it into an ast and back because you ll lose all formatting think of the blank line that make python so readable by grouping related sets of line together ast nodes have lineno and col_offset attributes comments
both line of input should be underlined when printing
else i agree with adam robinson s answer - if you just want to hold the day of a week stick with the dayofweek enum zero is sunday instead of using an integer
using javascript is it possible to detect when a certain element is no longer visible such as when the user scrolls down far enough or when the browser is minimize or covered with another window
can the tfs proxy be installed on windows-xp
if you re looking for something as simple as notepad but with some syntax highlighting check out notepad++
even if you re not familiar with ruby s c internals it s pretty clear that this function has a for loops iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is t_module and then uses a while-loops iterating downward to actually include the modules - so the modules in include x y z would actually be included in the order z y x
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu
i recommend dojo at the current moment it is the fastest javascript-framework on most browsers
i find this is less mentally taxing then building cmd-line pipes
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksortheapsort or any other sort algorithm
the view that must be shown contains following controls 2 textbox 3 labels a button and linkbutton
average asymptotic order of quicksortis o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops
we currently have a website that has user account functionality but we are looking to provide an api to allow users to manage their accounts perform actions via other devices websites by providing an api for common tasks
in case you could go only with .net it s better to choose .net 3.5 and wcf framework instead of .net 2.0 remoting the last one is dead and unsupported technology
it runs on the jvm use the groovy language that in many aspects is more close from scripting languages while it s not and the grails architecture will remind you the ruby-on-rails one
aside from that i can t think of any situations where i d prefer webforms over asp.net-mvc at this point
for the backend i d recommend java or python because they are multithreading and nio-capable
imho asp.net-mvc allows you to factor code much better than webforms so i think developers with lots of patterns experience will be more comfortable in asp.net-mvc
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux
v will select line that do not match
the 32-bit version can still be installed on 64bit windows but the functionality doesn t show up in the default 64bit explorer
if all you are doing is simple concatenation i d argue that code-readability is more important and i d leave it like you have it
you can a have a button save it is the controllers has to know which action must be executed insert or update
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content
i have one group in main report shows header information and pass one parameter - reportid to each subreport
since this is a client app i thought about putting a scrollbar in the category section so it can expand without causing the ui to blow out
wcf supports way more transport protocols http in various ways tcp msmq and more has a lot richer security model credentials federated security and offer options for hosting - self-hosting in a windows app or service in iis or was and more
i m realizing that pulling in a weather rss feed might be the only clean solution but i am not very familiar with parsing rss feeds so it will require a lot of labor on my end since i ll be digging through documentation
for example if you have a score field that is only meaningful with value between 1 and 100 then you have no business storing it in an int class whose range is -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647
in the left pane right-click the visualsvn-server item and choose properties from the context menu
they should always be written to handle multiple row insert updates or deletes or sooner or later your triggers will cause data integrity problems
in ms access the relationships tool shows the db tables as little movable boxes that can be linked with line
finally select the first link in document order in case any of those node-sets had more than one element
when i try to define an overriding default constructor that takes 3 field and sets the fourth to a default value 0 i get errors in the instantiation part of the code not the constructor definition complaining that my object must be initialized by constructor not by ...
well with oracle-xe if you hit the limits you have to either buy oracle or migrate your entire application to a different database
a few things to be aware of if you choose oracle-xe
completely agree wcf is way too bloated and much slower in comparison to .net remoting which is slower than managed socket code which is again much slower than native iocp code to hand rolled code
you haven t provided much information but unless you re already an oracle expert i see no reason to choose oracle xe over postgresql
also if you re writing a value that s larger than the native word size 32 bits on an x32 processor the writes are not atomicity - so the high 32 bits of a 64 bit write will hit the bus at a different time from the low 32 bits of the write
for a bit more info the first chapter of the asp.net-mvc 1.0 book is online and can be downloaded for free
where any string thatcontains commas will be bounded by double quotes - things could potentially get interesting if you ve got commas inside quoted strings so you may have to set limits to how clever you want to be what the provided data can contain
the postfix-operator has the same priority as the pointer resolution but the prefix-operator has a lower priority
to be honest though i like the websites i go to to be consistent so i would like your javascript files to be retrieved via http
if it is a lot of code say more than 5-10 line of code or more than 50 of the total amount of code in the parent method i would extract it to a private method for code structure and readability
sadly this is not possible with oracle-xe as there is no support for java in that free edition
having said that i would argue that the iterator is faster since at does range checking as well it throw an out_of_range exception if the index is out of bounds
if you are showing 100 records page use json to pass the data from the server as javascript can parse it quickly and then use innerhtml to put the html as the dom is much slower in rendering tables
i m new to c# been a pascal lover until i found c# in depth.in delphi there is a try statement that is also implemented in c#
if memory serves me well tomcat or the isapi tomcat connector would never be given the basic authentication headers supplied by internet explorer as iis took those away after failing to use the credentials for the windows authentication which i did not ask for when sending the authorization required response in tomcat...
xml imposes more overheads than json yaml
using asp.net-mvc it s better to try to go client so jquery or others is the better
that way you can accept more less than 3 line of data but that s only necessary if the number of line you want to accept is variable
the problem is that in order to achieve the results i had to include the subsonic source in my solution alter the generation templates for the data objects and add entirely new templates for a super type that could serve paged sorted and filtered strongly typed collections
i know it can be done using custom-plugin data source but that is only enabled with windows-server 2003 enterprise edition
this is more of a subsonic 3 solution but have you seen rob s screencast using subsonic3 t4 and the jquery grid to do pretty much most of what you are asking above paging sorting filtering
a cursor over the result set so the function can be called one row at a time
personally i try to avoid using stored procedures as much as i can but for this case i see them as the best option loading all the entities just to increase the value of 2 field seems pretty much an overkill especially if the call is going to be made through ajax
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears
i have a datagridview control which i am using and i added my handler below to the datagridview.cellformatting event so the values in some cell can be made more human-readable
i find that much more useful than linq-to-sql
if it is important to match everything there are other line that would match this you can say
as you pointed out the resulting worst case for a tree is worse than o log n and could end up looking simply like a linked-list
my code functions can definitely be grouped into category
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc
while it does let the user browse for a directory it s not as intuitive as folder browser dialogues that i ve seen in installers in the past
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free
but what is really neat is their nature if you are using the latest scr the service component runtime which is anextendser bundle implements the new and improved osgi r4.2 ds - declarative service - specification your classes will not import anything from the osgi model
this approach paid out very well resulting in fast development no overhead at all and a framework which actually was mightier than most java frameworks out there but with only a few hundred line of code in a single file plus some simple mod_rewrite rules
add functions to the wrapper to create and destroy instances of the library
weborb is also a very good choice but they are mainly focused on .net that s what i m using it for so you would have to compare amfphp zend-amf and weborb
so no i would not be concerned about this aspects at all
i think the recent release of gae meaning that gwt-rpc can be used for free would ve helped
and diskid32 run on windows-vista ultimate 64-bit
if you got into childselectedion or anything more than just root elements and id classes this could get messy fast
can be used with either cpython or ironpython
the time and effort taken to type the attribute name above the method cannot possibly be less than the time and effort needed to write the reset code which should be in its own method as well so you don t copy-paste a magic number everywhere
i have already done lot of the work but now i have more than 600 line of code pho only per page and more than 20 database tables only for storing and geting the movie data many-to-many relationships
in an orm like mysqlor oracle when you start adding more nodes if you join two tables that are not in the same node the join cost is higher
if you ve got twonodes with no parent that is more like a forest than a tree
all of the three options you mention seem like perfectly valid ways to do this but registering these hits at the same time as returning either the .swf or the .xml config file seems like a smart thing to do because afaik most browsers have a pretty low limit to the number of concurrent http-request they can make to the same host i think it s two or something like that so if more request have to be made in order to render something in the browser the ones going over this limit will have to wait for the first ones to finish before being initiated
keep in mind that asp websites and vb6 applications can be migrated to vb.net with little to no pain
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript
if you are going the with a java back-end i would recommend hibernate for your jpa jsf with richfaces ajax skinning and facelets view rendering templating for your front-end and seam to put it all together
however even if installing firebug does not appeal to you i d recommend checked out firebug lite which requireds no installation into the browser nor in fact does it even required firefox
imo declare a constant with default-value is a better way
if you are doing full-out processing all the time in your threads you won t benefit from having more threads than processor
i d recommend wcf though as the programming api is more simple imho and wcf will give you more flexibility with regards to.network transports etc
your adaptor would be passed a frame and one of your hashtable-based dtos
so to do this properly the file s revision number should be updated at svn checkout update
no ruby is not better than php or python
on the other hand php is better suited than ruby for writing a one-off short backend for an email submission form
python has list comprehensions php is much better when embedding and generating html
the other advantage of having a view model is that because it is shamelessly tailored to a particular view your real model is more reusable because it doesn t have to make any weird concessions to make it suitable for ui display needs to implement inotifypropertychanged or serialization or any of that mess
note however that due to the larger adresses 32-bit is 4 bytes 64bit is 8 bytes a 64bit jvm will require more memory than a 32-bit jvm for the same task
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles
implement the forms as usercontrols instead put them onto the same form and show and hide the controls as appropriate this can also be achieved by loading the forms stripping form borders and such and setting their parent to a panel or something similar
i think you are going to need to do some user validation and i would be tempted to put keys to the decryption in a separate database and provide some other mechanism to get that out which should require authentication
the onchange event is only called when you have changed the value of the field and it loses focus
use the xmlignore attribute to mark a property to be ingnored in serialization deserialization
it looks like you are expecting a soap packets with an asmx service and jquery is more suited to hitting a restful service generated from an ashx file or wcf service
you can plug a remote debugger into a running jvm and get all kinds of information about a running application that is simply impossible with python ruby etc
about this topic http-methods usage i recommend reading this blog post
for instance you should checked which of your dependencies are required and which ones can be made optional
as to reading from a named pipe they can be treated like any other file with the caveat that they will block until the other side of the pipe is set up
this is more of the dry style of configuration assuming the configuration for each environment is pretty similar
my impression is that the fastest but most expensive route to doing application delivery across those three oses is to buy allegro but an alternative more work but cheaper would be to use ccl on os x corman on win32 and ecl or sbcl on linux
note that this should also match any characters that are alphabetic not just the usual roman alphabet s set and therefore also matches accented characters etc
however since these tend to have significant side effects the security aspects trumps this a lot of the time out of fear
while i would not recommend this there is a way to revert back to how clr 1.0 and 1.1 were behaving by setting application compatibility flag in app-config file
then i discovered asp.net-mvc january 2008 and since then although i still master asp.net webforms i will always prefer asp.net-mvc
i can t seem to get the while-loops of more than one field working for the life of me
but if the user does not select any value on the picker coz they want to select the 1st option which is already selected this method is not called and the selection is not reflected in the variable
and i d use a quicksortrather than bubble-sort
for a installed client application then arguably java has the better portability - but with things like compact-framework micro framework silverlight etc .net is catching up
for example some do better by building dom objects some setting all of it to the innerhtml of a single non-tree dom nodes then adding it to the tree etc
what would be perfect is keeping the percentheight and width while child width is smaller than parent a width
value types are created on the stack unless nested within a reference type there is something about field locations on the stack that the clr can t guarantee that they will be zeroed out contrary to field locations on the managed heap which are guaranteed to be zeroed out
authentication shall be separated from authorization
if you are doing this with linq-to-sql within your applicaiton it isn t much different but in general linq is easier to write debatable of course
linux development is more diverse with hundreds of compilers text-editor ides etc
full list of reserved keyword can be found here reserved-words
static-code-analysis for java can be automated with apache maven which can be extended with many analysis plugins like findbugs checkstyle or pmd
i am not familiar with python but if it is like php this will have no advantage over method 2
it would mean creating rows and cell to add to the table but it would give you more control over the layout
httpclient also supports handling basic authentication so the authorization header can be refactored out depending on how deep your changes go
how to select .net-framework-version running from excel
and python is slower above hundred times than c++ in execution time 100 1
this will work even if you are not root since it only fetch the source code to the app-name and put it in the current directory which is easier than having to track down the source and there is a better chance to get it work since you download the version that should work on your system
i would choose asp.net-mvc over asp.net webforms for one reason testing
testing asp.net-mvc is orders of magitude easier than webforms due to the ability to mock or replace parts of the core api
swt is an alternate toolkit for java that has slightly less cross-platform compatibility than swing but is still popular nonetheless
is there a good rule of thumb for when nonatomicity properties should be used in objective-c on the desktop or on the iphone platform as opposed to the default atomicity properties
also be aware that single-digits integers in your lexer will not be matched as integer they will come out as digits
from xcode you can right-click the project and select add - existing files... when you have selected all your files click add then select the checkbox at the top copy files...
if you call decode ... you try to interpret the characters as some encoding that still needs to be converted to unicode
note that if your dirpath arguments has several leading directories only the last one will be included by default
obviously groovy is slower than straight java
could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding basichttpbinding
the udf approach has slightly better metadata and composability compared to stored procedure - for example you can add addition where skip take etc to a udf query and have it run at the database but last time i checked only linq-to-sql not entity framework supported udf usage
the xml schema is written in relax ng since it seemed like a neater and more modern than xsd and dtd loose assumption
i m parsing some html using regex and i want to match line which start with a word without any html tags while also removing the white space
i reckon it s better than asp.net ajax for webforms
the rubygems feature set is a little larger than just packaging in involves package distribution and installation
it could be doing the temp table renaming if you are trying to add a column to the beginning of the table as this is easier than altering the order
an alternative would be to show the dialog hide it immediately show a topmost progress form instead and then hide that but i think showing a single dialog is more seamless an experience for the user
i would have thought the inherited class should call the base-class s count function
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work
whether that s perl or python or ruby or whatever i choose perl but that s not always for everyone it s just something that will allow you to bypass the shell for quoting
i strongly recommend named paramters as you can later add features by passing get params without having to worry about the order
in c# i d almost certainly write it in more than 10 line even though it would be feasible in 10
if you have more than one hosts header on your website in iis you need to have each one represented in the hostss-file
the return value can be used exactly as a tuples and has the same speed and memory properties so you don t lose any genericity
you re looking for something easier than 5 line of code
an example that illustrates the difference can be found in this question where the op wants to do part of a linq-to-sql query in sql server bring the objects into managed code and do the rest of the query in linq to objects
the false positives may arise if you are using older valgrind with newer gcc and glib valgrind 3.3 with glib 2.9
you should create a dependencies it doesn t have to be called this folder within your solution thatcontains any pre-compiled dlls you require
either that or you can reload the page when theselectedion is made which is likely to be done in javascript anyway
or if you do ask why this is any better than having one big map hash table associative arrays to hold all entities in your app and lots of functions most of them duplicared cut and paste and out of date doing switch cases or rtti to figure out the real type of each entity
in addition to the answers from mssrs information and mouviciel nsarray is faster than nsmutablearray
many of my utilities that allow default for the arguments tend to be written with explicit checks in the beginning like this
is there an easier way with l2s than count before and count after and taking the difference
if you ve got more than one radio-button which i m hoping you do then you really can t use getelementbyid without all this extra looping logic etc.
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digits limitation of floating-point variable
well i am catching the soapexception but when i display the message on the client end in a messagebox it shows more information than i really want to show
not possible with generics but with c++ cli s variadic-templates when it gets support for them you can do it
do note that the wanted elements will be produced in any desired order because we are using the xpath 2.0 sequence type vs the union in the xslt 1.0 solution which by definitioncontains items in any desired specified order
but if you looking for an alternative to page.postback then i would recommend jquery but from the question it seems as if you re new to ajax so assuming you know javascript hopefully you know that first to understand how jquery works
another option would be to set a sort of fluctuation threshold where you don t do any recalculation until the speed changes by more than that threshold
found the solution turns out that the body should not be wider than the report size so for example if you have a standard letter page 8.5 x 11 than the body should be less than 8.5 pay special attention if you have margins since you have to subtract those inches too i want a one inch margin per side so left and right would sum up two inches
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster
but this works better global bool variable appactive to keep track of active-window
one more caveat a sortable field must have no more than one value stored in each field
but if it s just for sending data usually json is more compact than xml
also you need to transfer these instructions to and from the cpu 64bit instructions are twice as big as 32-bit instructions which means more traffic to and from memory and the caches
in what ways is it better than either the kernel used in bsd and or linux
rules like no gotos no global variables one return per function functions should be less than x line of code etc
it should have a visual environment where one can use a point and click interface so that it is possible to select objects with mouse and move them around
we already have xml why is json better apart from being native to javascript
json is generally much smaller than its xml equivalent
as the probability you mention will tend to many alternating streaming parts like 0101010 this will give you many streaming parts like 111111 which can usually be compressed better by usual compression algorithms
or it could even be hooked to mouse or keyboard events so that when the user doesn t move the mouse or isn t using the keyboard the timer counts down until it reaches the log off time
they show that python is up to about 400 times slower than c++ and with the exception of a single case python is more of a memory hog
my experiences with python show the same definite trend that python is on the order of between 10 and 100 times slower than c++ when doing any serious number crunching
is much shorter than either its python or c++ equivalents
you may find that asp.net-mvc gives you more control over the html and hence more ability to meet any requirements
what algorithms can be used to draw a binary-tree in the console
if i would have to write application to transform images and had to use python too all the processing could be written in c++ and connected to python via bindings while interface and process control would be definetely python
code some method on the supplier to iterate through all products and set the product s supplier to null and use this method before deleting any suppliers
there are a lot of answers here that prefer json over xml
value change listener cannot be used to alter the values being changed fyi they are invoked in the validation phase
i have been happily using cvs for over 10 years and now i have been told that git is much better
if you have more than one cpu then one cpu reads the file and parses the data into lines the other cpu takes each line and processes it
if your application does some computing that takes longer than the time period specified in net_write_timeout between two calls to mysql_fetch_row the mysql-server considers your connection to be timed out
however the table per subclassing strategy n + 1 tables and n joined-subclassing elements in one mapping file makes more sense in my case because i want to put some constraints on the subclassing tables
ejb3 defines jpa api and hibernate can be used as persistence provider for jpa
in the future i might still write some parts of the application code in java but for the tests i would prefer using scala ruby groovy or similar language with a more flexible syntax
i used max because i assume a customer may have more than one invoices
i had to do nothing more than selected the right answer in a couple of checkbox
i used to be one of the cookie module testers and i don t think there is any design reason this would behave differently although if you crash the session-cookies might be designed to live on when you restart...
json s a text-based object serialization format that s more lightweight than xml and that directly integrates with javascript s object model
ajax is no more than a fancy name for a technology that allows javascript to make http-request to a server which usually implements some handlers that produce specialized light-weight content for the javascript caller comonly encoded as json
regarding replicate the page s behavior from c# using the webrequest webresponse - what you have to realize is that like i said earlier the javascript ajax call is nothing more than an http-request
my goal is to load the results of the rest request into a traverse-able xml datamodel which i can then grab elements and their values from
basically the issue is i have a flash movie which contains a text box and if the user click in the text box and drags to select highlight text and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse then the flash move doesn t receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash
in asp.net-mvc it is even easier - you just send the program object to the view as the model object and loop through its stakeholders and outcomes in a couple of nested for loops directly on the view
i guess an aspects could be fired upon any c r ud operation inserting a log row in this table
save as uses the actual href value whereas selecting the link otherwise can be intercepted keyboard mouse down and up click to set the location to something else
static initializers can be used to set the value of any static variables in a class which should be more efficient than having an if somestaticvar null do stuff block of code at the start of each constructor
both of these cases assume that the code required to set these variables is more complex than simply var value as otherwise there wouldn t seem to be any reason to use an initializer instead of simply setting the value when declaring the variable
the other thing i ll mention is that unless you need the full-blown oracle just stick with oracle-xe express edition
for high end platforms linux unix tends to be preferred over windows but that s probably not an issue for you
if you re just developing and aren t yet comfortable with oracle make it as easy on yourself as possible and stick with windows and oracle-xe
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup
this is because json can be directly evaluated into a javascript object which is much easier to work with than the dom
elementtree is pure python and celementtree is the faster c implementation
most guides seem to recommend using macports to install ruby and rubygem then using rubygem from there on to install gem
i know on some web sites it will take you to a paypal site for the payment authentication - can this be done over http requests instead of forcing the user to another website which won t be available from the app
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server
incidentally rather than setting the text width tw to some number of characters smaller than your window you could instead set the margins you want to leave on the right side of the window like so
why does everyone like jquery more than prototype scriptaculous or mootools or whatever
you can for instance use a compile-time weaver like postsharp and create an aspects that can be applied to properties
this makes decrement loops more efficient than increment ones
i would have expected the session-cookies to be deleted
can anyone give me some advice on how i can validate marshalled xml to make sure it conforms to the xsd schema
python has much better web tools and frameworks than c++ and its regex handling and standard libraries urllib email etc work very well
using c++ is likely to result in a radically faster application than php perl or python and somewhat faster than c# or java - unless it spends most of its time waiting for the db in which case there won t be a difference
left join are slower than inner-join though this is dependent on what you re doing exactly - can you accomplish what you re looking for with inner-join
with arrival of stl and development of boost parsing text happened to be extremely easy with c++
the hash is meant to be used for caching so i was thinking of md5 or sha1
having a fastcgi web application no matter c++ php perl python ruby etc. gives you better initial startup time than a cgi application
as flexible as this solution is it requires a very deep knowledge of gtk cairo and everything else involved
asp.net-mvc which is way better both in terms of oop design and in terms of graphical informational design
otherwise the object will be copied marshalling by value serialization into the current application domain
if you are stuck to nant try a nightly build if not i recommend msbuild for .net 2+ and 64 bit machines
when is set the webresource.axd handler will automatically set a long cache policy on resources retrieved via it so that the resource is only downloaded once to the client and cached there forever it will also be cached on any intermediate proxy servers
i don t know what equivalent to org.eclipse.jdt.core.jdtcompileradapter should be used for building outside of eclipse on the cmd-line
this uses the knowledge that space precedes any digit in the ascii latin-1 unicode sort sequence and that atomicity numbers are not more than 3 digits
assuming membercount is a numeric column and the values are not more than 4 digits long adjust appropriately if they are longer the query can be written
if you set the tag to display block then it should be centered with margins 0 auto
i will subclassing the pure virtual class in c++ and then likely start with luabind as per aaron and lefticus solutions
in short asp.net-mvc can technically be run by any web server that can allow the website itself to handle the requests instead of the web server handling them
later on obviously you ll prefer http to send your credentials
data cannot be allocated with malloc and free with delete nor delete
if the memory is to be released by free in your or someone elses code it s pretty darn required to use malloc
in c# i ve found problems that couldn t be solved without reflection because of information i didn t have until runtime
one example when trying to manipulate some third-party code that generated proxies to silverlight objects running in another process i had to use reflection to invoke a specific strongly-typed generic version of a method because the marshalling required the caller to make an assumption about the type of the object in the other process was in order to extract the data we needed from it and c# doesn t allow the type of the generic method invocation to be specified at runtime except with reflection techniques
this pattern would also be useful in the event that you want to extends a 3rd party s picturebox that is sealed in which case you would not be abel to extends from it
the deselection .selected false was included to deselect the listviewitem in the .items collection just in case it may have been selected by default and thereforesetting it to true would have no effect
serve static content on a different domain or sub domain this allows more simultaneous http-request
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better
only available under linux unix this is a bit different
mozilla s gecko firefox follows the standard and only allows this method to be called on input elements
if it s windows-server 2008 you ll have to select advanced system settings from the menu on the left after you select properties on my computer
silverlight is another possibility but there are quite major differences between wpf and silverlight and turning a wpf application into a silverlight application requires more rewriting than one might initially think
it s certainly different than webforms -- and knowing webforms can actually be a hindrance in learning asp.net-mvc -- but i m not planning to go back
if you don t have a proper doctype on your page it will be rendered in quirks-mode in ie which means that it uses an incorrect box model where the padding is not added to the size of the element
anyhow how would i given an account name of the format domain user find the relevant number for thier lookup id in the security of the site using only the web-services
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first
also the following topic appears to be related what s a windows text-editor that matches this criteria
mvp is a more modern variation of mvc that fits in better with environments such as windows where the view does user-input and output
the fact that i m using floats shouldn t matter since they can be considered as unsigned int after inverting the sign bit
if you want to send a value in and out of the method one would choose ref
personally i would recommend using asp.net-mvc as it is more intuiative and you have more control over your pages than with webforms
however there s no doubt in my mind that asp.net-mvc is the better option and you should use it as the default option for all future development
i m sure it d turn into more than 10 line of code but have you considered a form based app where pressing the buttons does things like changing the colour of the background or changes the size of the text
silverlight requires only the silverlight player which is available for ie firefox and safari and works on windows and osx and is much smaller than the full .net framework in terms of download size
to go a step further that two line script can also be written in python though it takes eight lines still under the 10 line goal
little play algorithms like minimax game tree search can be done in like three line
i like using haskell much more than sml but i would still teach sml first
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell
in the next iteration you want the m-l-1 th elements of the n-l-1 floats that are bigger than the pivot
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though
i migrate from access to firebird very easily i think firebird is better than mysqlfor delphi
i ve now changed the methods to take and return uint unsigned 32-bit integer instead - this is also in greater accordance with the c++ rotl and rotr functions
my question is is there some way i can be notified in java preferably including the data that changed by the database when a record is updated deleted insert using some sort of triggers semantics
i recommend git and subversion svn both as free open-source version-control systems that work very well
i would recommend reworking this to be based off a timer so it runs repeatedly on regular intervals instead of locked into a while-loops
i use bazaar so this might be a slightly different answer than a git user would give but
each api call can be hundred of line of code
we had to insert parentheses because the subscript operators binds better than the dereference operators and it would otherwise be read as which isn t what we want
sorry that it is more than 10 line
the database contains no more than 50 line of data in all entities it s a new project so it s not waiting on data
the output of ls | cat which is significantly faster might not be enough because that one cannot distinguish files from directories
if there s really a high chance of wasted work by user integration it s better to prevent it through the design of the business-process rather than database locks
java c perl python ruby php i prefer python but are there performance concerns
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes
there are good principles out there such as solid-principles that will allow you to design and build good meaningful classes
i feel that a double-pointers for the target string should be passed to this function which will be like passing the address of the pointers variable and not the pointers itself
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format
based on your summary i had it match any group of 6 digits followed by any length of whitespace including new line then followed by an l and 7 digits
if you re silverlight solution is basic in terms of implementation - ie datagrid of data only - then asp.net-mvc is a better fit as this way you re not having to worry about deep linking etc as that comes free inside a native html based approach
i d recommend getting safari 4 public beta which has a brand new web-inspector that allows you to edit the dom real-time i m not sure whether you can actually edit a css file with it however
it must be a property that prohibits adding text with more than x line but i can t see it
of course you could change your pre-processor checked to be normal code checked which can obviously be switched as required
it must be a property that prohibits adding text with more than x line but i can t see it
for transferring mass data i would usually recommend either just a stored procedure if the processing can be done in the database - or if you need richer code something like sqlbulkcopy hooked to an idatareader - this will allow you to streaming data from one table to the other with the minimum of buffering overhead
if you install and use either of vim or emacs you will have a text editor that can be used on any major platform now and in the future and most of the minor ones too
system.invalidoperationexception value name controllers does not match any of the values
i m struggling to create a table view controllers that has anything more than just a table view in it
this can be done with any language which supports com delphi vb6 vb.net c# c++ ...
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as
an m-way tree can have more than one value per nodes but the theory is still the same
sure - make options an arrays of strings and use .join rather than every time through loops
i am not familiar with python sorry ruby guy typing here however you could try a few things
another problem linq-to-sql is more poco class linq to entities is too complex
linq to entities the entity framework is a lot more complex than linq-to-sql - but it s more complex because it allows a lot more flexibility
a wikipedia link on ntfs symbolic links says the ntrights.exe tool that comes in windows-server 2003 resource kit tools can be used to grant this right on home edition
for example i used it to bind draggable and droppable to some dom elements which will be added through ajax
in c++ the same could be done for copy-constructor and assignment operators
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclassing
i use and recommend xquery over xslt
i would recommend using gcc and getting comfortable with the cmd-line if you plan on doing c for any extended amount of time
i want to be able to not only select rows and columns but also select cell in a diagonal direction
so in an example with multiple threads updating and reading a you won t ever be able to guarantee that the a you re reading is the same value as what you updates from some other thread may have changed the value
now have a list of listener that will be notified on locale change by the first method
can mysql 5.4 beta be compiled for 32-bit processor under linux
my app reads frames from video using pyglet extraction a strip region - full width by 1 to 6 video lines then pastes each strip appends it into an image that can later be written out an .png file
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install
i set a break point at the first line above but for some reason i lose it after webrequest httpwebrequest webrequest.create server
if you start a new project then asp.net-mvc is a better choice
in my install you select select enabled protocols then tcp-ip and properties
i recommend dojo -- i realize it s not quite as popular as jquery number of hits on google dojo 13 millions jquery 13.4 -- but it is better architected and designed
the copy paste works ok if the cells are continuos but if i select with ctrl the first and the third cell when i paste it to the textbox it will paste also the 2nd cell
the resolution sholud be winapi no .net only as various languages can be used eg c++ delphi
a line of inheritance usually goes from the most common and general aspects all the way down to a point where it makes no more sense to be more specific
1 i want to check if the amount has more than 2 digits after the decimal-point
i prefer wicket with a twist of spring quartz etc. over all of the others
does anyone know whether it is possible theoretically or in reality to use the codedom that seems to be provided in delphi s .net counterpart
if anyone would like to help develop a wordpress-plugin or class to do this i would be more than happy to have you on board
however there are some items in the database that are not so sensitive lets say a list of categories that i want to be dynamic...i may then have users with admin privileges be allowed to add and delete a category and the delete could be permanent
for those of you who are working with more complex applications with expression-blend what are your strategies for keeping your projects decoupled in an mvvm way yet at the same time structured in the expression-blend way where you can still see and edit whole parts of your application in a way that makes sense visually so that you can continue to edit them in the blend gui as they scale
i also thought about aspects programming insert tracing code in before and after methods but i don t think aspects programming could be allowed inside this project
they will be forced to upgrade or maintain parrallel versioning of the project file
i recommend ironpython -- among its advantages is the excellent book ironpython in action which will lead you through every important aspects including testing
openmp works in a fairly different way than message-passing libraries openmp uses multiple threads within the same process but mpich and openmpi use multiple processes
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved
another programmer suggested using decode in oracle or case statements in sql-server but this is a more general solution
in my program after clicking on the button - selected listview entries should be copied to richtextbox
this is a better solution because it correctly treats the datedifference as a time period measured in days or seconds in the case of the related time class since the event
and therefore mvc for the web at least as regards interaction between client and server should be less complex with the controllers merely mediating between the client and server
in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomicity properties are faster than atomicity accessors
i know it s probably not as compact as you would like but what s needed to reduce this down effectively yet still retain the strong-typing is higher order generic typess called types classes in haskell a way of indicating that types parameters are themselves generic and can take types parameters
in v6 the capacity was added to connect to non-openedge databases and in v8 to create openedge databases of more than one storage area
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the
several languages such as python can be embedded into c++ so that may be an option
isn t there a simple way to tell linq-to-sql classes that a particular datetime property should be considered as utc having the kind property of the datetime type to be utc by default or is there a clean workaround
subversion works just fine over http https
if you are referring to a http-post only a post initiated it can also be initiated by javascript by a submit button from within the form will be posted to the server
merely opening the ofstream in binary mode does not change the way that the operators work - they will always perfform formatted output
the consequence of that design for user is that importing existing sources into version-control is as simple as git init git add
this will select rows where the labels fieldcontains any of the words in the criteria search string
i find php a more disciplined and therefore sometimes more limiting language than perl
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net
typically when query cost gets order of magnitude more expensive it is because a loop or merge join is being used where a hash join is more appropriate
i ve looked at the w3c s html specifications and while they are very precise with what attributes can be used with elements and also some behavioural stuff such as exactly what gets included with form submission there s nothing about the behaviour of elements
perl has massive frameworks available on cpan which can make it work as well or better than php even in a purely cgi environment
this is somewhat crude but basically tells you whether the clr is running as 32-bit or 64bit which is more likely what you would need to know
are there any standardised set of diagrams or mathematical symbols used in the design of functional programs or are such programs best designed in short functional-pseudo code given that functions will be much shorter than imperative counterparts
diagrams aren t as necessary because functional programming is somewhat simpler than procedural-programming
this link is a nice tutorial on using regex to match line in a file using c#
this can be used with either div tags or table cell
if leveraging existing community is very important to you and or your project then i do recommend going with asp.net-mvc
i m not sure what could be accomplished with this approach that couldn t more easily be accomplished with the visitor-pattern as drew noted
then you have a endxxx method which takes the iasyncresult returned by the beginxxx operation plus any ref and out arguments which is invoked when the call is to be completed either after callback waiting on event in the iasyncresult or by blocking
the class itself can be marked abstract but all methods should be empty virtual-methods not abstract-methods
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction
firstly a copy-constructor is nothing more than
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly
or if that seems like overkill or too difficult with bash tools you could have a heuristic of reading only 5 of the line 1 in every 20 to quickly get a close to exact answer and then refining that if desired
2 sorting a list of base-class pointers where some of the objects may be derived subclassing you only have access to the base-class fields
also hard coding a lookup table for say sine cosine values would probably be a lot more efficient than loading it from a file. but hard coding data purely for the sake of convenience is not a smart idea
binary-tree can be created using dynamic arrays in which for each element in index n
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc
also having a serarate mysql user for your php scripts that can only select insert update and delete is probably a good idea.
i would also recommend eclipse-rcp or have a look at netbeans rcp
is there anyway perhaps other than iptables rules to drop this packets before it is seen by libpcap tcpdump
but i want that when i press key the key-values should be displayed in toolbar textfield
i also strongly recommend visualsvn server to setup your svn repository
consolidate some cell to have more than one row if you have a start date and end date put the start date on top and the end date on the bottom
in my opinion besides the endless git is better than subversion is better than cvs -discussion i don t think the differences between them is what matters
it might seem that the decision whether to invest into the scaffolding can be determined as the project-management science would have it by a simple cost-benefit analysis estimate the development cost compare to predicted benefits and if the value of scaffolding is greater than the cost there is a good point in building it
is linq to entities more difficult than linq-to-sql
and the only reason i don t choose nullable types more often is the itchy feeling in the back of my head that makes me feel like it s more than backwards-compatibility that forces that extra
however it will only highlight the characters that exceed the width and then only on line that are actually longer than the width
the second reason is that you are attempting to match b at the end of a line and your test string only has one line that matches this requirement the first two lines end with
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time
alternatively is the pattern of use wrong - it would be straightforward to subclassing the controller again to distinguish between the two and retain common code if that is a more appropriate solution
nesting another if then else inside a for-loops is actually harder to read and maintain later than a nice simple goto with a comment on the goto line saying something like read as continue for
tcp-ip i get the message this version of microsoft sql server management studio can only be used to connect to sql server 2000 and sql server 2005 servers
i wouldn t expect there to be a case in which the arrays search is faster than the dictionary lookup though
i like xom more than dom4j for its simplicity and correctness
the javascriptserializer doesn t require classes to be marked as serialization or as datacontract but the datacontractjsonserializer does
i haven t done very much with this sort of thing but i have seen differences between desktop and mobile-safari how do i make an element scale down to nothing using a css transition on the iphone
then in a few lines you can parse your xhtml into a dom tree and reach down to pick out the list s nodes and do whatever you like with it
if you compile with the highest optimization settings memcpy and memcmp might be replaced with intrinsics by the compiler and never call glib at all
shared hosting is stronger in ruby than java and since you excluded php which is hugely popular in shared hosting that one is going to lean you in ruby s direction
uiviewcontroller can be grouped by uinavigationcontroller or uitabcontroller both of which add navigation elements to navigate between different uiviewcontroller
this will match any strings in which finger or knuckle are contains
iterating over such an arrays would be done using nested for-loops and if you want to perform certain calculations on a per-dimension base you should alter the order of the loops accordingly
varies per system and named pipes are slower than tcp-ip in many
leave requestcontext out altogether to not run any context processor
mvvm base application that can be edited with expression-blend and visual studio
i would expect console.out to be used when writing or debugging your tests whereas trace would be used to display trace output from the code under test
i think that this is clearer than trying to write a loops for the variable names especially for the number of arrays you are maintaining
your wifi adaptor may also have specific apps for creating the initial network device this is the case with madwifi which will create an athx x is numeric device which can be controlled be ifconfig and iwconfig
if more than one table the view trick doesn t extend beyond two tables afaik so you may just have to live with the poor performance or change technology dao is reported faster than ado sql server may be faster than ace jet etc
this is much older that alpha-transparency - think about a clock application you can make your window circular if you wanted even on windows 95
the other aspects to this is that javascript is sometimes used defensively against bots scrapers malware like keysniffers and so on etc for both your security and that of the site
nsoperation and nsoperationqueue can be used for this
the date value from the text field can be fetched by jquery s .val method like
if you are very familiar with oracle-xe you may want to use it but i would like to point out the following reasons for not using oracle
oracle licenses are the most expensive in the business sql express might be better as sql-server is cheaper
it doesn t get much easier than using getopt to parse cmd-line parameters in c c++
is there away to do this that is better than having to html decode the string truncate and encode again
all the actions of the controllers would be called from javascript
in the meanwhile i still stick with firefox over google-chrome for the simple reason that firefox is i non-profit and has a ii huge addon community
error messages should be written to stderr aka console.error and normal output to stdout aka console.out
these streaming support compression levels and deliver much better performance than the built-in classes
typically i define my database connections in a configuration file which can easily be changed between environment development stage production
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division
you might want to try the closest function- it sounds like it s more along the line of what you are trying to do
sql-server express is free faster and more capable .
i m sure that someone must have done this since it is a very weird choice on behalf of the developer not to draw these line
the latter uses gdi which is more modern in terms of text-rendering
the way i see it asp.net-mvc can be achieved in webforms by not including the runat in the form tag
i am not sure how much traffic that your ssrs can generate but i truly believe that a dedicated-server with 4gb ram is much more than enough to just handle 100 concurrent users
no matter what every ace should be counted to sum value as 11 then when the total sum has reached over 21 subtract 10 from hand but the thing is you must make sure you keep a count of how many time you subtract 10 and how many time you add 11 an ace
as others note though most of the time it s easier just to traverse the tree directly as linkednodes
a ternary trie may be faster than a hashmap for a smaller number of elements
svn is faster because it was meant for wan as opposed to vss which is for lan
it could be done via reflection as some libraries already create the tostring orequals methods
naming-conventions are not for the compiler to process the computer does not really mind names but rather for the programmer that is browsing the code to have as much information as possible with as little effort as required
a similar structure might be used per line temporary when editing that line so you don t perform a copy on each key-press
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to char when displaying the result
in order to stop any words wrapping i have to set letter spacing to 1px for example but this then causes the larger words to have a much bigger movie than they need and as the nav is horizontal this pushes the next item too far over to the right
the functions fgets and puts aren t intended to be used with binary data like image files
this is even more elegant because you can theoretically generate infrastructure for any supported building environment thus you are not bound to one specific ide and settings in the helper infrastructure paths etc. don t need to duplicate the main project settings
this will be developed in asp.net webforms c# .net 3.5
you may want to consider json as the data protocol as the jquery library is far more accessible to developers and the time to productivity with the framework is far less than with xslt embedded javascript in tags awful syntax and all the other minutia that come with xml xpath xslt on the front end
asp.net-mvc gives you a lot more control over your markup than plain-old webforms so it should be ideal for this
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing
most commonly this can be accomplished using any popular javascript library such as jquery or prototype scriptaculous
you are right about the fact that the subclassing will often take more space than the parent class
plus sql-server 2005+ is way better than mysqlfor serious db stuff
i m the php guy that also does .net that is going to say all things being equal programmer skill with the chosen platform hardware bandwith etc. asp.net with sqlserver is going to be faster than php with mysql at runtime
checkout this guys answer wcf sessions with http
now within this for-loops you can see that elements are added until the total elements height +offset is greater than the listbox itself
within excel this would be accomplished by copying the worksheet to a new workbook not by creating a new workbook then adding the worksheet to it
in order to not have to prompt the user for a username and password every time they launch the application we will expose a login service that validates their username and password on initial launch and returns an authentication token that can be used for future web service requests for real data
i could write this easily with a while-loops but i would prefer not to use a while-loops because the real world application will have a lot more data than four records and will by called by multiple users many times per day
so we can t flatly say that linked-lists always beat arrays for insert delete options
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.
you should use inheritance when subclassing is-a super class both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that
chunked can be used to send a http-request or response in multiple parts and send one part while subsequent parts are not available
for most objects with simple comparisons a quick sort on 10 items will not be noticiably faster than a bubble sort a linear search on 100 items will probably be faster than a binary-tree and so on
there is a very good reason to use regular expressions in scripting languages such as ruby python perl javascript and lua parsing a string with carefully optimized regular expression executes faster than the equivalent custom while loop which scans the string character-by-character
there are many php frameworks so a lot of the issues of speed of coding diminish if not disappear altogether if you compare ruby on rails to php + some framework or frameworks with which you re equally familiar
ruby is slanted twoards prototype being integrated and the like whereas php is more open to any javascript framework which has advantages and disadvantages and both can do whatever in html and css
and of course this splitting can be done with any of the standard text processing tools in unix perl python awk head tail combo
even though the user experience may not be quite as nice the selected with a button degrades more gracefully both when the user does not have javascript and when the user is using accessibility technology
otherwise you could use inner-join makes query more readable
added bonus is that the user can execute groovy code to compute their configuration options much better over using properties files as well as being able to do different environment with ease
i don t agree with all those answers as there is some misinformation there such as firefox being the dictator of what happens in gecko it certainly influences but is not the deciding factor
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment
i m trying to learn how to use managed unmanaged-code interop but i ve hit a wall that 4 hours of googling wasn t able to get over
some of the data appears to have been encode as cp-1252 and not decode as such before being encode as utf-8 and stored in mysql
to me jsf or spring sound like better options than struts these days
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them
however in the web application everything seems to be oriented towards synchronization with the http-request
it s a visibility modifier it means that instance variables declared as private can only be accessed by instances of the same class
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home
the standard states in 5.4.7 that c-style casts can actually do more than any sequence of new-style casts can do -- specifically including casting from a pointer-to-derived to pointer-to-base even when the base-class is inaccessible which is precisely what happens here with private-inheritance
also on the subject of dependencies it is probably best to drop tables first add a decode in your cursor that assigns a lower numeric value to this object type and order the cursor select by this value
if you want a more sensible path you need to tell the algorithm that some paths are more desirable than others effectively weight horizontal vertical as better than diagonal
json is just a nice way to transmit data esp when sending to a webpage as it can be more compact than xml and javascript can parse json faster than xml since json is made for javascript
there are more naming-conventions if you prefer underscores as private field prefix
if i were you i would either pick spring.net or just start building your own framework around asp.net-mvc and fluent nhibernate
this needs to be linked against openssl -lssl but doesn t need libcurl at all
there are no efficiency guarantees on python res any more than on any other part of the language c++ s standard library is the only widespread language standard i know that tries to establish such standards -- but there are no standards even in c++ specifying that say multiplying two ints must take constant time or anything like that
i think that itext is still better for report creation it is more straightforward i had some less than enough experience with jasper-reports and it seemed clumsy
instances of the dsl can therefore be stored in sql-server express or above
the number of organizations working with ruby-on-rails is greater than django
once you re thoroughly familiar with ruby-on-rails and have been working for a bit continue learning django
if you re using innodb tables for acid or just because at more than 30 million rows myisam tables tend to get crappy yes a straight one-table select is probably faster than in pg
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysqls bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysqlfor any even slightly complicated query
i know there is trick to show the whole array in the spreadsheet by selecting a range of cell with the formula + f2 + ctrl+shift+enter but i would prefer vba to handle it all
the whole notion of less than ten line of simple code seems to elicit a mood of show me something clever
in less than ten line i ve verbosified a document
should new networking code with the exception of small cmd-line tools be written with twisted
should new networking code with the exception of small cmd-line tools be written with twisted
is it even possible to have more than 1 asp.net-mvc project application running on the same windows xp machine
is it even possible to have more than 1 asp.net-mvc project
yes it is absolutely possible to have more than 1 asp.net-mvc application at same windows xp machine
you just need to decorate your classes or methods with the attribute and they will automatically be exposed as json or xml depending on the client
the data file which should be modified contains 1500000 line each of them are 800 chars long
debug is good for logging particular occasions of something while trace is better used for dumping method calls parameters and stuff like this
this can be done either with hardware or software os x linux windows-server etc
however for my project i really need this error to be handled just like it is when a method is missing from the controllers class
the easiest way to get the declaration and implementation right is to select the attributes in the datamodeler and choose copy objective-c 2.0 method declarations to clipboard from the design- datamodel menu the paste into your implementing classes .h file
some pages need to be excluded from authentication and authorisation checks such as the login page
i ve set it so that i can debug managed and unmanaged native-code as well as debug not my code but those settings don t seem to matter
the default constructor is the one that can be called without any arguments if there is one
the other approach could be the use of google email docs and calendar - a free friendly way of team interaction....i would shy away from issue bug tracking tools for project-management - they tend to have differ on focus pm tools on the entire project resource timeline and issue tracking tools for specific entered issues..
and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0
for what it s worth my recollection is that many developers had high hopes for stx to be much faster than xslt processor
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows
i am reading path from temp.txt file which has 500 lines each line is a path for specific file to be copied to location c opencascade
the following example shows where is used in the default arguments and implies the less than operator
some extra memory or a few extra processor can sometimes be more cost-effective than development time spent optimising depending on development costs and how much optimisation you are doing obviously .
rather than rolling what is basically your own orm i would recommend switching to one of the established orms such as nhibernate or entity-framework
personally i d rather know everything that s happening in my applications even if that sometimes means more work which is what makes me prefer asp.net-mvc
having been using webforms for a while now i would recommend trying out asp.net-mvc its a good framework and simpler to use than it seems at first
i have a working version of this doing xslt for-each for lookup table but i suspect it is suboptimal and would like to know if i should have used select key cr-lookup cr instead somhow
i can right-click a controllers action and choose add view.
the first part of the boolean expression will evaluate to false and the call to method will thus not be attempted since evaluation the second part is redundant
json keeps things compact and can be faster than xml
in point-to-point situations confidentiality and data integrity can also be enforced on web-services through the use of transport layer security tls for example by sending messages over https
so ws-security offers more protection than http would and soap offers a richer api than rest
so when you see a class that imports most of the available namespace has 30 000 line and has more commits than the rest of the codebase combined chances are you re looking at a god object
theres no need for the technique to be restricted to zooming in and out of tile images
when a user cklicks on the button i want a new window to be opened the window is a form with text areas buttons and other swt widget
i am very familiar with php and python and have written some websites in them
appending is o 1 amortized constant complexity however inserting into deleting from the middle of the sequence will require an o n linear complexity reordering which will get slower as the numbers of elements in your list
any portability to another os instruction set is lost and must be recompiled to execute
if a request in a session could be handled by any node then that would imply that you have all-to-all replication set up in the cluster meaning the session data of node1 is replcated to node2 node3 ... node n the session data of node2 is replicated to node1 node3 .
you should use asp.net-mvc because you have a lot of more control about the generated client code than in webforms and is simpler than ashx handlers
wcf is a communication stack that allows services to be exposed over http like asmx and tcp like remoting as well as named pipes msmq and with .net 3.5 rest
model folder is more a convention from mvc- model view controllers
you have to create a blackberry archive or libs project or whatever it s called and add your libs to that then reference it from your application project
in conclusion i believe that you would be better of with windows-xp embedded boards
vladiator s solution can be shortened by having the first part select records present in both and only in the first table and then adding those only present in the second table
this will allow you for example to do vector addition and matrix multiplication and for large arrays it is much faster than python lists
i ll answer with a perl one-liner because i know that syntax better than awk

everything from the development environment requirements to the release process to the ongoing maintenance is more complex than simply building an asp.net app
according to what actionurl returned response can be an xml document a json object text etc.
is there any way to get linq-to-sql to issue one sql statement and use known types
yes there is a lot of awful php code out there but you know it was mostly written by people who would have written awful ruby or awful python
feedback means that you re not using echo cancellation line and or acoustic depending on whether it s working as a speakerphone or not or if you are the delay in your system jitter buffers network encode decode etc is greater than the echo canceller can handle
if neither column will ever be involved in any mathematical operations make them char or varchar as you will be dealing with a sequence of characters not numbers
in order to assign it to a variable either you have to use the highest level type it could be list in this case or downcasting if you know it must be an arraylist
since you haven t specified a height for the body element it has its default-value of auto
since the iphone shouldn t really be used for processor intensive things such as audio conversion have you thought about transferring those files to your computer and running the conversion there using the cmd-line tool you mentioned
the choice to write rails in ruby isn t an indication that ruby is better than php which many could argue
at the point that the form is submitted to the controllers the command object is no longer a new object but a persisted object that needs to be updated
when i start up vs 2008 to work on a wpf silverlight app and open a xaml or xml file the xaml xml editor is no longer working
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse
in practice you can assume that int and other integer types no longer than int are atomicity
also sctp support in glib is less than ideal in other words non-present -- you must use the libraries from lksctp and it s not entirely well-integrated into the normal sockets api
it will just match any letter-number sequence and ignores a 1 and a1 types of cell
the inner-join to explicitly not select any unreferenced records that means this selects only those properties that have rental units that have tenants
in other words are the first 32 bits of an md5 hash just as random as any other substring
of an md5 hash just as random as any
i have an existing asp.net application that talks to load balanced wcf services iis hosted in-app pool running under account configured as serviceprincipalname etc.
to me this looks more like a supervising controllers than classic mvc
in c++ ++x is to be preferred over x++ because for classes with overloaded operators best practice is for post-increment to be implemented in terms of the pre-increment
pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary containing its old value
i understand that only one instance of any object according to .equals is allowed in a set and that you shouldn t need to get an object from the set if you already have an equivalent object but i would still like to have a .get method that returns the actual instance of the object in the set or null given an equivalent object as a parameter
i have some problem where i set 2 floated div elements one of div contains select element when the page loaded the divs didn t have the problem but as soon i click on of the element s on select box the div that positioned in right shift to bottom
c++ has stricter type checking so you might need to add a cast to each call to malloc realloc calloc
also if main or another function call itself the local variables will be copied but global-variables will not
imho an advanced option for your user to set the connectiontimeout value would be better than any constant value you determine
due to the fact that a wol packets is always a broadcast packets dest-ip 255.255.255.255 it won t leave your local network and will always be dropped from router gateways or any other bridge between to networks vpns etc.
first set the uiscrollview s contentsize to have a width that is equal to or less than the width of the uiscrollview s frame
using tdd i then write the business class and mock the data-access-layer or any layer that is deeper than my business-logic-layer
insert is a read only temporary table which can be accessed in any triggers
not only https is easier to deploy correctly but an application that relies on the transport layer security is easier to debug over plain http
if so i recommend doxygen for unmanaged-code and sandcastle for managed-code
i have an ajax form in asp.net-mvc which is as simple as this
build words list prefer hash or binary-tree to speedup search in the list for every entry during adding it into db remove all too short words lower case and store this data for further usage
on ppc the binary interface to c specified that arguments would be put into registers there were so many to chose from however it seems that even on 64bit x86 requires arguments to be put on the stack
or you could do more complicated things with reflection stack traces to check for correct usage at runtime
i have more familiarity with wxwidgets though its design is heavily geared towards the windows mfc paradigm of application design
since those appear to be mutually exclusive statements in the unions i would suggest that union-all is a better choice than union
now i know that arrays implementaion is easier than i thought but still i dont know how to implement the same using linked-lists
it seems technically possible in that when a user tried to login to outside.com through a client-side silverlight interface that the sl app could connect to the outside.com login service and be told to authentication that user against ldap.inside.com
reflection is useful for runtime configuration allowing parts of a system to be driven through external configuration
des code is 8 times larger than rsa
to avoid boxing the best way to compare generics for equality is with
i would like the state of certain things in the page loaded via ajax to be retained across postback
however you could pass in a callback function for start or selected events that cancels the selection if more than one element is selected
could be converted into this syntax-error by the preprocessor
the cocoa design patterns encourage using a controller object to configure views but there s no reason why you can t subclassing like you re describing especially if you need to add functionality that can t be done any other way
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out
can asking a developer whether he prefers webforms or asp.net-mvc be a good indicator of his proficiency
if construction of the real float i am assuming that since i is not really an int f may not be a float either is much more expensive than reassigning the value then the other solutions of encapsulating inside an extra pair of curly-braces to limit scope would be the best option
also linq-to-sql has more or less been depreciated
kind of related to 3 you would typically see this as an invoice and payment type representation even if you don t issue invoices so that would imply that one payment could represent more than one order and vice-versa so that would imply a many to many relationship
also something similar to setinterval would be nice where it calls the callback every n seconds but that can be implemented using settimeout
more than 20 line for a function is a code smell
given that in almost every case i choose sql-server over ms-access
try something newer such as c# ruby python and best care about design pattern and work methodology
this is a completely different product than sql-server express standard etc
in future if things go haywire again head back to tools import and export settings... and this time choose import selected environment settings radio-button and next choose no just import new settings overwriting my current settings and next either choose the name of your .vssettings file from the list usually under the my settings folder or browse
your dao layer and sessionfactory do not need to be adjusted except that you need to inject your subclassing of abstractroutingdatasource into the hibernate sessionfactory
there are lots of ways to cause a cocoa program to execute its own code under you control carbon is harder
with some other databases this can be handled with serialization isolation state but at least with oracle postgre the phantom reads are prevented but as the result the table ends up with two distinct rows with same counter value
it would be nice if i could have a method which would take as a parameter method calls to setter and getter and call this for all fields but unfortunately this is not possible with java
- maybe this could be adjusted from php for delphi pascal
in some circumstances you can also use wct it s usually implmented by debuggingger s or profiling however it can be used from any code as the usual debuggingger requirement of being the thread which has the debugging port open is not a pre-requisit
i think your progress-bar needs to be based on progress and not time
how do i exclude the files that are free for view to be displayed without logging in while still maintaining the user to login for viewing other files in the same folder using just the configuration file
how do i exclude the files that are free for view to be displayed without logging in while still maintaining the user to login for viewing other files in the same folder using just the configuration file
if you are lucky the bouncycastle objects will be marked as serialization if not you will need some extra code
i want to find the first item in a sorted vector that has a field less than some value x
also if you are establshing a web-services back-end is it better to use rest json vs rest xml vs soap xml...etc
as for json vs xml obviously json is more lightweight which makes it a better candidate for the iphone generally but if your data requires a representation more complex than json can offer then go with xml
this will match any string of any length that does not contains
sqft makes about as much sense as line of code really.
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct
besides if you are doing anything more complex than loading some x html into an element you should probably use one of the more powerful jquery ajax methods get or .post or ajax
i gues i m not understanding why asp.net-mvc would be mutually exclusive with .net 3.0
there should be powerpoint and code samples to achieve automated building and packaging
conditional operators can be made readable as multiline statements with the right indentation but if else syntax is much more familiar to most developers
if on the other hand the assignment is done immediately before the messageboxes where the variable assignment is commented in the code above then the variables print a different value that is somewhat more like what is expected but not exactly typically the two variables are exactly the same or one is numeric when both are expected to be different alpha strings
it seems like there should be another way to do this but you can pass cmd to be executed as command-line parameters to cmd
any project is responsible for building and then versionning its set of files to be delivered jar war ear ...
once comfortable with php and javascript i d recommend looking at some javascript libraries such as jquery or yui and looking at the source of one you like then maybe take a look at something like the zend-framework or symfony for php
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct
if you re on an iphone go libxml2 and don t look back - but if your target machine has two processor and more ram than god i d go nsxmlparser for easier to maintain code
so when we run it then textbox should be shown in gridview and we can put value in it and my grid has 3 columns and i want to add new row in grid when i press tab on 3rd column of gridview
i ve decided that the membership would be kinda simple in this aspects that - the users would upon signing up be given a free account and would be allowed to upgrade their accounts for a set period the expiration of which they would be reset back to their basic accounts unless they choose to renew with a paid subscription
it is a lot more mature than asp.net-mvc so you shouldn t be disappointed
it s more than a text-editor though
note this isselectedion with replacement so the same word could be chosen every time
i was wondering if anyone has any prettier more economical more accurate means by which this could be done since this is being run inside of a for-loops to generate x numbers of rows defined elswhere and i d like if possible to reduce the load.
you could create the target arrays then loops through the words determining the probability that it should be picked and replace the words in the arrays according to a random number
this is probably because oracle is old older than me and sql-server is young compared to oracle
i used ms sql-server in a big company i worked at a few years ago and i would choose firebird over ms sql-server
we re currently building a website with a categorized mysql table contains various competences and we noticed that the nested set model would be optimized for this
note also that union-all will be much faster than union
perhaps you could require that appropriate packets filters be installed or maybe your application could install these filters itself
if it is show your tooltip and you d probably want to pass the mouse coordinates into the tooltip s show method instead of just passing in the textbox so that the tooltip can be positioned next to the link
keep in mind that #include is nothing more than copy-paste and it happens before your program is compiled
onblur fires when a field loses focus while onchange fires when that field s value changes
as long as all one of your user instances is not destroy those will retain the resource instances and so prevent it from being prematuraly deleted even though the global shared_ptr could have been destroy
many libraries have sections that need to be compiled separately like boost-serialization and program_options
if you are trying to just read in and turn the xml into an object then i would suggest stax as sax is faster than dom but too much coding stax is much nicer and you can learn more about it below
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0
it can be an object with id and name properties so they can be accessed with listbox sselectededitem property
i m somewhat familiar with orca the tool to manipulate .msi files as well as full blown installer applications like installshield but i would like to make this using only raw visual studio and other available open-source tools
recursive ctes are ideal for very small trees but the branch operations get all children in this branch.. get very costly with deep large tree
if you are looking for reliable hosting or dedicated-server it is better to go for grid hosting providers such as media temple
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable
you could make all your model types that you would pass into this partial inherited from a base-class interface that establishes the basic behavior that would be used by this partial view and accept any object of that class interface type or just have the view accept any type of object and then use reflection to base your partial view behavior off of
but when the table view is larger than the screen and cell have to be reused drawrect isn t called every time setneedsdisplay is
they as the name implies allow variables to be retrieved and set - specifically they are called getter and setter
note that busexecutaservico is the class whichcontains the method enablefield for checking if the selected item matches any field on the database
furthermore the code reflects a cleaner design with fewer line of code for each feature
i m not familiar with sql-server logs but i know oracle has a bunch of them and they re full of good stuff
embedding lua is much easier than embedding python
lua is about 20x smaller and simpler than python
you seem to have forgotten to typedef the type m_data that you re using in the various methods and i don t understand why you want a separate tree_node struct rather than using the class itself
2 remember that all included images and files in your secure page must be loaded using http or users will see warnings about insecure contents on the page
1 for gui design you can choose between c++ mfc and the .net compact-framework
my set of ci addon s include display of menus that can be controlled via css role-bases access controll before controllers is invoked and other features
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable
for extremely small data sets which are frequently changed and or infrequently searched an un sorted list may be even faster since it avoids the overhead of doing the sort. as the data set becomes large the growth of the list s search time overshadows the fixed overhead of hashing and the hash table becomes faster
simpler and still a tad more efficient than copying thousands of line from file to file write many but smaller log files
you will want to save enough line in your design to divert interesting data to be inspected with external devices
as some time has passed since i initially wrote this answer the more disturbed recessed of my brain suggest that you could create a duplicates iframe position it below in z-space the first and when the onload event of the frame fires animate the opacity of the original iframe from 1 to 0 before removing the elements entirely
if i have a dal created by subsonic 2.2 how do i convert the collections created by it to wpf observablecollection in code pref.vb.net to be consumed by wpf
i ve considered storing the original value for all the model s properties in a hidden form field and then writing a custom tryupdatemodel to only update the properties that have changed but this feels a little too like the viewstate we ve all been more than happy to leave behind by moving to mvc
the primary usage of this try-catch with main would be purely to prevent your program from crashing in very unusual circumstances and should do hardly any more than display a vaguely user-friendly fatal error message to the user as well as possibly logging the error somewhere and or submission a bug report
resources lockout can be done with stateful desktop-applications but with web-applications any lockout scheme you try to implement may only minimize the damage but not prevent it
i had an app once that installed a performance-monitor counter that should have been shared by my app and perfmon when it was running so installing it should be just to make sure either app was closed
how can this be done in asp.net-mvc
this library works transparently with big- and little-endian elf files and runs just fine under linux despite its freebsd origins the usual . configure and make sequence is all you ll need to build it
i could just manually implement hibernate lazy loading by dipping to hibernate and hydrating the hibernate object manually but the object graph for that object is huge contains hundreds of types that would need to be initialized and set
this script does so so the cookies you can set on this page will be sent to any page in the www.quirksmode.org domain though only this page has a script that searches for the cookies and does something with them
linq-to-sql will essentially allow you to bring your set-based sql knowledge forward to the application domain and give you good performance to boot you can start with select from employees and add filters onto it successively such as where name smith which ultimately execute on the database
that unpack is faster thansubstring becausesubstring returns a lvalue so that you can operate on it as well
this compares only the ids - a primitive type like a int or a guid - and this can be transformed into sql
i ran into this problem a lot when using report headers where a company logo or report title was much longer than any of the fields of the report causing merged cell
if you must use native code then i would strongly suggest rad studio from codegear embarcadero it s a studio product that ships with delphi the object oriented language that evolved from turbo pascal and c++ builder if you are already familiar with c++ then it s going to be very simple for you to pick it up
so can anyone either provide or point me towards a list or set of what features classes are or are not compatible between squeak and gnu-smalltalk
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now
in particular they each have their own protocols which can be tunneled over ssh if you need security and they have http https access as well
keep in mind that ace has had to support a large number of legacy platforms for long time so it doesn t utilize modern c++ features as much as boost-asio for example
the boost serialization library can be used to marshalling data into a binary form as well as text
according to advanced programming in the unix environment by stephens and rago the second fork is more a recommendation and it is done to guarantee that the daemons does not acquire a controlling terminal on systemd v-based systemds
yep the forum app of sct can be used for this - simply set it up and create multiple community groups these are similar to vhosts and map them to subdomains - each community group would have separate forum category can have separate templates separate user permissions etc
where output is some outputstream where the encrypted data will be saved and input is some inputstream where the plaintext data will be read
so as i understand it windows-ce is more of a real windows for mobile devices while windows-mobile is somewhat trimmed down and targeted at those with less cpu power and memory
you should put all of your own plugins into vimfiles to make sure that when you upgrade your vim installation you don t lose any of the custom plugins or modifications
public key cryptography needs a longer key than symmetric key cryptography to sustain the same level of security
php can be run via an interpreter on the cmd-line so any computation task can be done in php
causes the processor s lock# signal to be asserted during execution of the accompanying instruction turns the instruction into an atomicity instruction
configurations can be handled by xml or json files
i recommend using tinymce for a rich text-editor
the speed aspects of php has more to do with the user experience than with the performance itself
and i figured out that adding a property such as this one to the controllers
for one short is a 2 line method while some else will think that method with no more than 100 lines of code are pretty short
the mark allen comment on the other thread is suggesting that instead of append your new cloned input which ie doesn t give the selected file property to the other form you replace the old input with the new input which looks proper and then you put the old input on your upload form
this should also address if a user applies a filtering on the report you may or may not have given them this option. on a field other than thegroupinging
note i am seeing my problem in silverlight but i am guessing that the exact same behavior can be seen with wpf
on the other hand because managed-code in some scenarios is slower than native-code you might want to try unsafe code instead
considering that the managed-code does bounds checking on the index of every array access which the unmanaged-code doesn t do i would say that the difference is smaller than i expected
linq to xml and linq-to-datasets rely on linq to objects which i guess could also be implemented for .net 2.0 but i haven t seen this done yet
in my own opinion the insert all is the better human-readable of the two while the union-all variant is the one taking less space when such an insert is automatically generated
haskell certainly has fewer libraries than .net but it does have a reasonableselectedion and the quality of the api design in many of them is very very high
the ruby interpreter can also be embedded within c programs and may be considered by some to be more object-oriented than python
i am not familiar with seaside but you can use many different view engines with asp.net-mvc nhaml
rubygem can be configured to install gem in the user s home directory instead of system wide which could work well on multi-user machines
note that in this output all results must be of the form with no line feed to be considered valid output
i m writing a method to lift certain data out of an sql query string and i need to regex match any word inside of curly-braces only when it appears outside of single-quotes
this was collected from various answers and linked documents especially the msdn article how to determine which versions and service pack levels of the microsoft .net framework are installed linked by dok . a full list with kb update versions and support retirement dates can be found on wikipedia list of .net-framework-versions
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered
i know that this will result in 1 less threads than processors which is probably good it leaves a processor to manage the threads disk i o and other things happening on the computer
because i was less concerned with authentication authorization i don t know what to recommend as a best practice for dealing with binding certs to individual users and going more granular than machine-level my solution was windows service to windows service communication -- completely unattended
if you want to support recomposition you d have to set the allowrecomposition properties of the import attributes to true then you can implement ipartimportssatisfiednotification on your class and the interface s onimportssatisfied method will be called whenever the imports have been set
if this token is not found in the atom-feed there is no more
i think git has better tools and a better toolchain and the fact that it doesn t required a central repo and a checked out repo is nice when you re working on small projects by yourself
build a basic finite automaton dfa nfa nfa-lambda for the language in the alphabet sigma 0 1 2 where the sum of the elements in the string is even and this sum is more than 3
in the latter case the uitabbarcontroller must be have been a uinavigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller
screensavers can do more than just display pretty pictures - i ve seen interactive screensavers before that used the mouse and keyboard to provide a simple game though i can t remember which version of windows i saw this running on.
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable
visual studio is really nothing more than an integrated development environment ide that enables you to edit debug building and run your code smoothly and easily
when you have code in the header file for simple getter-setter methods it s more or less just fine because you either want to save some working time because of code maintenance typing same method in header and implementation file or because you actually want the method to be inline due to function call overhead in time critical places
http and ssl mutual authentication should be used for this because client already has at least corporate ca-signed certificate on its smart card stored
well linq is more about querying than updating so i ll still separate it into a linq query and then a foreach loop to do theupdates
ps this is no longer virtual override relationship no polymorphism calls
i would like to test results to be saved as csv or xml file that i can analyze and plot them
that kind of revision metadata has to be stored elsewhere like trac or some other system that s built on top of the svn repository
the w3c specifications show that table cells should support onkeydown but this doesn t appear to be supported by firefox google-chrome currently you could try reporting this as a firefox bug through their website
this is because the minus sign would have caused mysql to try and calculate the value of the field contents minus something else
keep writing the new line to the end of the file each at a time until the byte count of the remaining line is less than the byte count of the line at the beginning of the file it may be that this condition is true immediately in which case you don t need to write any more
however you could grab linq-to-sql results by doing a .asenumerable and process the rest on client side
one answer can belong to more than one category although for simplicity one can assume that categories are orthogonal exclusive
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there
if the fetch request doesn t have any sort descriptors set to it explicitly will the objects be random every time or are they going to be spit out into an array in the order they were added to the managed object context initially
but if this is the case there is no auditing as it is a shared account and also our dev profiling which you will appreciate are vastly different from a shared one cannot be used to debugging production
i was wondering is it more computationally expensive if i change the line that are used to create the provider to this.
this is because you do not know if the site will be deployed as root under a folder in root web or in a virtual directory
just a month ago one of our dev leads was insisting on installing the bits necessary to do remote-debugging on a production server
with all the process above you minimize the amount of records to be updates to the minimum necessary and so the time the final table will be locked while updating
make sure when you write the triggers that it handles the case where more than one row is being insert or updated at a time
classes are friends of themselves in c++ terms private methods and fields of any instances of that class can be referenced from any method of the same class even static methods
the rational for this is that a std binary_search of a sorted vector with a custom comparitor is nearly as fast and sometimes faster than a map lookup and iteration is much faster
you just can t compare swing to winforms wpf in the performace startup time aspects
i prefer linq-to-sql because i do not need to support non mssql db and its much lighter than ef
that fewer line is better
converting from finger spaces to output spaces is even easier
in this case i would have separated model component pairs for the progress-bar and handle them in a separate controller class
why does sql-server doesn t allow more than one identity-column in a table
so it s impossible for the sql-server to have more than one identity-column per table
therefore c++ would be better than languages like php python ruby c#
for example if you need to match processor to the work load or match workers to their jobs
pretty much anything you can do with lambda you can do better with either named functions or list and generator-expression
i ve used it this way for preprocessing tasks that i might otherwise have delegated to awk or perl such as collecting details from the current fossil revision into my built project
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
the reason why this solution switches from uint64 u to unsigned long w and v in the middle is that the yyyymmdd and hhmmssiii fit to 32 bits and 32-bit division is faster than 64bit division on some systems
for my application which reads a line from a text file and looks for data at certain offsets the java code ran about 3x faster than groovy
for complex lookup and any lookup essentially involving or i recommend django s q operator
i was expecting that the method will be called by hibernate to resolve entity name of a transient object when i save the object
basically if the debugger is currently running it will stop it then kill any processes named webdev.webserver which should be all the cassini instances and then starts the debugger again which will implicitly start cassini again
what i should have done is copy-paste only this line
the sql query is supposed to be generated by this linq query so i m thinking of it as a poor man s serialization deserialization of linq queries to t-sql format
creating the super class is much harder when you have to think about how it can beextendsed
as you ve realised .endswith will fail if there is anything after the en or if that varies but i don t think it s any more reliable than contains
not familiar with aix but the following works on linux and solaris
i am quite comfortable with generics and such but in this special case i have a question concerning the type-safety unchecked cast from
hidden worksheets workbooks have some limitations to what can be done in vba code like most selected and selectedion statements and anything coming from activesheet but i can t seem to find any list of what the limitations are
curiously if the value assigned is less than 256 the assignment is atomicity so there s no problem
1 covert each of the dll into an exe which will be loaded in 32-bit and it can interact with my rest of 64bit application via com interfaces
also to avoid any sort ofdelaying or missing ticks choose this timer isr to be a high-prio interrupt the pic18 has two levels
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv
if you read the windows user experience interaction guidelines specifically the section on confirmations you will notice that the question icon has been deprecated for a long time so it is only fitting that the task dialog does no longer provide it even though it is still supported for messagebox for reasons of backwards-compatibility
suppose i setup a simple php web server with a page that can be accessed by http
if you use svn then subwcrev from the tortoisesvn distribution could be used for this piece as well and could automatically use the revision number from your repository as the version string
i remember that at one point it was said that python is less object oriented than ruby since in ruby everything is an object
i m not sure that i buy the argument that ruby is more object-oriented than python
how to go about that depends on your c++ needs as much as python
jian lin the answer is yes python is more object-oriented than when matz decided he wanted to create ruby and both languages now feature everything is an object
i wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than perl and more object-oriented than python
it can be used to send any cmd to vim using the cmd-line
do you think asp.net-mvc will compete with asp.net webforms
in the configuration above the modal popup is higher that it is wide - even though width is 800 andheight is 600
i suppose flex which is more common to users shoul have similar ways of validating http certificate from user s point of view
python can be used for web development but there isn t a special language extension or anything in the language that will handle all the html generation or that works like php
i now use subversion even for test projects that are less than 100 line
i regretfully wind up putting a lot of derived sources under source control because i work remotely with people who either can t be bothered to set up a proper building environment or who don t have the skills to set it up so that the derived sources are built exactly right
note scanf with unadorned s is as bad as gets because it puts no limit on the amount of data that will be slurped in
i do sometimes construct arraylist with an initial capcacity more than the default of 10 and a hashmap with more than the default buckets of 16 but i usually especially for business crud never see myself thinking hmmm...should i use a linked-list instead arraylist if i am just going to insert and iterate through the whole list
the groovy syntax is much terser than java it s much easier to do things in one line of groovy code that would take you several in java
simpler validation def simpler than struts-1.x username size 6..10 blank false specifies two validation rules for a username field to be of a specific length and non blank
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false
if you really don t want to delve into the frameworks - and you should i heartily recommend django or pylons - there s still need to go down the road of cgi
it doesn t overly concern me that this is more line than the linq version
when you want to install the exe on the client machine you should be installed .net framework on that mc because applications and controls written for the .net-framework-version 2.0 require the .net framework redistributable package version 2.0 to be installed on the computer where the application or control runs
this returns results that match any of the search terms i would like to modify this so each resultcontains all of the search terms
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference
so all i m saying is that search-engines are often brighter than seo consultants give them credit for.
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd
i ve read about the vmware-cmd tool but believe that is only available with vmware esx not workstation
i ve started looking into whether vmware or parallels can somehow be brought into this but there s not much that can be done without hacking the os
asp.net-mvc provides a better separation of concerns than webforms however it does come with some overhead that is harder to justify on smaller projects
if so the authentication cookie may be expiring after leaving the app inactive for a long time and if you click the select button you re redirected to the login page but the login page itself may be having a problem that causes a redirection loop to occur which causes most browsers to display the this page cannot be displayed message after a couple of runs of the loop
i can t say i ve had any performance problems with either but cherokee is definitely easier to get set up
json is usually a smaller payload than xml and many tests have show that it is easier for the browser to load it in
i suspect that in stack frame at the top of stack my this object has been delete d i think this is no longer a valid pointers
however if the website is more concerned with presenting content to the end user typical websites blogs e-commerce apps portals asp.net-mvc provides many advantages over webforms
integer multiplication division and modulus are much slower than integer addition and subtraction
i ve been watching in profiler but that hasn t given any clues except for occasionally seeing set no_browsetable on set no_browsetable off statements occurring before and after the sp runs
what i would like to know is if there is an input parameter that can be passed to wsdl2java tool to generate client side code that communicates via http with the soap endpoint
also if you really are going to be doing some serious string handling i would recommend using the c standard-library rather than a string object library simply because you have better control over in-place substitution and so string copies become glaringly obvious in the code
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster
xmpp chat messages can be used for handshake and it has filesharing extensions to do the binary transfers
in the controller tier helper methods defined on applicationcontroller should be marked as protected -- if they were private the other controllers would not be able to access them but if they are public rails will treat them as actions
because i use it often and coming out of my java days i favor protected for all helper methods to give freedom to anyone usually myself who wants to extend the class -- unless i m really really embarrassed about one then i mark it private
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division
i m not too familiar with windows authentication and impersonation and i know even less about was and how it handles security so i m hoping to find out if this is possible and where i might get started
the jvm looks better under this aspects
so for basic types char short int long float double you should always prefer pass by value unless you specifically need to use a reference to store a value for use after the function exits
you said that the projects aren t secret public files should not be seen as nested projects but i m suggesting that you make this distinction in order to split them into two directories
the class is probably less than 30 line code and i use it for quite a few places
to locate files among a fixed set of directories alternatively use a fixed maximum-number-of-files n per directory and when you fill up go to the next one the k th photo should be stored at where aaaaaa floor k n formatted as decimal or hex and bbbb mod k n formatted as decimal or hex
you might also need to do something to make sure that the symbol is exported and wasn t name-mangled to a c++ name that will never be found by lua
command-pattern is a little more complex than abstract-factory but is commonly used and powerful
what would be the fastest without more than 30 line of code way to do this
is there any inherent limitation of the us at t 3g-network that will block the nat traversal techniques would you be limited to wifi firewall nat traversal
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop
for example says java is more popular than php which is more popular than ruby
and the standard library of python is not so versatile the list and dict types have less methods than in ruby
so for someone new to perl ruby and python i d recommend spending a day with ruby one more day with python and choose which of these two to concentrate on learning
we compare that with the string-length and if they differ then there must have been an integer
is there anyway to compare arrays in php using an inbuilt function short of doing some sort of loops
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free
if your input string is more complex than just a series of field and value its structured a more complex parser would likely be needed
simple fact is that concatenations...when the number of string parts is known without limitation..you could concatenate a thousand parts...as long as you know its always 1000 parts ...are always faster than stringbuilder or string.format
another grave misconception and this is primarily from the sql-server camp...i have very little experience with oracle is that stored procedures are the only thing that can be compiled and the execution plan cached
alternatively you may be able to create a custom subclassing of application and store the mediaplayer there but using a service is considered better practice
i didn t get why it wrote it to memory twice though or why it was using 32-bit registers well actually my guess is that a 32-bit processor is way faster at working with 32-bit values than it is with 8 and 16-bit values but that s a totally uneducated guess so i tried rewriting it
the params scope is a combination of url form get post fields and it will be printed out in the log as part of the normal output processing so you might not need your own dumping of it - any development or production logcontains the params dump at the top of the log line
headers include other headers which include yet other headers so when you do a #include it could be adding tens of thousands of line of c++ into each cpp file or cxx c whatever all of which need to be compiled each time
after all an abstract-class is just like anyclass except it can t be instsntiated requiring subclassing etc to complete the class
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally
if you prefer ruby over python you could use rbot an irc bot written in ruby
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style
there is no way to specifically limit the background image to cover only part of the element so you have to make sure that the image is smaller than the element or that it has any transparency areas for the background-color to be visible
the same approach can be used for webforms as well as asp.net-mvc
3 within an access application or any other vba vb application i should use dao as ado must go through a translation layer of the jet ole db provider while dao is more direct
it can be a cmd-line utility a c c++ objective-c or java code and will be used on osx 10.5
t be found in controllers
to the contrary it can be used to model pretty much any aspects of a software system almost at any level of abstraction
some have suggested using the blur event but this doesn t seem to be supported by jquery-dialog
as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw
keeping this if-else condition in the controllers level is a better idea than moving into views
the idea is to have duplicated getter and setter for a field which is lazy loaded
that said an awful lot of vb developers were annoyed when the classic vb was discontinued and vb.net was not compatible with vb6
the reason to use listview would be if you need some special layout for example to create a table that places more than one item in the same row or to break free from table-based rendering altogether - which is not possible with gridview
viewwillappear will be called every time your view is going to appear whereas viewdidload is called just once when the view is created
to which michael burr had replied saying in arm processor stack growth direction can be configured - either descending normal behaviour stack grows towards zero address lower address in memory or ascending stack grows towards higher address in memory
if you just want the relevant data to be displayed to stdout the terminal output if you re running from the cmd-line you can use p some_object
modulus should only be used with integer
what first appeared as a seemingly random failure to establish an ssl connection using libcurl in my application turned out to be caused by this but it took deploying debug versions of libcurl and openssl and stepping the customer through debugger script to finally figure it out
you can count the number of records where the value that you are sorting on has a lower value than the record that you know the key-value of
this position does not map back to any position in the table though unless the order by is on a set of clustered index columns but even then that position might be invalidated the next second
oracle doesn t even distinguish between unique-constraint and unique-index one command is just a synonym for another
actionscript properties can in fact be backed by methods - so called getter-setter pairs
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie -
you could use a cmd-line program that may be able to do it maybe it could be accomplished with sed awk grep etc
such extensions for hashing are supposed to be added in tr1 but as far as i am aware 128bit ints aren t supported my many compilers
when the number of line after filtering is less than
if those exceptions are thrown when your program is running is because you did something wrong in development thus a runtimeexception subclassing is more appropriate
when to choose checked and unchecked-exception
building a java web app under tomcat 5.5 although a requirement is that it can be deployed anywhere like under a weblogic environment hence the loading resources as streams requirement
if you use a webserver such as cassini or iis to host your wcf service the base address will be provided from this server
there are some ides and plugins out there but nothing very complete so you might be better off with a text-editor and a command line build tool in the meantime
for parallelism you don t get much wider than shader language and the related opencl - typically 512 processor in parallel on a high-end desktop rather than erlang s 4 processor in parallel though with many scheduled processes
but when i set that to false its blank and i cant seem to grab any output data
jeffery palermo says classic webforms more mature than asp.net-mvc is classic webforms more mature than asp.net-mvc
i recommend pushing building to this environment at least once a day or if you a really up to it with every good build from the build environment
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has aheight or width that is less than 100px
index is what will be passed to the controllers in the sidx query string parameter to indicate which column should be used for sorting when you click on that column header in the grid
as other have said the stack allocation is very fast the speedup from not having to realloc each time is probably greater for more complex objects such as an arraylist or hashtable now list and dictionary in the generic world where there is construction code to run each time also if the capacities are not set correctly then you have unwanted reallocations each time the container reaches capacity and has to allocate new memory and copy the contents from old memory to new
but then as soon as it loses focus theselectedion vanishes i want it permanent
now the export-to-pdf method will be done like this
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters
i would recommend either recreating resorting the treeset before searching it or my preference iterating through the set before the search and removing any of the objects that are too old
if we were to write this query as a join then we would return duplicate rows whenever an order had more than one line item.
i realise php is more dynamic than java and doesn t even let you define the exceptions that it throw but what is the closest i can get
so if you do http you ll need to buy http for your image domain awell if you don t want to annoy the hell out of your users
if you re using ssl you would need to either get an additional single-host ssl-certificate for images.domain.com or a wildcard ssl-certificate for .domain.com matches any subdomain
this is further complicated with field like multi-lookup where when extracting the value of that field can yield results like id_1
i m not familiar with swig or with using c++ and python together but if this is under a recent version of microsoft visual c++ then the monitor class is probably throwing a c structured exception rather than a c++ typed exception
for example your static content could be served via lighttpd or nginx while still serving your dynamic content off apache
if anything the thing that windows forms has going for it is that it s based on the technology that has existed for well over a decade and that inertia is not dying anytime soon the browser you are typing in is using gdi the taskbar is using gdi your instant messaging application is using gdi the new ribbon control in windows 7 is using gdi the 60 printer sitting your desk is using a gdi printer driver the windows-ce applications running on your phone run a port of windows forms and gdi the new event viewer in windows-vista is using windows forms and there is a large third-party component community behind the windows forms platform--wpf is a very small niche product that only exists in the managed world which is itself smaller than its unmanaged counterpart
there are other issues with the default code templates - for example they are not compliant with stylecop out of the box since the using line are outside the namespace declaration
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know
so if you know what state you want to bring your application back to you could load the appropriate viewcontroller in the series to be latered and push them onto the navigationcontroller
you can achieve much higher performance with a custom solution which also might be simpler hazelcast jgroups are free you can add a node s which does the database synchronization so your main app doesn t slow down
plain char having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extending a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain char unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain char gets implemented as signed
this of course still leaves the integers with more than two primes factors
now that the solutions with two primes factors are known i ll try to find a potential algorithm for finding solutions with more than 2 primes factors
pyflakes is a smaller and faster pylint
in the gpl world lgpl is more compatible than gpl with other code
if the result count is one it returns that instance and if the result count is greater than one it throw an exception
the question is what type of hierarchical datamodel is more suitable for such situation
this is valid syntax but it will fail both in mysqland in sql-server if the subquery returns more than 1 row
is there a built-in function in emacs or does someone have elispto line up all the equals signs in a series of inititialization statments in cc-mode
if i try and upload small xml files it works fine however if the xml file is larger has a few thousand nodes i get an ioexception where the bufferedreader down is being created
change weight for searchable text relevance - if a search word occurs in a document s title and its body the title is probably more relevant
although i highly recommend nhibernate you may also want to look at the data-access application block of microsoft s enterprise library
i will be routed to controllers index action index category mycat
anyone know of any network apis proprietary or otherwise that can be used to lookup mac addresses given an ip address
sqlite 3 does allow user defined collation functions and these can be done in sqlite-net as .net functions but the overhead of calling back and forth across the managed unmanaged boundary is considerable
b if second article was correct then if textbox control had autopostback true shouldn t then textchanged also be considered immediate response event
i assumed that because java is compiled and is generally considered to be faster than python i would see some big paybacks
how come my python implementation is faster than my java implementation
by that i mean that the java put call seems to be much slower than the python set s add
the java implementation of the production code is also about 2.5 - 3 times slower than the python version -- just like the above
i m not too familiar with python but i do know hashset can t contain primitive so when you say counts.add i the i there is getting autoboxed into a new int i call
it has generally been my experience that python programs run faster than java programs despite the fact that java is a bit lower level language
the java runtime is much bigger than python so takes longer to load from disk and takes up more memory which may be important if you are swapping
this means that every request to the server is parsed by the .net dll so that url s can be rewritten asp.net-mvc heavily relies on url rewriting
is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder
if i like ruby a lot is there a reason i should learn another language now such as lua or erlang
the osgi service compendium spec contains a deployment admin service which defined deployment packages as a collection of bundles and other artifacts such as configuration that can be deployed upgrade uninstalled and so forth as a single unit
there doesn t seem to be any killer desktop-applications for ruby at the moment mostly because there is such a demand for web-applications and providing rich application experiences via the web is getting easier and easier
it could be recommended for web-hosting but i believe for small sites it is overkill
so there is something like that can be queryed by php python javascript
how s that for python is faster than java
also note that you could write it in another language on the jvm if your more comfortable with ruby or python
phil haack shows off with the help of rhino mocks how to mock httpcontext in asp asp.net-mvc but i d imagine can be applied to webforms
from my small knowlegde from java se i want to try a tutorial on java me.i have netbeans 6.5.1 with mobility package and have java 6 update 13 installed on my windows-xp sp2.i ve arrived on a stage of the tutorials where they are using bufferedimage that seems not to be found either on java.io java.nio.buffer javax.microedition.io or javax.microedition.m3g.image2d
it might be ipsec but it is often viewed as complicated so you might be better or faster off with openvpn which i use and generally am happy with
edit i m displaying it in the .net winforms control but it will also be exported to pdf and perhaps .doc xls etc.
another 3rd-party alternative is graniteds which does much the same thing as blaze but is spring-friendly out of the box and does quite a lot more than blaze runtime-compilation and generation of swf files from the webapp
it claims that you can write arbitrarily complex queries against javascript arrays dom node lists or your own enumerable types which sounds like what you want
if a packet count and deadline are both specified and fewer than count packets are received by the time the deadline has arrived it will also exit with code 1
here is an example of a case to match gecko based browsers netscape 6+ mozilla firefox ...
so long as thenodes in general have more parents than children this direction will be much faster
for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and their other counterparts
1 created two javascript files one which defines all javascript functions dom manipulations as required by the site and second called messages.js this defines all the string literals that need to be localized something like var alert_msg alert message in english
i use llblgen but it has to be refreshed when datamodel changes are made
let s say i have a size class which hasheight and width properties in reality the class is a bit more complex than this but size makes a good example
in the case of a single size instance i could create the property in the controllers class containing it but this becomes more difficult when you have an array of sizes
to me a bloated application is full of to manny features not really belonging as i see it to the application that can not be turned off or at least hidden and would be better off as a plugins add-on
the exported code is getting larger and we want to encourage users to do this more often so the copy-paste route is no longer desirable
storing value in a hidden field is no more of a hack than .net web forms itself is
it s close - i m finding ifheight is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect
similarly if width is greater thanheight the top position of the rotated image is incorrect
so a really simple interpreter will basically have a tree with a nodes for the where loop with two children one less than expression for the conditional and one block for the body of the loop
it s just different naming-conventions between simulator and i image ipod touch and iphone
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction
it is c++-cli - code that is written to be run as managed-code under the .net framework not regular c++ code
if you need more clarification have a look at section 9.3.2 of java persistence with hibernate called working with detached objects. i d strongly recommend you get this book if you re doing anything more than crud with hibernate
probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min
if you are trying to print out a report for others to read or for change documentation then the cmd-line way shown by alex is better
cause widget is supposed to be located in layout i don t know which is current page therefore - can t get back on failed authentication even worse - i know nothing about page state changed fields selected items in checkbox etc.
if you use 0 in the formatting string those will be filled with zero of there are no significant digits there
note that x87 is effectively deprecated at this point and may be removed from future processor entirely
it uses the quicksortalgorithm not bubble-sort which is typically better anyway. even better it has an overload that takes a argument which means you can pass a lambda expression and make things very simple indeed
if you re developing using cocoa ie for the mac or iphone you have access to the nsthread class which can be used for multithreading
the browser vendors w3c whatwg etc have a hard enough time agreeing on a single specifications as it is can you imagine what would happen if there was more than one specifications
main browser line comes with increased support for the standard but websites that use these features will be broken to any users in an earlier version
to address the problem of maintenance nightmare of application config some standard like uddi or ws-discovery exist ws-discovery will be supported by wcf in .net 4.0
to investigate notice 2 1 which causess stderr to be written to stdout
how do i disable that so even if the pixmap is bigger than window it won t be moved by keyboard or mouse unless i use my events for that
create a hash md5 sha etc of the string password id you want to compare against maybe add a salt value to it
now according to one speaker in order to test your behaviors you need to use mvc but on the other side its been said that tdd is an approach which can be adopted in any environment as the discussion surrounding asp.net-mvc or webforms
the easiest way is to have a mapping of all the vob symbolic links that need to be created and put all necessary cleartool ln -s command line in a script to run once
the search resource would have fields for color make model garaged status etc and could be specified in xml json or any other format
the idea is to speed up the whole versioning process not make it harder by having to do cmd-line
i personally use and recommend visualsvn-server and tortoisesvn for windows
unfortunately i don t know of any tools but i would think this could be done using javascript using jquery prototype or other js framework to rip through the rendered dom and discover applied styles and create new html based on that
i ran a test a few years ago and dlmwrite was something like 5-10x slower than the fopen fprintf fclose solution
they are not present in any of the .net code base unless you count the vb6 compatibility layer library so should be considered deprecated and therefor ignored
may i recommend taglib-sharp for mp3 tag editing
the leading space is important because the classname properties treats the css classes like a single string which ought to match the class attributes on html elements where multiple classes must be separated by spaces
and since sql-server express is the only sku that supports user instance databases the host will have to have express installed for you to use it as-is
having a source control tool integrated with your development environment makes the whole process much easier than having to mess with command line
if you need anything more complex than what read or zenity provides change to c++ is really the best method although i d recommend python ruby over c++ for such shell-script-replacement tasks
specifically this tool would be used to traversal a set of objects that are different versions of a parent object
in most vm languages variables can be conceptualized as pointers or references to memory in the heap even if the variable itself is on stack
for languages that have primitive types int and bool in java for example those may be stored on the stack as well but they can not be assigned new types dynamically
my question is though if i just mark the one class as serialization can i assume the entire class with be marked as serialization
meaning if theheight divided by width gives more than 1
entities are the future not many enhancements will be made to linq-to-sql in the future
i prefer this approach to escaping because it works in oracle and mysqlas well as sql server
i m not sure why you d think the variable var would be known in this context
jruby is one of the most complete ruby implementations there are a lot other ones out there such as ironruby maglev rubinius xruby yarv macruby
this is clearly more complex than the record approach but retains the ability to work with enum values sets strings and can also beextendsed to implements additional meta data features where required
ie6 sets theheight of empty divs to your font-size if theheight specified in the css is less than the font-size
i understand i could simply use xslt style sheets and output html but i prefer pdf xps xls or .doc output and want better formatting control
the constructor are marked private so they cannot be called except from inside the class and the factory method is marked as static so that it can be called without first having an object
now i would like to know how other chart types like pie chart can be created in controllers
all objects used in object hierarchy must be maked as serialization
if you are familiar with vim or got the time to learn a fairly complex text editor i would recommend checking out macvim
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration
the php based tools are the easiest in my experience to get up and running and the perl tools more involved
php will have the most resources but python is a better choice
i m basically mimicking the share button feature on facebook with jquery and what im trying to do is when i click on the textbox area the textbox gets larger by height
looks like a flash issue given that the inconsistency occurs when the number of line is different there s nothing to be done about this at this point
classes would just have to be marked serialization of course
it is of course possible to require more lines to represent all addresses in the official format but commas can always be used as line separators meaning the information can still be captured
a c++ cli assembly can contain native-code which has the potential to be more performant than managed-code
doesn t that make a very fat controllers because of the tens of methods this model is overly simplified the car has many more parent-child relationships
the first three can be optional if for some reason you don t want one of them to be used although why you would want that i couldn t fathom. however the last one is the deserialization constructor and if you wish your exception to be supported in any kind of distributed environment .net remoting asp.net web services wcf etc. then its is pretty much essential
i have also found that separating the two leaves less margins for php errors if the html elements are separated from the php there is a smaller amount of php that can go wrong
in binary-tree the right leaf is always smaller then the head and the left leaf is always bigger so you can search in sorted tree in o log n you just need to go right if if the key is smaller than head and to the left if bgger
jquery website is a javascript framework that makes working with the dom easier by building lots of high level functionality that can be used to search and interact with the dom
join order makes no sense for merge join and cannot be forced in postgresql for hash join
you can make some of the columns non-sargable and this will force postgresql to use intended join order in case the optimizer chooses nested loops
this is because of the way nagle s algorithm causes data to be buffered over tcp-ip
radio-button tend to be used for variables that have more that two values so rather than having three variables
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysqlfull-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene
the reason being a graphics2d object of the bufferedimage can be obtained in order to produce a better quality scaled image
remainders and integer parts greater than 9 must be converted to hex digits directly 10 becomes a 11 becomes b .
by instantiating the tip object you actually perform constructor call simple function call which handle and update the visual element accordingly but once this object is not referenced by any variable it supposed to be collected by garbage collector
some ffis make you write code in the target language like haskell where ffi code must be written in haskell and others make you write code in the source language like python where ffi code must be written in c
although both might be stored as numeric 10 2 aheight and a width column could not be compared without casting
it s much more complex than linq-to-sql and has a steeper learning curve for example ef allows one class-multiple tables mapping
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have
so you already can inherit and add properties fields methods to your subclassing that will all be handled by reflection if the dynamic path doesn t do the lookup
as mentioned above rubygem that have c extensions cannot be installed under jruby
license it is lgpl when wt is gpl meaning cppcms may be used free in non open-source projects as well
if you choose xml or json look into a serialization framework like xstream to serialize deserialize your javabeans into xml strings and back again
as can be seen every time getcallback is called it assigns a new value to static field callback
i ve tried various things involving merging of multiple result sets but get the error local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
with a little tweak to the require test_helper line in my tests a single test execution is no more than a f5 away and the whole suite available from the cmd-line with a quick rake
a plan may be scoped like a par or unscoped and may be atomicity meaning the lifecycle of its contents is tied atomicityally to the lifcycle of the plan like a par or non-atomicity
you just need cat with the -s option which causes it to remove repeated empty line from its output
ctags is easier to set up faster to run and if you only care about jumping one way it will show you less line
i am wondering since a lot of things can be done using reflection can i change a private readonly field after the constructor completed its execution
i found a solution that isn t as resource-heavy as retrieving all users the google reporting api can be used to get the total number of account in a google apps domain
in the index page i have a list of client to select button or whatever and i would like to go to client home.mvc start in function of the client selected
i do not recommend 64bit workstations until exceeding the 32-bit memory limit for this reason
in the example above files greater than 1000 line are deleted
there s this thing called the visitor-pattern that works better
i thought i remembered a way to set a machine level flag so that all the any cpu .net dlls would be treated as 32-bit and not 64-bit by deafult but i can t seem to find it again
is there anything else that can be done with nsurlconnection via http
it should take less than 10 line of code in php
this thread on the gwt forum gives better details on how this can be done outdated uses listener outdated the internals of dialogbox have been changed a lot since this thread - it doesn t work
after that you re as secure as the account is secure which is nothing to write home about but it s much better than having credentials passed around between processes
if you haven t installed an oracle and a sql-server test server you probably haven t even started
i am considering resorting to a do i have the semaphore global and removing the signal blocking but that is not 100 safe since acquiring the semaphore and setting the global isn t atomicity but might be better than blocking signals while waiting
check in the project and solution files with a text-editor for any paths that point to files that cannot be found - maybe there is a relative or absolute path that cannot be found
words grouping filtering has higher
.when you are waiting on a kernel object your thread won t be granted any cpu time as it is known by the scheduler that there is no work ready
however if you know python then i would definitely recommend networkx and its cousin pygraphviz which is an interface to graphviz
what i would like to do is provide the user the option to give feedback on a programme which can then be taken into account during the generation of any subsequent programmes
and according to optimization reference manual for ia-32 function calls deeper than 16 can be very expensive so i would like to do this using a while-loops instead of recursive calls
for example if i perform a head request to your web service and one of the http headers in its response is www-authenticate ntlm then the credentials stored in defaultcredentials would be encrypted using ntlm and then sent up with the full get post put whatever
also i want to be able to track the position of the on-screen notifications so that if the next check finds more to show it knows where the last currently visible one is and the new ones are show below the others
it depends on whether or not you want to allow people to select cell or not
edit json key-value pairs can also be used like this -
granted this isn t as easy as linq-to-sql s implementation
asp.net-mvc is helpful when you wish to have more control over the output and lifecyle of your application
that said migrating from linq-to-sql is easier than from nhiberante or some other technology so if you need to go live tomorrow either take a chance with beta 1 of ef 4.0 or go with linq-to-sql
my next course of action is to allow each processor grab all available orders and just round robin the processors but i was hoping to simply make this section of code thread safe and allow the processors to grab records whenever they like
but if you don t need it then a text-editor is easier
the main thread is probably not guarenteed to be called main though - might be better to check for a stack trace elements thatcontains main
if you are using wpf then simply load an image into the project right click properties and choose splash-screen
the idea i use in this is to extend the hours a day have from 24h to 27h +3 but only where cardeventtime is less or equal to 03 00 00 24h i add 24h and to cardeventdate subtract 1d
ugly but the boost preprocessor library can generate this code for us and in c++0x support for variadic-templates will be added so this ugliness is only temporary
strong-typing is your friend here since it allows you to track types and usages in a much better fashion than weak typing
c++ stl may help but it is going to be a lot more verbose than lua
but it can also be used to put and delete data as well as get header information etc
it seems that when the for the thickbox control is injected into the dom after the initial load jquery is no longer able to do its magic and intercept the anchor link request
each iteration in quicksortis a lot simpler than heapsort
for instance a linear search through an array of 100 integers will probably beat out a search through a binary-tree of 100 integers due to memory accesses even though the binary-tree will most likely require fewer operations
if a method is not marked with scriptmethodattribute the method will be called by using the http-post command and the response will be serialized as json
i prefer working with invoice rather than invoices because i m usually dealing with 1 record at a time
also they are multiples of 4 which are more efficient for computers to handle due to the width of the internal data bus being 4 bytes or 32-bit 64bit is getting more prevalent now wide
the filereference.save method will pop-up a dialog for the user to choose where to save the file so the filename given is just a suggested filename
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch
a generic issue when not falling under those other category is more often than not a representation of something reported by the end-user
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all
you can always use an off-the-shelf package such as graphviz win linux osx pajek win ucinet win or even visio win
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management
perhaps it can be found in nunit also but i found it in mbunit first
that means that all of your boxes should likely be upgraded to windows-vista or windows 2008 server or windows 7 as it is running iis 7.5
if the database wasn t configured correctly or the data was inserted without using the n prefix it won t be possible to get the correct data out since it will have been downcasting into the latin 1 ascii character set
for example a properties of a type may be described either using an attributes or an element as long as its name can be interpreted correctly
note that while python s regexp implementation and many others such as perl s can do this this is no longer a regular expression in the narrow sense of the word
this is where the common functional convention on almost everything being immutable helps by doing this it becomes far easier to not care too much about the concrete implementation of the collection and think solely about it s externally visible behaviour a red balck tree for a set or a hashtable - it doesn t matter to consumers its just a set
edit i ve noticed that the internal procedure doesn t take the pointers as parameter so forget that part _ anyway stack frame has more information than just the parameters of the function so it will be still more memory efficient and the main point was that the heap were the data stack is allocated is usually larger than the process stack
also is there any way to set a business rule like that is always checked without the try except finally so if at anytime throughout the code x is less than 0 an error is raised like if you set at the start of a function anywhere within the function where x becomes less then 0 an exception is raised
in your case the min and max values are exactly adjacent representable values so there can t be more than one partition
there is an add-on for wcf called the wcf rest starter kit which will also be included in wcf 4.0 with .net 4.0 which allows you to use get post put delete http commands to query wcf services and such
the visitor-pattern is a way to implement multiple dispatch in languages that do not do that automatically such as java
caveat is that other types of nodes will be ignored and xml document may contains diffrent elements so this might not work for every type of node encountered
our ticketing system let s us read the database directly but updates need to be done either through a web service or an insert to a special staging table and then calling a web service to triggers the processing of their business logic
i am doing all the development in .net and know better silverlight than asp.net
that is what i do buy subtract 150000 time 15 00 00
silverlight is cross browser compatible what you see in ie is what you ll get in firefox safari and the same on the apple mac versions of the browsers
i d like to know if it s possible to execute more than one sql statement within a single execute or do call using dbd oracle via perl dbi
now adding two ints will be faster than adding two longs on a 32bit processor because adding two longs requires more microops since you re working with numbers wider than the processors word
i would recommend switching from junit to testng
note this answer is more to do with the abstract task of counting line in a string rather than to do with the gui side of things
so as you can see the name of the image is file.png and this works correctly it saves the image as png also works with jpeg tiff gif and it can be loaded with any image processing application
when the async operation is done it will fire the callback methods where you can handle the processing that needs to be done post sql execution
this can be done using dom sax or stax processing
boolean are meant to be used for specific purposes flags and shouldn t be mixed with int else the uses of variables can potentially become quite confusing
edit i understand that the location of cell phones or voip line probably cannot be geocoded and this is fine by me
i would not recommend having the user control define how it should occupy table grid cell in a host
if you implement idisposable interface in your class derived from viewresult the dispose idisposable.dispose will not be invoked by asp.net-mvc framework
i have used the rklib export library a few times to great effect this uses a memory stream and can be given any datatable which it will export as a csv download
image provides an abstract access to an arbitrary image it defines a set of methods that can loggically be applied upon any implementation of image
calling back to the ui and showing the result in the ui can easily be reached by having the ui to subrscribe to events made available by the controllers
should the mvc framework really be renamed to adaptor view controller
many people recommend this for the debugging project profiling
regarding the application hosting socket connections for clients to connect to i d double-check on what s allowed as i think only http and https connections are allowed to be made with azure
in more real situation if we have about 12 concurrent calls and default 1 min send timeout and if service calls process more than 10 seconds in average than we can easily get timeout exception with the last two calls 12 2 10 sec 60 sec because they will wait all others
the objects you provide as arguments as part of the service request must be marked with serialization and based on some of the answers posted before mine you also need to make sure your custom object does not contain any parameters in the constructor
the simple current and upstream modes are for those who want to push out a single branch after finishing work even .when the other branches are not yet ready to be pushed out
similarly this can be extended to int long float double types as well
dojo is currently slightly less popular than jquery has 8.4 million hits on google search vs 4.3 million for but that s still way popular enough to ensure it won t go away any time soon
of course your table will jump in position 1px when the border is added so maybe it s better to use margins or a white border when you are not hovering
note that linq-to-sql required sql server while the other two can be used with any database
the question is is there a common design pattern that implements such a system or open source software that achieves a similar thing thaty could be used to create a generic solution that could be used for controllers or pc s and can beextendsed to allow any number of controllers to act as standby routines
if conditional are needed then extension methods and arbitrary expressions can be used null-coalescing operators
there s no such thing as an executable jar equivalent to an exe file in windows in an executable jar you ll be only specifying the entry point your main class you want to be executed by default
there is some overlap between words and categories such that some words could go into more than one category
are there non obvious differences between nvl and coalesce in oracle
i m not really familiar with linq but i m currently working on an asp.net project and using linq-to-sql as orm i m building a route planning application
i would highly recommend downloading visualsvn-server
the .net framework provides these as a homogenous way to provide network credentials but with wcf this seems to have been thrown out in favour of a new incompatible system based on the unrelated system.servicemodel.description.clientcredentials class
as cesar said type checking is a run-time process one of the major reasons that groovy is slower than java not that that s really bad
edit the user can only pick either weight or dims on asp.net page and if user selected dims then they must supply length width andheight
wsh can be run from either the protected-mode windows-based host wscript.exe or the real-mode command shell-based host cscript.exe
on the flip side i d say generally speaking complex stateful user-interface is easier in oo c# than functionalook-and-feel#
the thing is it has to be written in python or in ruby and have a verbose mode trace mode or very helpful debugging techniques
this is much more flexible than using inheritance because we can stay with the theme of using composition and parametric-polymorphism without locking down brittle hierarchies
postgresql has more established support for this but mysqlhas played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions
mysqls version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates
of course this means that some frameworks are going to have to be rewritten for railo since this breaks full compatibility with adobe coldfusion
this has to be unique and usually not sequential - examples are a uuid guid or a hash md5 of the integer id but be careful of characters that are not compatible with http
html5 defines a contenteditable attribute that can be applied to any element including the body element it s supported in ie which i think invented the attribute safari 2.0 and firefox 3.x where x is at least 5
this is easier for a cmd-line application but for gui testing you would need to use a framework like others have mentioned
the example below is for asp.net-mvc but a similar approach could be used with webforms
this is simpler if you have consistent naming-conventions for your objects table names start t_ stored procedure names start usp_
i also know this point has become more or less moot with linq-to-sql and its successor entity framework
the advantage of phase listener is that they can be registered either globally in faces-config see spec or for specific views
i have much more experience with oracle but very likely the same applies to sql-server as well
this is mainly due to the fact that authentication is much more application specific
in webforms i would have just bound the control then inserted another item however it seems this is not possible with asp.net-mvc am i right in thinking i will need to add some javascript to the view to add this new item once the dropdownlist has been bound
not sure if this works for non x86 cpus as well such as powerpc or arm
this cannot always be achieved with public protected private
it sounds like you re more after just parsing rather than full xml serialization deserialization
ibrahim i m not entirely familiar with this but i know that if you use server.transfer it would keep your url as default.aspx i understand you are submission and not redirecting but if you could somehow redirect instead it would look like this
this is tremendously more efficient than reading the entire file into memory as an array of line and then processing it one element at a time which is often--if not almost always--the wrong approach
imagemagick requires ghostscript to be installed in order for this to work
note i used sql-server to model test and then changed the syntax to match postgresql
if your service will need to be interoperable and be called from java ruby php or other clients you absolutely must catch all .net exceptions on the server side and turn them into soap faults which are the interoperable equivalent
for example if your repository is returning a domain layer object but your persistence is using l2s you might want to map the l2s data to the domain-object
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysqloptimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with
i think that dto + dao or domain object + repository is a better design most of times
i am working on an application using the yui-datatable and my result set is rather large 2 000+ rows which takes yahoo.lang.json.parse about 5-6 seconds to parse
i would like to store the category ids in my table and be able to select rows based on the categories they belong to
lua values cannot be created until there is a lua interpreter which requires calling lua_open which cannot be done until runtime
ruby is better than php
domains in published puzzles 4x4 or 6x6 typically have no more than 5 cell but again this does not seem to be a hard limit
is there anything that can be done in seam that can t be done in spring
anything in spring that can t be done in seam
you can t use a char to represent an integer longer than 1 digits so i m going to assume you did in fact mean char
although your code seems correct i always prefer using field names to get the value instead of index position that can be easily changed in a number of situations
if you re only looking at the last four digits you don t need anything larger than an integer
if your xaml isn t hugely complex i d consider sl3 - but going from wpf to silverlight is trickier than the other way around - there are understandably big gaps
then i added most of the code from j.biard i changed the rect to 50 50 100 100 left out the setdelegate out for now as i am just trying to get it working visually for now and i found that self.view addsubview view worked much better than self addsubview view to the end of the viewdidload method of the first view controllers that is displayed when the app fires up
never been part of a project nor written anything longer than 500 line
it should never be visible outside of the transaction except that isolation levels lower than serialization allow it to some extent
if it needs 10 values then it isn t unheard of to pass 10 values into the constructor - but what you describe sounds more like an entity object
in most cases quicksortwill run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer
ruby and perl allow subroutines to be called without parentheses vbc-style languages visual basic vbscript do this too
when you had no space between line numbers to add new lines you had to run a renumber utility which caused you to lose any mental anchors you had to what was where
all requests must be sent using http-post
it would be very hard to follow asp.net-mvc in classic asp.net if possible so i will reply based on mvp
their is much detail behind those category but a useful heuristic to guide your intuition is if you can take the address of an expression such as a variable it is an lvalue there is much more to the story here but this is a good place to start
you can also set up .html extensions to be parsed as php files by apache so every http-request for an .html document is sent back with a header and a footer automagically included
while there are certain things that work better with vbscript such as passing arrays back and forth from com objects is slightly easier although it is easier to pass event handlers into com components with jscript i am still surprised by the amount of coders that still use vbscript to script windows - i bet if they wrote the same program in both languages they would find that jscript works with you much more than vbscript because of jscript s native hash data types and closures
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages
the graph came out as two straight line with the c being 4ms faster than the java counterpart over 100 000 random integers
on windows use eclipsec.exe instead of eclipse.exe to have build output written to stdout stderr and so that the call blocks until completion
you just loop through your list and put all elements smaller than your pivot at the beginning and all others at the end - which is not enough to get a sorted list
karl fogel discusses this situation and several similar ones in his famous book producing open source software - how to run a successful free software project and comes to the same conclusion strict testing and code review are more helpful than strict authentication
will it automatically pick this up if i add a new view and controllers method
wpf does this better then silverlight though i don t know if there are improvements in sl3
i always prefer checked for conditions that required a break or return rather than those that would need lengthy code execution
in c++ static-assert are either part of the standard c++0x or templates that need to be evaluated at compile-time so they can guarantee the assertion
there are no static-assert in c# because there are no templates in it generics looks similar to templates but there are a lot of difference and they are not as powerful as templates are
i have a form consisting of one textbox and button.on clicking on button one popup appears which contains one datagrid from which i can select value such that value appears in textbox using javascript .in ie6 and ie7 i can select value from grid in popup but in ie8 mozilla and chrome iam not able to select.what may be the reason.can anybody help to solve this issue
even the updates from the view is also send to controllers and it will be routed to model
also have a look at the java.nio package whichcontains faster i o elements than java.io
sometimes char type is more usable than int - fixed size char doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated value directly in database field
as a side note - it makes sense to inline functions like this because overhead on function-call is bigger then function body although optimising compiler should do it without second thought
we put logging on the session hijacking checks to see what was going on and found that these people would come in on one ip and their session would continue on another this wasn t a hijacking attempt however it was to do with how their proxy server worked as a result we amended our session hijacking code to ascertain the class of the ip-address and from there figure out the network portion of the ip-address and store just those parts of the ip-address this is slightly less secure in that session hijacking could theoretically come from inside the same network but caused all our false positives to go away
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg
warning this must be called from sta thread otherwise it throw an exception
this can be encountered in mstest cleanup code which is mta not sta
i am interested in jquery uses for things that asp.net-mvc does not do out of the box or things that jquery makes easier simpler
coff object modules later became the defacto standard for all microsoft win32 development tools and gained an advantage in being much closer in format to portable-executable files - the native executable format for win32 a coff-format linker has much less work to create a 32-bit exe or dll from a coff file than from an omf format file
cohesion coupling and complexity are more important metrics than line of code
mostly c# followed by xslt xpath t-sql javascript vb.net when it s forced on me power shell vba and html and css if you re counting those
of course at the start of small project i can generate many more than ten line of code per day but i tend not to think of the amount of code that i ve written only what it does and how well it does it
brooks wasn t about to throw out some sort of arbitrary figure of productivity but he was working from data on real projects and for all i can remember they might have been 12 line day on the average
b to be hosted in .net applications for automation similar to dcop in kde and how gnome is using corba
however if it is purely a performance decision all other things being equal access pattern doesn t favor one way or the other good hash function sparse map etc. i would think hashmap key x y z would be faster than hashmap x map y z - i want to think that 1 lookup in a larger hashmap is faster than 2 lookups in smaller maps
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping
the jsp will only be used to display view any data provided by the controllers from the model view-model and to display input elements to allow the user to provide input
if you want granular control over your html xhtml output then i would recommend switching to asp.net-mvc
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s
table name should be passed in constructor or defined in subclassing so that every table has its corresponding dal object
i d recommend using expression-blend
another way to put it would be write a javascript functions show commonimageid nexttoimageid and hide commonimageid nexttoimageid that would be used like show correct draggable1
but a simple hello world application that just uses the console as output can be compiled on windows linux vms as 400 smartphones freebsd ms-dos cp80 and almost any other system for which you can find a c++ compiler
those developers often have to choose between delphi or c++ or else convince management to move to .net development
i recommend this tool rather than simply using firebug and firefox because not all errors that occur in internet-explorer will occur in firefox and so performing any debugging in that browser may not yield any results
this way the value of the submit button will be ignored upon submission the form
the javascript will be used to populate a listbox based on theselectedion in another listbox
i know that the attribute is designed to be used for authorization purposes but is it also a best practice to use this attribute for authentication
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available
its important to take a new backup now as old archive logs will not be able to be used with this db since you ve reset the logs
in other words python threads are really much less rich than java s -- not to mention that only one thread per process can in fact run python code others may be running c code or waiting
jason day my original implementation to this problem was to use a trie but the memory bloat with that was actually worse than the sorted set due to needing a large number of object references
unless there is good reason i d avoid having a subclass constructor with fewer parameters than the base-class .
the main issue is that web applications are my there nature concurrent and multi user this doesn t lend it self to longer lived objects with listener and events etc
i did similar thing now but i was able to choose between autotools and cmake
to a lesser extent loc has also been helpful as a relative measure if we see a class come in that has 20 more line than the average class. coupling has been less useful usually most helpful when looking at how many things we might break with a change
now we are in the design phase for the project and feel comfortable enough to look forward to getting more work with expression-blend
it sure would have been nice if the database design had worked such details into table triggers or else provided a stored procedure api for such operations as insert new records into these tables
i have a dropdown with some products and i want to give the user the ability to add a new product so when they select add new it will pop-up a dialog and when they are done it will insert the new product into a table in the database
drools flow is at lot more sophisticated and powerful than both jbpm and osworkflow and development is moving at a faster pace than either
i m not very familiar with repository patterns but what if you delete the old entity from the database and put the new entity in the database with the same id
the application is developped with php and zend framework database should be mysqlor postgresql
furthermore as somebody else mentioned having smaller commit makes it easier to rollback a previous modification if you change your mind later
its configuration is significantly cleaner than either maven s or sbt s and its startup time is orders of magnitude less when running under mri
as you most likely know randomly accessing an element takes a bit more time with a linked-list as opposed to an arrays
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects
the linq-to-sql seems better for poco would it
basically i need the opacity of the shadow elements 4 individual ones to start at 10 opacity and while the user hovers the type moves down this part is working and simultaneously the shadow becomes stronger increases to 60 opacity
javassist cannot be used through xml config file of hibernate it requires hibernate.properties-file where the project i am working on used hibernate.cfg.xml
i suspect json will be a bit more compact than xml although if they re compressing the data you may well find they end up taking the same bandwith as a lot of the bloat of xml is easily compressible
note simplexml is the easier to work with xml lib but also parses the whole xml-file at once so in this case there s no benefit over json
finally be warned that debugging access violations using windbg can be a fairly involed and complex process - if you can get a stack trace another way then you might want to try that first
the -x option specifies that grep should match line rather than the whole text
join the table with the primary key to the rest of the tables or on any other field where field value of one table should match field value of other table
html table should be displayed in cell of excel sheet
i prefer this variant over the c-style for-loops
the easiest way to do that was in unix not entirely certain about the fsync in linux but you should be guaranteed that this wil happen eventually unless the system itself goes down
so yes the inner-join is probably faster
it depends - if it fails because something is definitely wrong then an exception-handling makes programming easier - you don t write a try-catch around each call you just let the exception-handling bubble up
if you ever need to modify how this part of the model needs to be updated this is the controllers action to look for and update
for instance i want a button or link to select this record and have the server send them an email or flag them in the database or even something as simple as changing the style of the selected row so as to bring the user s focus to it
i would recommend using mpmovieplayer controllers as long as you are only doing simple streaming
if so my testing says that asp.net-mvc with output caching turned on is very much faster than wcf
i nearly always favor using linq over standard looping constructs in my collections but the parallelization aspects changes things slightly
a lot of people recommend either c++ with sdl or python with pygame
assuming tcp-ip the socket could be configured to send a packet on every write instead of buffering output in the kernel until the buffer is full or the socket is explicitly flushed
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent
python is very easy to learn compared to c++ so you can be up to speed a lot quicker in doing basic programming tasks
c++ has a lot of power but has many ways to shoot yourself in the foot compared to python not saying that can t be done in python
this is a more or less complicated design choice unless your class is a utility class in which case you should have only one private constructor
ruby and python s dynamism means that both are more amenable to metaprogramming than f# is types can be modified at runtime for instance
this is a coding horror relational-database schema should not be written like this
edit in reponse to your comment be aware that if you are trying to iterate over all key-value pairs in a map there is a better way than iterating over the key and calling get for each
i wanted something that needed to be created a runtime not while wiring up object that also had parameters to it s constructor
consuming the web-services is more efficient because there are a lot more things you can do to scale your web-services and webserver via caching etc.
also with workling you don t have to use starling as the queue it also uses amqp stuff but this is more easily integrated into an environment that uses eventmachine like thin or evented mongrel so if you are using passenger it s a bit more difficult
air is more like safari and google-chrome
stop using complex base classes no base classes with more than 7 line should exist
but i think union-all is much more efficient than union
instead they should be assigned a default-value just before their use
# is in most languages used as an optional digits as opposed to 0 which is a mandatory digits to be used to get leading trailing zero
i believe your answers will have a much greater relevance than scoring a few so points so please contribute what you can even if the bounty has expired
which means primitive-types get boxed and that we lose type-safety
i recommend intel compiler if your on linux unix it s got better support than gcc and produces faster smaller binaries i normally get a free 10 performance boost using it
you can skip some comparisons when the arrays are sorted and start with the inner loops with the element after the last match and break it if the value is larger
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp-ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
on many processor integer multiplication is faster than integer division
i have access to a bunch of phones but i would prefer symbian s60 or windows-mobile
rather than that approach and assuming that each of your version string elements is less than 255 you could just take each element as a byte in a 32 bit unsigned int
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs
you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance
if the height is less than that the scrollbar disappear -- probably because there is not enough room to show the arrow icons
i am somewhat familiar with tree like data structure and traversing a binary-tree using recursion
you could separate the render part dynamically generated apart from what to render based on category
this statement matches non-ascii-characters as well as ascii control non-printing-characters such as bell tab null and others
from a subjective point of view i would say that entities should be complete by definitions considering lazy-loading and could completely or partially be loaded to dto s to optimized the amount of data sent to clients
if you are on the latest versions of vs then the solution files can be built with msbuild which is basically a nant equivalent
so far from seeing physx as the obvious choice for high-end game development i d say it should be avoided unless either you don t think people with amd cards make up a significant fraction of your player base highly unlikely or you have enough coding and qa manpower to test two physics-engines more plausible though if your company is that wealthy i ve heard good things about havok
i would normally recommend python as a good next language but here in brisbane there are 10x as many job opportunites if you know php
if you truly don t need stdout or stderr from the program being timed this is a fine way to do this and should be as efficient as any other method
for example let s assume you can guarantee that each list element never occupies more than one line is always terminated with on the same line never contains any markup such as a list that contains a list then you can use awk to do this but you need to write a whole awk program that first finds lines that contain list elements then uses other awk commands to find just the substring you are interested in
personally i m a c++ and python guy and i would probably go with c++ because this sounds like a relatively intensive project and i do most of my best high level design in c++ great for building fast flexible code base while i tend to use python for things like django where there is less application logic but being able to tune the function look and feel quickly is very important
but python is certainly more productive than c++ in a given amount of time you will get more things done in python than in c++ unless you are a much better programmer in c++ than in python
also if there is a need to interact with scientific people who are not programmers python will be more readable than c++
sniffing the traffic would reveal the submission url and what variables needed to be passed in order to update the score
ie the user selects option with value 123 when the form is returned from the post to the controllers the selected option is not re-selected via the jquery reload
slow down each connection slightly the connection is being established over a dialup or the network is having a high-error retry rate - so the tcp-ip ack takes longer than ideal out of your control os level thing
i guess the original conditions for which exceptions where raised for like page-faults and stack overflows were conditions noticed by the kernel that was informing the user mode of the condition and not exception the user code was throwing onto himself so the term makes more sense in that context
a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s
while looking through the spring mvc framework i noticed that unless i misunderstand its developers favor throws exception instead of throw multiple exceptions
the asp.net-mvc view objects are vastly different than asp.net webforms with server controls--you get straight up html
i want them to both be able to use the data access project but the data access app has to grab configuration from its configuration file...so web-config for the web project and app-config for the console service apps
data mining is an aspects of bi in that data mining can be used on massive amounts of data for knowledge discovery and predicition using tools that implement algorithms such as clustering neural networks etc
if i mix http and https it requires more coding cross domain problems
so since pretty much everything with spring is designed to make it as easy and lightweight for you to integrate with as possible it s easier for them to specify that the interface method merely throw exception
it really depends on the memory allocator you re using however i think by default malloc and free are non-reentrant as they maintain the list of blocks of memory in a static list
on the other hand if i were to write this pattern over several line i would have used braces and indented the pattern
i can t answer for everything but the library support for scientific and mathematic libraries in python is much greater than that for ruby
python is in general a much more mature language than ruby in my opinion and as a result many more developers have been encouraged others to develop mature libraries
conversely python is much more popular than ruby for doing just about everything else and is beginning to compete with ruby-on-rails with solutions like django as well as the google app engine
python in general is more mature than ruby ruby appeared in the englih-speking worlds only in this century but in terms of libraries one can only say it depends
imho python is better for mathematical stuff and for working with c++ applications while ruby is better for everyday scripting and creating simple web applications
here you can see the two relevant line of code which gave me huge performance increases using mootools but can be ported to jquery
this can even be done in webforms and not just asp.net-mvc
if its value is true this is the default-value the module should be loaded at startup
it is not possible with dom and javascript on web browser so you should use ajax or sth similar to process xml
that behavior seems to be broken under windows-vista
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one
unless you are willing to tie your code to a specific compiler and target-platform there is no better way
2 static extension methods can only be added to static-classes
eventually we wont be able to get faster eventually we will be limited by space hence why you see newer processor under 3ghz and multi core
well the truth is that c++ is faster than java is faster than pretty much everything else actually but sometimes c++ code can be poorly written and java may prevent beginners to make some mistakes resulting in many of the claims that java is as fast as c++ there are even claims that python psyco are as fast as c++ and faster than java
does anyone recommend any particular cmd-line svn client for windows
in general using saaj will be slower than cxf since it doesn t allow streaming which cxf would normally do
inspect.getargumentspec func returns a tuple with four items arguments vararguments varkw defaults len arguments is the primary arity but arity can be anything from that to infinity if you have vararguments and or varkw not none and some arguments may be omitted and default if defaults is not none
supervising controllers is less work but less testable
and last it seems like a very fast language nearly as fast as java and really close or beating the second fastest language on the jm scala
guys i am trying to write a stored procedure in t-sql sql server that will select records based on a date field keeping a variance of minutes in mind
i ended up with my own retrieve implementation with the help of pycurl it supports more protocols than urllib urllib2 hope it can help other people
and the expressions mean to match any character other than those described in the character set
there are two activerecord constructs that could be used within this scenario they are single-table-inheritance and polymorphic inheritance
use linq-to-sql it s no longer dead
i think this in my mind at least would work without requiring additional markup in the source files so users of plain text-editor wouldn t be disadvantaged by having all this extra markup cluttering the files
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it
i have gotten advice to not return the items in question in the retrieve_item event that i do not want displayed but when i do not return anything less than a listview item cached from an array of listviewitems holding all my listview items in question i get an exception error saying that i must return a valid listviewitem in the retrievevirtualitem event like it reads in the msdn it will do
this gives you more control over the upload process and you can display a progress-bar during upload more user-friendly
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
in a regular hosted environment on one of those cheap webhosters like dreamhost with around 1000 articles in joomla a couple of users and a few hundreds visitors a day would a sqlite database with a persistent connection sqlite_popen perform noticeable faster than the mysql equivalent with the tcp-ip overhead etc.
change to an editor that directly supports markdown a simple text-editor will do but you could go for a more advanced text-editor with markdown mode such as vim markdown mode
you can also embrace standards such as xhtml 1.1 strict which is almost impossible with asp.net webforms due to the auto generated html
the other things in already established mvp architecture with web forms in my app give me more flexibility than pure asp.net-mvc approach without webforms which i like although require a bit more code than ms asp.net-mvc examples never tried it for real project to see if it stays that way like in those examples in screencasts
when a user uploads an image get the dimensions of it then work out which is greater theheight or the width
i friend-function definitions within classes can only be found by argument-dependent-lookup when called from outside the class definition
look at the stringwithcontentsofurl-encoding error method of nsstring - it lets you pass in a url as an instance of nsurl which can easily be instantiated from nsstring and returns a string with the complete contents of the page at that url
but if i scroll more than 0.5 cell up or down the app will crash
i m building classes that interface with the twitter api and i m wondering whether php s built-in xml or json parser is faster
since json is only a description of nested string sequences without the need to offer a dom interface attributes parsing and other subtle stuff my guess is that a json parser is way faster that an xml parser
however neither is quite as rich as you require for example to present the same data as bytes or halfwords you need to copy it between two arrays the numpy third-party add-on is much more powerful for interpreting the same area of memory in several different ways and for example to display some bytes in hex there s nothing much bundled beyond a simple loops or list comprehension such as
numpy s arrays are more compact than python lists -- a list of lists as you describe in python would take at least 20 mb or so while a numpy 3d array with single-precision floats in the cell would fit in 4 mb
one notable playwright says code-readability is more important than micro optimizations and i agree
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning
i don t know if your example was incomplete but i think initializing the variable to the default-value is saner than using a nullable and then the
affinity is not determined by the cpu state and can therefore not be modified by assembly alone
the cookie in turn can save the login information that will be used for authentication via the google gadget api
yes i agree that do while-loops can be rewritten to a while-loop however i disagree that always using a while-loop is better
i m sure this would be simpler than the perl python solutions and it would be much more reliable because the header would be being parsed by the c compilers parser
i have found very few instances where it s more terse to do a do-while instead of a while-loops
a wcf component can be hosted in any kind of environment in .net 3.0 such as a console application windows application or iis
wcf can be hosted by any windows process that is able to host the .net framework 3.0
you ll need to explicitly match line delimiters if you want to match across multiple lines
i m not an sql expert and even then have spent more time on sql-server than oracle
xml is good for this too - it s slightly more verbose than json but easy to read and good for messaging and other xml-based systems too
for pcs you will usually get more than one ip-address if you query by hostname because nowadays you typically have at least two wifi and ethernet adapters with their individual mostly single ip-address
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes
i need help here on how we need to decide a property can be converted to radio-button or list box etc
in some cases it would seem that copy-paste is better - each user of the paste code has a private copy which it can customize without consequences
in windows-vista the option of publish is no more available
copy-paste is better - each user of
and compare draw on for your php implementation even if you don t know much python
the each methods will pass the current key the current value and a boolean indicating if there are more elements as arguments to the callback function
shouldn t the cookie be encrypted by default under an http connection
i think what you want is for doxygen to produce html output that is more similar to javadoc which has both pros and cons
why not python or ruby both of which have excellent web frameworks available and are much easier to learn than perl but much better-designed than php
it s almost certainly over-clever and should probably be separated into viewdidload and viewwillappear rather than two versions of viewwillappear
after having used both languages for a while i find the syntax and usability of the core perl language to be slightly better than php
- as i say absolutely fine with firefox and google-chrome
i understand that in ie 5.5 6 and 7 when you modify a dom element before it is closed it throw an operation aborted error this article has more information
it can be done using display table with 100height but then naturally ie doesn t support that either
this is less than ideal obviously because of the increase in disk io due to these temp files -- what i really would like is an enhanced tail -f that would terminate the pipe cleanly after a certain number of seconds
edit actually this kills tail doesn t cause it to exit gracefully so we lose the entire pipe
supervising controllers - mvvm is much closer to the supervising controllers pattern than to the passive view
this link call create action in group_members controllers and after create action performed i want to show groups invite.html.erb with group_id i mean after click send invite group_members will be created and then the current page will be shown like this
on the other hand seperation of concerns sounds reasonable and we are in the entity domain now so i will use the way you two both recommended though i have to admit this is easier and cleaner to achieve in linq-to-sql by using associatewith
the answer is that python is inherently much slower than c++ or even java
when the nodes has no more children dump the path
a basic 8ball answering yes or no could probably be programmed in less than 10 line of code and it can be expanded incrementally in any number of ways
still there is this persistent meme that git has worse documentation than say subversion with its version-control with subversion also known as svnbook and mercurial the definitive guide also known as hg-book .
if your problem and schema is more dynamic - graphy - you may benefit from the triple store approach where it s easier to hop across the data than it is typically in a rdbms world aka joins
if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and theheight has to be proportional of the width
which everyone knows has an infinite number of non-repeating digits in its decimal expression which means it cannot be expressed as a fraction so it will be left over and that means that the set of irrational-numbers is larger than the set of counting numbers
the free software foundation has consistently claimed that software linked to a library covered by gpl is a derived work and thus needs to be covered by gpl itself indeed that s the main difference of the lgpl license
the history table will be populated by triggers and each row will be a denormalization representation of the row that changed
