constructor	object
for non-primitive-types building an instances of those to be passed to the constructor of the object to test meaning you recursively have to consider the constructor parameters of that parameter primitive-types or not

190123
constructor	object
i think vonc s on the right tracking but i would even settle for something less sophisticated such as a parameterized test that takes in the .class object for which the object methods are being tested followed by a variables numbers of constructor arguments

190134
traffic	packets
install this tool on each tier and watch the http traffic and packets

190135

however after this foreach loops is finished .when you enumerate result it will contains all product that has the last attributes of the requiredattributess collections in it s attributess properties also a collections

190245
inlining	inline
but mainly it is controlled by the inline keyword and compiler switches for example you can have it auto inline small functions even without the keyword. its important to note that debugging compilations should never be inlining as the calltack will not be preserve to mirror the call you created in code

190265
binary-data	chunks
i have binary-data arriving in regular chunks via a networkstream

190282

190374
h.323	sip
- i recommend using the sip protocols as opposed to h.323

190376

linked-list	nodes
essentially a linked-list is composed of nodess each of which containss one datum an object which itself can contains several member variables to be precise and a link to the next nodes in the list or a null-pointer if there is no such next nodes

190393
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes
to add multiple pieces of data to a single nodes sounds like adding several links off of one nodes which turns your linked-list into an n-ary tree

191376
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
it seems like maybe there should be an abstract base .profile class that the other profiling should extends but i m not sure how to implements that eg a jointable between .profile types and account types

191386
base-class	inherited
i d suggest aggregation rather than inherited here for the relationship between account and .profile but have an account base-class that is inherited into multiple account types

191386
constructor	object	contains	set
the account contains a .profile object which can be set in the constructor of each polymorphism account types

191400
worksheet	excel

on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processor limited during compile-time although a faster hard-drive would still help speed things up

191513
base-class	inherited
a class inherited from object if you do not specify a base-class

191513
base-class	inherited
however if you specify a base-class it will inherited from that class instead of object

191521
base-class	inherited
this is perfectly valid and says that specialtyderivedclass inherited from specialbase-class specialtyderivedclass parent which in turn derives from base-class specialtyderivedclass grandparent

191521
base-class	inherited
this is not allowed in .net but it says that specialityderivedclass inherited from both base-class and specialbase-class which are both parent

191521
base-class	inherited
this says that specialtyderivedclass inherited from base-class it s parent and also ispecialbase and ispecialderived also parent s but more like step-parents as interfaces can t specify functionality

191536
json	xml
in a nutshell how should we convert xml to json using python

191549
selected	listbox
.when an item is added to the list the item appears in the listbox however .when one selected the item the currency manager positioning will not go to the positioning

191578
contains	set
for visual-studio 2005 you have to go to hkey_local_machine software microsoft visual-studio 8.0 nativede stepover and add string value contains regular expression for each function or set of functions you wish to exclude

191601
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
in opera the event target for windows.onload and body onload and even windows.addeventlistener load func false will be the windows instead of the document like in safari and firefox

191602
subproject	libs
vc 2005 does not compile more then one file at the time per project .so either move to vc 2008 to use both of your cpu cores or break your .solution to multiple libs subproject to get multiple compilations going

191653
groovy	java
updates also works with java c# c cobol ruby jsp asp html xml visual basic groovy source code and even plain text files

191656
isnull	nvl
you can do the isnull or nvl stuff but it s just going to make the engine do more work

191677
contains	set
unfortunately it doesn t start the animation .when you set the contains block to display block .so we used the above line of code to trick ie into reload the image

191691
arguments	default
i have often found that developers who have no experience with multiple-inheritance will often default to the multiple-inheritance-is-unnecessary arguments simply because they do not have any experience with the paradigms

191744
python	java
forget all that python just allocates more memory as needed there is not a myriad of comandline arguments for the viewmodel as in java just let it run

191745
contains	elements	contains	any
therefore it s important that this meta declaration occurs before any other elements that may contains non-ascii characters

actually i hope to integrated any solution into an existing nant build-process

191812
attributes	properties
further updates i m not sure if what i m talking about is an attributes or not to clarify a little what i would like to creat in an entry in the following properties page.

191813
constructor	object
the difference between include object and just encapsulated object is that you don t have to create the delegation forwarding yourself and they don t exist as independent object that you can pass around they are part of your object and live and die together with your object or more technically spoken the memory for your object and all include ones is created with a single alloc call same memory block you just need to init them in your constructor call while .when using real delegation each of these object causes an own alloc call has an own memory block and lives completely independently of your object

191821
environment	building
it provides gnu styles semantics obviously and is small enough to simply include with the project for distribution if you re not sure of your audience s building environment

191824
windows-vista	windows	versioning	upgrade
a lot of companies are ignoring windows-vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows versioning .when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows-vista

191824
windows-vista	windows
it is better to rewrite once for the new windows than to rewrite once for windows-vista and then again for the next windows versioning

191856
environment	building
if you can afford it tfs is a nice product that gives you bug-tracking version-control and a building environment

191864
windows-vista	windows
if you planning on upgrading your software for windows-vista checkout windows logo program requirements for the windows-vista logo program for software ms-word document 183 kb file named windows-vista software logo specifications 1.1.doc

191873
32-bit	64bit
i d like to configure visual-studio 2005 to copy .dll s based on whether the os is 64bit or 32-bit during a building

191873
32-bit	64bit
my first attempt was to use a batch-file to lookup the windows versioning but some 32-bit and 64bit versioninging of windows shared the same versioning numbers

191909
implements	extends
one thing that results from that is that i cannot ever add to an interface once i have release it because it would break compilation for anyone implements it -- the only option is to extends the interface

191929
abstract	sealed	protected	public
public private protected virtual abstract overrides new static internal sealed and any others i m forgetting

191942
abstract	sealed
i usually start off with the access modifiers first then virtual abstract sealed then overrides new etc

191966
required	checked
everything that is required to rebuild the solution should be checked in

191968
instances	private
that way you can have a shared interface but then delegation your implementation to a private instances of the class you would normally inherited from

191990
scala	java
java for language or scala if you want to be bleeding edges depending on how you plan to support it and what your developers are like it might be better but also worse

192132
contains	elements
i was using overflow hidden to force the div to contains the floated labels and input elements

192156
coalesce	isnull
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

192160
javascript	dom
i wrote a small javascript utility that walks the dom for whatever page it has been include on and then stubs out a valid css skeleton .so that i can immediately start writing styles without having to do the repetitive task for every site i work on

192170

if you need shortcuts that won t be available on the menus then you ll have to handle that your self via the keyup or keydown events either on the form or the control

192173
panels	grid
did you put your textbox control inside of another control such as a panels or grid

192179
protected	public
the main difference between traits and default interface implementation which java now has is that traits can contains private or protected methods unlike traditional interface methods that must be public

192188
profiling	debugging	zend-debugger	xdebug
i ask only because using the zend-debugger with zend-studio has proven to be much easier fewer step to start stop debugging from the browser but i really like some of the profiling tools available that only work with xdebug

192201
subproject	libs
it s very easy to write binding to existing libs .so i just do that as a subproject

192220
hashmap	arrays	data-structures	hashmap
assume further you only have basic data-structures arrays and hashmap no fancy object with parent children references no orm no framework just your two hands

192220
hashmap	arrays
the result set i spoke of can be pictured as an arrays of hashmap to stay in that terminology

192220
children	nodes
each nodes can have n children

192222
contains	elements
enumerate source and yield elements until count elements have been yielded or source contains no more elements

192230

most fortune 500 companies now use mysql or postgresql or another open source rdbms somewhere in their organization even if they also use one of the commercial closed-source rdbms branding

192230
postgresql	mysql
i realize that both mysql and postgresql were available as early as 1995 but i would argue that they weren t mainstream for several years after that

192237
attributes	properties
.when creating a wpf user-controls is it possible to make a properties required via an attributes or other mechanism

192254
any	set
assign the properties to an initial value which can be distinguished from any other value that it might be set to null for reference-type

192254
any	set
also make sure this is prominently describe in the documentation on the class on the properties and on any methods that will throw the exception-handling if the properties is not set

192271
contains	elements
now xpart contains only those elements of x which lie in the specified range

192278
revision	utility
there s definitely utility in having a building or revision numbers there too for troubleshooting although if you ve got really rigorous cm you might not need to include it

192329
void	main
static void main string arguments

192396
protected	public
if you look at c++ for each class you specify after the colon in the class declaration the kind of inherited you get is determined by the access modifiers private protected or public

192409
contains	elements
thing2k s answer is pretty good but i d seriously recommend having code to contains child user-interface elements in the base user-interfaceelement class

192409
textbox	button
if you don t support this in the base-class you ll run into major problems .when you try to implements anything more complex than a textbox and a button

192416
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera
firefox also supports ntlm as does opera and google-chrome

192462
children	nodes
then you can add a term in your search for querying the immediate children of a given nodes

192464
postgresql	oracle
there are two databases behind it an oracle and a postgresql one

192489
rhino-mocks	mbunit
this is probably a summary of what has already been said but for tdd i personally use rhino-mocks and mbunit

192489
rhino-mocks	nmock
the advantage of rhino-mocks is we do not need to use magic strings in setting your expectations as you do in nmock

192489
mbunit	nunit	cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
nunit is supported by default in cruisecontrol.net and you have to do a little extra work to get mbunit to work in cruisecontrol.net

192489
mbunit	nunit
testdriven.net allows you to right click and run tests in the ide and it supports mbunit and nunit and others

192489
testdriven.net	gallio
i have not used any others .so i could not compare and contrast them with you but nbehave is supported by gallio from the mbunit team which means you can run your bdd tests just as you would your unit tests with testdriven.net

192569
callback	methods
in php 5.2 you can use a variables as the methods named in a static call but to use a variables as the classnamed you ll have to use callback as describe by baileyp

192570
firefox	gecko
rv 1.8.1.17 gecko 20080829 firefox 2.0.0.17

192603
binary-tree	tree
then sacrificing a bit of memory especially if your tree is sparse-matrix and or unballanced you can with a bit of index math access all the strings randomly by storing your tree width first in the arrays like .so for a binary-tree

192608
filtering	sorting
i m looking to utilize jquery to handle a few very common request we get for data tables of varying sizes scrolling sorting and dynamic filtering

192621
meta-inf	jar	.war	jar
finally in each of your project there should be a meta-inf manifest.mf file that just has the named of the jars that jar .war depends on

192628
.when	ready
it s better to use a 301 redirect .when you re ready to make the switching source

192632
rollingfileappender	logfile
i m 99 sure that rollingfileappender dailyrollingfileappender while it gives you the date-rolling functionality you want doesn t have any way to specify that the current logfile should use the datepattern as well

192643
attributes	properties
at its essence it loops through the sqldatareader s ordinals and all the properties of t and populate the properties that match the named of the ordinals also some attributes magic is throw to change column namedd

192648
contains	set
the guitar object contains an attributes called named and i d like to be able to set that as the pagetitle for the individual page views

192656
processor	cpu
it turns out that in most versioning of the 386 and later there actually was a cpu id but it was only visible at one specific time right after the processor was reset in the edx register

192656
protected-mode	real-mode
it would then clean up the mess turn a20 back on flip back from protected-mode to real-mode for dos and return control to the original code

192672
virtual-memory	paging
the performance improvement can occur because the operating systemd now gets to manage this former file i o along with all your other programmatic memory-access and can in theory leverage the paging algorithms and .so forth that it is already using to support virtual-memory for the rest of your program

192672
solaris	bsd
anecdotes i have heard say that the solaris and bsd virtual-memory systemdd may show better performance improvements than the viewmodel systemd of linux--but i have no empirical data to back this up

192691
findstr	cmd
it supports regular expression via the findstr cmd and uses mplayer to play the tracking

192694
python	ruby
in general monkey patching is less used in python than in ruby

192697
reserved-words	keyword
how do you fix a named mismatch problem if the client-side named are keyword or reserved-words in the server-side language you are using

192736
git-repo	repo
updates i did use the -t -b and -t options in my case because the svn repo has multiple-projects but i want the git-repo to contains only the project i m working on

192737
any	set
the value set in the view will overrides any value that may have already been set in the controllers

192764
subtract	time
find today s remaining time by subtract today s end time minus the start time the result should be a timespan

192792
web-services	ntlm
their object-model simplifies the integration a great deal depending on what you want to do and .so it actually means less code over-all - but better tested and testable code and al.so you can work around things such as the ntlm auth used by the tfs web-services

192806
any	set
if you want a keyboard shortcut to be used from any control on the form without using a toolbar set

192806
keydown	keyup
this will allow all keypress events to get filtering by the keypress keydown and keyup events at the form level which will allow a single keyboard shortcut to be handled in one location instead of duplicating the functionality in all user-controls

192828
web-config	app-config
what you want to do is copy the configuration section out of the app-config file from the libs assembly project and merge it carefully into the applicable web-config or app-config for the main assembly

192846
worksheet	excel
you write your assembly code in the excel cell and your memory layout in the other worksheet and then at the bottom the machine-code binary strings will be calculated

192852
getter	setter
in this case there is the possibility that your setter getter may inadvertently make direct or indirect assumptions about the state of the object

192852
observers	destroy
for example in the code below the observers does not know that example is being destroy and could assume that other properties which have already been free are valid

192864
virtual-machine	vmware
your options are either to explicit write your software in a way that lets it dump state on a signals and later resume from the dumped state or to run your software in a virtual-machine and migrate that to the alternate hosts - xen and vmware both support freeze restore as well as live migration

192870
scheme	lisp
some other language interpreter do that too i m thinking of lisp and scheme implementation mostly

192872
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
also you may want to consider modifying an existing class that s already inside media printing or building up the new css using something other than innerhtml which i ll admit smells awful to me but seems to work in opera 9.6 safari for windows 3.1.2 ie 6 and firefox 2.0.0.17 i didn t test any other browsers

192876
any	set
is there any way to set a systemd wide memory limit a process can use in windows-xp

192888
hide	show
i have some nested tables that i want to hide show upon a click on one of the top-level rows

192935
primitive	int
unlike the pointers the reference makes the manipulation of the data as easy as it would be with a primitive like int or bool without using the operators all the time

192978
webserver	upload
what i want to do is upload the pdf files to a dedicated-server for performing the desired process photoshop action convert send images back to webserver

192993
binary	hex
is there a way to see via hex editor or otherwise if data in a binary file is aligned or packed specifically for an hp-ux systemd

193013
finite-state-machine	dfa
the answer was to compile all your regexes together into a deterministic finite-state-machine also known as a deterministic finite automaton or dfa

193025
automata	dfa	automata	nfa	dfa	nfa
the regular expression are converted into a single non deterministic automata nfa and possibily transformed in a deterministic automata dfa

193047
wan	vpn
the client will be run from remote location using a wan or vpn hence the idea of using a web service rather than direct database access

193055
python	java
which amusingly is written in python and not java

193067
mac-address	ethernet
i couldn t figure out how to get the ethernet mac-address from banyan s adaptor as there was no documented api to do this

193086
arrays	loops

you ll effectively have to do rpm for fedora debs for ubuntu and debian etc

193129
virtual-machine	vmware	configuration	upgrade
use virtual-server or vmware and building a virtual-machine with your configuration then upgrade that and test test test

193138
silverlight	wpf
however i don t work on visio wpf clr or silverlight team

193138
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is related to wpf in the sense that they shared xaml and the corresponding clr types

193138
silverlight	wpf
silverlight supports only a subset of what wpf offers though as it is not targeting windows os only and thus is limited by the fact that it has to be portable

193138
silverlight	wpf
with silverlight 3 shipped sl and wpf are getting even closer and sharing bigger set of supported features

193138
silverlight	wpf
and no i still don t work on the wpf or silverlight team

193140
spaces	output
if you want to output the tree using indentation rather than nested elements you can simply skip the printing statements to printing the divs and printing a numbers of spaces equals to some multiple of the size of stack before each item

193140
nested-lists	dictionary
you could also easily use this methods to construct a set of nested-lists or dictionary

193140
children	nodes
each elements in an arrays is a 2-tuple consisting of the nodes itself and a list of all its children

193176
silverlight	wpf
wpf is being used as a replacement for winforms and as a competitor to flash in the form of silverlight

193176
silverlight	wpf
i have move away from wpf and am doing a lot of silverlight 3 development

193176
silverlight	wpf
there are wpf and silverlight versioning

193176
silverlight	wpf
take a look at mvvm and prism if you are going to be doing wpf or silverlight development

193180
.when	ready
your production site is always on trunk while you do your development on branches which get merged back to trunk .when they re ready for release

193181
python	java
python doesn t have a distinction between src .lib and bin like java or c has

193194
put	get
seriously though you get back what you put in

193198
ostringstream	std
the std ostringstream is a good methods but sometimes this additional trick might get handy transforming the formatting to a one-liner

193230
key-value	key
on startup the application would open the xml file iterate through all the key-value pairs encrypt both the key and value of each create a hash of the encrypted key and add the encrypted key-value pair to a static hashtable

193230
key-value	key
the function for reading a setting took an ordinary string key and returned an ordinary string value .so it had to encrypt the key hash it and use the hash to locate the key-value pair in the hashtable and then decrypt and return the value

193249
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
it could add subtract multiplying and divide

193278
constructor	object
in the case of #1 the standards unit test entails creating two instances of the same object with the same data passed to the constructor and verifying equals hashcode

193282
put	get
note that this is all hidden away in a private framework .so don t try to put this in code you submit to the app-store and be prepare for .some hackery to get it to work

193287
paintcomponent	draw
alternatively use a jcomponent that overrides paintcomponent to draw as you wish

193292
haskell	lisp	haskell	ocaml	haskell	erlang	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	ocaml	lisp
as i ve already got ruby lisp haskell and erlang under my belt i m interested specifically in what kiss-violating features i should look out for in ocaml

193293
exif	xmp
given a filename i need to be able to access certain metadata in an image for a closed source project i m currently developing without regard to how the metadata is stored that is exif iptc or xmp

193314
any	set	updating	updates
if you re going to need more performance than that i would set up a trigger-based systemd for updating the balance to the main account table then updates the view behind the scenes .so you don t need to change any other code

193336
linux	osx
the visual-studio command-prompt isn t near as nice as the linux osx terminals

193381
debugging	trace
every time the file you have selected in the filtering is modified you get an alert you can use both a debugging class or trace class to output data

193382
erlang	scheme
try it in scheme or ruby or erlang as well

193390
shell	bash
you can run bash or other shell on windows

193390

you get most of your classic linux unix cmd shell scripting etc

193420
bash	zsh
i ve been combining putty cygwin screens and zsh not bash lately

193446
entity	poco
the dal should be there to take a poco and persistent it - in your case that means mapping it to and persistentent an ef entity

193456
rollback	commit
with a nested transactional if t1 issues rollback after t1 commit counter returns to it s original value because it also undoes t2 s commit

193458
reflection	runtime
it uses only compile-time reflection introspection .so that it can work with struct which unlike full-blown classes have no runtime reflection introspection capabiities in d because they re supposed to be lightweight

193469
debugging	exit
i see that if i run in release-mode the console windows stays up after the program exit but in debugging mode this is not the case

193469
visual-studio	release-mode
i just want to make visual-studio pause after running the tests with debugging like it would if i were running in release-mode

193483
executable-jar	jar
.when using maven to building an executable-jar how do i specify the jvm arguments that are used .when the jar is execute

193521
factors	primes
collect primes factors for all numbers between 1 and 20

193521
factors	primes
count the maximal exponent of each primes factors we have as well as 5 7 11 13 17 19 each appearing only once

193553
while-loop	arrays
you could just always use a while-loop and compute the arrays limit before hand

193563
contains	any
if this arrays contains any of

193570
directory	folder
and you can ignore the arguments about deleting a single directory to uninstaller your program - windows-vista won t let you modify files in the program files directory .so your configuration will need to go in a different folder anyway

193615
decimal-point	digits
your only reliable solution is to store the numbers as a sequences of digits and the location of the decimal-point as per decimal types mentioned above

193622
automata	dfa
you could compile the regex into a hybrid dfa bucchi automata where each time the ba enters an accept state you flag which regex rules hit

193623
meta-inf	jar
create a service.xml in the meta-inf directory of your jar file and put this into it

193626
octal	hex
once upon a long time ago 1987 or .so i wrote a program odx octal dump in hex - weird that i continue to use - it gives me a hex dump 16 bytes per line plus an image of the printable characters

193633
wavefront	.obj
wavefront .obj is a very simple text file-format for storing 3d model and it s supported by all 3d model applications eg

193633
3dsmax	maya
maya 3dsmax lightwave .so you can export and import your model very easily

193633
wavefront	.obj
the wavefront .obj is as simple as it gets and well specified

193652
compression	streaming
on the client side you can reverse the compression process and convert the streaming back to your desired image

193701
python	php
because i need to be able to use the api in very different settings i m currently planning to have a versioning in php for web-applications and a second versioning in python for desktop applications and long-running-processes

193713
python	php
i know this from personal experience having ported a libs from python to php

193713
getter	setter
idioms aren t just naming for example python has a good deal of magic you can use with getter and setter to make object properties act magical

193725
authentication	login
if you have authentication page where you allow a user to login i would suggest not to include the master file for the form

193730
firefox	safari
it was behaving properly in firefox but not safari

193734
contains	any
if your .app collects any data that is meant to be protected by privacy laws then you will have to treat the screenshot as contains sensitive information and protect them accordingly

193770
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
...you could jump through these errors using usual keyboard shortcuts mouse click you use for compilation error analysis...

193802
windows-vista	windows
how do i use windows-vista s folderid api inorder to retrieve filepath for known folder such as systemd or windows

193806
entity-framework	llblgenpro
there are several other linq to x implementation around including linq-to-nhibernate and linq to llblgenpro that offer or mapping and supporting frameworks in a broadly similar fashion to the entity-framework

193809
groovy	scala
i mean scala groovy and jruby have closures and produce valid bytecode

193816
jquery	.post
with jquery..post you will be only able to send key-value pairs to the server in a .post request however you can use pluginss like jquery multiple-file-upload plugins

193869
delphi	c++
delphi or c++ builder - it s a difficult choice

193869
delphi	c++
for c++ may look better on a cv than delphi

193869
delphi	c++
a few years back i considered a switching from c++ to delphi but the lack of raii idiom was the one thing that i found difficult to come to terms with

193873
system.reflection	.net
in .net 3.5 i m going to be working with system.reflection to use aop probably in the context of castle s castle interceptor to do things like defined which security actions need to be performed at the methods level etc

193873
interceptor	inject
caching is inject to my interceptor via constructor-injection

193882
environment	execution
note an operation architecture team has the role to make operational an execution environment meaning to have

193887
perl	ruby
i think the biggest difference is that ruby is much more similar to perl in terms of useage

193887
perl	ruby
ruby got all the advantages of perl and the oop is much more similar to smalltalk than perl s oop hack

193896
32-bit	x86
the binary is a 32-bit x86 linux executable

193913
callback	methods
javascript only has functions and no delegation like c# .so it is not possible to pass a methods and the object it should be applied to as a callback

193913
callback	methods
the only way to call a methods in a callback is to call it yourself inside a callback

193921
python	java	python	c++
an example of a complete project written in objective-c java c++ or python is found at specialkeval

193922
principles	srp
moreover each object is srp single responsibility principles

193937
elementtree	lxml
see lxml elementtree import example

193956
python	java
and they complain that their genius built the set of apps in a period of weeks it can t take us months to rewrite them in java python vb c#

194005
debugging	trace
i had to prepare everything i could debugging output messages soiling the code trace tools remote-debuggingging tools on the camera and the list goes on

194015
registration	login
or should i implements my own login and registration mechanism for my users

194031
nested	order
if you use nested sets sometimes referred to as modified pre-order tree traversal you can extraction the entire tree or any subtree within it in tree order with a single query at the cost of insert being more expensive as you need to manage columns which describe an inorder path through thee tree

194034
controllers	routes
you need to either add an extension to your routes controllers .mvc action id and map that extension to asp.net or map all request to asp.net

194060
percent-encoding	utf8-decode
basically the unicode url is encode in utf8 and each byte of the utf8-decode string is encode using percent-encoding

194061
markup	xhtml
no you should not use xhtml if you can t guarantee well-formedness and in practice you can t guarantee it if you don t use xmlserializer to generator markup

194061
markup	xhtml
xhtml with just one markup error ceases to be xhtml

194068
solaris	linux
i started to use ruby at work because we needed some scripting-language that behaved more-or-less equally under solaris linux and windows 98 2000 xp

194068
smalltalk	lisp
and .when were at the lisp land try to replace lisp with smalltalk

194081
factors	primes
step one gets the primes factors of a numbers

194100
contains	set
this would at best create fragmentation within the libs as some developers work to the core and some required the bolt-on and at worst would mean that we will start having distributions of java in the manor of java each contains a different set of jars and bolt-ons

194112
arrays	loops
for checkedbox and radio button see whether and for html elements you ll need to loops over the select.options arrays and checked for each option whether

194117
markup	xhtml
if you want to use xhtml just .so you can close certain elements with where html-compatible just use html5 markup .so the browser is in full standards mode

194117
markup	xhtml
html5 allows the use of in an html-compatible way the same html-compatible way you have to do it .when using xhtml 1.0 markup with text html

194120
dhcp	arp
as for the dhcp problem if the other computer is on the same sub.net you can look it up by mac-address using .net arp

194134
.when	ready
how about adding a scripting to the remote machine which gets run on startup to have it tell you .when it is ready

194147
updating	updates
updating numerous selected insert and updates queries vs

194154
lookup	any
is there any way to caching the last item that was found and shortcut the lookup if the cursor is in the same place

194157
windows-vista	windows-xp
on windows-xp and 32-bit versioning of windows-vista this works fine

194159
windows-server	windows
i recommend downloading the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5 but if you donâ t have the network bandwidth or just want the samples then the last option should be the most suitable

194161
environment	building
if you building the application .so it is amenable to automated configuration-management and deployment to multiple environment you can get to .something that is fairly easy to maintain even on multiple-instances

194166
continuous-integration	teamcity
we do this in a variety of ways -- either we issue an svn-checkout for a subdirectories but svn-externals would work for this or we do a wget ... to grab the output from the last successful building of another project we use teamcity for continuous-integration and it makes artifacts available over http

194173
delphi	basic
.so if you were to pass a string that was allocated by visual basic to a dll written in delphi you would end up in big trouble because both would now try to manage the string and would get into each other s hair

194184
boost	stl
using precompiled-headers this is quite useful for stl and boost

194191
64bit	x86
note however that the programfiles x86 environment variables is only available if your application is running 64bit

194191
32-bit	x86
if your application is running 32-bit you can just use the programfiles environment variables whose value will actually be program files x86

194195
delphi	basic	delphi	c++
edit i ve written com dlls in visual c++ 6 compaq visual fortran delphi visual basic 6 activeperl and a few others

194195
delphi	ada	delphi	c++
i ve written standards dlls in visual c++ 6 delphi ada and a few others

194195
delphi	vb6
the question was originally written in the context of a delphi dll+typelib reimplementation of a vb6 original

194197
elementtree	lxml
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194206
hash	md5
one thing about distributing the filenamed into different directory if you consider splitting your md5 filenamed into different subdirectory which is generally a good idea i would suggest keeping the complete hash as filename and duplicates the first few chars as directory named

194223
32-bit	64bit
32-bit program running on 64bit windows

194261
buffering	streaming
the original source came from the web but i added try-catch-finally clauses to be sure that should something wrong happen the buffering streaming would be closed and thus my os ressources free before quiting the function

194261
buffering	streaming
i am missing something or do i really have to produce ugly and bloated code in java just to handle exception-handling in the close methods of a buffering streaming

194262
hide	show
then capture each subclassing types and show or hide a different loader graphic

194277
oracle	mysql
if you are using normals insert operations and want a significant performance improvement i suggest using some sort of a bulk-load api if h2 supports it like oracle sqlldr sybase bcp mysql load-data-infile

194281
buffering	streaming
can t back that by numbers but fewer call should be more efficient than adding buffering streaming on top

194282
shell	bash
you might want to take a look at this pure bash implementation if keeping it all in shell scripting is that important

194282
python	perl
that said other scripting languages such as python and perl are also highly portable and will make your life a lot easier

194289
python	java
edit in response to a request for clarity -- consider that i will have a server written in python one client written in c# and another client written in java

194292
buffering	streaming
closing the buffering streaminging closes the streaming underneath

194306
python	ruby	python	java
since it will take a while to work out the nuances you ll probably be happier with a dynamic-languages like python or ruby than with a static language like java or c#

194306
python	tcl
for example python tcl and javascript are lightweight interpreter that you can call from c or c# programs

194306
python	java
your java and c# clients can talk with a python subprocess

194327
communication	messages
i want to have intermediate storage on a server and a messaging layer but i want there to be performant means to communication between devices for shorter unimportant messages

194334
contains	set
on the other hand if you really need to use the io support in the jdk ioutils contains a set of closequietly methods that close readers writer streaming etc

194347
value	field
enables submit and reset button if field value change

194347
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
supports ie 6+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ and presumably opera but i did not test

194351
launchd	daemons
you launchd a daemons monitor on the remote machine see the security parapraph

194359
debugging	trace
we al.so support diverting our output to the debugging trace systemd this is windows .so it s a simple call to outputdebuggingstring and our engineers have access to a debugging catcher called dbwin32

194369
triggers	insert
in terms of database-design put as few constraints indexes and triggers on the table s you re insert into as possible as these will all slow down the insert

194381
value	field
i would store each field value in a variables .when the page loads then compare those value .when the user unloads the page

194399
versioning	packaging
of course by packaging up your source into a garbled minified mess you have a lighting versioning of security through obscurity

194418
python	php	python	java	python	c++
i m a fairly green software developer and focus mainly on the web python php but am pretty well experienced with java applications and as an electrical engineering student looking forwarding to dive into some c++

194426
linux	unix
you can simply ssh into the linux unix systemd and run x11 programs direct to your mac screens ssh -x user host_or_ipaddress login and just run the x11 programs you want and the x11 apps will appear on the mac display

194426
linux	unix
same solution works with any linux unix systemd remote or virtual

194432
malloc	free
assuming that you allocated the memory dynamically using malloc or another memory allocation you free it using free

194437
while-loop	arrays
if you have many elements in the arrays and speed is an issue then you want to use a while-loop that iterates from highest to lowest

194444
malloc	free
.when it s about runtime memory allocation you can use your trusty malloc and free

194457
selected	button
i would use case2 and add a selected all deselected all button to the list

194460
csv	xml
i can parsing csv or xml files just fine but an xfa one has come along and i m not familar with the format

194485
32-bit	64bit
libpng wasn t linking properly because i ve built 32 64bit executable and 32-bit libs

194489
xstream	xom
if you decide to roll your own xml-configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parsing some xml take a look at xom

194489
meta-inf	jar
package most of your xml files inside application s jar either in the root or under meta-inf directory

194489
spring	guice
you can implements them using different libs and tools starting from raw jre adding spring guice or going for a full j2ee containers possibly with embedded spring

194490
innodb	myisam
the second arguments against eav i have heard is that it required table join that get into low double digits but it was commented that using innodb over myisam improved the performance some or it could be vice-versa but i can t remember totally

194504
ruby-on-rails	django
does it make sense to use a framework like ruby-on-rails or django

194514
constructor	object
in c# 3 constructor call are able to set field properties in a compact manner with object initializer expression

194517
attributes	properties
these usually use some sort of introspection on the class to determine what properties to read off the xml or they will have some static-class properties that map instances properties to xml tags or attributes

194517
attributes	properties
it takes all of 2 seconds to add a new public properties and a single line to read the data from an attributes or child tag

194524
access-control	authentication
a good authentication datamodel for such application would be role based access-control rbac

194526
traffic	packets
something curious about the logfile is that i have noticed numerous udp packets in fact it constitutes basically all of my incoming traffic that don t have my hosts as destination or source showing up in the logs

194526
packets	subnet
i thought this might be a implementation detail for udp the packets are hopping over my computer in the subnet but wikipedia ing udp didn t enlighten me any more and i don t see why my computer should be forwarding these packets in the first place

194540
constructor	private	instances	private
i write a static methods and make the constructor private if creating the instances does something that you wouldn t ordinarily expect a constructor to do

194575
multicast	packets
the packets addressed to ips starting with 239 and 224 are multicast packets

194585
any	set
the working set stuff is good job object also control working sets but that s not total memory usage only real memory usage paged in at any one time

194596
python	java
why support your own viewmodel .when someone else will support java or python for you

194596
python	java
is your own dsl and viewmodel better than java or python

194633
linux	unix
if you plan to develop on linux then this is all the more likely to occur as you get used to thinks like working with build-tools and scripting that are common on unix platform

194633
virtualbox	vmware
install something like virtualbox virtual-pc or vmware to run linux in a virtualenv

194633
ubuntu	linux
virtualization or a live cd versioning of linux such as the ubuntu live cd is a fantastic way to get used to linux without having to throw out the safety blanket of windows right away

194636
opensuse	ubuntu
if you re not happy with say ubuntu you can just nuke it and install something else say opensuse centos or fedora

194636
ubuntu	linux
it s .so popular that you often get better results in google by replacing linux with ubuntu

194646
player	movie
you create your movie player like normals and then do the following

194646
hide	show
doing this makes it .so your custom overlay will show and hide with the normals overlay as they are now one in the same

194656
getter	setter
i generally go with constructor destructor first then important methods followed by getter and setter and eventually misc

194667
fclose	fopen
compute the size of the file to search with fopen fseek file end fclose

194681
google-chrome	opera
tested and working in ff3 opera 9 ie6 and google-chrome

194702
linux	unix
i d been using unix linux types servers for best part of 13 years .when i switched

194702
any	set
makes it easy treating any os as just a set of things you have to learn

194777
httphandler	httpmodule
i would recommend implements and httphandler or an httpmodule for this types of scenario

194820
safari	opera
you can embed svg files with and in cutting-edge browsers opera safari also and css background-image

194831
constructor	object
eric lippert had an interesting .post on the related issue of object initialization which explains the reason for the order of constructor and field initializer

194840
country-codes	iso
edit upgrade to use 2-letter iso 3166 country-codes

194844
png	gif
create a png pnm pseudo gif svg

194880
safari	opera
you could also use svg + css background-image in opera 9.5 and safari

194884
chown	sudo
why not use sudo for the deployment routine and then chown -r on the rails_root

194889
double	int
for example adding two int is different than adding two double or even one int and one double

194889
tostring	equals
the truth is that like the tostring clone equals methods are for java quasi-standard-like c++ operator-overloading is .so much part of c++ that it becomes as natural as the original c operators or the before mentioned java methods

194889
subtract	add
do not subtract in a + operators as in do not subtract in a add function or return crap in a clone methods

194889
complex-numbers	numerical	complex-numbers	matrix	numerical	matrix
some object would greatly benefit from operator-overloading concrete or numerical types like bigdecimal complex-numbers matrix containers iterator comparator parsing etc.

194889
groovy	scala	perl	ruby	perl	lua	perl	c++	python	perl	python	lua	python	ruby	python	c++	haskell	scala	haskell	ada	haskell	fortran	haskell	python	haskell	c++	haskell	perl	haskell	lua	delphi	ada	delphi	c++	fortran	perl	fortran	ada	c++	lua	ada	lua
despite all the fud against used defined operator-overloading the following languages support it scala dart python f# c# d algol 68 smalltalk groovy perl 6 c++ ruby haskell matlab eiffel lua clojure fortran 90 swift ada delphi 2005 .

194895
environment	execution
execution environment the contents of

194907
put	get
one caveat with this and i m sure there s an option somewhere to control it but it s been my experience that once you put an xml comment anywhere in a project you ll get a compile warning for every public item that isn t commented if you don t use them everywhere in the project

194986
visitor-pattern	composite
the basic driving force behind the visitor-pattern is that by using interfaces on the concrete nodess every operation that needs to be added to a composite data structure must change every nodes

194987
oracle	mysql
you can use ssrs with any database server for which ado.net drivers are available including oracle and mysql

194994
solaris	linux
be aware that there a shared-libs that get loaded unconditionally at program startup and dynamically loaded libs bundles iirc that are loaded on demand and the two are somewhat different on macos x from the equivalent on linux or solaris

195032
3des	aes
if the algorithms you re working on are standards encryption algorithms like 3des and aes there is definitely hardware available

195044
code-coverage	ncover
ncover is a good tool to measure code-coverage

195046
32-bit	64bit
i would say use 64bit - if for no reason but easily using 3gb ram and that you can virtualize a 32-bit os on 64bit but not vice-versa

195064
contains	elements
the value of selected above will be an arrays of object contains the named and value of the selecteded elements

195070
boolean	int
i would like the fastest and most accurate function boolean isreachable string hosts int ports that passes the following junit tests under the conditional below

195073
onmousedown	onmouseup
then you can intercept the selectionchanged event in the onmousedown and do the selection in the onmouseup instead

195073
mousedown	mouseup
you will also have to maintain a list of the selecteded rows in the mousedown event and if it turns into a drag drop event you drag all these selecteded rows and selected them on the mouseup

195075
code-coverage	cobertura
cobertura - an open source code-coverage tool that can easily be coupled with junit tests to generator report

195092
controllers	routes
a front-controllers is the gateway for your application - all http request go through it and it routes to the appropriate controllers action

195102
deployment	install
i don t use setup install because i want to support multiple versioning of the .app al.so i have .some control of the runtime environment .so i don t package python with my deployment but should be easy to add python into the deployment package if it s needed

195109
hosts-file	hosts
i have written a program that modifies the windows hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts in vista the program will not run and will fail with an exception-handling unless you right-click and run as administration even .when the user has administration privileges unlike in xp where it will run if the user has administration rights .so i need a way to elevate it to the correct privileges programaticly

195128
mouseenter	mousehover
btw instead of setting enabled in mousehover you should do it in mouseenter

195128
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave is a pair which indicate whether is the mouse is within the button or not and it s fired once per entry exit

195131
grouping	sorting	aggregate	grouping
for many queries it is much faster than mysql especially for grouping and sorting and can query remote systemd in parallels and aggregate the results - which make it very useful in use with sharding

195140
difference	zero
while near to zero the difference prevent reliable equality testing and difference can accumulate

195175
required	checked
i am new to this community but i am working on a site that required implementation of a user passwd register checked upon entry which would checked against a database or write to the database in the case of registration

195190
any	set
since i hadn t find any open-source libs maybe open-source program that can read and set itunes-style metadata tags in mpeg-4 files will help you

195195
motif	gtk
wxwindows a framework which supports windows 3.1 95 98 nt and unix with gtk motif lesstif and macos

195211
explode	implode
you can usually get by using implode explode or replace

195233
defined	declare
the only data you can declare and defined is integral static constants

195243
required	checked
i don t think you need to worry about trying to eliminate checked whether intialization is required or not every time the instances is accessed

195249
default-value	default
i have taken the liberty of setting the default-value of bubbles to true and passing the custom event types to the super constructor by default .so you can then just say.

195250
keyboard	hid
that should work not just for keyboard but for all hid devices â mice game pads etc

195256
httplistener	http.sys
while you can write your own httpserver using normals tcp-ip it s relatively simple it is easier to use httplistener which takes advantage of the http.sys functionality added in windows-xp sp2

195261
opensolaris	solaris
portable to windows bsd-based systemd linux-based systemd hp-ux solaris sparc gnustep solaris 10 u2 vmware appliance opensolaris others

195275
internet-explorer	firefox
the web service and the webpage that loads my flex application resides on the same webserver tomcat .so .when i load the webpage of the application with http i been asked to confirm the certificate i confirm it but this confirmation does not apply on the flex application on internet-explorer and firefox

195305
bugzilla	trac
how does it compare to trac bugzilla

195331
response	timeout
for that reason you should always implements a timeout in your receive routines even if there is a party listening at the other end there is no guarantee it has received your messages or that its response will reach you intact

195338
redmine	trac
the advantage of own project-management software like trac or redmine is that you have the power of everything

195353
sql-server	mysql
the other databases we considered were ms sql-server and mysql

195367
response	timeout
i agree with mdb that timeout are necessary but would also add that you might want to implements simple challenge response systemd that periodically checked if anyone is listening

195382
textarea	pre
this causes incorrect display of whitespace in elements that ought to preserve formatting such as pre and textarea

195383
rollback	commit
in any case the exact answer to your question is that any sqlexception should mean a rollback happened .when the end of transactional cmd is sent that is .when a commit or rollback or end is issued

195392
installation	building
if the building and installation is managed by module building you can simply run . building testcover to get a nice html site that tells you the coverage per sub line and conditional with nice colors making it easy to see which code path has not been covered

195398
postgresql	mysql
the most mentioned difference between mysql and postgresql is about your reading writing ratios

195398
postgresql	mysql
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

195398
postgresql	mysql
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398
postgresql	mysql
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195410
triggers	insert
a triggers on the original table creates one log row for each insert and deletion and two rows for a modification

195415
postgresql	mysql
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

195417
calloc	malloc
a nice malloc calloc and reallloc replacement is rmdebug it s pretty simple to use

195425
click	mouse
code that s associated with and triggers by the occurrence of a specific event like an incoming messages a throw exception-handling a signals sent to a process a network i o request completing or a mouse click on a user-interface elements

195426
cursor	row
as many have show it is not a big deal to handle one row cases but .when dealing with large dataset one needs a cursor with all the performance problems that come along

195427
rollback	commit
it isn t actually doing a vote commit - the transactional and any early operations has rollback but any subsequent operations still inside the transactionalscope can get performed in the nul-transactional auto-commit

195435
contains	elements
you could measure the width of the contains elements using javascript and truncated the text based on that

195435
contains	elements
another slightly hacky option is to measure the width of an elements contains the letter w then do a character count and truncated if

195439
webforms	asp.net
using webforms i know that you can only have one asp.net form on a page

195451
boolean	int	click	mouse
i use public boolean mousedown event ev int x int y to detection a click of the mouse

195477
subtract	add
.when you equip or unequip an item add or subtract from the effective stats where appropriate

195479
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the default view engine asp.net webforms has the same restrictions of one server-side form but with or without asp.net-mvc you could always use client-only forms

195482
configuration	environment
in that test environment you should replicate various configurationuration you expect to support in your environment setup your own webhosts router machine configuration

195485
emacs	vim
using either vim or emacs you come to understand that the interface exposes the code s representation of the state of the file you are editing in the buffering the file is the on-disk storage you can fill a buffering from or write a buffering to

195485
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are our two oldest editor in common use today and they shared this behavior

195535
internationalization	localization
you ve been pointed to gettext which allows you to replace literals strings with localized versioning at runtime - one aspects of localization which is what happens after you ve done the internationalization .when someone actually uses your internationalized code in a specific locale

195544
sql-server	oracle
sql-server as far as i know doesn t actually support pseudocolumns but there are errors and stored-procedures that refer to pseudo columns probably for oracle migration

195567
emacs	vim
hence emacs s basic unit of work is a buffering and not a file and the same logic holds for vim

195567
emacs	vim
more capable applications like emacs and vim are a lot more flexible in that respect

195590
folder	dir
does anybody know how to determine the location of a file that s in one of the folder specified by the path environmental variables other than doing a dir filename.exe s from the root folder

195600
any	set
if you don t set the owner then the user can click something else or even close the owner while the messagebox is open then .when the messagebox closes and the code after the call to messagebox.show runs your program can be in an unknown state - or if the owner was closed you are now running code inside a windows that no longer exists and any call to methods of winforms or wpf or for that matter also winapi and any other framework are likely to cause a crash

195639
entity	pojo
i need a way to bind pojo object to an external entity that could be xml yaml structured text or anything easy to write and maintain inorder to create mock data for unit-testing and tdd

195639
constructor	object
problem it won t work with constructor .so no good for immutable object

195649
linux	unix
in addition to the which ms windows and where unix linux utilities i have written my own utility which i call findinpath

195661
any	set
the reason that not as many people do it is because it would be easy for someone to set up a complete clone of your website without making any useful changes

195667
show	next
depending on the result-of the event i have to show a particular table on my main page these tables basically have retry next buttons...depending on whether or not the file is upload i have to show respective button

195668
emacs	vim
in other words much of the vim emacs model except tweaked to be more inline with discoveries that browsers are making

195677
blacklist	whitelist
in other words whitelist don t blacklist

195683
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate activerecord subsonic npersist linqtoef linq-to-sql llblgenpro db4o csla etc

195688
double	int	digits	short
i have a string char and i need to find its underlying datatype such as int float double short long or just a character arrays contains alphabets with or with out digits like varchar in sql

195688
decimal-point	digits
digits with a single decimal-point

195693
constructor	object
this is the section of code that describe how the object should be initializer on deserialization - it sets the constructor arguments to three string value

195696
malloc	free
to prevent confusion in the future i d like to points out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc free to manage the buffering being played is simply wrong

195696
contains	any
the buffering being free by wavecompleteheader is not the one contains the pcm data the responsibility to free the pcm buffering lies with the application and there s no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way

195703
blacklist	whitelist
it s never enough â whitelist don t blacklist

195709
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	perl	python	ruby	python	php
what would be the most significant conflicts in creating a scripting-language that permitted all the native syntax and libs functions of python ruby php perl shell and javascript such that you could freely intermix code blocks and function named between languages

195723
administration	account
the link show a walk-through of starting up from the mac os x installation dvd and using its reset-passwd functionality to reset the administration account s passwd

195725
administration	account
if your account is an administration account

195735
any	set
any chance you ve got open_basedir restrictions set

195752
python	ruby
it sounds like getting ruby s behavior to coexist with javascript s or python would required some kind of ugly disambiguation

195764
checkbox	button
the index.php page that show the list of activities with checkbox a button to delete the checked activities and a field to add new activities

195768
selected	button
i know i could just use a pair of selected boxes but that feels cluttered and then i also need a confirmation button

195780
json	xml
just use xstream for xml or you could give a try to json

195794
contains	elements
as it stands you have 22399 entries each of which may contains a varying numbers of strings or triplets of abbrev marker line where last seen elements of that line where last seen

195794
contains	elements
by the way greg s talking i may need to have each line contains the same numbers of elements even if some of them are empty strings

195795
unsigned	short
for example is 0xbac0 an unsigned short expressed in hex

195795
double	int
now you can convert it to the largest possible types long-long for int double for floating pointers and then use the value in limits.h to see if the value would fit in a smaller types

195795
unsigned	short
you might also have to take arbitrary decisions for example 54321 can only be an unsigned short but 12345 could be a signed short or an unsigned short

195814
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited
with inherited you can implements common code at the base-class with some overrides at the subclassing form and implements flexible interplay

195814
subclassing	base-class
but that required all implementers of the subclassing to be aware of the base-class source code which can get chaotic

195824
32-bit	64bit
this is because the 64bit jit compiler applies tail call optimisation whereas the 32-bit jit does not

195833
web-applications	webserver
in the memcached page is to run memcached on the same machines as webserver on the premise that web-applications are cpu-heavy which memcached is not whereas memcached is memory-heavy which most web-applications are not at least in comparison

195835
environment	building
i would like to ask you which automated building environment you consider better based on practical experience

195837
double	int
my comparing dvalue double long dvalue i guess you should know if is an int again not taking into account the usual precision problems coming witb binary real numbers used by computers

195843
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception

195847
markup	xhtml
the extensible hypertext markup or xhtml is a markup that has the same depth of expression as html but also conforms to xml syntax

195910
research	metrics
the metrics that are capture in most static analysis tools are typically metrics that have been identified over the course of research in our field s short history to have significant meaning

195919
directory	folder
it seems like the uninstaller removes only the directory and files that were originally install from the msi file and it leaves everything else that was added later in the application folder

195932
continuous-integration	code-coverage
project leaders they are concerned with daily live code-metrics coming from unit test code-coverage continuous-integration testing

195944
required	checked
this code again doesn t required a checked for nil value and flows naturally.

195949
instances	private
if you already know the numbers of controls you ll be creating at runtime at design-time then you can declare private control object variables with events and instances these at dynamically at runtime

195996
vb.net	vb6	basic	vb6
he s also written what is i believe is considered one of best books on the .net visual basic and is probably the foremost expert on migrating from vb6 to vb.net and the pitfalls therein

195998
virtualbox	vmware
if you can t get pre-packaged binaries for solaris you ll need to get your own solaris machine using virtual-pc vmware virtualbox etc use it to compile the gem then pull the binary files out

196014
swing	swt
which libs better for faster java application swt or swing

196027
hide	show
although this isn t a huge amount of time .when using it to hide show user-interface elements the time can be visibly noticeable

196038
contains	set
very roughly a libs is a set of tools designed for a specific task whilst a framework generally contains multiple libs and performs a complete set of duties.

196048
value	field
i have a systemd which generator a large numbers of xml document every day of the order of 1 million and i would like to be able to store and index these .so that i can for example search for all document with a certain field set to a given value

196061
markup	xhtml
you can however already mix svg and xhtml markup

196073
contains	any
any file created in the project which does not contains an explicit namespace will be intsead include in the default namespace

196088
pointers	stack
but if i have a variables on stack the only way to coerce it to any kind of pointers would be to invoke

196091
setinterval	settimeout
dan from my experience that include implementation of smil2.1 language in javascript where time management is in subject i can assure you that you actually never need high precision of settimeout or setinterval

196091
setinterval	settimeout
what does however matter is the order in which settimeout setinterval gets execute .when queue - and that always works perfectly

196116
pointers	stack
your final code has a methods which creates its instances on stack and then call the same methods but on a member which is a pointers to your base-class

196136
malloc	free
.so i suppose my real question is other than malloc free which handles getting and freeing pages for itself etc does a program need the os to provide anything else

196146
malloc	free
then it s up to malloc to dole out memory in a way that doesn t fragment the free memory too much

196154
malloc	free
most often c programs have their own malloc free functionality

196179
bison	yacc
please limit your solution to yacc bison parsing

196191
malloc	free
the job of malloc and free is to manage those pages of memory which are fixed in size typically 4 kb but sometimes bigger and to splice and dice them into pieces that applications can use

196227
xsd	xml
you can also create xml columns that conform to a schema using xsd

196234
animation	rotation
.when applied to movement scaling rotation an other animation these equation can give a sense of momentum or friction or bouncing or elasticity

196241
zend-debugger	xdebug
.so xdebug is known not to work with many zend tools i know zend-optimizer for certain i don t know about zend-debugger but i wouldn t be surprised if xdebug has a built-in checked for that

196244
versioning	upgrade
for users it means they can have but one versioning install and upgrade etc required parallels running

196252
swing	swt
several years ago swing was slow .so swt was developed to make native api call on systemd

196252
swing	swt
swt is non-standard while swing is officially part of the java specifications

196252
javafx	swing
javafx will also be built on top of swing

196288
scripting	shebang
these are the .sort of questions you can ask yourself about your scripting .so that instead of splitting it up you might get the whole shebang to run in time

196349
hide	show
.when the user presses the button hide the button and show the progress-bar

196349
hide	show
then hide the progress-bar and show the button again

196357
shell	bash
in bash shell with emacs key-binding you can use key combinations like m-f m-b to move one words forwarding or backward on the shell prompt respectively

196357
shell	bash
the key-binding i m talking about is for bash shell not in emacs

196357
shell	bash
it just happens that by default bash shell also use the same key-binding as emacs

196361
malloc	free
rather you d run into the difficulty that any good memalign implementation will be an integral part of the heap-manager codebase not simply layer on top of malloc free

196364
arrays	loops
i d use and then loops through the returned arrays finding the correct named value pair for the v part of the query-string

196368
rollback	commit
do you need transactional semantics commit rollback for the data

196369
command-line	cmd
skapsal s comment on a command-line tool for execution sql cmd is a reference to osql for sql2000 or sqlcmd for sql2005+

196412
managed-code	native-code
you can reference native c libs but i doubt very much that you can run native-code from within managed-code

196452
constructor	object
instead business-logic-layer object take a datacontext reference in their constructor which explicit allows sharing the datacontext and implicit allows sharing of the entity object from query results as they are all from the same data context

196468
code-coverage	cobertura
i am using the maven 2 cobertura plugins to create report on code-coverage and i have the following stubs i am using in a methods

196468
maven-plugin	cobertura
any idea how i can convince cobertura s maven-plugin that since the system.err.println statement is covered that ending braces has to have been covered

196472
factors	primes
the answer does not required any fancy footwork at all in terms of factors or primes powers and most certainly does not required the sieve-of-eratosthenes

196487
any	set
any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead

196503
annotations	mapping
in the java classfile format every methods is annotations with a table mapping code offset to line numbers

196522
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve programmed c and c++ for a long time and .so far i ve never used exception-handling and try-catch

196529
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling is useful because it makes it easy to separate the error-handling code from the code written to handle the function of the program

196530
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch -- with alert for exception-handling -- can be your friend too

196548
hash	md5
basically the idea is to take everything that you can find out about the computer person and then generator a md5 hash of this information

196551
implements	extends
the only thing i can think of you could do is write a proxy class where one of your private field is the class you d want to extends and you implements all it s methods and proxy their call

196571
margins	padding
you ll have to play around with the padding and margins to make it look good but those two attributes will get you on your way

196576
display	width
yeah using display block it would be impossible to make them sit beside each other unless if you d try to specify a width for each of them

196583
click	mouse
if you put rendering to a bitmap inside of sprite then you can capture mouse click

196616
mstest	nunit
run the test with a testrunner nunit mstest etc

196628
linked-list	queue
i don t really understand how i can make a single methods work for all of the various types of collections linked-list queue stack

196647
implements	extends
layne you describe the problem as happening .when your controllers class implements an interface but in the code sample you provided the problem occurs .when your controllers class extends another class of yours validatingcontrollers

196660
firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql
you building the model and the application once and it works on gae but also witl sqlite mysql posgres oracle mssql firebird

196664
value	field
i have a form that has multiple field and for testing purposes is there a way i could printing out the value entered in all the field without having to individually printing each value

196705
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196705
pylons	django
nothing is wrong with django or pylons

196705
web2py	django	pylons	web2py	pylons	django
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and

196705
pylons	django
webp2y logs all traceback server side for the administration django and pylons do not

196705
ruby-on-rails	django	web2py	django	pylons	web2py	pylons	django
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and ruby-on-rails

196707
png	gif	bmp	gif	bmp	png	tga	png	tga	bmp
just by calling snapurl and saveimage you can take a snapshot of a webpage into various images such as bmp jpg jpeg gif png tif tga and pcx

more than 30 samples written in vc c- delphi vb c++ builder java jscript perl vbscript asp asp.net and php are provided

196726
python	php
the platform uses php python with isam w mysql

196737
protected	public
i ve been working with the joomla framework and i have noticed that they use a conventions to designate private or protected methodss they put an underscore.js _ in front of the methods named but they do not explicit declare any methodss public private or protected

196737
protected	public
are the public private or protected keyword not available in older versioning of php

196739
protected	public
public private and protected are php5 keyword

196745
mediawiki	trac
google-code has one or you can install your own such as mediawiki or trac

196755
contains	sorted
given a string of keyword such as python best practices i would like to obtain the first 10 stack overflow questions that contains that keyword sorted by relevance

196771
python	php
i have a php application which needs to output a python scripting more specifically a bunch of variable-assignment statements eg

196771
python	php
this was for integration between a web-app written in php and mailman written in python

196776
python	ruby
i need to be able to send encrypted data between a ruby client and a python server and vice versa and have been having trouble with the ruby-aes gem libs

196798
web2py	django
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django

196798
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session-cookies request response caching internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgresql oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser

196810
margins	padding
using this information you can rendering the table using your own border padding and margins value

196817
export	report
just wondering if anybody had working code example in c# for export a crystal report to excel from a .net application without the report s page headers and footer s

196820
positioning	sidebar
sidebar panels depending on cursor positioning in text

196836
environment	execution
if you want a way to control stack size and your goal is a really controlled and efficient environment but do not care about programming in the same styles as linux etc. go for a single-shot execution model where a task is started each time a relevant event is detected runs to completion and then stores any persistent data in its task data structure

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
it sounds like what you really want is mouseenter mouseleave ie proprietary events but easy to emulate

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
alternatively patch prototypejs and use mouseenter and mouseleave with confidence

196859
textbox	button
i need to change color of textbox whenever its required field validation is fired on click the submit button

196865
debugging	trace
trace printing for general debugging information and the breakpoints for pieces of the code where i need to more thoroughly investigate the inner state of the drivers

196885
32-bit	64bit
how can i determine if i m running on a 32-bit or a 64bit versioning of matlab

196894
attributes	properties
and attributes properties

196896
python	ruby
if i were you i d checked that in your python and ruby programs

196904
linux	unix
i think linux unix doesn t use the same locking mechanics because they are built from the ground up as a multi-user systemd - which would expect the possibility of multiple users using the same file maybe even for different purposes

196930
windows-vista	windows-xp
how in the simplest possible way distinguish between windows-xp and windows-vista using python and pywin32 or wxpython

196933
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome

196940
required	checked
you could break the phrase up into words and checked a dictionary there are some that you can downloading this may be of interest but that would required that the dictionary you used was good enough

196947
type-safety	generics
the points of generics well one of the pointss is to use compile-time type-safety

197035
stderr	stdout
al.so try to redirect the output but stdout and stderr to a file .so that you can see the error messages that are generator

197053
arguments	default
if you want to know if its callable with a particular set of arguments you need the arguments without a default already specified

197059
dictionary	arrays
what is the most efficient way of turning the list of value of a dictionary into an arrays

197102
ms-access	oracle
kexi competes with ms-access foxpro oracle forms and filemaker

197113
attributes	properties
non-functional attributes product properties other than work it performs

197120
oracle-xe	oracle
usr .lib oracle-xe .app oracle admin xe bdump

197123
any	set
is there any way to automatically rename accessor mutators .when a variables they get set gets refactored - rename eclipse 3.4

197126
postfix-operator	prefix-operator
the difference is is that the increment only gets applied .when using the postfix-operator after the function returns - but if you use the prefix-operator it is applied before the function returns

197157
derived-class	base-class
firstly this is indeed how it works in c++ the return-type of a virtual function in a derived-class must be the same as in the base-class

197157
derived-class	base-class
in general it doesn t make sense anyway the reason get_r is a virtual function in the first place is because you will be calling it through a pointers or reference to the base-class ainterface in which case you can t know what types the derived-class would return

197160
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	safari	opera
like internet-explorer opera safari on windows

197202
web-inspector	webkit
the next safari versioning will probably also include one since its rendering engine webkit now has one as part of its web-inspector

197209
contains	elements
however perhaps the safest way would be to create a new map contains the elements you want to keep else you could be relying on how the internal implementation of positioning works

197210
keyboard	mouse
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

197229
configuration	installation
the basic configuration is complaining that the â œdefault web siteâ we selected for the bam portal installation is not validation due to â œiis is not 32-bit enabled.â despite setting the apppool classic mode 32-bit properties to true biztalk configuration wizard is still complaining

197247
dictionary	map
purpose of the class a dictionary where a key can map to multiple value

197267
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
if you want to avoid apache it is possible to deploy a mongrel cluster with an alternative webserver such as nginx or lighttpd and a load balancer of some variety such as pound or a hardware-based solution

197276
stderr	stdout
the redirects stderr to stdout .so any error messages will be capture in

197282
calloc	malloc
the malloc calloc valloc

197291
value	field
given a table mytable contains a numeric field mynum how would one go about writing an sql query which summarizes the table s data based on ranges of value in that field rather than each distinct value

197294
callback	methods
however .when i run the same piece of code within a callback methods via jms courier i get the above error

197300
value	field
the idea is to compute some function of the field that has constants value within each grouping you want

197310
python	java
c# java and python are all likely to get used though

197317
contains	set
the usual solution .when you absolutely cannot rejig it to get rid of the rowspan is to add a 1px dummy column to one side of the table contains empty cell each with the height set to how high the row should be

197322
value	field	communication	messages
with messages-passing rather than methods calling as your object communication mechanism then operations such as calling a methods that didn t exist .when you wrote the code becomes sensible as the object can do something sensible with the messages anyway checked for a remote procedure return a value for a field with the same named from a database etc or throw a methods not found exception-handling or anything else you could think of

197325
sql-server	mysql
i do not know if this is applicable to mysql anyway in sql-server i think you can simply use grouping by in both the selected list and the grouping by list

197346
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
as eric said a lot of big website don t validation however if you start with a validation website that works perfectly in for example firefox safari google-chrome or opera chances are it will be right or mostly right in the other 3 and will only required minor adjustments for them to be right

197346
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko	safari	opera	opera	gecko
ie6 and 7 have html hacks that don t required any extra work to load specific stylesheets for them but there isn t anything available for the gecko webkit or presto browsers firefox safari google-chrome or opera .so an alternate methods is needed for anything specific to these browsers

197357
authentication	login
up until now i had created a membership database and was manually authentication users based on their nt login

197382
g++	gcc
if you want to be able to compile this code in gcc or g++ you will need to create an iterator and use a standards for-loop

197403
children	nodes
i suspect that you could design a stored procedure that would drill down in the table until the ids returned by the inner query did not have children -- probably better to have an attributes that marks a category as a terminal nodes in the hierarchy -- then perform the outer query on those ids

197413
quirks-mode	doctype
the choice of doctype 4.01 transitional with no systemd identifier url triggers quirks-mode in ie which makes it highly inconsistent with other browsers

197437
hash	md5	salt	md5
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might building up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8

197477
environment	building
you can use the visual-studio environment to building almost standards c++ applications

197496
order	add
for example it is much easier to add some order dynamically or leave some parts restrictions out depending on some parameter

197509
instances	destroy
is the foodao created once for each foo instances or would the foodao instances be created only .when access to data is needed and destroy immediately afterwards

197509
dto	dao
the j2ee page on dao introduces a dto in addition to the dao

197513
credentials	account
in windows 2000 there are no built-in principles with the required privilegess and you ll need to use a regular user account for this purpose it does need to have the run as a service privileges enabled of course but that s handled automagically .when entering the account credentials through the service control manager user-interface

197520
python	ruby
test both sides independantly encode some information and checked that ruby and python endoded it identically

197524
callback	methods
however .when i run the same line of code in the callback methods i see the same line followed by

197567
subclassing	superclass
you could subclassing or superclass one of these controls to implements infinite functionality

197567
keyboard	mouse
create a single child windows draw it yourself handle all the mouse and keyboard input yourself and implements the scrollbar messages yourself

197597
database-table	mysql
the article managing hierarchical-data in mysql is not that mysql specific despite the title and gives a great overview of the different methods of storing a hierarchy in a database-table

197622
gethashcode	equals	gethashcode	tostring	tostring	equals
is there a visual-studio plugins tool snippet for .net that is similar to commonclipse for the java eclipse platform that automatically generator the tostring equals gethashcode methods for you

197648
design-patterns	anti-patterns
like new .net 3.5 features design-patterns anti-patterns code smells etc

197649
svg	vml
while working on svg implementation for internet-explorer to be based on its own vml format i came to a problem of translation of an svg elliptical arc to an vml elliptical arc

197649
ellipse	angle
in vml an arc is given by two angle for two points on ellipse and lengths of radius

197649
ellipse	angle
.so the question is how to express angle of two points on ellipse to two pairs of their coordinates

197671
ellipse	angle
work out if a points lies on the ellipse and matches the angle and iterate through every points in the bounding-box

197676
variables	boolean
or else why set a boolean variables to be 255

197686
any	set
though this will set all bytes in a char it will also work for any other variables types since any one bit being set in a variables makes it true

197706
malloc	free
in microsoft s runtime the new-operator uses malloc and the delete-operator uses free

197736
unmanaged	c++-cli
the best bet would be to create the wrapper using c++-cli which can directly call the unmanaged function and expose the details with a managed class

197753
value	field
therefore does anyone know how i can change the value of the associated field table2.foriegnid

197760
perl	php
i m not overly concerned with the core-language of the package unless i d need to hack on the code for the systemd itself in which case i m reasonably comfortable with php perl and .net though i could probably pickup an other language s as needed

197765
syncfusion	telerik
there are dinosaur vendors like telerik syncfusion devexpress infragistics which offer gui with good quality and support but they are not very cheap because the branding costs money

197779
highlight	cell
in his example .when you mouse over any cell in a row the entire row is highlight

197793
logout	login
the function requestbeheerderslist does nothing is not reached i put a alert as first statement in the function but that is not display .when i login after a fresh load of the swf but .when i logout and login again then the function is reached and the alert is display and the list is filled with the data from the server

197799
cursor	row
the row itself wouldn t be clickable unless you added additional html to the row but most of the content spaces of the row would act like a normals link cursor status bar etc

197806
templating	markup
there are a numbers of templating languages implements for ruby-on-rails that give relatively simple syntax for markup

197811
debian	rpm
like debian or rpm package you can say you depend on other eggs and they ll be install automatically through pypi.python.org

197845
hide	show
i m trying to show hide a movieclip or graphic symbols that is on a layer of a button symbols using actionscript 2

197853
eclipse-plugin	subclipse
before i make the switching does anyone have any experience with using the tortoisesvn eclipse-plugin or are there any other eclipse svn plugins other than subclipse that are recommended

197892
attributes	properties
markup your object that are being used by the service with datacontract attributes and then put data-members on the public properties

197893
implements	abstract
a curious thing happens in java .when you use an abstract-class to implements an interface some of the interface s methods can be completely missing neither an abstract declaration or an actual implementsation is present but the compiler does not complain

197900
processor	cpu
it may be possible to let c++ keep tracking of all the allocated arrays and their sizes if you are writing a words processor for a windows box running on the latest intel cpu but it may be completely infeasible .when you are writing an embedded systemd running on a dsp

197902
abstract-class	subclassing
the subclassing will be required by the compiler to implements any interface methods that the abstract-class left out

197930
enumerator	any
any can save time by doing a short enumerator

197940
put	get
i can t seem to find an easy to use .net-native way to get comboboxes on .net winforms to display one value and return another based on the selection without creating my own helpers class with the knowledge that winforms is going to display the tostring methods on the object that you put in it

197958
click	mouse
in flash there seem to be two sets of mouse click events

197958
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmouseup onmousedown

197964
contains	any
do the rows you are bringing back contains any large image blob data

197971
implements	abstract
.so even though it implements an interface the abstract-methods of the interface can remain abstract

197971
implements	abstract
if you try to implements an interface in a concrete class not abstract and you do not implements the abstract-methods the compiler will tell you either implements the abstract-methods or declare the class as abstract

198009
32-bit	64bit
the image_file_header.machine field will have image_file_machine_ia64 set for ia64 binaries image_file_machine_i386 for 32-bit and image_file_machine_amd64 for 64bit ie x86_64

198032
json	xml
the model never changes because it is independent of sql yaml json xml or some other serialization technique

198047
nested	order
can anyone suggest a tutorial or sample code that implements a nested set or similar order tree with associated javascript that facilitates drag and drop

198058
background-color	width	background-color	height
i d like to show a div that has a background-color with the height and width set to 100 but no content

198066
wcftestclient	was
believe it or not the problem of at least loading the service through wcftestclient was solved .when i re-registered the asp.net in iis with asp.net-regiis

198077
delphi	c++
i program professionaly in delphi for the last 10 years and have a good knowledge of c++

198083
firefox	safari
this seems to work in firefox safari ie6 ie7

198090
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmousedown and onmouseup are general events that anything can listen to via mouse.addlistener

198090
click	mouse
they get triggers no matter where the mouse is click

198090
click	mouse
also important is onreleaseoutside...for the case where you click down on a movieclip then drag the mouse outside then release the mouse

198096
mousedown	mouseup
it looks like the mouseup mousedown events will triggers even .when the mouse is outside the movieclip while onpress release will automatically checked to see if the mouse is within the clip before being handled

198105
arrays	loops
the reason you have to loops like in the example you mention is that the numbers of arrays that needs to be deleted is not known to the compiler allocation

198113
worksheet	excel
you can setup another worksheet in your excel file and use spreadsheet styles functions to do the necessary transforms referencing the data from the raw-data sheet

198115
rollback	commit
since you ve not done any dml i suspect there d be no difference between a commit and rollback in oracle

198125
json	xml
what jquery and other frameworks ends up doing is using a special asynchronous request called xmlhttprequest and then parsing the server response can be anything pure html json xml etc and process it

198131
queue	fifo
queue and stack are slightly specialised in that they are optimised for fifo and filo behavior fifo and fifo respectively

198132
type-safety	generics
you will get full type-safety compared to arraylist and hashtable and they are much faster for value-type int struct floats etc. compared to non generics onces

198136
sortedlist	hashtable
sortedlist like a hashtable but the entries are always returned in sorted-by-key order

198136
queue	fifo
queue fifo collections

198136
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sorteddictionary tkey tvalue like sortedlist but stored as a tree of key-value pairs which gives better performance in many situations

198136
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
linked-list t doubly-linked-list fast access to head and tail

198137
ellipse	angle
now we have a systemd of equation with 4 variables centering of ellipse x0 y0 and two angle t1 t2

198137
cos	sin
y2 - y1 2 b cos t1 + t2 2 sin t1 - t2 2

198137
cos	sin
r2 cos a1 sin a2

198141
temporary	copy
i was going to create a temporary table copy the data in recreate the indexes and the delete the rows i need

198143
selected	cell
if you use the offset function you can specify a starting cell and the numbers of rows and columns to selected

198148
rollback	commit
in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same

198160
show	next
this paragraph is here to make sure the next two line show up as code

198221
rollback	commit
i agree with the previous answers that there s no difference between commit and rollback in this case

198221
rollback	commit
there might be a negligible difference in the cpu time needed to determine that there s nothing to commit versus the cpu time needed to determine that there s nothing to rollback

198224
include	ssi
i am building a menu and have it set up .so that i use a stadard ssi tag to include my xml document

198227
istream	std
std istream is a class not an operators

198229
rollback	commit
on the other hand the commit is more-or-less the expected outcome and i suspect that discarding the rollback area might be slightly faster

198241
web-services	webserver
as a side note .sometimes controllers and model are actually exposed in .some other abstracted way like web-services .so that you can have a bunch of uis or webserver to balance .some of your incoming traffic and you can still leverage the same back end

198252
databound	gridview
i have a form that contains a gridview control which is databound to an objectdatasource control

198252
selected	listbox
.when i use the selectedvalue parameter of the listbox the objectdatasource is only seeing the first selected item in the list

198252
selected	listbox
here s the question how can i get all the multi-select listbox value passed into my custom object mydataclass instead of just the first one selected

198280
credentials	account
in addition it s probably trying to connect using your windows account credentials

198290
mousemove	mousedown
you would need to deal with this by implements your own form move resize logic in the form s mousedown and mousemove event handler

198304
stax	sax
try to use stax instead of sax

198305
display	width
without min-width your div will take whole page width that is how display block elements behave

198306
content-management-system	opencms
it s used by the opencms content-management-system as it s in-place jsp and javascript editor

198306
python	php	pascal	basic
customizable real-time syntax-highlighting currently php css javascript python html xml vb c cpp sql pascal basic brainf ck

198319
double-quotes	single-quotes
i changed the double-quotes to single-quotes and vise versa

198320
constructor	private
would it be wise of me to new up the linq-to-sql class in each of the methods or would a private variables holding the linq-to-sql class - new ed up by the constructor - be the way to go

198348
double	int
web2py has javascript to blocks the user from entering a non-int in a int field or a non-double in a double field

198360
silverlight	wpf
other than compiling the code as silverlight and wpf

198382
linked-list	arrays
in one case i changed an arrays insertion-sort to simply use a linked-list and it changed runtime from 10+hours locked the machine to seconds minutes

198411
unique	words
if for some reason this isn t an option though i think i would get a list of all unique words in your data and use that as a lookup table

198414
highlight	selected
it needs the capability of selected a single elements or grouping of elementss and highlight the data in some way

introspection or reflection on the other hand refer to the ability to find out what interfaces methods or attributes an object implements at runtime

198441
actionscript	mxml
the flex mxml is mainly another syntax which eventually gets compiled to something you could have also written in actionscript

198459
contains	any
you can change the named of the input with types file but make sure it doesn t contains any spaces

deterministic	theory	turing-machines	state-machines	turing-machines	automata	state-machines	automata
.when i go back to school after thanksgiving i ll be taking a course in cs theory covering topics such as deterministic and nondeterministic finite state-machines turing-machines pushdown automata and a few other things

198487
http	ssl
for real sensitive info make sure to use ssl http

198489
http	ssl
get is visible to anyone even the one on your shoulder now and is saved on caching .so is less secure of using .post btw .post without .some cryptographics routine is not sure for a bit of security you ve to use ssl http

198500
contains	elements
the clone methods returns a new arrays a shallow-copy object contains all the elements in the original arrays

198500
contains	elements
a shallow-copy means the contents each arrays elements contains references to the same object as the elementss in the original arrays

198500
deep-copy	object
a deep-copy which neither of these methods performs would create a new instances of each elements s object resulting in a different yet identical object

198540
textarea	textbox
for the textarea you would have do it on the actual textbox that you are adding the extender onto

198543
textbox	button
i have a third-party editor that basically comprises a textbox and a button the devexpress buttonedit control

198544
delphi	c++
and it s worth mentioning that the c++builder package include the delphi compiler and you can write add delphi .pas files and include them as part of your c++ project

198571
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
8bit 16-bit 32-bit

198571
boolean	int
as others have pointed out any int value other than zero is considered true for the purposes of boolean expression in c.

198592
perl	tcl	python	perl	python	tcl
the .net regular expressionengine is a backtracking regular expression matcher that incorporates a traditional nondeterministic finite automaton nfa engine such as that used by perl python emacs and tcl

198592
dfa	nfa
matching behavior first paragraph â â this article also offers a rationale for the employment of an nfa rather than the more efficient dfa

198605
specifications	w3c
if you haven t checkout the w3c specifications and see how much you really know

198606
cassini	iis
this works fine in cassini the built-in ad hoc webserver for visual-studio but gives me internet-explorer cannot display the webpage .when i try it on a live server running iis

198607
slimdx	xna
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

198609
constructor	private
initializer in the constructor and holding a datacontext in a private variables would make that impossible

198624
dfa	nfa
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

198647
constructor	object
if you re talking about the datacontext object and your code is a class with a long lifetime or your program itself i believe it would be best to initializer it in the constructor

198651
versioning	upgrade
the client viewmodel compiler serves as an upgrade for both the classic viewmodel and the just-in-time jit compilers used by previous versioning of the jdk

198652
triggers	insert
if i understand you correctly you could use a triggers and on the insert or updates checked to see if the combinations of the value is unique prior to making the change

198669
groovy	java
if speed was really an issue i would rather use a java libs to parsing whatever i want than to rely on groovy s implementation

198676
ms-project	visio
if by binaries you mean non-text files i can tell you that i use svn all the time to store non-text files jpg images visio files bmp files ms-word 2003 document with images and diagram ms-project files and similar files

198679
audio	ogg
given an inputstream called in which contains audio data in a compressed format such as mp3 or ogg i wish to create a byte arrays contains a wav conversion of the input data

198691
textbox	button
lately .when opening up a form in designer the common user-interface controls textbox button labels etc etc... have vanished leaving only the controls defined within the project

198712
dojo	gwt
but if you are creating an user-interface more like a web application where the user stays at a single page for a long time think gmail google-calendar etc then it probably is better to look at dojo extjs or gwt

198720
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
is there a coldfusion analog for the deployment-descriptor web.xml file found in a j2ee web containers

198730
project-management	scrum	project-management	project
given the evolving nature of most software project that deserve something like a gantt charts i would recommend you take a look at the project-management methodologies that go under the banner of agile scrum and extreme

198746
acrobat-sdk	acrobat
the windows-shell doesn t depend on the acrobat-sdk to generator the thumbnail but it might depend on your having the free acrobat reader install on your machine

198762
constructor	object
you could inject these object .when needed as members instead of in the constructor

198780
revision	svn
my team only ever needs to browse our svn repositories via a web browser and compare revision and for that we use websvn

198806
.net	wcf
i assume you are trying to call a wcf .net 3.5 service from a wse2 .net 1.1 client

198810
contains	any
any string contains a zero will fail

198810
contains	any
any string contains no zero will pass

198829
tuples	set
the built-in containers types can dictionary set list tuples etc.

198829
data-structures	dictionary
since a dictionary can contains arbitrary nested data-structures it might not be pickle-able

198831
associations	model
here are my migration scripting and the associations in my model

198853
.net	wcf
wcf .net 3.5 is said to be compatible with wse3 .net 2.0+ but not with wse2 .net 1.1+

198854
vb.net	vb6
i used to use it religiously back in the vb6 days but stopped .when vb.net came out because that s what the new vb guidelines said

198918
version-control	git
some version-control systemd notably git and probably bitkeeper work on this level by design instead of on a file level

198974
internet-explorer	firefox
this validation works perfectly in firefox but it does not in internet-explorer

198995
udp	tcp
in the example on cpan use sock_raw rather than sock_dgram udp or sock_stream tcp

199001
payment-processing	google-checkout
i would strongly recommend you use paypal google-checkout or worldpay or whatever payment-processing systemd is provided recommended by your bank

199002
selected	checkbox
then in the find-replace dialog selected the use regular expression checkbox

199010
backslash	regex
for example one might expect that my find regex above is broken because the backslash before the double-quote is not properly escaped but in reality putting a double-backslash there will break the expression not fix it

199016
32-bit	64bit	nvidia	ati
i ve tried it on vista 64bit with ati graphic card and on windows-xp 32-bit with nvidia with the same result in both cases

199030
integration	payment
disclaimer this information is based on my limited experience integration payment providers in the uk

199038
hotmail	gmail
apparently email providers such as hotmail gmail yahoo drop all incoming email from widely used server providers such as amazon-ec2

199045
perl	php
i m looking for a libs that has functionality similar to perl s www-mechanize but for php

199045
perl	php
the reason i m asking for a php solution is that i have no experience with perl and i could probably building what i need with a lot of work but it would be much quicker if i could do the above in php

199052
libcurl	openssl
libcurl uses openssl for ssl support

199052
libcurl	openssl
rebuilding the libcurl libs i now got some errors about openssl include files not being found

199052
typedef	struct
it complained about a struct typedef in one of the openssl headers

199052
libcurl	openssl
after an hour of googling i broke my own principles and commented out the typedef from the openssl header and luckily libcurl wasn t using that symbols .so it built fine

199065
value	field
basically i have two field i want to store a unique-key and its value

199070
multi-query	mysql
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query

199085
contains	any
if you wanted the passwd to not contains any non-alphanumeric characters you could do either or

199123
attributes	properties
once you narrow elements and attributess to innocent ones the pitfalls are in attributes content â javascript pseudo-urls ie allows tab characters in protocols named - still works and css properties that triggers javascript

199127
javascript	dom
.when i access this windows my javascript functions can access the field via the dom with the getelementbyid methods and .when i postpack to the server i am receiving the updates made by the client

199131
versioning	migrate
i have seen very impressive results and would highly recommend it if you can migrate to versioning 9.1 or even better 9.5

199141
bonita	jbpm
another workflow engines worth taking a look are jbpm bonita and shark

199155
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
unfortunately openoffice.org s spreadsheet compare seems a little flaky

199159
constructor	private
then your constructor can just initializer a private member madtastic.datacontext and set your private member madtastic.entities.comment to the result-of the linq query on it

199159
any	set
but it doesn t make sense to submit changes yet because you haven t set any value for this new object anyway

199159
submitchanges	datacontext
in your submitchanges all you should have to do is call submitchanges on the datacontext

199186
javascript	dom
nasty hack around this might be to execute javascript from the applet to call a dom methods to do a mock resize of the windows or perhaps call focus on the body in an attempt to cause an external redraw of the canvas

199208
windows-xp	windows
this will result in test1.txt being install to c users username appdata roaming my on windows 7 and to c document and settings username application data my on windows-xp

199217
rollback	commit
oracle recommends that you explicit end every transactional in your application programs with a commit or rollback statement including the last transactional before disconnect from oracle

199217
rollback	commit
if you do not explicit commit the transactional and the program terminate abnormally then the last uncommitted transactional is automatically rollback

199217
rollback	commit
a normals exit from an oracle precompiler program does not commit the transactional and relies on oracle to rollback the current transactional

199222
swing	awt
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together

199222
swing	awt
moving to swing you need to replace every last awt component swing equivalent hint avoid import java.awt

199223
any	set
we ve been using mule and cxf a bit and .so we ve had to downloading from both legacy maven1 and standards maven2 repositories - these are straightforward to set up and required little if any administration

199233
python	lua
use a language where an embedable interpreter exists for the target languages lua python

199246
aes	des	3des	aes	3des	des
.when i add a new ipsec filtering rules the only options for esp i get are des and 3des .so the faq is correct - there is no support for aes prior to windows-vista

199252
promotions	product
userid manage users manage product manage promotions manage order

199262
swing	awt
this happens all the time if you are not programming carefully in awt swing

199262
put	get
third and this is an extension of first if you get a callback that is not already on the awt worker thread be sure to put it on the awt thread before doing anything with the gui

199289
protected	public
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validation the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods

199290
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199291
checkstyle	ant
basically i inject the proper platform-specific directory value into the main checkstyle configuration file by configuring a checkstyle properties-file with an ant building scripting

199291
checkstyle	ant
the checkstyle properties-file is not static it is generator by an ant building scripting from a properties-file templates called templates-checkstyle.properties

199291
checkstyle	ant
then i call the checkstyle ant task like this

199292
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
yes it s good practice to validation all arguments at the beginning of a methods and throw appropriate exception-handling like argumentexception argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception

199307
attributes	properties
the component i was implements a custom collections inherited from collectionsbase i changed this to a list and added the designerserializationvisibility designerserializationvisibility.content attributes to the list properties this list is also readonly

199313
reverse-dns	dns
the problem with this trick is that if the isp doesn t have reverse-dns info for that ip you won t know whether it s the isp or just some knucklehead who didn t configure his dns properly i ve made that mistake many time in the past

199326
project-management	project
fast find of files and symbols functions classes in project not to mention project-management features

199327
exception-handling	try-catch
i would probably checkout the xmldocument class within the system.xml namespace and try-catch exception-handling for the load or loadxml methods

199327
row	col
the exception-handling s messages properties should contains info on where the error occurred row col numbers and i suspect it d be easier to use a regular expression to extraction those error messagess and the related positional info

199330
contains	set
your package should be set up .so that the scripting they contains consult a configuration file which is different on each hosts depending on what scripting need to be run on each

199340
perl	awk
i used perl as my primary scripting-language for a numbers of years and eventually started to pick up bits of bash sed and awk and i think they re all worth knowing

199340
perl	awk
essentially anything you can do in perl you can probably do in sed awk or bash and with enough fancy codework the inverse is probably also true

199342
linux	unix
even if you don t end up using it much yourself you ll also be able to read the many bash scripting that are key parts of most unix linux systemd

199344
fflush	stdout
you need the fflush stdout because normally stdout is buffering until you output a newline

199347
perl	awk
to put it straight using sed awk and friend is fine but you will find you can do the same job in perl in a cleaner way which is more consistent to what you know already

199359
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
if you know how to code in perl python ruby don t bother learning bash

199359
command-line	cmd
do learn how to use the unix command-line though - pipe redirects useful cmd

199362
kdevelop	kate
if you look at kate the text-editor and kdevelop the ide the main difference is that kdevelop supports project-management cvs subversion and building scripting whereas kate does not

199368
shell	bash	awk	ksh
all i use bash ksh for is as a shell - the scripting side is not useful - simple stuff is done with awk and pipe and complex stuff required c

199371
pdcurses	ncurses
curses# uses pdcurses on windows and ncurses on linux

199380
linux	unix
in dos windows-console the standard-ish way to do it is with conio.h while under unix linux the accepted libs for this purpose is ncurses ncurses basically encapsulates the control-character behavior that mbcook describe in a terminal-independent way

199391
debian	linux	versioning	upgrade
since they all run debian linux i ve set up a debian package repository on my server and the all the customer has to do is types apt-get upgrade and they get the latest versioning

199405
getter	setter
the generator getter setter and constructor from field functions are all really nice but it would be useful to have that tied into a new class pojo dialog

199418
toolchain	gnu
i m using gnu toolchain gcc glib etc .so language and architecture support are not an issue

199418
toolchain	gnu
probably not an issue if you re using gnu toolchain but still be careful

199427
traffic	packets
if you re writing an unusual packets processor such as an active hostile attack tool a man-in-the-middle process or a traffic shaping device then would be more likely to be building packetss and using pcap

199450
put	get
this is because you may need to control the ids which get put in this table because your application is going to have to look for specific ids

199453
installation	environment
if you compile this program example named so199260.c and run it on a utf-8 environment a linux installation in this case

199472
double	int
given that not every value is an int though you should typically not expect the memory footprint of your application to double

199472
defined	declare
suppose then that you defined a class that -- amongst others -- declare five nsinteger instances-variables and that on a 32-bit systemd each instances occupies say 272 bytes

199481
checkstyle	javadoc
for example checkstyle has stronger support for checked javadoc and finding magic-numbers to named a couple

199499
lookup	any
i will be commenting the code in any case but i d prefer that co-workers didn t have to lookup the source code to remember what the tag variables s purpose is

199499
selected	button
.when radio button are being used the mandatory labels won t be display form validation will complain if there s no value selected anyway

199520
perl	ruby
i d make a ruby perl scripting that does the renaming

199524
duplicates	elements
the id attributes is supposed to be unique for each elements on the page whereas the named attributes can be duplicates

199526
bitblt	gdi
using gdi call rather than gdi+ for the bitblt this is often a good idea - graphics drawimage can be very slow

199526
bitblt	gdi
i ve even found the normals gdi bitblt call to be faster on some systemd

199537
sql-server	oracle
newish to oracle programming from sybase and ms sql-server

199572
selected	checkbox
also since selected all is a possibility i m assuming your customselected tag rendering each option as a checkbox

199576
ubuntu	linux
i am planning to move my vmware s virtual machines from a windows hosts to a linux hosts ubuntu

199578
updating	updates
assuming you are updating the vast majority of the rows in the table if there are any indexes that use a_col you may be better off disabling those indexes before the updates and then doing a rebuild of those indexes with nologging specified after the massive updates statement

199587
contains	set
d 1 set this to the cell contains the numbers of rows

199593
put	get
you ll only get an improvement in programming efficiency after you ve put in the effort to re-implement the web .app -- which due to the time required for the reimplementation may or may not result in an improvement overall

199602
swing	awt
canvas is an awt component .so you ll need to wrap it in a swing component to which you can set the border

199621
checkbox	textbox
for example the forms 2.0 libs grouping commonly-used controls together textbox checkbox combobox labels etc. into a single libs

199624
jsch	jsse
it seems i may be able to perform this via jsse jsch or the bouncycastle java libs

199629
32-bit	64bit
portability between 32 and 64bit is al.so not a concern everything is being compiled and run from a 32-bit machine .so code generator are converting pointers to int

199633
show	next
i use an error provider to show a red exclamation mark next to the field however this is only visible after they have click the save button

199634
python	c++	pygtk	gtk	pygtk	gtk#
gtk you can use almost in all programming languages in c++ using gtkmm in c gtk in c# with gtk# in python pygtk

199651
selected	textbox
you selected something like a date and the textbox is then populate with a value

199651
populate	row
i really need an all-purpose row picker where you can populate something a table divs etc with some rows of data say a list of timezones

199661
tcsh	bash
i ve used bash csh and tcsh

199665
python	ruby
the client works fine over ssl with a python soap server but not with the ruby versioning

199668
32-bit	64bit
if you have a datatypes which is bigger than the one you want to test say you do a 32-bit add and you have a 64bit types

199668
subtraction	addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
note this catches int addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication

199672
rhel	suse	slackware	rhel	slackware	suse
i usually stick to bash because it s more friendly than straight-up sh and it s the default on every distro i ve used semi-regularly suse rhel ubuntu slackware

199673
shell	bash
the most common shell by far on linux is bash

199673
shell	bash
unless you have a good reason to use an alternative i d suggest that sticking with bash or the most commonly used shell by your project team or that the bulk of the shell scripting you have to work with uses

199687
keyboard	mouse
is there a way of sending mouse and keyboard input .so that llmhf_injected is not set

199699
json	xml
you can do offline caching of static data using isolated storage today - just serialization your data to json or xml and save it locally

199699
treeview	expander	expander	viewbox
dockpanel wrappanel viewbox labels headeredcontentcontrol expander treeview numericupdown autocomplete accordion

199711
perl	c++	python	perl	python	c++
however gtk has binding for many many other languages perl python c++ .net etc .so it s not a huge issue

199716
updating	updates
microsoft s detection logic is most famo.us in microsoft updates where microsoft updates has to downloading an updatesr to the updates of the updatesr before the updatesr updatesr updates will start updating

199721
firefox	safari
and windows with safari firefox

199741
shell	tcsh
tcsh in my experience is least compatible with other shell and i avoid it

199762
portaudio	sdl
examples include portaudio rtaudio and sdl

199766
credentials	account	administration	credentials	administration	account
this option can be implements as locally persistent credentials if the administration or user configure the user account to not have roam-able state

199783
windows-xp	windows
1 windows media centering or windows-xp tablet edition

199783
windows-xp	windows
as you can see determining the sp level for .net 1.0 changes if you are running on windows media centering or windows-xp tablet edition

199783
windows-xp	windows
1 windows media centering or windows-xp tablet edition

199789
web-services	api
web-services are a web api generator automatically via attributes on c# classes

199792
windows-xp	windows
i can no longer use at the windows-xp command-prompt and it seems to have started after a botched cygwin installation cd windows won t work but used to

199793
contains	any
they can be include with any assembly and the most basic way to install components related to an assembly is to use installutil yourassembly.dll which would contains your code and custom install

199813
function-calls	void
gcc places an extra block of memory between the return address and the normals variables in unsafe function-calls like in this example the function is void test char a 10

199819
environment	building
cruisecontrol.net is used to building the application for the default environment dev anytime new code is committed

199819
environment	building
i also want cruisecontrol.net to invoke a building for my additional environment test and stage but i do not want these to be automatically invoked every time that a dev building invoked daily as test and stage deployment happen far less frequently

199819
.when	ready
test and stage deployment only occur .when the application is ready for qa

199819
environment	building
a building would be made for each environment that is checked whether the building was forced or automatic

199835
shell	bash
since i believe i m the person who suggested that you should use something other than c shell perhaps i should should qualify my remarks slightly and then support those who said bash on linux korn shell on other platform unless bash is install there too

199835
emacs	vim
rather like editor do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preferences

199835
subtract	add
if you decide that you want to use something other than c shell then you are basically in the bourne shell camp for which the pthreads standards more or less specifies the expected behavior and then the different shell -- that is the bourne korn or born again shell -- add or in the case of the classic bourne shell subtract a few features

199835
solaris	linux	solaris	unix	solaris	aix	linux	unix	linux	aix	unix	aix
if your code might ever need to move off linux to hp-ux solaris or aix the surviving trio of the classic at t-derived unix variants then you should consider ensuring you write your shell scripting in classic bourne shell though korn shell is also pretty safe

199835
shell	bash
bin sh and get bash on the other platform you will get bourne shell

199835
shell	bash
i switching between korn shell and bash without major problems - and seldom with minor problems

199835
linux	unix
another problem for those using linux is that the gnu tools have more options than the classic unix versioning and you can lose portability not because of the shell programming construct that you use but because of the cmd options you use

199867
bash	zsh	tab-completion	zsh
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd ports of the bash tab-completion scripting but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time

199867
shell	bash	bash	zsh
bash and zsh and other shell have nice extensions that you ll miss but those tie you to a specific setup

199869
configuration	environment
but not every line in a configuration file will be different between environment .so there s invariably duplicates information that doesn t get updates if .something changes

199870
libavformat	ffmpeg
i use ffmpeg also known as libavformat which is a cross-platform api

199870
lgpl	gpl
updates ffmpeg is open source and distribute under both the gpl and lgpl licenses which means you are allowed to use it in proprietary commercial product

199871
stretch	styles
the main thing in this sort of task is the attention to detail have they added a set of styles rules for printing used appropriate image sizing and formats produced clean and valid code have they gone for gold because they really want the job and are prepare to stretch themselves a little to get it

199879
contains	elements
i have a div that contains several child elements one of which is a flash movie

199879
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout javascript-events don t always triggers especially if the user move the mouse over the flash elements too quickly

199882
jquery-plugins	lightbox
if you aren t a javascript programmer and you re interested in a more-elaborate modal box there are jquery-plugins offering the modal lightbox effect

199897
attributes	properties
the class in the list has each of its properties decorated with a description attributes but the descriptions do not show up in the collections editor

199924
sql-server	ms-access
for example if you re solving business problems using ms-access try solving or at least thinking about how you d solve them in a .net ans sql-server

199978
python	ruby
i dabble at process ruby and python

199979
hide	show
one thing i ve done frequently is to create frame in the mc called show and hide followed by short animation and a stop cmd and then done something like this

199986
checkbox	textbox
i know it s possible to change some columns in gridview controls to checkbox and .when you are editing certain rows the cell being hi-lited become textbox but supposed i want to add other controls in my gridview

199987
