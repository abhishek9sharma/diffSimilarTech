factors	primes	number-theory	primes
rsa the cryptoalgorithm relies on number-theory specifically the multiplication of two large primes and the fact this is difficult to factors to differentiate between public and private key

2300950
factors	primes
it is not factors large numbers that is difficult it is factors two large numbers whose only factors are themselves large primes because finding those primes is difficult

2300950
factors	primes
which means if we choose a numbers e coprimes no common primes factors to p-1 q-1 we can find es inverse mod phi n

2300950
factors	primes
it however does not rely on factors large numbers into primes for its security

entity-framework	ado.net
why will we prefer ado.net entity-framework

2300999
.when	ready
.when a thread is move to ready state or blocked state the information needed to restart it is stored in the thread table exactly the same way as the kernel stores information about process in the process table

2300999
page-fault	kernel
if a thread causes a page-fault the kernel not even knowing about the existence of threads naturally blocks the entire process until the disk i o is complete even though other threads might be runnable

2301005
entity-framework	data-access
entity-framework tends to generator a more comprehensive class-library as the data-access layer while giving you visual tools to tweak the generator code

2301028
linux	osx
this will be true on linux and osx as well

2301040

you can also use php s substring function for the same purpose but first you will have to selected whole field value from db

2301056
punctuation	words
note this will return punctuation attached to the last words which may or may not be desired

2301062
windows-vista	windows
your using a fixed address that is generally a very bad idea even more .so now that windows-vista and windows 7 use aslr making it unsafe for even fixed based modules even without aslr its unsafe because the image can reallocated for various rea.sons

2301066
decimal-point	digits
if you want a formatted decimal that occupies 8 total characters including the decimal-point and you wanted 4 digits after the decimal-point your format string should look like 8.4f .

for .some rea.son the mouse events especially movement are not passed correctly through the windows .when wm_paint is in progress and .so it appears as though the mouse and the keyboard for that matter lag

2301089
keyboard	mouse
the fps is fine this is some api problem i suspect that for some reason the keyboard mouse messages are not handled as they should while the wm_paint is in progress because the slower the timer is set to the less jerking there is

2301101
click	mouse
and this picture file xxx.png can be printinged by using the default windows picture printinging tool right click the mouse on top of the file and selected printing

there is a contact form which current action is it send field and value

2301114
keyboard	mouse
i believe with the main messages pump the mouse and keyboard messagess are queue up and waiting for you to finish the prior wm_paint messages

2301173
keyboard	mouse
wm_paint messages are never delivered to your windows unless someone call updatewindows or there are no keyboard or mouse messages in your input queue

2301173
keyboard	mouse
once you begin process wm_paint if a keyboard or mouse messages arrives it just sits in your queue until you are done with wm_paint

2301180
margins	padding
by applying a overflow hidden to the wrapper then forcing a long margins -3000px in one way and a long padding 3000px to the columns you can then apply the border to your columns and get the desired effect

2301184
swing	awt
i don t have that much experience with java threads awt events and swing components

2301190
dsa	rsa
for public-key systemd like rsa and dh dsa both used in openpgp email encryption common key sizes are 1024-bit and larger these days early 2010

2301190
factors	primes
for rsa in short it is many time easier to generator a factors of two random large primes and do multiplication with them compared to factorss of very large numbers that has no small factorss

2301190
factors	primes
due to properties of the public and private-key pairs the search spaces is limited to factorss of large primes numberss which becomes incredibly sparse-matrix .so it makes sense to try to be far more intelligent then simply trying to factors every very large numbers

2301190
aes	des
whereas with symmetric ciphers like aes rc6 rc4 twofish des and triple-des these algorithms use a random key of a given bit length

2301190
aes	rsa
i hope that explains the general difference between the two types of crypto systemd such as rsa and aes

2301197
silverlight	wpf
the web counterpart of wpf is silverlight which was formerly a part of the wpf itself

.when i submit the empty form some of the field value returned were two comma

2301229
concatenation	comma
asp.net-mvc must have concatenation the value together comma separated

2301231
swing	awt
swing does not support multithreading .so whenever you need to interact with it you need to do in from the awt event thread

32-bit	64bit
for example linux 32-bit is ilp32 and linux 64bit is lp64

2301246
assign	add
add them directly through the code-behind -- and assign param.defaultvalue upon adding

2301253

.when you have multiple field with the same named the value of the field will be returned as a comma seperated string

2301253
html-select	selected
if your form include multiple object with the same named for example html-select tags the item in the form collections will be a comma-delimited list of all the selected value

2301271
contains	elements
otherwise the schema will only contains person and not teacher or student elements

2301273
any	set
.when i run the page first time last nodes of my treeview automatically set that background-color as i applied in css.....and if i selected any nodes of my treeview as soon as my css has worked but after page postback it just disapper...how do i maintain that css after postback.

2301282

the course is the second in the program covering analysis of algorithms and basic data-structures such as stack queue lists tree etc

2301417
any	set
and then turn up on .so with please do my homework questions. a lot of them are going to have difficulty with any assignments you set but you don t need the aggravation of a bunch of students complaining about the exercises being too hard or not being covered in your lecture notes

2301426
contains	set
the set of diagnosable rules consists of all syntactic and semantic rules in this international standards except for those rules contains an explicit notation that â œno diagnostic is requiredâ or which are describe as resulting in â œundefined behavior.â

in orderedcollections a whole collections is copy-paste while in linked-list just pointers are adapted to the insert nodes

2301524
google-chrome	firefox
please note that in firefox is working fine but in ie or google-chrome it is downloading the swf...if i comment response.redict ... the user remains on this page .so the click button is working well only the redirect seems to be the problem

2301539
json	xml
what i think you really should be doing though is registering an httphandler ihttphandler implementation for the url which performs the process and creating a response which returns json or xml which flash can easily parsing

2301544
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
while everything works fine in firefox ie8 opera google-chrome i m having problem with ie7 wrapping words inside block elements

2301553

2301653
put	get
they ll then get the appropriate support put in-place .so that can happen

2301659
webforms	asp.net
now from my understanding the right thing to do would be to try building an abstraction layout of the page and user-controls model present in asp.net webforms however seeing as it would required a major investment in an existing application it is not an option

2301659
webforms	asp.net
it s more intelligent that just an exhaustive search because it knows about the asp.net webforms application layer and my goal here is to basically explore the state of the web application hoping to hit all the corner cases before our users

2301669

.when the product is added to the cart you save the recording and you set the value for that field

2301718
constructor	private
instead of creating a private constructor you can use an enum types which has a private constructor by default

2301731
decrement	increment
if it doesn t work you can create your own counter caching it s nothing more than a call to increment decrement see add_counter_caching_callbacks and ensure it s called before your code

2301736
opera-mini	safari
updates opera-mini and safari mobile definitely support it

2301739

any	set	64bit	x86
likewise if the main assembly is set to x64 it will only run on 64bit operating systemd and any attempt at loading an assembly set to x86 will fail

2301782
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
a msil main executable assembly will run as 32-bit on a 32-bit operating systemd like if it was set to x86 with the above failure points and as 64bit on a 64bit operating systemd like if it was set to x64 with the above failure points.

2301782
32-bit	64bit
obviously typically you want to go with the msil setting if you re not calling assemblies that are flagged as something specific and as long as you re not doing p invoke that isn t portable across 32-bit and 64bit i have no idea if this works if p invoke to win-api functions will map to a correctly bitsized dll or not.

opera-mini	opera
opera-mini browser can save html pages in obml opera binary markup format for offline browsing

2301812
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
i ve had a quick look at the visual guide to swing components windows look-and-feel and all the components appear to have a windows-xp styling which may be an issue if your oftware is going to be run on windows-vista 7 that said the swing libs may well re-theme itself .when run under vista 7 but i couldn t find anything that said either way

2301846
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i ve used cakephp on several project in the past and have more recently started using ruby-on-rails but there s a new project i m about to start that will required php

2301846
cakephp	lithium
while refreshing myself on cakephp i learned that there is a new framework called lithium that is essentially what cakephp 3 was going to be

2301846
cakephp	lithium
i m trying to decide whether to use cakephp for my upcoming php project or to wait a bit for lithium to release a non-development versioning and try that out

2301851
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the code in google-chrome and firefox and the result is the same

2301874
inner-classes	superclass
inner-classes are implements by having the superclass as arguments of all their constructor

2301874
subclassing	superclass
and whenever you want to initializer the subclassing from within the superclass

2301879
crossover	mutation
if the children produced via crossover mutation is an inverse ignore it and generator another child till it is a good child

2301891
datapager	gridview
how can i use gridview with datapager inorder to have a server side paginator

2301951
wikipedia-api	wikipedia
i know there s a wikipedia-api from wikipedia labs that s available

2301959
aiff	wav
i don t think there are any libs that will let you compress mp3s i presume you re talking about generator an mp3 from a wav aiff etc

2301974
button	popup
in an automated application i wrote some time ago i dispose of the popup by monitor for windows popup grabbing the windows handle and sending a click to the button in that windows

2301976
web-config	app-config
set it in the web-config or app-config for the sake of maintainability

2301980
vb.net	vba
the difference between vba and vb.net is just because vb.net compiles continuously in the background

2301983
svnkit	svn
to answer your svn java-api question svnkit is really handy

2302001
contains	elements
the first parameter is the html elements that will contains the map and the second parameter is an object that containss extended options

2302014
dialog	pop-up
1 the pop-up dialog box doesnt seem to be set to be hidden at first and even though its been assembled it doesnt actually show up until the button is click - why is this

2302014
hide	next
2 in creating a similar dialogbox basically through copying the code i m facing the problem that between call to the dialogbox - the contents persistent .so if i hide the box with the button on the dialog box the next time it is called - the new contents are just append above it.

2302017
primitive	int
i tend to think of enums as primitive data types and your question would be like asking how do i make a variables be either int or long

2302020
64bit	x86
first off setting platform target to x86 on your .exe project is a very useful .when you are debugging your project on a 64bit versioning of windows

2302020
32-bit	x86
choosing x86 in your release building is something you should do if you program has a dependency on a component that only works in 32-bit code

2302020
pointers	stack
that s somewhat justified 64bit code does need more stack to store pointers and return addresses

2302052
hide	show
the first step is to show the from that you will need to hide

2302052
form-for	destroy
if you first showed the form using showdialog then setting will close the form and destroy it which can get nasty if you were using a separate thread which communication with the form-for example

2302065
google-chrome	firefox
however i discovered that while google-chrome and .so presumably webkit allows you to selected text within a readonly part of the contenteditable elements firefox only allows you to treat the contenteditable as one big block and selected it all at once

2302068
linux	unix
ftp-server can be run standalone as a windows service or unix linux daemons or embedded into a java application

2302069
puts	gets
this is because the dc which contains the text gets process with alphablend which also eventually puts it to the windows s dc

2302071
linux	unix
ftp-server can be run standalone as a windows service or unix linux daemons or embedded into a java application

2302076
selected	button
i then flip the view .when the user selected a button on the toolbar by doing the following

2302107
specifications	w3c
see 11.2.3 row grouping the thead tfoot and tbody elements in the w3c specifications

2302115
javadoc	doxygen	documentation-generation	javadoc	documentation-generation	doxygen
there s also documentation-generation tools that ll do that such as javadoc for java doxygen for many languages etc

2302145
python	java
are java and python my only other options

2302178
masstransit	nservicebus
alternatively both nservicebus and masstransit have implementation of this

2302178
masstransit	nservicebus
even if you don t want a framework like nservicebus or masstransit the pattern itself is well worth looking at as it fits your problem spaces very closelyfrom what you have describe

2302208
constructor	private
but it mostly because it has a private constructor and hence you can t extends it

2302211
constructor	private
typically it is a concrete class not an interface and due to its private constructor it is not subclassable

2302240
simulink	labview
i m interested in creating a visual programming language which can aid non-programmers like children to write simple programs much like labview or simulink allows engineers to connect functional blocks together without the knowledge of how they are internally built

2302246
instances	private
defined your singleton as an interface and have something else manage it s lifecycle and inject it where you need it for instances as a private instances variables

2302246
dependency-injection	singleton
most dependency-injection containerss will let you markup a component as singleton but it s up to the containers to manage that

2302246
constructor	object
it also means your code really starts to become truly object oriented as any use of static-methods including constructor is debatably procedural

2302250
expression-blend	designer
i know how to do it in general but i m looking for a solution that would allow editing the visual details in expression-blend by designer without touching the code

2302250
contains	elements
.when the elementss differ only in some colors and image and contains lots of common elementss apart from that then creating separate datatemplate for each elements types would cause unnecessary code xaml repetition

2302257
selected	button
for example .when the user click on the browse button the selected folder dialog should appear

2302260
virtualbox	vmware
i found that ubuntu 3d graphics work out of the box in virtualbox 3 where vmware 7 doesn t support out of the box at least

2302260
virtualbox	esx	virtualbox	vmware	vmware	esx
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that required user integration photoshop gui etc

2302260
virtualbox	vmware
also there are tons of features in vmware such as ace to lockdown virtual machines that just don t exist in virtualbox

2302262
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
.so it s not like choosing between oracle or sql-server or mysql

2302262
mongodb	couchdb
with couchdb this means the use of json and with mongodb this means the use of bson

2302262
mongodb	couchdb
there are many other difference between mongodb and couchdb and these are considered in the nosql spaces to be very close in their design

2302262
declarative	imperative
typcially querying follows an imperative mode of programming rather than the declarative styles of sql

2302269
authentication	login
as you rightly state the domain is checked .so along with encrypting your authentication cookies and ensuring you use http i think the only thing you can do to to stop an invalid returnurl is to just ignore it and redirect all login to the home page or top level of you site letting users then navigate back via the menu

2302284
yaml	ini
imagine a strategy whereby you might want parsing for several formats of configuration file say ini xml and yaml for example

2302287
annotations	mapping
the mapping annotations would be something like

2302309
worksheet	excel
if you have excel install you can directly insert the properties into the cell on a worksheet

2302309
worksheet	excel
you could write a macros in excel to automate outlook or you could write a macros in outlook to push the data into a worksheet

2302311
margins	padding
you will need to remove all margins from the li and all padding from the ul

2302348
postback	ajax
cannot be submitted via ajax it has to be a full postback

2302399
csv	xml	export	csv
there s also the export plugins which - besides pdf - generator csv excel ods open document spreadsheet rtf and xml

2302403
gtk2hs	gtk
i am using gtk through gtk2hs with haskell via ghc and i am wondering if there is any general advice for handling events

2302404
revision	svn
i guess you need to downloading the latest svn revision from their repository to use this experimental feature

2302412
nokia	meego
both nokia and intel are now pushing it as the main gui in their new distro meego

2302475
click	mouse
in my code if the mouse click a button in titlestate s handleevents function the program call that button s activate function which looks like this

2302493
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even .when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#

2302495
any	set
is there any way that you can have the field set just be as big as the widest control inside the fieldset

2302506
header-only	boost
while many libs in boost are header-only some required libs as in .lib .a .dyld c to be built

2302519
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
it overrides touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled

2302524
dictionary	arrays
i am new to iphone development .i have parsing a xml page and stored the title date summary in a mutable arrays stories as mutable dictionary object for key .all the value are saved as string but i want to save the date value as.date format.so that i can sort it with date.how can i achieve that.please help me out.thanks

2302553
scala	java
given that java and therefore scala can call external libs and given that those highly specialized external libs will do most of the work then the performance is the same as long as the same libs are used

2302582
textbox	button
i want to create a firefox extension using it .so i created small extension that display a textbox and a button on status bar button click call a javascript function which takes value from textbox and passes as a arguments to the function in npruntime plugins which is embeded in xul

2302603
attributes	properties
on a slightly different topic were you aware that all wxpython widget already have a named attributes which can be assign using the named keyword arguments at initialization time and accessed using either getnamed or in recent versioning of wxpython the properties named

2302604
arrays	loops
you can then loops through this arrays and output the list however you would like

2302605
arrays	loops
you could use get_the_tags which returns an arrays of tag object which you can then loops through and get the named of the tag

2302611
children	nodes
the reason i m getting confused is because of the recursion that is used to traversal the left and right children of each nodes

2302634
contains	elements
if your heap contains nothing but equals elements all the elements will be traversal

2302640
svnadmin	dump
if you don t want to work with that the subversion book offers the svnadmin dump --incremental option explained here

2302640
svnadmin	dump
migrating a repository has examples on svnadmin dump --incremental

2302651
revision	svn
you can also use svnsync to copy new revision directly from one svn server to another

2302661
32-bit	16-bit
but i know like a definition that pushing a 16-bit value to 32-bit wide stack could cause a stack misaligned

2302661
32-bit	16-bit	decrement	increment
but the thing i dont understand is how this could happend...since push and pop checked the d flag at the segment descriptor .so is 1 increment decrement 32-bit and is 0 16-bit

2302674
decrement	increment
are there functions for performing atomicity operations like increment decrement of an int etc supported by c runtime libs or any other utility libs

2302674
solaris	vxworks	solaris	linux	vxworks	linux
os windows linux solaris vxworks

2302684
spring	guice
of course i could write something like don t use singleton they are evil use guice spring whatever but first this wouldn t answer your question and second you sometimes have to deal with singleton .when using legacy code for example

2302684
constructor	private	instances	private
the constructor is private .so we we can t extends it and we can t control the creation of instances in tests but well that s the points of singleton

2302684
constructor	private	mockito	jmock	powermockito	jmock
another option would be to use powermockito an extension to mockito or jmock which allows to mock stuff normally not mockable like static final private or constructor methods

2302690
contains	set	contains	elements
if you have a set of int and you insert to it the int 6 8 13 8 20 6 and 50 you ll end up with a set contains the following five elements

2302690
contains	elements
if you do that with a list you ll end up with a list contains the following seven elements

2302691
json	xml
components json and xml parsing http

2302702
frame	width
moving the frame declaration to the top above the call to setcolumn and restructuring how to determine the width of the current column solved things

2302709
xsd	xml
i need to read a large xml 65 mb validation it against a xsd and run xpath queries on it

2302713
children	nodes
i then added a new methods to scenenodes which is called rendering this methods gets the pointers to gameobject and call it s updates function before calling rendering on any children of the nodes

2302752
xerces	jdom
it seems that the workaround is to include a copy of the xerces jar in your application .so that jdom doesn t try to load it from gae itself

2302761
python	java
my server is in java and client is in python

2302766
updating	updates
if you look at the memory addresses of the things that are updating and the memory addresses of the things being updates in rendering they may actually be different

2302793
command-line	cmd
we use this from a custom command-line .so that we can mix c# cmd with .some written in ps

2302808
put	get
from there it s easy to get the actual value of an instances s properties but you have to checked to see if they are primitive-types or object .so i was too lazy-evaluation to put it in

2302814
annotations	mapping
you should include if using xml or if using annotations on your collections mapping

2302822
json	xml
i manage two formats json and xml

2302822
json	xml
don t have to copy-paste the parameters for xml and json

2302840
duplicates	elements
elements may be duplicates

2302849
contains	any
.so in keeping with dont repeat yourself mantra does anyone have any ideas on how to contains refactor this code in one place

2302853
void	main
i guess may be you have a typo in function head try modifying it to void main double ttxy

2302864
contains	elements
however i ve got a little problem as the div contains the calendar isn t nested to the elements which the .datepicker function is applied to

2302874
uitableview	uiview
i am trying to pass-through touches from a custom uiview to a uitableview underneath the uiview is directly on top of the uitableview

2302874
uitableview	uiview
i ve even tried passing a pointers to the uitableview directly into the custom uiview and doing this

2302876
textbox	button
nor am i able to add content to the combobox using textbox on button click as suggested in previous question .when i use this code cmb_act_mf.items.add txt_box.text

2302876
textbox	button
with combo box in one of it s columns such that it s list content can be added through textbox on button click

2302880
put	get
short of moving up the inherited chaining and put the source code of those parent classes all in my project or writing the widget all from scratch without using the existing framework widget that already solved the problem i can t find a way to get a vertical scrolling gallery

2302891
getter	setter
let mfoo be an instances variables that s a properties that has been synthesized hence it has default setter and getter

2302895
void	main
normalsly you should follow the standards form of the main function but not defined your own versioning.the normals versioning of main function should be int main void or

2302919
enumerator	any
a dance pad would work just as any other game controllers although you would have to figure out the mapping between button and the gamepad button enumerator

2302949
contains	set	contains	elements
in an std set the insert and deletion take time in o log n which means a bit slower if a lot of elements are contains in the set

2302953
required	checked
in short the in your interface declaration is not required it s there for error checked at compile-time

2302961
nested	order
edit i tried using nested clientdatasets and it works in parts but i still don t know how to get the insert order id

2303017
uitableview	uiview
if the uiview is not a subviews of the uitableview it will not pass it touches up the responder chaining to the uitableview

2303017
uitableview	uiview
since the uitableview uses a scrollview it is likely that the scrollview is trapping the touches before they get to uiview itself

2303022
selected	listbox	highlight	selected	selection	highlight
i have a databound listbox or listview it happens with both and if it has more than 2 items in it selection works - i get a blue highlight bar and the item looks selected

2303022
selection	highlight
if i only have 1 item the selection does not work - i do not get a blue highlight bar but the selection events all fire as normals

2303031
dictionary	arrays
indeed core data exist to handle graphing that cannot be easily represented by arrays and dictionary

2303031
dictionary	arrays
to make the graphing simple enough to upload you might have to create arrays or dictionary object and populate them with the value of the managed object

2303046
udp	tcp
for example various network service can be configure in etc service and a program like inetd listens on all of the tcp and udp sockets for incoming connections and datagram

2303046
stderr	stdout
.when a connection dg arrives it fork redirects stdin stdout and stderr to the socket using the dup2 systemd call and then execs the server process

2303046
udp	tcp
you ask why are tcp servers are typically concurrent while udp servers are typically imperative

2303068
dictionary	arrays
i can use any collections if one is better in solving than the other dictionary arrays etc ..

2303070
linux	unix
the ports range 0..49151 is further divided into the well known range 0..1023 which only a privileged process can bind to at least on unix linux and the registered range 1024..49151

2303070
solaris	linux
ports in the range 1024..49151 can be used by server process that may run as an unprivlieged user and it is also possible for clients to use ports in this range if they are not being used by a server dynamic ports on linux and solaris start at 32768 by default rather than 49152

2303089
selected	button
there is a grow button grow_btn and a shrink button shrink_btn which increase and decrease the scalex and scaley properties of a selected object either redobject greenobject or blueobject over time

2303090
attributes	properties
i want to make attributes of gae model properties

2303090
put	get
one potential issue of overrides get_value_for_datastore that i think of is it might not get called before the object was put into datastore

2303093
ppl	tbb
this would bring it closer to more common c++ libs tbb openmp ms ppl and tpl

2303117
protected	public
similarly the core android team had to make a decision as part of creating the initial sdk of how best to take the existing code and create public stuff we can work with and protected private stuff we cannot with sdk fidelity in mind

2303119
malloc	free
is there a one-liner that will free the memory that is being taken by all pointers you created using malloc s

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
strictly speaking nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect nscolor user-interfacecolor and nsimage user-interfaceimage struct object are all implementation user-interface elements that have nothing to do with the datamodel

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
it should store all the nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect as strings or numbers

2303135
contains	set
the result set will contains a row for each combinations of orderitem and payment

2303142
implements	extends
to the points just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the dopost methods defined the servlet in web.xml and let the action attributes of the html elements points to an url which is covered by the url-pattern of the servlet mapping in the web.xml

2303147
firefox	opera
i have a greasemonkey scripting that works just fine in firefox and opera

2303147
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
this allows me to have the same code for firefox and opera and google-chrome i thought

2303147
google-chrome	firefox
resolution i followed max s. advice and it works in both firefox and google-chrome now

2303149
malloc	free
note that .when your program exit s all the memory you allocated with malloc is free

2303151
malloc	free
yes you can do that unless you write your own defintion of malloc and free

2303151
malloc	free
note both your custom methods will be calling malloc and free internally

2303181
subtract	add
.when you add or subtract characters on a string it doesn t change the string it produces a new string that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
.when you add or subtract numbers from an int it doesn t change the int it produces a new int that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
and .when you add or subtract a delegation from a delegation it doesn t change either delegation

2303191
attributes	properties
.so if you want to work with both the datastore and for instances of model that have never actually been to the datastore and back you ll have to choose two namedd for what s logically the same field -- one is the named of the attributes you ll use on in-memory model instances and that one can be a built-in properties

2303200
xilinx	fpga
if you re trying to learn verilog there s no need to actually get an fpga board though you can get fpga development boards for much less than 1000 - you can get xilinx s kit for 100

2303211
contains	any
this contains local business results but you don t have any further control over them

2303231
digits	base
the nines complement in base 10 is found by subtract each digits from 9

2303238
naivebayes	svm
although not a specialized text-mining framework weka has a numbers of classifiers usually employed in text-mining tasks such as svm knn multinomial naivebayes among others

2303239
blacklist	whitelist
i suggest a whitelist approach because it s much easier to write rules to allow p br em strong a for example rather than to try and identify every kind of malicious input and blacklist them

2303242
version-control	git
with mercurial hg or git you do not need a version-control server

2303255
scons	cmake
cmake scons i have used cmake but i don t exactly love it but i have heard really good things about scons

2303277
implements	abstract
well the error basically tells us that lambda is an abstract-class which means that inorder to derive from it you d have to implements all abstract members

2303279
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
if your concern is over the generator html output of asp.net webforms not being compliant have you considered using asp.net-mvc

2303295
aggregate	grouping
if i grouping the data by category i can aggregate sum count min max etc. based on any of the other columns

2303299
contains	any
field can start or end with any of these but not a spaces but i can trim it before passing into validation function and contains none one or any numbers .so just a checked to make sure everything in the input is one of the above

2303309
getter	setter
also .when i place breakpoints in the getter and setter of the attached properties they are never reached

2303309
getter	setter
the breakpoints in the getter and setter was al.so never reached yet throw an exception-handling in them did cause the application to terminate .so i am thinking it s a framework eccentricity

2303310
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	mysql
if you re just looking for a free sql database there are many sqlite as valentin suggested postgresql mysql firebird etc

2303387
administration	account
if you don t have any login that has access then you need to restart the server in administration mode and use a local administration account to enable back the account hp16969 bernard

2303388
multiple-languages	locale
internationalization required multiple-languages and presentation of date time for various timezones and locale

2303410
value	field
2 updates those backing object whenever the value of the form field changes

2303416
python	java
i ve looked around and figured out that it might be a connection problem in ib but i m new to this whole connecting thing man i wish they supported java or python .so here s how it s laid out

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
using the jquery mouse events for mouseenter mouseleave or hover all work swimmingly on all mac or windows browsers except for ie8 windows

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am using mouseenter and mouseleave to test for hot rectangles absolutely positioning and dimensioned divs that have no content over an image used as hotspots to make visible the navigation button .when different regions of the main enclosing rectangle image are touch by the cursor

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
windows ie jquery never send notifications mouseenter our mouseleave as the cursor enters or exit one of the target div s

2303425
attributes	properties
converting a simple attributes to a properties is quick and easy and doesn t need modification of client code

2303425
attributes	properties
.when i write a properties i use _get_foo and _set_foo for the accessor and _foo for the attributes itself

2303444
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl	ftp	ssh
checked it has go php ruby perl python git ftp ssh with a viewmodel that has root access

2303446
constructor	private	instances	private
for instances if one uses the design pattern for a singleton often time accessor or properties are used and if the class is not initializer it is done from the accessor since the constructor is private

2303454
google-chrome	firefox
the header image appears correctly onlayed on top of the background-color on firefox google-chrome and newer versioning of ie

2303470
performance-testing	profiling
other than through performance-testing and query profiling

any	set
i m trying to set up a cookies which would store the time .when the user leaves a website .so in the next visit he can find a there s new content messages if any - checked against his last seen stored time

2303500
attributes	properties
as far as i know criterion only supports order by mapped properties .so perhaps mapping the date of last modification as computed properties using the formula attributes of the properties tag will do the trick

2303516
freebsd	aix	solaris	unix	solaris	aix	solaris	freebsd	unix	aix
for a project at university i need to extends an existing c application which shall in the end run on a wide variety of commercial and non-commercial unix systemd freebsd solaris aix etc.

2303544
windows	ms-dos
the list may be long but it s not nearly as long as also supporting windows and ms-dos

2303585
if-statement	loops
mark byers below there is a simpler versioning of the code above and it has three if-statement two before the else one inside a for each loops and another inside the for-loops i want the one at the foreach loops to pair up with the else statement

2303586
32-bit	64bit
in c# long means 64bit int while in c++ long means 32-bit int you need to change your pinvoke declaration to

2303604
constructor	object
given that i have a class base that has a single arguments constructor with a textbox object as it s arguments

2303606
json	xml
you re likely going to want to overrides the to_xml and to_json methods in each model and ensure that your controllers is calling those methods on your object .when returning json xml

2303615
margins	padding
this is a rather ugly hack that works by specifying a huge bottom padding as well as a negative bottom margins then hiding the overflow

2303618
parentheses	keyword
echo is a keyword not a function .so you don t need the parentheses

2303624
children	nodes
if no nodes have children then it would mean that no move can be done thus the opposing side has won the game

2303635
protected	public
because the signature include internal types the methods can t be public or protected

2303654
constructor	object
basically i guess you can do quite a lot of things in the call to super itself call a static methods for calculating some stuff that needs to go to the constructor but you ll never be able to use anything from the not-yet-completely-constructed object which is a good thing

2303668
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
viewdidappear and viewwillappear of vc3 is not fired either

2303676
32-bit	64bit
pushes 32-bit or 64 if it s a 64bit segment

2303676
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit	decrement	increment
in any case esp or rsp or just sp depending on the address size is increment or decrement by 2 for 16-bit operations 4 for 32-bit operations or 8 for 64bit operations

2303698
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
the documentation states that viewwillappear and viewdidappear should be called on vc3 .so i don t know why they are not

2303703
python	lua
for example many games use python lua and other languages as scripting languages

2303703
python	c++
therefore they expose c++ functions to python

2303715
constructor	private
you can create a private constructor that takes textbox as an arguments and call that from your public constructor

2303717
any	set
i think it would be really cool if you could assign an identifier of any length in a set like +- | # + to a class methods and then use it like an operators

2303740
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind using both memcheck and exp-ptrcheck

2303758
gedit	nano	gedit	vim	nano	vim
funnily enough i thought usual linux tools like nano gedit vim and whatnot would have capabilities for ansi color codes in a text file but it s very modest out there with info on ansi color in text files in these editor

2303784
setinterval	settimeout
there are setinterval settimeout methods but they are the same timers

2303802
put	get
this makes it easy to add new files to your project - you simply put them on disk and they will get compiled automatically

2303806
javascript	dom
you could potentially traversal the dom and generator a pure javascript object representation of it and then feed it to the dojo serialization

2303806
javascript	dom
but you have to first decide how you re planning to map dom elements their attributes and the text nodes without ambiguity to javascript object

2303806
javascript	dom
i think the a reason dojo doesn t immediately support dom serialization could exactly be this the need to first pick a scheme for mapping dom to javascript object

2303806
javascript	dom
would your javascript object simply mimic a dom tree without any functions

2303809
function-call	inline
advancing through a sequences is much faster .when inline the cost of a function-call dominates actually traversal the data structure

2303822
radio-button	checkbox
checkout this jquery checkbox radio-button plugins i think it does what you re looking for

2303864
user-interface	look-and-feel
if you draw your own button you lose compliance with the current look-and-feel and unless you do all the stuff the button user-interface does handle rollovers armed state etc it s unlikely to look good

2303865
antivirus	security
for example api hooking could conflict with security settings and even security software such as antivirus or firewalls

2303866
callback	methods
inorder to updates my user-interface as the file plays from the callback as each buffering completes playing i invoke a separate thread because you want to do as little as possible inside the callback that call a methods in my form

2303866
contains	elements
the form contains a class level eventhandler that handles a methods within which i updates user-interface elements with new information

2303866
callback	methods
in the form methods called from the waveoutwrite callback i use the invoke methods like .so

2303875
hashtable	set
i see that hashtable has a get methods but i would prefer to use the set

2303883
defined	declare
better declare that variables as extern in the header and defined it only in one source file

2303885
extends	sealed
if this is the case how can you extends the sealed class

2303901
invoices	erp
in our erp systemd we have bills and invoices separate

2303919
macros	basic
the basic idea is that i have one list of arguments that i want to pass to two different macros without repeat the list of long arguments every time

2303933
google-chrome	firefox
incidentally ie handles this scenario more gracefully than either google-chrome or firefox

2303936
function-call	inline
if you were using a c compiler that supported a nonstandard inline directive you could eliminate the overhead of a function-call

2303936
c-preprocessor	macros
if f and g must be macros there isn t any way with c-preprocessor to pass multiple arguments to the macros without an actual comma appearing at the invocation site

2303940
google-maps	bing-maps
bing-maps platform previously microsoft virtual earth should be a cheaper option than google-maps for commercial use can printing routes between nodes supports distance calculation and provides a javascript api

2303951
google-maps	bing-maps
bing-maps as suggested before me may also be an option one of my customers chose them because the entry fee was much less than google-maps

2303955
value	field
the value of the form field is being capture as just the couple of letters i typed and therefore the validation is failing

2303955
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works as it should

2303955
selected	textbox
as it should means that .when you press enter to selected the email from the history dropdown all it does is puts that email-address into the textbox

2303962
margins	padding
i ve got transitions on my navigation menu as well and the same thing happens this time altering the padding and margins

2303962
margins	padding
hmmm just tried bumping the value up a bit and even changing the margins and padding by 15px using a linear transitions still produces a small looks like 1 or 2px glitch

2303962
google-chrome	safari
same thing happens in safari and google-chrome

2303985
execute	prepare
and the statement + bound variables are execute on the mysql server -- without it re-doing the preparation each time the statement is execute which is why prepare statements can be good for performance .when the same statement is execute several time

2303994
.when	ready
.when your code is ready merge it to the master branch with git-merge my_new_branch

2304002
invoices	product
the outgoing invoices will have line items that match your product table

2304018
click	mouse
that being said if someone had already implements a chessboard with 8x8 jpanel and told me to use it i might try putting the 8x8 jpanel in a jlayeredpane and then putting a single transparency jpanel on top of everything to handle all the mouse click

2304020
haskell	scheme
in any functional language like clean haskell ml or scheme this kind of thing is very easy

2304020
malloc	free
in a language with explicit memory allocation new or even worse malloc and free such a solution would be very tedious

2304043
selected	button
besides the val only works on input elements input selected textarea and button

2304061
32-bit	64bit
difference between int types sizes on different platform mainly 32-bit vs 64bit

2304074
opennlp	maxent
i built a maximum entropy named entity recognizer for conll data using opennlp maxent for a course once

2304084

2304085
contains	any
i tried .emf but i am unable to find any tutorial that would show how to import xmi contains uml

2304086
switching	screens
now if i press the home-button and then switching to the home screens the activity will unbind from the service .when i go back to the activity from the task manager then oncreate will not be called and if the code is trying to access a function from the service i will get a nullpointerexception

2304086
onresume	onpause
if i bind and unbind only in onresume and onpause i don t have this problem

2304092
execute	prepare
for prepare statements that are execute with the mysql_stmt_prepare and mysql_stmt_execute c api functions the server writes prepare and execute line to the general query log .so that you can tell .when statements are prepare and execute

2304103
hash	md5
you can use md5 file_get_contents to downloading the file and calculate the md5 hash if your php installation is configure to open remote streaming

2304113
unicode	ucs
unicode is always stored in some kind of unicode transformation format utf well or ucs but i never saw that used somewhere

2304118
contains	set
.when i set a breakpoints and inspect the data object it looks to have a properties d that contains the string that should be json

2304135
revision	svn
i m trying to use flex compile-time constants to include the date and time the swf was built source control revision timestamp such as svn keyword is not sufficient for our needs we need to know the actual building time not the commit time

2304135
defined	declare
but i can t get it to do anything whose value wouldn t be explicit known at the time i declare the defined

2304156
firefox	safari
silverlight is supported on windows and mac os x in ie firefox and safari

2304162
ruby-on-rails	rspec
in rspec for ruby-on-rails this happens magically but this is not a ruby-on-rails project and i can t find any useful information

2304192
treeview	listview
for example a treeview a listview and a diagram view

2304193
silverlight	wpf
silverlight was originally known as wpf e

2304194
ready	live
if that doesn t work then only make it public long enough to validation that it is ready to .post live and then take it down

2304196
spring	grails
it s a monitor solution from spring source who also are owners of grails framework

2304210
onresume	onpause
in most cases you will want to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

2304210
ondestroy	oncreate
if you use oncreate and on ondestroy you will still be registering for updates .when you are paused which is being a bad citizen

2304220
textbox	button
i want to bind a button s width to some textbox s text value although i want to always have a button width s that s twice what is written on the textbox

2304224
textarea	textbox
.when you press enter and the autocomplete is active firefox erroneously first fires the page s key handler then the browser s internal key handler that closes the autocomplete pop-up and updates the textarea value while it arguably should just fire it at the autocomplete pop-up and only let the page know the textbox value changed

2304231
implements	extends	implements	sealed	extends	sealed
extension methods imply that you are extends the sealed class with new functionality and not overrides the ones already implements

2304237
value	field
how can i redirect the user back to the same page and still save their already entered value in the form field

2304242
linked-list	arrays
i do not know how to convert a linked-list of double to arrays

2304261
silverlight	wpf
i m not sure how other stackoverflow members would do it but wpf asp.net-mvc silverlight what you would do is use the mvvm design pattern

2304261
silverlight	wpf
in wpf and silverlight you use binding to access the data and use data templates to express the exact details of how to express it

2304283
jquery	.post
if i .post a comment like hello there dog it works great but if there are any special characters like or the comment is .posted successfully to the database but the jquery code is not display the comment in the list

2304288
selected	textbox
i m trying to get it .so either the selected text changes or if no text is selected only the fonts after the marker gets changed not the whole textbox

2304291
contains	set
set up a from arrays of characters contains your entire printable character set and a to arrays contains the same characters in a different order

2304300
treeview	listview
if using mscomctl.ocx you won t be able to .apply to your listview or treeview the xp vista 7 styles and your .app might look alien

2304318
javascript	dom
note that the javascript that gets returned from xmlhttprequestobject.responsetext will not execute .when insert into the dom text with innerhtml as you are doing

2304341
contains	set
in set-theory a set is a superset if it contains everything in the original set and possibly more

2304341
contains	set
a subset however is does not contains everything of the initial set

2304341
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
with that in mind in most object-oriented programming languages i m thinking objective-c but i know the same is true for java and others the parent class is called the superclass and any class which inherited from the super is called a subclassing

2304341
superclass	inherited	instance-variables	superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
a subclassing inherited things like all instance-variables and methods from its superclass thus it contains everything from the parent plus whatever is added in the subclassing

2304343
arrays	loops
if you re working with an arrays of more than two or three elements you should use loops or arrays functions rather than a long sequences of similar statements as is done in the sample code

2304345
subclassing	superclass
the set of possible members of a superclass is a superset of the set of possible members of a subclassing of that superclass

2304349
droppable	draggable
i incorporated the answer from .when i make a draggable clone and drop it in a droppable i cannot drag it again which works with one problem

2304361
16-bit	8bit
it would give 4+4+4+4 16-bit or 2+2+2+2 8bit textures that would have 2 16 65536 and 2 8 256 color depth respectively

2304361
32-bit	16-bit
the fact that pvrtc compressed images don t seem give any visible artifacts in opengl-es with the pixels format rgba4444 would suggest they re 16-bit using 32-bit png images with the pixels format rgba4444 in opengl-es on the iphone gives very visible artifacts

2304369
value	field
just create two separate field making one the real passwd field types passwd and one a fake passwd field types text setting the text in the fake field to a lighting gray color and setting the initial value to passwd

2304369
hide	show
.when the user leaves the real passwd field the scripting will see if it s empty and if .so will hide the real field and show the fake one

2304371
value	field
the int field always contains the value 50396416

2304381
subclassing	superclass
the properties and methods defined by a subclassing may extends beyond those provided by its superclass and in fact they often do but instances of the subclassing are still members of the set of instances of the superclass

2304381
subclassing	superclass
.so in oop terms people would be a superclass and programmer would be a subclassing

2304381
subclassing	superclass
hence superclass and subclassing

2304392
contains	elements
where ctx is my domaincontext the product object returned have the productareas properties but it contains no elements which is a very serious problem in my case

2304396
selected	button
whenever you create a new xcode-project selected each xib file get info on it click the general tab and at the bottom of the panels click the button make file localizable

2304402
implements	extends
just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget methods accordingly with the espider stuff and finally forwarding to a jsp page to display the result register the servlet in web.xml and call it by url which covers its url-pattern in web.xml

2304411
subclassing	superclass
the subclassing has all the members of its superclass and more

2304411
subclassing	superclass
if a class declaration is considered as a specifications then the superclass specifications is satisifed by more object and the subclassing specifications is satisfied by fewer object

2304415
default-value	arguments
4 add an arguments with default-value to an existing member function

2304417
bundler	gem
upostgresqlrade your gemfile to bundler 0.9 and add the postgresql gem

2304421
python	ruby
i might add that if you re going to be doing a lot of this types scripting it would be best to spend a day or two learning the basic of ruby or python

2304436
contains	set
first arrays will be a set that contains unique value

2304436
duplicates	contains
second arrays can contains duplicates value

2304456
default-value	arguments
adding arguments with default-value to existing member function changes numbers of argumentss to that function default-argumentss are substituted at the call site - client code recompilation is required

2304469
textbox	button
add an invisible textbox and after getting your random numbers you can just text1.text button + randomnumbers and then change the color or whatever you wish using text1.text

2304477
buffering	capture
the weird thing is the output is being capture but does not show the results in the debugging windows in real-time that is it is buffering i guess until the process terminate the whole output is shown.

2304479
put	get
why not get an extra dns entry in and put sharepoint on its own hosts header

2304480
any	set
interface-builder doesn t see any outlets or actions in the classes you have set currently

2304488
google-chrome	safari
if i points by browser google-chrome or safari on osx to this website it show all the svg perfectly

2304491
system.web	.net
an easy way to register system.web and all its dependencies is to register them from the .net install directory usually c windows microsoft.net

2304493
credentials	account
the credentials used for the account named expired on 1 9 2010 1 33 39 pm and need to be updates

getelementsbyclassname is supported by google-chrome firefox 3+ as well as recent versioning of opera and safari

2304557
sftp	ftp	sftp	ssh	ftp	ssh
another option to consider is using sftp ftp over ssh instead of curl.

2304560
alpha	rgba
if transparency does not work any color with an alpha value of 0 for example rgba 0 0 0 0 is also acceptable

2304580
comparator	sortedset
the java documentation for comparable recommends that comparator be consistent with equals because of the behavior in sortedset or sorted maps

2304607
fadeout	fadein
because stop does not work with fadein and fadeout there is a funkyness with the arrows sticking around if you move the mouse pointers fast

2304607
fadeout	fadein
as i said there is still a fix -- get rid of fadein and fadeout and use animate .so you can call stop

2304657
.when	ready
but for all that above your assembly .when ready should be a job well done other wise it is better to keep the helpers classes to where they belong

2304659
mousedown	keydown
at first you would need to handle the mousedown event to register where the user click and after this you should be able to handle the keydown event to register which key the user pressed

2304659
click	mouse
the above code capture the location of the mouse .when the user click on the form and saves it in the lastselected variables

2304682
return-value-optimization	pass-by-value

2304747
fadeout	fadein
you can control the fadein and fadeout methods much more reliably

2304749
put	get
as such .when i call for my function i get the following result this is only for breakfast since that s all i ve put in

2304754

2304767
viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewdidload
don t use viewdidload use viewwillappear or viewdidappear depending on which looks better for you

2304768
viewdidappear	viewdidload
what if you try hiding it in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload

2304775
inline-assembly	assembly
although inline-assembly is supported i prefer to replace an entire function in assembly and not use inline-assembly inline-assembly isn t portable .so the .source will have to be changed .when porting to a different platform

2304793
32-bit	64bit
i m testing on os x snow leopard 32-bit windows-xp 32-bit and vista 64bit and ubuntu 9.10 32-bit

2304794
ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	oncreate	onstart
i would generally recommend doing this in either oncreate ondestroy or onstart onstop depending on the semantics that you want

2304794
ondestroy	oncreate	.when	ready
if your activity wants to be integration with the service the entire time it is running for example maybe it can retrieve .some data from a network for you and will return the data .when ready and you want to allow this to happen while in the background .so if the user returns you will have the data ready then oncreate ondestroy is probably appropriate

2304794
onresume	onpause
i generally wouldn t recommend doing bind unbind in onresume and onpause

2304794
ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
also these pairs oncreate ondestroy onstart onstop onpause onresume are intended to be the proper pairs for acquiring and then releasing resources such as binding to service s registering receivers etc to ensure that they are correctly acquired prior to being needed and release and not leaked .when no longer needed

2304808
children	tree	children	nodes
i m trying to develop a view of a hierarchical tree in which the weight of each nodes is the actual numbers of children it has

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

2305134

view state is a kind of hashmap or at least you can think of it that way that asp.net uses to store all the temporary information about a page - like what options are currently chosen in each selected box what value are there in each textbox which panels are open etc

2305317
server-side-includes	ssi
server-side-includes ssi is a simple interpreter server-side scripting-language used almost exclusively for the web

include	ssi
the include ssi -- server side include puts whatever s in js.htm inline while the script-tag references an exterior file without putting it inline

2305332
installation	environment
it doesn t need hard installation just unzip directory + add the path to it to the environment variables depending on os

2305345
ubuntu	linux
for this i recommend g++ on an linux distribution such as ubuntu

2305350
configuration	installation
that said a lot of people tend to criticise maven in that although you need less configuration it downloading a lot of dependencies and dependencies dependencies .so it all depends on what you mean by lighting - do you mean lighting in configuration or lighting in dependency jar downloading installation size

2305351
git-repo	repo
i m in the process of moving a bunch of my work from personal svn repo s to git-repo s

2305365
connect	inet	subnet	ping	ping	lan
read inet getif for a list of lan subnet and then call net_kernel epmd_module named ip for each ip-address in each subnet to collect the list of running nodes then net_adm ping them all to connect

2305368
dictionary	arrays
.when you add object into an containers like dictionary or arrays retain will be invoked automatically and .when you release the containers as your question it s dictionary it will call release of every object to dealloc the object s memory

2305385
versioning	downgrade
until 5.3.2 is release you may compile a new versioning for use or downgrade to an earlier versioning

2305390
arrays	loops
if you have an arrays of 2 polygons you can just loops through them and draw

2305398
virtual-machine	virtualbox
perhaps you could run them inside a virtual-machine such as virtualbox with networking disabled

2305425
uitextview	uiwebview
how can i get selected text on uiwebview or uitextview

2305445
comet	chat
also look at comet if you trying to call consistent result like live data stock weather chat shoutbox

2305468
windows-xp	windows
since i upgrade my systemd from windows-xp to windows 7 but parent folder was still having .svn file in it and that s why .when i checkout the new folder code it used the old authentication details form .svn and didn t asked for the passwd

2305481
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
then implements the navigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller animated delegation methods and checked if the viewcontroller passed in is aa

unfortunately i cannot do this in ado.net entity-framework

2305506
database-table	mysql
i am using php mysql and have a database-table with image url

2305527
while-loop	cursor	nested	order	contains	lookup
you either have to use cursor or hack together a while-loop with a nested lookup if the results contains some sort of order column

2305549
order	add
also add a separate index on the order column post_date as in multi indexes only the first column on the left can be used as a individual index

2305558
sql-server	mysql
i wouldn t contemplate sql-server development without it and it revolutionised mysql development

2305574
widget	button
not only how the widget look but also things like button order etc

2305579
javadoc	doxygen
other tools such as doxygen al.so support the javadoc styles .so you should always use for comments documenting a class methods or variables .when developing in java unless there is a good rea.son otherwise

2305585
look-and-feel	swt
i have zero experience with qt but swt has native look-and-feel for the major platform by virtue of the fact it ships native libs to do the job

2305593
textbox	button
shouldn t the button and textbox have those colors too

2305597

2305602
carbon	cocoa
edit - for mac wxwidgets uses carbon and is currently transitioning to cocoa for 3.0

2305639
extends	final
if you defined a class as final then class can t be extends any more but if you defined any of the methods final then those methods can t be overrides or extended to add more functionality

2305672
.war	jar
.so i want to include 2 jar files in my java web application .war file - to be loaded on glassfish versioning 2.1

2305675
textbox	button
i just tested your code it s working fine without any problem just i put a textbox and a button on a form and copy-paste your function in the form class and put

2305677
any	set
setting innerhtml does indeed invalidate any references to elementss within the target elements you may be holding -- because those elementss don t exist anymore you removed them and then put in new ones that look very similar .when you set innerhtml

2305678
linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree
inorder iterator of a b+ tree is very efficient because 1 you only iterate through the linked-list of leaf nodes - branch nodes aren t needed and 2 you get extremely good locality

2305678
linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree	quicksort	mergesort
resorting within the tree is mostly a matter of choosing an algorithm that gives good performance .when operating on a linked-list of blocks the leaf nodes minimising the need to use leaf nodes - variants of quicksort or mergesort seem like likely candidates

2305679
mouseleave	mouseenter
the above code is my current solution and its working hover doesn t seem to work because live is required again to remove the bold class thus i am using mouseenter and mouseleave

2305686
z-index	tooltip
i m not entirely sure what you re asking but for the most-part you only ever need to use z-index if you re doing complicated styling hover tooltip or dropdown navigations simply to ensure that they display over other page content

2305697
.when	ready
there has been talk of branches in the answers and while i feel branches have there place i think that branchs are something different as .when a developer s code is ready to go into the main branch it should be checked

2305711
z-index	overlap
z-index is the properties that determines which html elements appears on top of antoher html elements .when they overlap

2305711
z-index	overlap
by default elementss have a z-index of zero but setting the css properties on one elements to 1 and another to 5 will make the latter elements be on top of the former if they overlap

2305712
parentheses	macros
you re missing some parentheses in your abs macros

2305714
asp.net-mvc	webforms
its not clear from the question if you re using webforms or asp.net-mvc

2305767
boost	stl
please tell maybe there s something in stl or boost for this

2305769
bazaar	git
generally from what i ve seen this suggests that a dvcs mercurial git bazaar et al might be the most appropriate solution - with the review step being the push to your central repository this resolves the conflict between commit often and review before commit

2305779
executable	jar
or you can make your deployed jar file executable by adding some manifest options tutorial for eclipse

2305780
textbox	button
i have a user-controls with a toolbar save button and a textbox

2305780
textbox	button
.when i press the save button in the toolbar i should recording in the textbox that i am about to save and that i have saved the customer customerview user-controls

2305785
value	field
you can use the final static string field the same way you do right now only give them a value read fro ma properties-file at the application s initialization stage rather than going back to the file for every constants which would be costly

2305823
attributes	properties
each attributes is wrapped with properties

2305843
executable-jar	meta-inf	.when	ready
.when you re ready to create your executable-jar make sure you create a meta-inf manifest.mf file that points to your main class and adds these jars to its classpath

2305850
boost	stl
i don t think there s anything in the stl or boost that does this

2305865
file-descriptor	pipe
as you can see the parent writes the file-descriptor numbers for the socket to the pipe and then call close on the file-descriptor

2305875
versioning	staging
for staging versioning that have been tested by the developers but need higher-level user testing review before going public already available to a wider circle than just the developers colleagues the whole team beta testers the public etc.

2305888
value	field
the databasetimezone field holds a timezone which describe the time zone that is used to store value in the database

2305899
malloc	free
i m trying to free up the memory i ve allocated with malloc but the free cmd doesn t seem to do its job properly according to eclipse s debugger

2305900
rhino-mocks	moq
you don t need di containers in unit tests because dependencies are provided through mock object generator with frameworks such as rhino-mocks or moq

2305900
constructor	object
in your application you will use a di framework to pass some real implementation of isomedependentobject in the constructor which could itself have dependencies on other object while in a unit test you create a mock object because you only want to test this class in isolation

2305909
webforms	asp.net
i m using linq-to-sql in a asp.net webforms application

2305911
rhino-mocks	moq
you should use a mocking framework to create your mocks rhino-mocks moq

2305911
rhino-mocks	moq
also automocking in moq or the auto mock containers in rhino-mocks will simplify building your mocks further

2305918
where-clause	sql
then you have to add a where-clause in your detail dataset s sql statement using a sql paramater with the same named as your key field in the master dataset

2305919
32-bit	64bit
the later is a 32-bit systemd and the first a 64bit although php is running as a 32-bit process and still gives the same answer

2305919
32-bit	64bit
i can only assume that this is a problem with 32-bit vs 64bit but is there any easy way to get the desired behavior

2305925
any	set
inorder for your code to know that there is no longer any data associated with the pointers you may want to set it to null after freeing the memory associated with it

2305927
firefox	safari
firefox and safari use the fragment in the location header

2305927
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
thus we seem to have consistent behavior for safari ie firefox google-chrome just tested in that the fragment from the location header gets used no matter what the original uri was

2305931
malloc	free
.when you malloc some memory all it does is searching for some free spaces in memory and keeping tracking it is now used

2305938
text-editor	editor
i created a text-editor and i would like to add actions to the eclipse toolbar .when my editor is open and has focus

2305960
perl	c++
if you want to actually do this with c++ you should probably use popen or fork + execute to launchd perl

2305960
linux	unix
most users by default have the terminal configure to display the most recently execute cmd or their current directory or some other information of their choosing and changing that is -- on unix systemd such as mac os x and linux -- considered improper etiquitte

2305971
linux	unix
the path etc aws.conf feels strange as you said you are using a windows systemd this looks like the kind of path one would use on an unix linux systemd

2305975
wikipedia-api	wikipedia
i m using wikipedia-api plugins for get content s pages from wikipedia

2305976
constructor	object
you only need to call prepare if you either use the regular mediaplayer constructor or if you are trying to reset the clip back to the beginning to play back from the existing mediaplayer object

2305977
configuration	environment
these blobs are taken from the notes ref which you can configurationure by the configuration variables core.notesref which in turn can be overrides by the environment variables git_notes_ref

2305981
ubuntu	debian
is this debian or ubuntu

2306004
joomla	drupal
read the code from joomla drupal and other open source cms

2306005
contains	elements
given the fact that std map all stl containers iirc stores a copy of the value elements the prospect of making copies of vectors contains several tens of thousands of elementss is just plain wrong

2306005
ubuntu	linux
i am building on linux ubuntu 9.10 with gcc 4.4.1

2306009
set	bag
if it s something that s not a part of a persistentent object then you can either just read the .post value each time and set the viewstate again probably the best practice or if you need to persistent that value across a redirect then use the tempdata bag which works much like session

2306019
system.out	system.in
even if you could drill down to the fd inside the streaming object associated with system.in or system.out i don t think that the java class libs provide an api for turning the fd into a socket object

2306062
unmanaged	c++-cli
i understand that the root source of my problem is that am trying to convert from an unmanaged to a managed types but i m not proficent enough in either c++ or c++-cli to know how to solve the issue

2306063
object-reference	instances
i mean i click the button that opens the windows and the .app just gets blocked and some seconds later the windows s initializecomponent methods throw a nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2306067
deployment	install
your issue would be simple to solve if you d install the .net assemblies to the gac but that s not very compatible with your deployment strategy

2306070
configuration	environment
django will abstract the database stuff but having different environment will leave you open to horrible internationalization configuration issues and nasty tiny inconsistencies that won t even show up until you push it live

2306070
postgresql	mysql
personally i d stick to mysql but i never got on with postgresql

2306080
children	nodes
i want users to be able to selected say europe and find all content matching france germany or uk and their children nodes

2306097
configuration	environment
whilst a configuration that depends on environment such as sfdatabaseconfighandler.class.php has one like this

2306121
callback	methods
the screens orientation-changes and the callback methods is not the same in this case or other similar situations home button...etc

2306125
lookup	any
you arrange the table .so that you can lookup a particular encode bit-pattern directly allowing for the maximum possible bit-width of any code

2306144
subtract	add
split the delta in half and add subtract

2306157
jsonp	ajax
you start by writing a custom actionresult that will return jsonp instead of json which will allow you to work around the cross-domain ajax limitation

2306161
abstract	extends
and the methods where i m calling this from is very abstract and has to be abstract because we want to extends the uiml document vocabulary without adding code

2306168
value	field
now you can get field value on any page like this

2306174
google-chrome	firefox
this page rendering differently in firefox and google-chrome

2306174
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
firefox opera internet-explorer

2306174
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

2306174
margins	padding
for example if i add padding 1px then suddenly google-chrome will add the bottom margins too

2306190
swing	swt
where i m not .so sure is if i should use swt or swing

2306190
swing	swt
.so what are the arguments for and against each user-interface framework swing or swt

2306204
arguments	default
and similarly simplify the call in the iterator decorator -- there s no need for two of the arguments nor for the default value

2306212
required	checked
these protocols have required methods that i need to implements and i am always checked the documentation to see which ones

2306223
swing	swt
for your requirements it sounds like the bottom line will be to use swing since it is slightly easier to get started with and not as tightly integrated to the native platform as swt

2306225
svnadmin	dump
you can t undo a commit directly the only option for this is to do an svnadmin dump remove the commit from the dumpfile either by hand using a text-editor or using svndumpfilter and svnadmin load it again

2306225
revision	svn
if it s not a real problem that the data stays somewhere in the repository as an older revision you can just svn delete it and commit something else instead

2306239
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
i don t know swt too well to brag about it unlike swing and awt but here s the comparison done on swt swing awt

2306257
primitive	boolean
however i thought boolean was a primitive types and .when i try this same logic with any other primitive types i get a compiler error that says

2306259
primitive	boolean
boolean is a primitive types

2306265
primitive	boolean
boolean with uppercase initial b wrap a boolean primitive

2306265
primitive	boolean
primitive types boolean in an object

2306272
exception-handling	try-catch
they have the same try-catch syntax as java c++ exception-handling

2306275
swing	awt
heavy components native awt hide swing components not a problem most of the time as as use of heavy components is rather rare

2306275
swing	awt
supported by eclipse gui editor vep vep also supports swing and awt

2306275
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
has an integrated awt swt bridge to allow use of awt and swing components

2306280
contains	set	contains	elements
currently i have a code that checked if given elements in arrays is equals 0 and if .so then set the value to level value temp_board is 2d numpy arrays indices_to_watch contains 2d coordinates that should be watched for zero

2306282
ubuntu	linux
if you want to write graphical applications which work on linux similar to those in a default ubuntu install take a look at gtk

2306294
shutdown	restart
dangerous from php use systemd.in systemd use sudo shutdown -r now to restart and sudo shutdown -h now for shutdown

2306294
shutdown	restart
write a scripting run by crontab as root .so that if this file exists the file is removed and then shutdown or restart is run

2306311
order	add
if you need them in descending order high to low add desc to the end of the query

2306329
bluetooth	usb
what is the best way using bonjour bluetooth or directly usb if it is possible

2306336
32-bit	64bit
an important thing to consider is that some users and some resellers dell install a 64bit viewmodel on their 64bit windows and you can t use the same swt libs on 32-bit and 64bit viewmodels

2306336
32-bit	64bit
this means you will need to distribute and test different package depending on whether users have 32-bit or a 64bit java viewmodel

2306357
revision	svn
if there were no other commit since you import your files then you can easily delete the last revision using svn dump

2306364
versioning	migrate
migrate to the ver prior to your new migration by using db migrate with a versioning

2306374
contains	set
in my form_login i have action set to auth login which contains the following code

2306391
shutdown	exit
then you can have ant send it the shutdown cmd .when the client exit something like

2306406
any	set
.so if you want to know where a value changes you can t set any global conditional as they would be too cpu consuming

2306411
attributes	properties
is there a possibility to access a i.e background-image url properties inside an inline styles attributes

2306413
ms-access	mysql
automatically convert a mysql ms-access or db2 database

2306413
ms-access	mysql
to a mysql ms-access ms excel or db2 database

2306415
duplicates	elements
for example the list below has n elements some of which are duplicates in the list

2306423
perl	c++	python	java	python	c++	python	perl
this layout has significantly increased my typing speed in c++ c java and perl and somewhat increased it in lisp and python

2306426
linux	osx
virtualbox can be a great help here for osx and linux users unfortunately most of the android-emulator and sdks in particular the preverifiers are geared for windows first a primes example being blackberry

2306435
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are recommended

2306436
jtable	jlist
for this kind of thing you d normally use a jlist or jtable if you need custom rendering

2306457
callback	methods
the callback methods then runs the query to get the count

2306457
callback	methods
there s also a callback methods for count

2306457
filtering	sorting
this allows the outer selected to filtering on row numbers after sorting and filteringing

2306483
order	add
you could first do a self-join on the exchange rates which are order by date .so that you have the start and the end date of each exchange rate without any overlap or gap in the dates maybe add that as view to your database - in my case i m just using a common-table-expression

2306491
environment	execution
what may be even worse - the target execution environment may not support the exact semantics of some c# operations

2306499
swing	swt
the miglayout for both swing and swt and jgoodies forms tools are two of the best in my opinion

2306515
put	get
for a perfectionist per.son he she would start to learn as much as possible about language x .so probably would run put of time and ot get it done

2306528
debian	linux
os debian linux 2.6.26-2-686 filesystems ext3

2306529
constructor	object
clone is very convenient to make defensive copies of arrayss passed to methods or constructor as all arrays types are cloneable and the signature for clone is covariant .so that actually returns a rather than an object

2306534
schtasks	cmd
to create a scheduling class i call the schtasks cmd from my code passing it the necessary arguments

2306554
file-access	filesystems
in addition to faster file-access by separating images into subdirectories you also dramatically extends the numbers of files you can tracking before hitting the natural limits of the filesystems

2306575
perl	php
that said it s a trail or some of temporary thing they i think you can pick enough to get something working if the task isn t too complex within 5 days especially if it s something more scripty like perl or php you need to pick up

2306595
ms-access	mysql
but they will probably not cover exactly the mix you are interested in for example there may be tools specializing in converting from a range of dbs to mysql or from a range to ms-access but having a general purpose tool doing what you want for all the combinations is probably too much to ask

2306598
strcat	strlen
in this example with strings that have known lengths you could survive without this return-value without needing to use strlen or strcat repeatedly

2306610
export	csv
some things can already be done without additional tools export excel to csv and import csv with mysql s tools

2306613
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit .app running on 64bit windows can t access certain areas of windows registry

2306616
malloc	free
there is a common sense way of doing this in the line of c for every pair of malloc there is a free if there isn t there s a leak likewise the same for the globalalloc virtualalloc heapalloc localalloc virtualallocex ...there s an associated ...free pair with them for example running a heapalloc on variables foo for example and there is no heapfree for foo that is a leak.

2306618
textarea	textbox
is it posible to replace a character at a specific positioning within a textarea or textbox

2306620
if-statement	arrays
each half of the multiplication in the if-statement will produce an arrays of boolean value which are then multiplied and ed together

2306644
uiimage	nsimage
i really need to emulate the behavior of nsimage s drawrect fromrect operation fractions using uiimage and i m wondering what s the best approach or better if somebody already did this and willing to shared the code

2306695
javascript	dom
for javascript checkout javascript with dom scripting and ajax

2306705
noncopyable	containers
i think you should probably do what standards containers like vector do and forbid noncopyable templates arguments

2306714
authentication	login
for iframes the solution was ultimately to redirect to the login url which becomes the authentication url if they are not already logged in

2306715
synchronous	.when
my javascript needs to send some data to a server .when the page closes which i currently do with a synchronous ajax sjax

2306745
getter	setter
by mistake maybe because they were typing to fast and just wanted to get the getter and setter out of the way

2306769
xhtml	tidy
keeping your views in xhtml ensures that they are clean and tidy

2306769
seam	jsf
there is a good choice of jsf seam books

2306771
value	field
the x in both the field and parameter represent the same value

2306776
pointers	stack
micro.soft c bcc32 embarcadero c++ and gcc all pass va_list in the same way a pointers to the first variadic arguments on stack according to my experiments .so it should work for you

2306788
getter	setter
also an average ide can autogenerate all getter setter in a few keystrokes click

2306788
getter	setter
in eclipse for example do alt + shift + r and then s and then selected the properties you d like to generator getter setter for and click ok

2306800
value	field
the clean methods on the form object takes the value of the time and date field and turns them back into a datetime

2306801
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
if you don t work in a team and you have all your files local you could use a distribute version-control tool like git mercurial or bazaar

2306802

2309347
communication	messages
in general the ways in which these people communication and the patterns of messages flow are pretty close to the gof design-patterns

2309367
hide	show
problem is you are hiding and showing bitmap on mouseover .so .when you move mouseover bitmap mouse goes off panels onpanelsmouseleave is called and you hide bitmap which means now mouse if over panels onpanelsmouseover is called and in that event you again show bitmap and that means now mouse if over bitmap again and out of panels and hence you are stuck in a hide show circle

2309372
placeholder	required
sometimes i just set the required attributes and set the text etc. sometimes i have placeholder in the templates and go something like

here only the pointers is on stack and not the object .so .when

2309535
firefox	safari
rest its working properly in ie 7 firefox safari etc etc

2309579
javascript	dom
through one user session it stores lots of dom and javascript object on client side

2309582
order-of-evaluation	parentheses

2309586
value	field
here you set the value of the field to itself

2309588
required	checked
it could be either int anything and as long as it is not known what types that anything is it cannot be checked if it is in class finite which is required by size

2309595
selected	button
i can click the magnifying glass button and then click the desired elements in the browser windows to selected the corresponding nodes in the dom tree display in the debugger

2309595
children	tree
if the elements has an id document.getelementsbyid works but if there is no id is there a better alternative to xpath or manual traversal of the dom tree using children

is it possible zend-framework does not have this wonderful community feature such as the vast amount of plugins available in symfony

2309633
annotations	mapping
as pointed out you can use jpa mapping file instead of annotations to map well non annotations entities classes from a third party libs

2309633
associations	model
regarding automation i don t think you can automate the generator of orm.xml from the object-model as opposed to a physical model an object-model doesn t contains enough information for example which field is the pk or for a bi-directional associations which side is the owner etc hence the need for metadata

2309668
contains	any
however for some reason a certain session does not contains any time information therefore the timeline feature does not work

2309675
local-variables	class-members
this is just for my understanding.objects which are class-members go into heap while local-variables and value-type got o stack.is there a usecase and possibilty to push the object to stack or heap forcibly

2309676
sql-server	oracle
like we can connect to sql-server using mssql_oledb plugins how can we connect to oracle server in nsis

2309716
expression	brackets
without the brackets it s a methods grouping - an expression which tells the compiler to look at the available methodss with that named in that context precisely for the purpose of creating delegation

2309717
triggers	insert
logical delete and a view you change your delete logic either by changing the delete cmd or by using insert of triggers to only mark rows as deleted

2309817
checkbox	button	input-field	checkbox
at first i also thought that there shouldn t be multiple input-field with the same named but having thought about it for a few more seconds i realised that - in the case of radio button and checkbox in particular - there is a good case for duplicates namedd

2309817
value	field
other answers have suggested giving the field unique named - this will simply move your problem to the server as it now needs to make decisions about which selected value is valid

2309840
background-repeat	background-image
it is background-image set to body with properties background-repeat

2309847

2309927
stderr	stdout
first two invocations prove that ls does not write to stdout and writes the error messages to stderr

2309930
background-color	width
in this example the div.container centering the elements and also gives them a width and the background-color can stretch across the page because # header #content and #footer don t have width

2309930
margins	padding
and in the future just apply margins and padding to divs inside .container and you ll save lots of problems with ie in the future

2309949
sql-server	mysql
fwiw your take-it-offline-and-do-it idea is exactly what i d do on a mysql database never had to on an sql-server database take the main db down grab a snapshot clear the binlogs enable binlogging and fire it backup

2310042
user-controls	ascx
the markup for each widget types will be encapsulated in a user-controls ascx

2310045
callable-statement	jdbc
vanilla jdbc only supports namedd parameters in a callable-statement setstring named named and even then i suspect the underlying stored procedure implementation has to support it

2310065
.when	ready
i could go about doing this the hard way and install windows ddk and mess around in c++ to create a low-level ndis drivers but being ã¼berly rusty on c++ and all the typical compile issues that comes .when compiling templates code for this i prefer some ready coded libs for this

2310078
file-descriptor	filehandle
a real filehandle will also have a file-descriptor associated with

2310225
dynamic-programming	memoization
this is most efficiently implements using dynamic-programming memoization

2310226

2310279
python	php
anyways there s a python libs and you can apparently use mcrypt to handle encryption decryption in php itself

2310284
shell	bash
and finally what you tried will work on some shell i m using bash as for the above examples just apparently not with your shell

2310296
webforms	asp.net

i know oracle better than mysql but i guess in this case it s the same

2310388
protected	public
personally i think it would make more sense to just expand the meaning of interface to cover any contract whether internal private protected or external public but i suggested adding a whole new construct first because people seem to be very adamant about the meaning of the words interface and i didn t want semantics to become the focus of people s answers

2310399
hide	show
also you d better hide them from the start and show only elements with image loaded successfully

2310420

afaik the binary flag only applies to fstream and stringstream never does linefeed conversion .so it is at most useless here

2311491
output	mode
in your case out is necessary or better yet use an ostringstreaming otherwise the streaming is in not in output mode which is why writing to it fails

2312450
subtraction	addition
here you go addition and subtraction in c++ using nothing but comparison and logical-operators

then you could store the points for each action in the action table and whenever you do a lookup for total points just join the the tables and order by the timestamp .so you can get a history of their points

2312452
dictionary	arrays
rather than removing the words from dictionary i add them to an arrays that is returned from the function

2312452
dictionary	arrays
also if the dictionary variables is an arrays which i suspect then every time you called remove it had to first search for the words in dictionary linearly starting at the beginning and then remove it

2312475
return-type	arguments
the compiler is able to deduce types t and u once the arguments are present but you cannot tell it that the return-type is decltype lhs+rhs as return-type since neither lhs nor rhs are yet in scoping

if you look at the source of that final link it consists of latitude-longitude pairs for the outline of the states which are then transformed into x y pairs for display in the svg format

2312949
contains	any
i don t think then that your problem is different from any schema version-control except maybe more complicated you have to make and ship sql-scripts that contains the schema updates for each schema

2312963
contains	any
apparently what i need to do is use as my delimiter .when there are zero or an even numbers of double-quotes but also ignore any contains in brackets

this reminds me of .when i fixed a bug in a online-playable game in which a fire object s constructor deleted the oldest fire if the total numbers of fires had reached a certain numbers

2312992
boost	stl
but you ll need to write a special class for that because there s nothing similar in the stl or in boost

2313117
linked-list	queue
than linked-list .when used as a queue

2313117
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
specifically an arrays-based queue implementation reduces the need to resize the underlying arrays if the existing arrays has sufficient capacity thus making additions to the queue generally faster than linked-list

2313117
linked-list	queue
the flip-side is that linked-list will typically provide a much more compact representation particularly in cases where your queue grows and shrinks by a large amount

2313117
linked-list	arrays
for example if you added 10 000 000 elements to an arraysdeque and then removed 9 999 999 elements the underlying arrays would still be of length 10 000 000 whereas a linked-list would not suffer from this problem

2313117
linked-list	queue
in reality for single-threaded access to a nonblocking queue i tend to favour linked-list

2313142
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome but something s not quite right in ie6

2313156
linked-list	queue
i see that linked-list implements the queue interface but it will only be as fast as a linked-list right

2313332
32-bit	64bit

i see no begin work or commit work or rollback work statements

2313402
rollback	commit

2314044
low-level	hardware
since you re writing assembly and hence probably are interested in low-level performance details you ll want either a cycle-accurate simulator or actual hardware or both

2314086
php-extension	imagick
if it can t figure things out because there are no count tags then it uses the imagick php-extension

haskell	c++
that would be of use for me for writing haskell program that generator c++ code which would be notated with comments telling which haskell line is responsible for which c++ line

2314133
apache	vhosts
you could use vhosts .when you have apache with two different documentroots one for the live versioning and one for development

2314133
configuration	environment
considering the workflow for rolling out you should create an application configuration where you can defined several application environment development and production that automatically choose their environment based on urls definedd environment variables or something else

2314134
python	java
while i m specifically asking about c# .net i d like to know the answer for java python and other languages for the next time i have to do this

depending on the size of the project though it might be a good idea to use version-control like git or subversion

2314180
required	checked
and checked that your hosting server does not prohibit any special functions you use on your dev server and this is pretty rare that the hosting company blocks vital things and if they do you can easily send support an email and 99 of the time they will assist you in enabling whatever particulars you required

2314399
perl	php	perl	c++	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	perl
it is of utmost importance to me that various internal tools java perl python php c++ be able to talk to this service and it would seem silly to have to rewrite maintain the interface layer for each of these languages manually .when the wsdl route would do that for me

2314399
python	c++
in each case and thus in c++ and python and c# where code cannot be shared eventually i ll end up with a wrapper classes methods that hide a lot of that ugliness from me

2314399
perl	c++	python	java	python	c++	python	perl
while i m a fairly sea.soned programmer with experience in java perl python c++ etc this is the first time i ve considered author a ws and don t have prior experience with other wss .so i m looking for .some guidance

windows-vista	windows-xp
i m running cygwin on windows-xp and windows-vista

2314476
player	movie
nb you must save the reference to the movie player in an instances variables and it s most convenient to declare a properties that we can use to access it

2314476
subclassing	ivar
you can intercept touches in that class and send a notification or cancel the movie directly if you ve stored a pointers to the mpmovieplayer in an ivar on your windows subclassing

2314477
json	xml
it s just http request with simple json or xml payload

2314477

i ve created a post-receive hook to generator an email to the dev mailing list whenever changes are pushed to the central repo and to generator documentation from the documentation folder in the git-repo

2314508
http-get	get
get with the http-get methods the form-data set is append to the uri specified by the action attributes with a question-mark

2314521
silverlight	wpf
since you mention wpf specifically i also assume you mean .net 4.0 since the datagrid is only available in silverlight 3 and .net 4.0

2314534
triggers	insert
but you can add a triggers on insert which would extraction guid from the xml data and put it in a separate field

2314549
reference-type	generics
however if you tried what i did above with a list generics on some reference-type then you would not succeed

2314559
javascript	dom
you need to have access to the dom which can only be done by javascript injections unless you are the one with the swf embedded in the site with in the html templates

2314559

myspace for example allows you to add any random swf to the html page but you can t do that javascript stuff because they force allowscriptaccess to always be false among other things to prevent any javascript dom access

2314563
pixels	line
desktop.thumb.jpeg was 50 x 37 whereas desktop.croppedthumb.jpeg was 30 x 30 .so i had a 3 pixels high black line across the bottom

2314600
increment	reset
.when you do delete entries make sure to reset your id increment

2314616
.net	wcf
you need to remember one big issue wcf is supposed to be interoperable - .net exception-handling aren t - those are .net only

.net	wcf
- and on your wcf server implements the ierrorhandler interface and turn all .net exception-handling into instances of your own error class and pass that back to the caller

2314630
shared-libraries	ldd
try running ldd test.out to see where it s looking for the shared-libraries

2314643
versioning	upgrade
updates if you upgrade your svn client to versioning 1.7 this is no longer an issue

2314660
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
you could also wrap this types of functionality into collections classes businessobjecttypescollections however there s a lot of movement towards using the repository-pattern in domain-driven-design to provide these types of accessor invoicingrepository.getallcustomers invoicingrepository.getallinvoices

2314666
contains	any
for future reference you can also use the json.stringify string methods to figure out what a json string or almost any object for that matter contains

2314673
put	get
you can also put the cursor on a words and enter to get a list of tags matching that words

2314674
value	field
then in your controllers you can grab those value the normals binding way and then transfer those nice looking field to the other model you have

2314695
groovy	java

2314704
onmousedown	onmouseover
this should work only if you have javascript event onmouseover or onmousedown etc

2314704
click	mouse
it will not made a right button just simulate the call to a javascript event like a right mouse click would have done

2314705
boolean	int
second other data types like int required more bits to represent .so they are going to take up more room in the streaming than boolean

2314705
cpu-architecture	x86
finally if you are on intel x86 your cpu-architecture is little-endian which means lsb first like you are describing

2314705
order	add
if you need to store value in the streaming as big-endian you ll need to add a conversion layer in your code - similar to what you ve show above where you push one byte at a time into the streaming in the order you want

2314714
asp.net-mvc	wcf
we are using wcf web application hosting report systemd we are accessing it from silverlight and since it s using same machine key as our asp.net-mvc application - we can shared cookies authentication as well

2314731
perl	c++	python	java	python	c++	python	perl
looking at your skill set java perl python c++ you should be very satisfied with a rest or at least http-based approach

32-bit	64bit
i mean 32-bit vs 64bit

2314767
automated-tests	selenium	automated-tests	web-testing	web-testing	selenium

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseup
i have a wpf scrollviewer that i use for panning mousedown mousemove mouseup and i would like to include an acceleration effect that incorporates inertia

2314931
contains	any
note that int types do not contains any information about leading zero .so that information is already lost by the time it hits the database

2314953
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
in the last of each row is a hidden div that i have wired up to show on mouseover and then hide again on mouseout of a link that is visible in the

2314969
onresume	onpause
the preferred way is to register a broadcasting receiver in the onresume methods of your activity and to deregister it on the activities on onpause

2314987
internet-explorer	safari
the pages work properly in internet-explorer and safari

2315001
hide	show
onmouseout should only hide the div if it should not be show

2315012
mstest	nunit
the only time i ve had this is because i was using the mstest runner to try and view nunit tests by mistake

2315017

2315038
promise	future
also about future clojure 1.1 has added abstractions for promise and future

2315061

2315062
http	ssl
http ssl

2315073
value	field
i have an object-model with a non-null date field but the underlying database field was nullable and had a null value

2315078
any	set
is there any way to reorder or manipulate a set of input before posting to a scripting for process

2315101

you could also implements a triggers to set the createdate to getdate .when a recording is insert

2315102
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

i m sure this is super easy but i can t seem to think what i m doing wrong anyway i have a title selected list for my form and i want to display a textbox if other is selecteded

2315126
canvas	scale
i ve done basically this before and started by looking at scrollviewer but in the end throw it away and used a viewbox with a canvas as the child for ab.solute positioning of content i was supporting zoom aswel as scroll it was basically deepzoom without the scale images for zooming .so there was pixelation .when zoomed right in

2315130
google-chrome	firefox
if you set your image tag src to # or empty it will cause twice pageload calling i faced this on google-chrome and before on firefox

2315131
environment	building
i m building a web-based application that can use activex controls to printing to a thermal labels printinger specific to shipping labelss in windows environment but i am racking my brain to figure out what the best methods would be for osx

2315134
data-structures	linked-list
.so no to use simple data-structures effectively it s not 100 necessary to be able to do all the proper error checked for loops null tail concurrency etc in a linked-list while blindfolded

2315134
data-structures	tree
however while the simplest data-structures aren t rewritten over and over tree and graphing are often still custom rolled and you probably won t be able to do anything with those without understanding more basic data-structures

2315139
selected	textbox
that is if the last option is selected show the textbox that goes by the id othertitle

2315153
subtract	add	subtract	modulo
the reason why you have to add d q before subtract the oldest character is because you might run into negative value due to small value caused by the previous modulo

2315166
constructor	private	instances	private
for example .when implements a factory that creates instances of class foo which only has a private constructor should that factory function be a static member of foo you would call foo create or should it be a friend-function you would call create_foo

2315170
click	mouse
the messages loops enables the form to receive windows-messagess eg key presses mouse click paint invalidations to allow it to appear responsive and have integration with the user

2315191
contains	elements
i have also verified using typesof that the value of thisrowid is indeed of the types string and that the string contains the id of appropriate row elements

2315196
mouseenter	mousemove
i suspect that in the mouseenter handler i need to store the location of the object then in mousemove compare

2315201
required	checked
this particular expression checked for four digits and then three time a hyphen and four digits thus representing your required format

2315213
push	pull
between myself and another programmer who are working on the same project we consistently have a problem with git where we will commit a few changes to a specific file push the changes up and .when the other pull down the entire file is conflicted

2315218
json	xml
we used wcf to implements a restful api where we could .post and receive data using xml json and protobuf

2315218
asp.net-mvc	wcf
however once we looked at asp.net-asp.net-mvc we dumped wcf and are now using asp.net-mvc to do the same thing with much more transparency code

2315218
json	xml
our primary need was to give clients the option to serialization request and receive response to xml json or protobuf

2315231
opensolaris	bsd
one can use a jail in opensolaris bsd to provide such guarantees but there are no cuda drivers for those operating systemd

2315233
contains	elements
i was wrong in that the contents of my thisrowid variables did not contains a reference to an appropriate row elements

2315240
json	xml
xml json xhtml rss

2315261
wicket	spring
.so i have an web-based application that is using the wicket 1.4 framework and it uses spring beans the java persistent api jpa and the open-session-in-view pattern

yes you can add a new rules above the default rules and provide a default-value for the controllers

2315305
void	main
find the first words preceded by class and succeeded by ... public static void main string

2315333
virtual-memory	paging
there are other factors involved such a pic positioning indepent code virtual-memory and paging

2315353

onmousemove	onmouseup
whenever i alter the onmousemove or onmouseup attributes of the document for example

2315358
internet-explorer	firefox
it prevents me from selected text in any input types text or textarea elements in internet-explorer have tried in ie7 and ie8 fine in firefox

2315399
pseudo-class	anchor
a couple of elements can have rollover effects set through css pseudo-class for example a hover for an anchor tag but it s limited and not 100 warranted across all browsers

2315406
temporary	rvalue
for a temporary rvalue you can only have a const reference

2315406
temporary	rvalue
i believe the reason why is to reinforce the fact that a rvalue is temporary as there is little value in being able to modify something that is going to disappear momentarily

2315407
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework overview

2315411
temporary	rvalue
a temporary object of types a returned by the expression a is an rvalue .so the above rules applies in your case as well

2315417
value	field
this gets rid of the issue and allows me to cancel without validation but the field themselves are not set to their original value

2315419
constructor	object
you are assign a temporary object the result-of calling the class s constructor to a variables

2315419
temporary	rvalue
a temporary object is an rvalue

2315428
any	set
set numbersofline to 0 to allow for any numbers of line

2315434
portrait	screens
keep the most important elements high in the hierarchy and let the others flow further down the screens .when viewing in portrait mode

2315443
malloc	free
if you use malloc as he suggests make sure you free it each time if it is allocated each iterator

2315447
binary-tree	nodes
since a balanced binary-tree with n leaves contains 2n-1 total nodes you will also satisfy your o n storage limit

2315459
order	add
you can use --nocheck-order to get rid of the warning or add a | sort -u inside the process-substitution if you can t guarantee order uniqueness of the input arrays

2315476
python	php
a better approach would be to re-declare functions like you can in python which would be o 1 complexity but the php development team hates this idea yes i ve asked for this feature

2315497
arrays	map
i had a very simliar messages earlier also except instead of the map being empty it was something like map v-- string arrays

2315501
stderr	stdout
just avoid any use of pipe -- let stdout and stderr just show on the terminal

2315510
contains	set
a directed probabilistic relationship aka a complete set of conditional probability tables aka bayesian network only contains statistical information

2315512
margins	padding
simpler than padding margins in some cases to shift stuff around a bit i think maybe it s just opinion

2315517
python	php
all the major server side technologies had adobe amf support php python dotnet etc...

2315521
filtering	sorting
you can also use the dataview class which provides sorting additional filtering derived columns and several other bits of functionality that is similar to the access query object in some respects

2315538
webforms	asp.net
webforms apps asp.net

2315538
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms application

2315551
data-structures	map
i wrote some custom data-structures a year ago for a work project because we were able to take advantage of our data s unique properties to use an on-disk memory map compress it store most of it in the indexes use bits of the offset pointers to indicate the types of the next data object and make it obfuscation enough to deter most people from trying to read out our database

2315556
z-index	overlay
i tried setting the z-index of the flash .app to something greater than my flex .app and that worked but unfortunately that solution doesn t work for my case because the flex .application has components that occasionally overlay in that area and setting the z-index of the flash .app to be higher means those components are always stuck behind it

2315560
ubuntu	linux
on linux it appears to only blink in the taskbar ubuntu default

2315623
required	checked
i have used jquery interface plugins which was easy to setup and worked pretty well for that task checked the demo but i wanted something lighter and which do not required additional pluginss

2315644
postdata	request
i ve tested it by using a chunks of code from my server that dump the request to a console and i can that the client is sometimes sending and sometimes not sending the postdata

2315651
any	set	value	field
setnewvaluefromlefttoright this methods would get any 2 object with the same class and set field value of bar2 using field value that are not null of bar1

2315656
click	mouse
on the first click of the mouse the axes change from 0 imagewidth and 0 imageheight to -200 imagewidth+200 and -200 imageheight+200

2315676
getter	setter
you have to loops through all the variables and checked for public setter and getter and use it

2315697
while-loop	loops
for what it s worth if you didn t have step 21-30 you could use a do while-loop where loops conditional goes at the bottom of loops instead of the top

2315704
value	field	getter	setter
if you have an accepted conventions such as the one used by javabeans where each field needs a corresponding get and set methods then you could loops over all of the first object s getter methodss call them and pass the resulting value to the second object s setter methodss

2315704
getter	setter
however this won t work for any field that don t have the right getter and setter

2315705
subtraction	addition
i mean how they work in mathematics operations like addition and subtraction

2315721
post-increment	pre-increment
the difference is that the post-increment operators i++ returns i as it was before increment and the pre-increment operators ++i returns i as it is after increment

2315740
google-chrome	firefox
this div will have a computed height of 104.5px in most recent google-chrome firefox and ie

2315740
margins	padding
i used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margins padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instances

2315743
versioning	upgrade
these days the preferred methods would generally be â progressive enhancementâ include the basic html versioning on the page then have javascript replace upgrade it where it can

2315752

if all you re doing is looking to make sure your nsmutablestring is equivalent to another nsstring why not do something like

2315826
udp	tcp
socket connection is tcp or udp

2315847
udp	mtu
udp uses datagram chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

2315880
tuples	any
any sort of tuples with an x y address is unnecessarily complicated compared to a simple int address

2315894
temporary	copy	updating	updates
because with prefix you modify the object and then return it .so it can be lvalue and with postfix you return the unchanged object a copy and only then updates it this is of course done by first storing the copy in a temporary updating the original object and then returning the temporary by value.

2315906
onkeydown	onkeyup
.so during my form s onkeydown onchar onkeyup i would need to pretend they are going to my windowless child control

2315906
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know in what development-environment firefox google-chrome or blender were created in but their widget support windowless controls

2315925
base-class	inherited
favor object composition over class inheriteded - if you are looking for new behavior from the base-class then it doesn t seem like you d want to inherited anyway because they are different types

2315925
base-class	inherited
perhaps ship and shipplacementarray should inherited a common interface but certainly not from a common base-class

- typically people dedicated a set of n machines to chat - then they hash based on a identifier for the user think a guid that represented the user - or a userid bigint depending on what corresponds to some internal authentication token that is consistent from login to login which allows them to deterministically route the user s status state information to a specific machine in that set of n boxes dedicatedd to messaging

2316024
listviewitem	gridview
each column in the listviewitem is rendering based on the gridview definition .so there is no real concept of column numbers

2316031
normalize	cosine
i m not sure of your implementation but the cosine distance of two vectors is equals to the normalize dot-product of those vectors

2316034

cin and cout are istream and ostream respectively but fstream derives from iostream

2316214
base-class	inherited
it is definitely a merit too t hat you can take advantage of the inherited implementation from base-class

2316219
textchanged	textbox
carlos_liu ok i can see now the problem you can achieve this with the textchanged event just save the value in a dummy-variables and reuse it at txt_validating but be cautious don t updates this variables unless the textbox is focused

anything persistentable has to be marked as such .so mark your subclassing as an entity and mark field that you don t want to persistent as transient

2316584
put	get
this link for java design-patterns is way too involved don t get too put off by the words java there you can use what they teach for development in any language

2316698
key-value	key
now hash has one key a which has a value of an anonymous hashref contains the key-value pair

2316830
exception-handling	try-catch
you would normally enclose a block of code in a single try-catch block if the code block should be execute as a block or not at all if some exception-handling occurs

2316830
exception-handling	try-catch
if it s not the case then i believe it is much better to isolate the different code blocks throw different exception-handling-handling into different try-catch blocks sandwitching do more stuff here that does not throw exception-handling

2316841
.when	ready
be ready to handle errors .when the ports is not available choose next ports retry

2316845
required	checked
if you really want to use an image input as a regular submit button then checked that its name.x is submitted and this required giving them unique named

2316865
click	mouse
to edit a curve on those programs which probably is bezier curve we can click on the curve drag the mouse and the curve is changed accordingly

that because your cms object is not a constructor function

2316900
contains	set
if you set up your urimapper to contains something like the following

2316902
configuration	environment	environment	building
another way is to have the configuration files created at building or deploy time using something like an awk scripting or xslt in combinations with a single file contains the specific settings for each environment

2316902
environment	building
the environment to be deployed would have to be supplied to the building scripting in some way of course but you need to do that anyway

2316907

our datamodel in mysql is now just key field int and the big value field just a big textfield basically

2316921
mongodb	couchdb
we did not go with any of the new player couchdb cassandra mongodb etc because although they each offer great features performance in their own right there were always drawbacks for our circumstances missing immature java support

2316935
firefox	safari	web-inspector	inspector
i had the same problem and found that whilst i couldn t inspect hover object in firefox with firebug safari s web-inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspector

2316992
malloc	free
c s memory-management is more basic than objective-c s but as you seem to know you use malloc and free that just stays the same

2316993
put	get
or i have to do it manually put just the internal repositories and which dependencies my building fails for those are external or there is a third way you think will get the results better

2317006
rdbms	acid
nosql seems to generally use key-value data stores you can always implements this in your preferred rdbms and hence keep the good stuff like transactional acid properties support from your friendly dba etc while realising the nosql performance and flexibility benefits via a table such as

2317014
put	get
at the moment we deploy using visual-studio and this creates a setup.exe that makes sure that both .net and the c++ redistributable get put on the target machine

2317014
put	get
if .so surely i can just include those dlls in the msi and make sure they get put on the target machine

let s call n d and e the rsa modulo private exponent and public exponent respectively

2317975
exponent	modulo
the rsa decryption speed is proportional to log d log n 2 quadratic in the length of the modulo and linear in the length of the private exponent

2317975

binary-tree	nodes
for example in an std set the nodes will be binary-tree nodes with spaces in them for an int and the two child pointers and the metadata that the libs needs the red black flag

2318331
binary-tree	nodes
the binary-tree nodes will not move around your applications address-space .so you can store pointsers to your data item elsewhere if you want but that isn t true for all containers - an insert in a vector move all items above the insert points up by one and may have to reallocate the whole vector moving all items

2318331
copy-constructor	constructor
it can take parameters .so it can call a copy-constructor or other constructor not just the default-constructor

2318331
binary-tree	nodes
in binary-tree nodess of course there should be no need for this as there is only one item per nodes and it s always construct

google-chrome	firefox
can anyone enlighten me as to why the following code won t work in ie7 but it works just fine in google-chrome firefox

2318776
compatibility	legacy
it might be some historical compatibility thing with 20-year old legacy code

2318787
firefox	safari
and unfortunately with a webview unless you do a bit of work you don t have all the great web debugging stuff that firefox or safari would have that would have made this problem easier to find

2318802
punctuation	tokenize
the rules are fairly simple but they will required some interesting special cases especially .when it comes to punctuation and capitalization requiring them to write a basic scanner tokenize

2318823
aspect-ratio	scale
if you want to be able to scale the preview and preserve aspect-ratio then put everything above into a viewbox which will deal with the scaling for you automatically

for each nodes that is matched i also need a comma-delimmited list of the ancestry of that nodes and a comma-delimmited list of the immediate children of that nodes

2318926
hide	show
the question is how do you hide show the images

2318926
hide	show
if you use the hide show methods to toggle the display properties then you can use

2318934
perl	php	perl	c++
i ve also noticed that it greatly depends on the language c++ and perl programmers prefer on the same line c# java and php developers prefer and on their own line

2318939
constructor	object
on constructor functions this is the default return-value if you don t return any other object or you don t even have a return statement on your function this will be returned

2318967
value	field
at the onfocus on the field there is a periodic checked if the value has changed if .so the callback after is called

2318967
copy-paste	undo-redo
this will work even if the user makes some indirect changes like undo-redo or copy-paste in the field

2318970
children	nodes
.so .when you selected like a certain nodes you could grab all its parent and children from nodes_parent

2318979
children	nodes
it works by taking all descendents and then requiring that there do not exist any nodess between the base nodes and the descendents which basically restrict the descendents to only the children

2318995
silverlight	wpf
this should supports all 3 requirements and i am hoping provide a fairly easy ports from wpf to silverlight for the web based phase 2

2319092
malloc	free
to understand malloc free and new delete you might read chapter

2319097
setinterval	settimeout
you can only achieve what you re trying to do with a settimeout or setinterval call increasing each step with a timer instead of a loops

2319109
implements	extends
however java s types systemd is perfectly capable of distinguishing between interfaces just try to extends one with a class abstract-class just try to initializer one and classes just try to implements one and .so are most ides

2319110
gettext	poedit
however a pro of gettext is the existence of a huge ecosystem of tools that translators of your software are able to use poedit

2319118
silverlight	wpf
if you re planning a ports from wpf to silverlight i d recommend following a separated presentation pattern like mvvm

2319132
malloc	free
also keep in mind that if you allocate memory in c++ using malloc you have to use free to free it

2319154
nonblocking	epoll
large-scale design pretty much always involves nonblocking sockets and selected poll epoll kqueue tricks

2319155

2319348
silverlight	wpf
refer to code-reuse in wpf and silverlight 2

2319360
classname	inherited
note that the inherited line is case-sensitive in c# .so it should match the codefile s classname exactly

2319364
revision	svn
instead to deploy the files you would use svn export of a known good revision

2319365
ellipse	line
i m working on a game-like .app which has up to a thousand shapes ellipse and line that constantly change at 60fps

2319381
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
older code in our application contains call to malloc realloc and free

2319381
malloc	free
the problem is that we now have to include a 3rd party libs which has classes that contains methods that have named like malloc and free

2319381
malloc	free
but even then if our code is required to call these malloc or free methods of the 3rd party classes the preprocessor will still alter the call unless we write all call like this

2319425
32-bit	64bit
i m compiling for 32-bit and the program will run on 32-bit and 64bit architectures

2319425

2319454
csv	xml
i have a controllers that generator html xml and csv report

2319687
udp	tcp
udp is explicit allowed to drop and reorder the datagram and there s no flow control as in tcp

2319688

2319688
windows-xp	windows
the machines i ve tested it on run windows-xp - windows 7 x86 and x64 versioning include

2319701
malloc	free
why don t you just defined your own malloc and free functions instead of using macros

2319712
32-bit	64bit	compatibility	platform
on 64bit systemd program that written for 32-bit platform will work through compatibility layer wow windows on windows and your pointers must be aligned on 32-bit

2319754
ubuntu	linux
but in linux especially in ubuntu it doesn t appear well since the font-size is 10 by default

2319761
constructor	object
next you need to make up your mind whether person_data is a handle which has to be set to an instances created with gcnew or member object semantics like stack semantics the constructor is automatically called by the constructor of the parent object the destructor called automatically .when the lifetime of the parent object ends and you use . instead of - to access members

2319761
instances	destroy
also are you sure you want one copy of person_data shared between all instancess of globals but destroy by the first instances to be dispose leaving any other instancess holding an invalid reference reference to dispose object

2319788
ellipse	line
what it boils down to is that every single one of those ellipse and line you re creating is a separate frameworkelement

2319809
constructor	object
on a basic level the application startup is the zero-parameter constructor for the object identified in the service contract

2319810
subclassing	base-class
there are really only the two choices mentioned either you modify the base-class to have a virtual dosomething methods and overrides it in the subclassing you can have default functionality in the base-class doesn t have to be abstract or you write a big conditional statement i would really not recommend that goes against oop

2319817
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
how to inherited the constructor from a superclass to a subclassing

2319827
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass

then under the environment tab selected custom for the python path click on the view as text button and paste in the extra path

2321601
implements	abstract
the reason they only are mentioned in an abstract way is that they are concepts while they will be implements as data-structures there is no universal rules how they have to be implements

2321622
if-statement	while-loop
you cannot declare a variables in the control part of a while-loop or an if-statement

2321622
if-statement	loops
obviously you can and always could declare variables in the block after any loops or an if-statement

2321622
expression	evaluation
before the first evaluation of the controlling expression

2321622
expression	evaluation
evaluated as a void expression before the first evaluation of the controlling expression

2321633
put	get
one problem with locals or variables is that it will let you put stuff in the namespace that you can t get out of the namespace by normals means

2321655
arrays	loops
it was fine to use .when you had the pivot elements as the first elements in the arrays because your checked in loops will skim past it

2321667
sql-server	mysql
i m currently migrating a customers application from coldfusion on windows with sql-server to coldfusion on linux with mysql and i m running into some issues recreating their views with regards to join

2321667
nested	order	order	join
the inner-join s without an on clause are what are tripping me up and i can t find any good sql-server docs on the order of nested join

2321676
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
i ve seen 8bit 16-bit and 32-bit crcs

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
.so much .so that i created a winforms user-controls that supports parameterized meta-queries for sql-server oracle and mysql and i describe extensively the design and use of this querypicker in a three-part series published on simple-talk.com.

2321704
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i regularly work with multiple database types sql-server oracle mysql and--practicing the great programming ideal of laziness--i do not want to have to lookup or remember an arcane sql recipe every time i need it

2321704
oracle	mysql
oracle and mysql tools do not seem to provide the same usefulness

2321704
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
what sql-server oracle or mysql meta-queries do you find useful

2321704
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
query sql-server oracle mysql

2321706
protected	public
that said i think in c++ which again supports private and protected inherited it s possible to cast the child class up to parent and get access to parent s public members

2321713
boost	stl
previously the code only used stl and boost but i recently had to include .so i could lookup csidl_local_appdata

2321720

finally .when you re ready to test it set up a debugging configuration of types eclipse application

2321734
windows-vista	windows
full windows-vista windows 7 uac support

2321769
daemons	systemd
then run your program until it crash and make sure that the systemd generator a core file use ulimit -c unlimited to allow the creation of a core file be careful if it s a daemons it must be done for the user that actually run the daemons

2321783
any	set
however in most cases it makes more sense to keep any extra information in an instances variables that is set int the constructor

2321786
factors	numeric
each data points has a set of fixed attributes which may be 1-d numeric factors or characters and also a set of variables length data

2321801
expression-blend	wpf
as for the grip you will have to edit default toolbar templates you can find one in expression-blend directory c program files expression-blend 3 systemthemes wpf and remove overflowgrid from it.

2321831
uitableview	uiview
in the navcontroller the first root view will be a custom uiview contains a uitableview that .when you touch a cell will push another custom uiview in to disclose details about the touch cell

2321851
selected	checkbox
and i ll create an interface to list those along with checkbox beside each one and a selected all etc

2321877
decimal	hex
however a cohort found the an xml specifications and implies that it is equivalent to a carriage return decimal 13 not hex 0x13 here

2321877
specifications	w3c
.when a specifications has an error not just something that changed but an actual error does the w3c leave the document accessible

2321880
cout	cin
i can use cout but cannot find examples of how to use cin within a qt console application

2321887
firefox	opera
this is especially odd because in other pages in ie the code works as expected and it works every time in firefox opera and webkit

2321908
if-statement	arrays
i have a series of if-statement that i use to basically parsing out the original input and based on .some string i choose which byte arrays to use and in doing .so copy the results to the original tstarrays

2321914
keydown	keyup
shift doesn t triggers keydown and keyup which would have been ideal

2321916
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
.so .when .something happens in your second tab where the uinavigationcontroller lives you will push a uiviewcontroller onto stack

2321918
firefox	safari
you can create an npapi plugins which will work in safari firefox and other mac web browsers

2321932
hide	show
i have little piece of javascript to show hide divs based on which link is click in a list

2321944
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
in c++ overloaded operatorss are not inherited through the class hierarchy .so try to completely redefine a separate copy of new and delete in each derived-class without referring to the base-class s definition using base_class operators new

2321950
contains	set
this set of data contains about 40 field and each recording relates to a single website

2321995
python	ruby	.when	ready
teaching them several different languages .so that .when the next python or ruby or sequoia comes along they re ready is important

2322007
dfa	nfa
you then step through all of those and follow some fairly simple rules to collect sets of nfa states together to become a state in the dfa

2322007
dfa	nfa
the rules are simple enough that it s pretty easy to program them into a computer but you have to repeat them for every cell in the nfa table and do essentially perfect book-keeping to produce a dfa that works correctly

2322013
jquery-plugins	jquery
jquery-plugins are expected to return the jquery object and deviating from this will cause you grief in the long run and make your code harder to use

2322017
contains	elements
this properties will contains an arrays of functions that should be called .when the event is raised on the elements .so the event handler function is added to this arrays

2322040
oracle-xe	oracle
i use oracle s free apex software quite a bit myself it comes with their free database oracle-xe just downloading it from their site

2322054
windows-applications	wpf
is f# necessary to building windows-applications which can already be written using c# and wpf

2322087
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	mysql	schema	rdbms
.so far the best way i ve found is to first load the xsd into an rdbms like postgresql or mysql and then have ruby-on-rails connect to do a rake db schema dump

2322091
swing	swt
performance is comparable to swt swing is not slow

2322091
javafx	swing
the integration of swing components within javafx is easier

2322091
swing	swt
but at the bottom line i wouldn t suggest to use pure swing or swt

2322091
swing	swt
there are several application frameworks for swing swt out

2322091
swing	swt
the biggest player are netbeans swing and eclipse swt

2322106
web-config	app-config
3 add a connection-string to your web-config or app-config

2322109
database-design	business-logic
we first make database-design and put some business-logic on it stored-procedures unique or not etc then we code server side and write most of the business-logic on client side actionscript-ajax flex

2322110
callback	methods
but wait basically magics-up a callback for you .so you can pass it to .some asynchronous methods and on the outside you just get back whatever was passed to the callback as your return-value

2322123
worksheet	excel
if you want to avoid the current named of your excel file being changed just save the current worksheet not the whole workbook the vba equivalent of the save-as function is activeworkbook.save-as to save just the current sheet use activesheet.save-as

2322126
show	next
do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using next to skip the line you don t want to show up in the output

2322137
hotmail	gmail
i can t reproduce this bug with any of my email clients gmail yahoo mail hotmail thunderbird blackberry or iphone

2322142
show	next
do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using next to skip the line you don t want to show up in the output

2322144
ellipse	line	.when	ready
4- the systemd returns to the ready mode .when finished drawing which can be detected automatically by the expected numbers of pointss 1 for points 2 for line 3 for ellipse ...etc or .when the user presses esc or right-clicked the drawing area if the expected numbers of pointss is unknown example polyline

2322164
expression	evaluation
this dump-vars-to-file routine will create some expression that can be read by simply evaluation the expression later via a load cmd or read

2322167
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery 1.4.2 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 4.0.249.89

2322169
lookup	any
besides caching you may al.so want this lookup to be asynchronous .so any delay does not hold up serving the page

2322176
pylons	django
i want to keep using python 3.1 but i m finding that lots of libs frameworks don t support it yet namely django pylons mysql-python etc

2322187
webforms	asp.net
i have a asp.net webforms page in which i m using the jqgrid component

2322194
contains	any
looking up module namedd from any package just causes your code to break randomly if the user happens to import some libs that happens to contains a module with a conflicting named

2322197
any	set	order	add
.so you would set the button to a very high order numbers 1000 and then add the dynamic elements starting with an order numbers of 1 or any numbers lower than the button s order numbers

2322206
value	field
in the edit page view add a custom field called img1 for instances and the value should be the image url

2322207
getter	setter
the end result is a properties that is publicly readonly while being readwrite within the implementation and for whom both setter and getter are synthesized automatically by the compiler

2322215
object-reference	instances
i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error .when this line is execute

2322215
selected	listbox
it is looping through a list of selected items in a listbox

freebsd	linux
i also have freebsd linux compatible .libs under usr compat linux .lib

2322231
button	popup
in my silverlight user-interface i have a button that .when click popup a control with some filtering parameters

2322262
declarative	imperative
re ant vs maven - in this respect syncing project settings ant building files won t work because they are imperative script-like rather than declarative

2322265
checkbox	button
.when your go button is click use javascript to get the value of all the checked checkbox

2322325
mouseenter	mouseover
i have tried using the events mouseover and mouseenter but both of these only animate one time .when the mouse is positioning over the button

2322334
sql-server	mysql
i haven t used mysql for about 6 months thankfully migrate off to sql-server but try changing your symbols for

2322341
selected	cell
your example doesn t show it but if all of your cell are in the same row or column and you re selected individual sums to avoid intermediate calculations consider using subtotal

2322359
click	mouse
an alternate methods that i have not had success with is using mouse capture in silverlight and detection .when the mouse is click outside of the pop-up

2322369
.war	jar
an additional step needed for jboss 4.2.1.ga is to remove any log4j jar files from the .war

2322369
.war	jar
if this jar is include in your .war the sql.log file is never written to

2322377
console.writeline	console.readline
you can use console.writeline console.readline ..for the purpose.both are in systemd namespace

2322384
perl	ruby
in ruby and perl 6 this has been called splat and i think most people from those communities will figure out what you mean if you call it that

2322386
sql-server	postgresql
well you can use actually almost anything postgresql sqlite and even microsoft s sql-server compact or sql-server

2322388
directory	folder
somewhere in each of those directory will be a class-template folder

2322428
double	int
only the types char short int long-long long float double long-double _bool void and with _complex will be examined

2322433
selected	checkbox
i have a generator table that contains multiple rows with each row contains a leading td with a checkbox and another td with a selected list

2322433
selected	checkbox
now i want to pin a change event upon the selected but i want an action only to get started if the leading checkbox is checked for now i have

2322437
instrumentation	profiling
my profiling is showing me that the sqlalchemy instrumentation is taking a lot of time in this use case

2322452
selected	checkbox
how about looking at this the other way around handle the click event on the checkbox and if checked assess the value of the selected in the row

2322460
xmlhttprequest	cors
possibly the xmlhttprequest cors cross-origin resource sharing specifications which is supported by many of the modern browsers but required the providing server to be configure to send out the cors header could be used instead of jsonp and using douglas crockford s json2 libs which also fallback on native browser json support if available

2322492
contains	any
however since almost any types can contains an arbitrary amount of padding bits theoretically the object size of types short might be greater than that of types int

2322515
getter	setter
i can do it without a setter and a getter but i want to know the correct way to approach this

2322515
getter	setter
should i just set the properties directly or use a setter and a getter

2322526
controllers	routes
in this case you will need a seperate controllers for both routes accounts_controllers.rb and profiles_controllers.rb

2322536
cout	cin
the first points is to make sure operator-overloading is a little less messy than in c++ debatable but it surely makes things a lot simpler and the second points was specifically chosen to rules out c++ s cin and cout way of dealing with io iirc

2322537
getter	setter
a reason to use an setter getter in that kind of situation would be if you want to ensure that some conditional or calculation is made on the data each time the properties is set

2322537
getter	setter
as a sidenote of course if your want to access your private properties from outside the class you ll have to use to public setter getter -- but it doesn t seem to be what you are trying to do here

2322549
getter	setter
don t forget that you can use the magic __get __set methods without having to create getter and setter for everything

2322549
getter	setter
edit if the member variables are private or protected you will have to use a getter and setter

2322551
sqlplus	prompt
and from your sqlplus prompt

2322552
haskell	lisp
concerning macros here is a page which talk about it hello haskell goodbye lisp

2322553
http	ssl
the ssl tls handshake is over before http even begins

2322576
peer	p2p
otoh your response to the above comment seems to imply that you might have some p2p elements in which case http will probably not serve unless you incorporate a little bit of network traversal and proxy to expose the peer as public addresses to each other

2322581
firefox	opera
i know how to include ie specific styles sheets using conditional-comments but what about firefox opera and webkit

2322584
double	int
the native types for c are char int float double and void

2322584
any	set
the c standards defined char to be large enough to store any member of the execution character set

2322590
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
there are no conditional-comments for firefox opera and safari

2322592
google-chrome	firefox
updates looks like this works in both firefox and google-chrome

2322609
logout	login
one is a login time one is a logout time

2322617
any	set
it is passed encrypted and secure assuming the client and server are set up correctly and you didn t click-through any certificate errors

2322623
highlight	selected
however you know that the selected option gets highlight by making background blue and text-color white by default

2322665
getter	setter
setter getter allow derived classes to modify limit enhance state and behavior of an object more easily

2322665
getter	setter
but you can over-do setter getter and then they become a bit annoying

2322677
mongodb	hbase	hypertable	hbase
updates and twitter s selected cassandra over several others including hbase voldemort mongodb memcachedb redis and hypertable

2322683
numeric	digits
the rea.son for using a 4 digits alpha numeric code and not a stupidly long numbers like a guid is that it easy for people to write the numbers down or sms it to a friend and just bring the numbers and have it entered manually .so we don t want large amount of characters

2322694
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
the advantage of this low-level approach is that with just wait pulse and the lock statement you can achieve the functionality of autoresetevent manualresetevent and semaphore as well as waithandle s static-methods waitall and waitany

2322700
any	set
the guiding principles for such a task logically partition the data process each logical partition in parallels eliminate access and updates contention between process batch-file commit changes don t transfer more data that is necessary on the wire use set based process as much as possible be able to suspend and resume etc etc can be implements on ssis just as well as any other technology if not better

2322732
filtering	sorting
there is an msdn article entitled selected rows randomly from a large table that talks about this exact problem and show a solution using no sorting but instead using a where-clause on a generator column to filtering the rows

2322735
tokenize	parsing
here is an example see parsing csv file with boost tokenize in c++ for details or boost tokenize

2322749
directory	folder
one directory folder per concept is a good idea

2322775
input-field	selected
to selected a portion of the input-field

2322782
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox google-chrome opera it works fine

2322790
32-bit	64bit
i tested by running on a windows-server 64bit with both dlls in the directory and on my systemd which does 32-bit

2322790
32-bit	64bit
how do i release the .app .so the same folder can be run as either 32-bit or 64bit

2322807
arrays	loops
how would i loops through each jagged arrays in the session

2322833
arrays	loops
then you can loops through the arrays like you were going to

2322857
webserver	nginx
most time it s easier to run a real webserver say nginx on ports 80 and proxy the request through to your program which you can run on a high numbers ports 8080 for example

2322858
placeholder	required
stfail is the exception-handling and only required 1+ argumentss. the last required arguments is always an optional format string for a description and any other parameters are used to substitute in those placeholder just like you d do with printf or nslog

2322869
derived-class	inherited
i believe i could have the interface inherited from the iserializable interface but does that mean that the derived-class couldn t use the attributes to specify serialization as opposed to actually implements the methods for iserializable

2322893
waitpid	fork
see the perldocs for fork wait and waitpid and al.so the examples in this .so thread

2322898
contains	set	contains	sorted	sequences	unique
it s used for results from query functions - your results are basically sortedset of unique recording since a set contains a sorted sequences of unique items

2322898
contains	sorted
a map contains key data pairs the key being sorted and unique

2322907
common-table-expression	subquery
to prevent this you ll need to relocate each xmlagg to a subquery or a common-table-expression that produces a single xml fragment .so you can safely reference it from the main query

2322907
any	set
it also gets rid of the need for xmlforest since xmlagg won t produce any results for an empty input set

2322915
enumerator	any
edit to clarify ironpython exposes any python enumerator of object of types t as an or an

2322916
widget	button
you listview row can either have focusable widget like a button or be clickable not both

2322926
decrement	increment
really you should be asking yourself why you need increment decrement

2322926
decrement	increment
i ve been using ruby for close to two years now and hadn t noticed that increment and decrement operators were missing

2322926
decrement	increment
might be because the ruby way to do operations where increment and decrement operators are commonly used is with an iterator

2322929
google-chrome	safari
over time encountered quite a numbers of serious cross-browser issues mostly in less widely used browsers safari google-chrome

2322944
rar	zip	gzip	zip	gzip	rar
i can uncompress zip gzip and rar files but i also need to uncompress bzip2 files as well as unarchive them .tar

2322948
silverlight	wpf
test manager for recording manual tests in web wpf windows forms and soon in silverlight

2322958
alarmmanager	wakelock
but if you want to keep the device awake -- whether for your first approach or just while you are doing work triggers by an alarmmanager -- you need to hold a wakelock

2322976
32-bit	64bit
most likely the libs is compiled as 32-bit and you re compiling as 64bit or vice-versa

2322996
for-loop	loops
i d even go as far as saying that the body of loops must not continue or break unless explicit documented at the top of the for-loop because as i said the whole purpose is to make the code easier to understand by coming up with a distinct styles to express simple repetitions

2323005
return-type	optional
a function-declaration is the prototype for a function or it can come from the function definition if no prototype has been seen by the compiler at that points - it include the return-type the named of the function and the types of the parameters optional in c

2323028
versioning	upgrade
alternatively just have the customer upgrade to the very latest fiddler versioning

2323051
keyboard	mouse
detailed integration step keyboard mouse ...

2323058
directory	folder
my question is how does visual-studio add this folder and xml file to the bin debugging directory

2323058
directory	folder
.when i clean the solution the model folder is still in the bin debugging directory but the contacts.xml file has been cleaned

2323064
memcheck	valgrind
run valgrind with the option to try it but beware that it is not as robust as memcheck

2323077
authentication	login
if you must use some authentication mechanism between pages using a session variables i d recommend using a second lookup table login and store the username login time etc in that table

2323084
markup	xhtml
leaving aside rdfa is there any markup that you re using that s conformant xhtml 1.0 transitional but not conformant xhtml 1.1

2323111
key-value	key
i want to get the user s input key-value if user click confirm key i will direct the page to some othe page now i don t know how to confir user click the confirm key

2323134
constructor	object
you could probably use the pypng package s png.reader object to do this - decode the base64 string into a regular string via the base64 standard-library and pass it to the constructor

2323138
private-members	object
static-methods have access to protected private-members of an object of that class

2323147
enumerator	any
on a enumerator object to see if any of its elements satisfies the predicates you pass in the block

2323157
solaris	linux
it also happens on linux and i expect solaris

2323157
buffering	streaming
in fact i would be surprised to find any conventional os platform that provides unlimited buffering for process-to-process streaming

2323213
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works correctly adding nodes as it should but on ie7 i get a scripting error and the specific error

2323225
copy-constructor	temporary
wouldn t it call the copy-constructor for the construction of a with the temporary passed-in as its arguments

2323231
decrement	increment
given an adjacency list or a list of edgess u v this is o v + e since each edges is touch twice - once to increment once to decrement in o 1 time each

2323241
copy-constructor	temporary
wouldn t it call the copy-constructor for the construction of a with the temporary passed-in as its arguments

2323252
derived-class	base-class
the base-class s member information will be suitably copy-paste updates to the derived-class object provided you have appropriate ctors defined of course

2323276
fwrite	fopen
use file_put_contents or fopen fwrite etc to output to file

2323292
shell	bash
.so in gnu bash shell i would use

2323295
.doc	xls
my requirements are to be able to thumbnail the major image and file extensions .doc x txt xls x pdf rte and as many others as possible

2323297
getter	setter	protected	public
give messages a public getter but protected setter .so that only subclassing and the datacontractserializer because it cheats may modify the value

2323315
directory	folder
..and you put the folder which contains the libs files into your project directory and of course change folder in the above code to whatever the folder named are

2323324
instances	destroy
destroy an instances but it doesn t do anything at all to the code for the class s member-functions

2323349
any	set
it is an essential piece of any devs skill set

2323350
decimal-point	digits
it should be read foo fn.m err bar baz n and m specific numberss where n is the field width in characters and m is the numbers of digits after the decimal-point

2323379
32-bit	64bit
and i m thinking with all the major manufacturers still dispatching 32-bit binaries predominately - major exception-handling i can think of is autodesk s autocad - is windows still immature on its 64bit libs

2323382
any	set
my keyboard is set to english and i don t have any other languages on my computer

2323401
derived-class	inherited
the reason why i want to inherited from derived instead of base is derived-class contains a lot of other implementation

2323402
decrement	increment
the numbers 0x12345678 is meaningful as a pointers value even if there s no meaningful data at address 0x12345678 in memory. because it s a distinct value it can be manipulated on its own you can increment or decrement it compare it against other pointerss and printing its value to the screens regardless of whether it actually points to anything.

2323428
json	xml
but i ve been using json or xml for communication between the two

2323431
32-bit	64bit

32-bit	64bit
.so at the end there is no difference in the msi .source files except that 64bit machines required difxapp_x64.wixlib to install the drivers properly and it seems like i still need to create two separate 32-bit msi files for 32 64bit platform

however note that multiplying two numbers of arbitrary length x is not o 1 on finite hardware -- as x tends to infinite the time needed for multiplication grows if you use karatsuba multiplication it s

2327301
digits	base
x the length or numbers of digits in whatever base doesn t matter for big-o anyway of n grows with o log n of course

2327303
multiplication	addition
of course if you implements factorial some other way for example using addition recursively instead of multiplication you can end up with a much more time-complex algorithm

2327306
key-value	key
put the other 120 value in another table with composite primary key based on the pk of the first table interactionid plus the keytypeid identifying which of the 120 possible key-value pairs the value is for

2327351
websphere	ibm
we re using websphere 6.1 as our primary deployment server and most of the java development is done in ibm rational application developer 7.1 i believe -- it s a flavor of eclipse for anyone who s never heard of it before

2327383
selected	listbox
the user is given an option to selected what they want to run based from the listbox

2327389
administration	sysadmin
a basic escrowing systemd consists of a systemd administration with a pc the sysadmin creates the key-pair stores a copy in the company safe and hands the key-pair to the user on a usb stick

2327393
put	get
but i would like hudson codeigniter server to be able to run it but no matter all the jars i put in ant_home .lib i can t get this task to run in a simple command-line ant..

2327403
webserver	nginx
wsgi is usually preferred because it decouples your choice of framework from your choice of webserver if tomorrow you want to move say from apache to nginx or whatever the move is trivially easy with wsgi not .so easy otherwise

2327417
callback	methods
thread callback methods

2327439
display	height
i m display a numbers of controls all the same custom types that can change their height in response to user-input

2327440
javascript	dom
however most of the time you want to use jquery methods to do the manipulation as opposed to getting access to the raw dom elements and then modifying it using standards javascript

2327457
dotnetnuke-module	dotnetnuke
i have a dotnetnuke-module created in dotnetnuke 4.9.2

2327463
inlining	inline
the problem wouldn t have been inlining the methods - it would have been the jitter doing interesting things with memory-access whether or not it was inline

2327510
jquery	.post
i m doing option 1 currently it s very lightweight and all you need is an ajax .post jquery or updatepanel and some modal i m using jqery user-interface

2327512
logout	login
both login and logout are of that types

2327534
value	field
i would make the field final and force the constructor to pass the value up

2327544
println	output
it s kind of hard to tell what this code is supposed to accomplish but maybe you want the outer dollar sign in the println statement to be preserve in the final output

2327545
constructor	object
initializer the object in the abstract-class constructor and just pass the difference to the that constructor

2327558
ref	out
there are three kinds of formal parameters value parameters ref parameters and out parameters

2327558
ref	out
.when you use a variables as an arguments corresponding to an out or ref parameter the parameter becomes an alias for the variables

2327568
templating	jinja2	wtforms	jinja2	werkzeug	jinja2	werkzeug	wtforms
this is probably less relevant to your questions but all the functionality in django is also provided by other libs that i find to be superior jinja2 for templating it has the same syntax as django-templatess without the mess that is the templates tags systemd and better performance wtforms for forms and modelforms babel for i18n with many features not present in django s own i18n libs and werkzeug to provide a complete wsgi interface with url-routing

2327593
parentheses	braces
it can t do better even if the statement is very large that s why .when coding in c or other languages if you made some error about parentheses or braces the compiler may give totally wrong information

2327645
postback	ajax
are you looking for an ajax appraoch or does this use postback

2327666
textbox	button
what i want to do is .when a user click a button callt his methods and pass in the value of a textbox .so that the url will now be

2327696
resource-files	resx
the default type-generator for resource-files explicit uses the resx provider and won t work if you implements something like a database provider

2327714
value	field
annotating a field with in is just one half of what s required you still need the other end which supplies the value

2327717
binary-search-tree	tree
a binary-search-tree is effectively .sorted .so you just need to go through the tree inorder and get to the nth spot

2327774
delphi	c++
the most ideal solution would be to create a wrapper preferably which consumes the original source unmodified and compile that wrapper to an .obj file using c++ which then is linked into delphi where another wrapper exposes the engine via a more standards .object-pascal syntax

2327779
ip-address	hostname
i was hoping to use hostname or ip-address like .so

2327790
value	field
i am writing a unit test for a service methods that retrieves the value of this field

2327790
value	field
the service methods uses a custom dal that returns a value of string.empty if the database field is null this is desired behavior

2327790
value	field
the l2s class assign the string a value of nothing if the database field is null

2327794
directory	folder
however i would like to be able to read the content of the pda not only in its mydocument folder .so i can t use this plus it have to work with 20+ possible pda of the same model thus making 20+ directory

2327797
user-controls	ascx
further more you could make a user-controls ascx file of the textbox for more control like handling events or adding a validation for each textbox

2327840
selected	checkbox
right-click on a resource file selected get info open the targets tab and click checkbox as needed

2327844
display	width
there s a display tab width there which you can reduce to your heart s content

2327849
value	field
the new field is a boolean value called compulsory

2327851
hide	show
since they just take up visual spaces is it possible to .somehow hide these columns .so they do not show up in a database diagram in ssms or ssmse

2327854
any	set
as i m having full trust in the people there we didn t have set up any details on which license was used

2327866
associations	model

here s some code that demonstrates my problem it s in the code-behind of a windows with a labels a button and a textbox

2327940
puts	gets
i currently have a function that gets some data from the database and puts it into a dataset

2327957
xsl-fo	xslt
i m using an xslt stylesheet by antennahouse to convert xhtml to an xsl-fo file

2327960
malloc	free
always use delete if you use new and free if you use malloc

2327960
malloc	free
malloc free only deal with the memory allocation and deallocation

2327968
32-bit	64bit
but you have x64 components the drivers and difxapp uses the same ids for their 32-bit and 64bit custom actions .so they can t both co-exist in the same .msi package

2327971
annotations	mapping
but i don t see how to do this for a simple key to elements mapping and i don t see how to do this using annotations

2327982
hornetq	openmq
other stand alone jms brokers open source which can be run standalone or even embedded in your java application are open messages-queue openmq which is also include in glassfish and the new jboss hornetq messages broker which will be the jms implementation in jboss application-server

2327986
margins	padding
i found this problem in many occasions in which i was animation just the height with slidetoggle but not the margins padding

2328027
directory	folder
deleting a folder in your virtual directory may cause your application to restart thus loosing all session data

2328033
hide	show
you will notice i pass an object to my user-controls allowing it to hide or show itself display certain options etc based on permissions

2328045
contains	any
business rules mean that my upload file won t contains any accented characters .so it doesn t matter if the code accepts or rejects these

2328082
any	set
the way i have decided todo that is to set any featured rows for an object called to -1 day from now .so its no longer featured

2328090
ostream	std
i have a class in c++ which takes an std ostream as an arguments inorder to continuously output text trace information

2328117
http-headers	content-type
the language and content-type tags are best replace with http-headers if you have that option

2328127
synchronous	.when
and get notified in a synchronous fashion .when input becomes available

2328157
any	set
.so just set the maxlength to 10 and you won t have any problems like this

2328160
boolean	int
it can only handle simple types like boolean int long float and string though

2328170
imap	nntp
there are functions provided in php you might have to install the extension though imap pop3 and nntp

2328195
contains	any
.when i run the tests from within vs.net using td.net or resharper as expected the world is good however .when i run my nant building scripting to execute the tests my building output folder which containss all of the assemblies test assemblies etc does not contains any of the associated app_config files

2328213
margins	padding
this is nothing to do with margins padding fonts resets or any css really

2328230
python	java
the question basically boils down to - java or python

2328230
python	java
.so they d rather have it in java and on time than in python and late and they don t want to pressure me to do it in python if i think i can t make it on time

2328230
python	java
as in if this project would take me about 2 weeks in java or a .net language how much longer can it take me in python

2328230
python	java
and include in this question - from what i ve heard it seems to be pretty easy intuitive to switching over from java to python

2328242
display	height	display	width
with the rectangle s width and height set to auto i expected the rectangle to resize to automatically display the arrow that is draw

2328242
display	height	display	width
if i leave the width height as auto the rectangle is display as a single points as if width height 0

2328243
contains	any
deny any access to the files -- use a .htaccess contains deny from all

2328243
authentication	login
authentication the users with some login passwd field against the data stored in the database

2328243
logout	login
the advantage is that your php scripting has access to the db -- which means it can allow users to login logout it can use sessions .

2328250
python	java
.so if java would take you two weeks then python may take about 6

2328255
http	ssl	fckeditor	wysiwyg
i ve got a fckeditor wysiwyg text and html-editor control on an http ssl webpage

2328257
bean-validation	spring
the ip-address is mandatory on the object and spring combined with jsr-303 bean-validation will give a validation error unless it is there

2328263
filtering	sorting
the new logger only consisted of a single python file which provided a bug list with sorting and filtering options and a submit page

2328275
python	java
python is like baby java you ll pick it up in a breeze

2328278
ip-address	proxy
here s a blog-post about that nginx proxy to apache - access remote hosts ip-address using mod_praf

2328284
artifactory	nexus
maybe overkill if you re the only one working on the project but i d recommend installing a maven repository manager like artifactory or nexus

2328284
artifactory	nexus
i m not familiar with nexus but artifactory installation is dead simple - just unzip and you re good to go since it comes with an embedded-jetty

2328294
decimal	hex
would it be better to just go back to an old comp sci assignment for base conversions and convert the decimal value into hex using a lookup table to add the appropriate next hexit to the string

2328309
value	field
even if you only put in an int in the price field for a product it converts it to decimal as the price attributes itself is a decimal value

2328312
http	ssl
you are getting the warning because the scripting are not being loaded via a ssl link http just regular http

2328315
ostringstream	std
create a std ostringstream and printing them to it just like you could to cout

2328326
initializer	getter
i m aware of two basic techniques the first being that you set up all cmd properties inside the constructor the second being you initializer the cmd lazily inside a properties getter

2328330
python	java
well i would say how fast you pick up python also depends on what other languages you know or comfortable apart from java

2328330
python	java
if the only language you know is java then i don t think the switching from java to python would be intuitive or smooth

2328330
python	java
to start with java is statically typed and python is dynamically typed and it takes some time to get used to oo programming with python even if you are skilled in using oo techniques using java

2328335
realloc	malloc
if you re allocation the strings with malloc originally you might consider using realloc to resize the character arrays .so they can contains the new string

2328346
python	java
the big risk is that you will code python just like you code java

2328346
python	java
many of the things true in java are not true in python and vice versa

2328346
python	java
if you decide to try python read up on common pitfalls coming from java for example

2328348
handler	service
that is how i initializer the web service but .when i debugging the code the handler is null

2328362
checkbox	button
it adds the ability to use a free-form list but turns it into either checkbox or radio button

2328364
python	java
if you re confident the java versioning would take 2 weeks that leaves 3 weeks to flail around with the python versioning until you have to give up

2328372
value	field
the value field enter the named of

2328374
64bit	x86
i want my solutions platform to default to any cpu i believe that means that at jit time the assembly will be either x86 or 64bit based on the machine that loaded it

2328386
memset	calloc
contains such gem of nearly-forgotten wisdom like as mentioned above there is a null-pointers for each pointers types and the internal value of null-pointerss for different typess may be different. which means that calloc or memset are not a portable initialization for pointerss

2328408
arguments	default
it should work because we have provided a default templates arguments but it does nt compiler gives the following error

2328411
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and .when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2328430
python	java
i d say if you want to avoid possible headaches do it in java and learn python at home by trying to recreate a similar application to the one you do at work if you want something which feels real

2328445
communication	messages
my question is this given the vendor code initializer its own connection thread should i still put all my remote communication code parsing events updating the model sending messages back to the remote .app in an explicit separate thread to the code that initializer the gui

2328445
callback	methods
the vendor libs will start its own thread and eventually will callback a given methods on your code

2328462
document-database	couchdb
we replace a postgresql database with a couchdb document-database because not having a fixed schema was a strong advantage to us

2328467
enumerator	any
you can use it in any ruby versioning with required backports 2.0.0 enumerator lazy-evaluation

2328473
triggers	insert
if you store the totals you need triggers to ensure that updatess deletes and insert all correctly updates the totals

2328480
display	width
float will not break the document flow -- also it will positioning any elements it uses the best it can fit in the containers width -- say i have 5 x 200px divs in a 800px width containers the last 5th will go in a newline below the other ones -- using positioning relative will make you need to calculate .when it needs to break yourself and it won t break correctly since the display will either be block and go over the whole width or it will be inline-block or inline which won t rendering the same way for divs as block would and would pretty much mess up the document flow layout

2328485
arguments	default
firstly function-templatess do not support default templates arguments only class templatess do

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i ve seen how collision is detected in the colliding mice example where it uses a qgraphicsscene to draw the qgraphicsitem mice on and scene - collidingitems this to see which mice are colliding

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
the problem is that the fridge magnets example uses a class that inherited qwidget in-place of qgraphicsscene .so there s no collidingitems methods to checked .when we have a collision

2328491
hash	md5
for the fastest verbatim searches you should store a md5 hash of the title in a binary 16 column create a unique-index over it disabling the key compression and search for the hash

2328497
contains	elements
i know the datagridtemplatecolumn does not contains a datacontext but i don t feel like this should be the cause of the problem .when i m giving it the elements and path to bind to

2328508
deterministic	theory
although it s mostly legal to initializer a gui in your main thread everything up to the setvisible true --in theory if there is any chance of a conflict from another thread invokelater will take care of it all in a very deterministic way

2328518
python	java
having said that i think java and python are similar enough that you might trim that a bit

2328518
python	java
however if there are parts that can be cleanly separated out and done in python maybe you could do some parts in java and other parts in python

2328519
textbox	button
for example i have a textbox inside a groupbox which exhibits the discrepancy but a button inside the same groupbox does not

2328539
arguments	default
page events and control events are both missing and impossible to guess what the default arguments list is

2328547
double	int
string is defined as a standards types just like int double float etc

2328550
firefox	safari
try using a different browser firefox safari konqueror or ignore that your div isn t partially transparency until the fix comes

2328556
malloc	free
new delete are types safe whereas malloc free are not

2328556
malloc	free
this means that pointers returned by malloc and free are void-pointers that need to be cast to the correct types

2328556
malloc	free
new delete implicit support arrays allocation and deletion using the and syntax using meta-data supplied by the compiler malloc free do not support this syntax

2328556
malloc	free
applying new delete to a class types t will call the constructor and destructor respectively of t malloc free do not call the constructor and destructor of t

2328556
malloc	free
the same holds for memory allocated using malloc which should be free using free

2328569
temporary	copy
it might also have to copy the new piece of string if it s a temporary pointers

2328569
memmove	memcpy
but anything under about 8 kb is faster to handle with memmove and memcpy

2328573
arguments	default
as gf and andreyt already wrote you can t have default templates arguments with function-templatess

2328573
arguments	default
however if you turn your comparator into function-object you can still use default function arguments

2328579
mouseover	mouseout	default	reset
.so i would imagine that you can simply do that on mouseover and reset back to your default on mouseout

2328587
versioning	upgrade
i am running versioning 2.8.4a and will try to upgrade to latest release hoping this will fix things

2328588
.when	ready
the general approach will be to put a placeholder where you want them and then move them into that placeholder .when they are ready

2328610
configuration	environment	expression	evaluation	environment	execution
for non-constant expression expression that are evaluated at runtime that are not enclosed by any checked or unchecked operators or statements the default overflow checked context is unchecked unless external factors such as compiler switches and execution environment configuration call for checked evaluation

2328622
attributes	properties
note this required that you create subclassing for your managed object .so you can access the attributes and relationships as properties on your object

2328653
hyperlink	embed
can you create a hyperlink or an embed tag that will display a specified page section of a pdf document

2328658
python	java
assuming it can really be done in python and java

2328658
python	java
learn the difference between java and python and see which one applies better to the problem

2328658
python	java
as another answer put it python is very simple and .so is java and almost every common language out there

2328668
locale	hebrew	right-to-left	hebrew
did you change it yourself or is it a posting issue you are using right-to-left locale such as hebrew or arabic

2328686
defined	declare
you need to declare the contants in the header and then defined them in one of your code files

2328686
defined	declare
make sure they are declare in a header that is include by everyone that needs them and make sure they are defined exactly once

2328696
defined	declare
also you shouldn t defined constants in header-files only declare them

2328697
contains	set
i also have an arrays of length n that contains a set of weight that dictate how i would like to linearly combine all the arrayss

2328699
controllers	routes
i tried creating a new controllers for it called manage but i m having a hard time with routes

2328713
hide	show
strangely as opposed to show methods hide can revert hardcode visible styles with no problem

2328713
hide	show
.so to hide show elements as intended i either have to use hide show methods combo without no visibility styles hard-coding or use css methods of jquery and set the visibility styles as desire

2328716
hide	show
i have some very simple jquery hide show logic called on a change in selected list value in a drupal form

2328724
put	get
is it possible via tortoisesvn to know the svn rev numbers you are about to get prior to a commit .so that i can put that rev# into the .source code comment section

2328739
put	get
i put everything in comments to finaly get to that conclusion

2328739
value	field
.when i renamed properties or renamed the value of the field named in a input tag

2328741
private-key	rsa
i m encrypting the text using the rsa engine and the private-key file from a streamreader

2328757
authentication	login
authentication will be done by comparing user login with passwd to database

2328774
revision	svn
svn special keyword - specifically revision

2328776
shell	bash
on the unix machines i write out a bash shell scripting that contains something like this

2328780
any	set
obviously any discussion of how best to generator the set would depend on that

2328780
any	set
certainly you only need to compare any points to its neighbours and only if they re already in the set which will save you a huge numbers of comparisons

2328836
arrays	loops
what s tripping me up is whether to use recursion or an imperative loopsing construct like loops through sorted arrays and see if an item is the same one that preceded it and then if it matches checked the one before it etc

2328857
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there s no such notion as controls in an asp.net-mvc application as it is in a webforms application

2328870
output	mode
open output file streaming in write mode

2328884
contains	set
the table exists - that is it s materialize as a table at least in memory which contains the result set and can be reused

2328890
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
2010-02-24 21 19 55.595 simpledrilldown 97651 207 terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - loginviewcontroller pushviewcontroller animated unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x190d8a0

2328900
wcf-configuration	wcf
.so if you are hosting your wcf in different execution contexts that is test with a con.sole application and deploy with a ws you need to make sure you have wcf-configuration data move over to the proper .config file

2328908
build-process	release
the build-process runs and vs says that everything was successful but .when i go into . x64 release the only file that is there is test.dll.intermediate.manifest which is just a bunch of xml code

2328912
solaris	linux
these dump were taken from an ase 12.5 instances located on a solaris sparc and i m trying to load these dump in to an ase 12.5 instances located on linux x86

2328926
python	java	python	ruby
for simplicity s sake assume an oo language is being used ruby python java c# et al

2328936
bindingsource	dataview
this works .when the bindingsource is a dataview

2328946
constructor	object	value	field
from the msdn article on c# field a field can be given an initial value by using the assignment-operator .when the field is declared...field are initializer immediately before the constructor for the object instances is called.

2328948
haskell	ocaml
learning some functional language like haskell or ocaml would help in intellectual enrichment and will teach you new ways in which you can tackle the problems

2328970
constructor	object
for an object of non-pod class types clause 9 before the constructor begins execution and after the destructor finishes execution referring to any non-static member or base-class of the object results in undefined-behavior

2328977
constructor	object
isn t foo using a default intrinsics constructor with the initialisation list invoking that default-constructor automatically to initializer the object

2328978
postback	ajax
if you want to get rid of the flicker from the auto postback you could also use an ajax updatepanel to make things seamless to the user

2328989
directory	folder
files should be downloading into a specific directory if you are concerned with other accessing this file you should do a deny from all in a .htaccess in that folder

2329012
exception-handling	try-catch
if you really don t care think hard about this one and only need to note the exception-handling then wrapping in try-catch blocks make perfect sense

2329019
variables	boolean
variables instead of variables true or variables false for regular boolean

2329057
communication	messages
for my project i m mostly concerned with communication with hardware over unreliable links such as rs-232 .so error detection and messages framing techniques are of particular interest to me though a general treatment of the topic would be excellent

2329060
arrays	map
doing in-place updates rather than creating new arrays with each application of map map2 and reduce would be more efficient

2329067
duplicates	elements
it would understand how the elements nest in relation to each other and have other restrictions it would treat the user-defined value like enums to prevent typos and prevent duplicates questiontype s per subjecttype

2329143
queue	fifo
you can do this iteratively by using a brainfuck search or applied to a matrix the lee algorithm which can be efficiently implements using a fifo queue which i describe how to do here change floodfill-algorithm to get voronoi territory for two data points

2329143
queue	fifo
basically all checked stay the same just that you use a fifo queue to hold your states instead of an implicit stack

2329204
exponent	modulo
the main problem i have is that i have been supplied the exponent and modulo as an nsdata object and i need to then convert them to a seckeyref object inorder to perform the rsa encryption

2329350
malloc	free
hence the reason you don t want to mix malloc free with new delete

2329352
handler	service
with the rest starter kit you are limited to having a .svc file but if you implements your own handler you can parsing the request manually and have much more granular control over the restful service

2329357
constructor	private
item 4 in effective-java provides this idiom however it does not add that the class should be made final as it would be impossible to subclassing it anyway with a private constructor

2329357
constructor	private
and there it is explicit recommended that the private constructor be documented to avoid exactly the confusion you are having

2329401

2329452
push	pull
i can control the push pull but i haven t seen a way to actually prevent repo from being visible in the hgwebdir cgi application

2329454
put	get
sometimes this is referred to as a viewmodel class and generally contains nothing more than several string properties that the user-interface layer can get from and put to directly without worry of validation

2329469
attributes	properties
to use this with simple savant i d have to put attributes above the class declaration and properties - domainname person above the class and itemname above the id properties

2329469
attributes	properties
i want to be able to use my existing simple class - without having attributes on the properties etc.

2329476
service-locator	inject
you d better create manually unity-container and inject it into your service-locator

the thought behind this is that i want to keep the store around inorder to preserve the column sorting and filtering but destroy the grid inorder to save on memory

2329482
filtering	sorting
is column sorting and filtering kept intrnally on the gridpanel object or on the store object

2329504
callback	methods
and a callback to a static methods is written like this

2329523
callback	methods

sqlplus	prompt
prefer to use set colsep in sqlplus prompt instead of editing col named one by one

2329529
interpreter	runtime
java a statically typed language is compiled to jvm-bytecode which was interpreter on older versioning of the jvm whereas it now uses just in time jit compilation meaning machine-code is generator at runtime

2329539
firebird	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	mysql
the current versioning already has to deal with sqlite and sql-server compact and i d like to experiment with support for other systemd like mysql firebird and .so on

2329658
any	set
which worked fine in asp.net-mvc 1 using tryupdatemodel in that any text entries that had no text in them would be set to a blank string in asp.net-mvc 2 rc2 apparently at least from my testing it sets them to null nothing

2329664
hash	md5	salt	md5
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

2329666
mouseover	mousedown
the problem is .when 2 items are positioning .so that the labels of one is above the icons of another in the z-index .so that the labels eats any mouseover and mousedown events

2329668
reflection	runtime
that is you can send any messages to a target using ordinary language syntax without programming against a reflection api receive only a warning at compile-time that it might not be handled and receive an exception-handling only at runtime if the target doesn t respond to that selector which is like a method-signature

2329669
versioning	upgrade
my solution was to upgrade the versioning of tinymce that i was using

2329678

oracle	mysql
look at it this way regardless of what oracle says the fact remains that they could decide to do something bad with mysql at any time

2329681
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
since you ve indicated that you re happy working with either one i say go with postgresql for new project and don t worry about converting existing project unless and until oracle does something with mysql that gives you cause for concern

2329715
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
try creating an object to bind to and instead of using datagridtemplatecolumn use datagridtextcolumn and datagridcomboboxcolumn and the editing should be as you expected

2329868
default-value	default
does default-value actually set default value

2329889
pbkdf2	scrypt
we estimate that on modern 2009 hardware if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 time greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt to find the same passwd and 20000 time greater than a similar attack against pbkdf2

linux	bsd
linux and bsd

2329904
fwrite	fread

this form will be used by multiple users at a time and i would like to have it .so .when .someone has selecteded a row and is currently entering data in the form with which the row will be updates once the user hits a button on the form no one else may selected that row

2330004
delete-row	rows
is there some sort of existing functionality i can use to accomplish this or will i need to create a table that tracking which rows are unselectable and have the application query that table before selected rows ie query table to see if row is unavailable if not insert rowid user is editing then delete-row after user has submitted changes

2330024
value	field
the second is to make sure you are operating in a transactional .when comparing the value and updating the locked field

2330024
value	field
it should be noted that the checked on the locked field is very important as it allows the rowcount value to be either 0 or non-zero depending on whether or not your ids are unique which you can evaluate to false in the zero case and true in the non-zero case in your application code

2330026
constructor	private
i have a static-class with static private readonly member that s set via the class s static constructor

2330037
.when	ready
another option is to add in the maximum numbers of rows allowable into the datagridview at the start prevent the user from adding more and checked to see whether information has been entered or not .when you re ready to commit the input

2330043
textbox	button
the .app has a button and a textbox .when the button click the textbox will be set with 7 00 and then down to 0 00

2330060
any	set
if set any

2330079
contains	any
nsstrings are for text and images can contains sequences that aren t valid as text in any encoding

sql-server	oracle
yes it s raw sql underneath and the database can be either sql-server or oracle

2330105
callback	methods
in .net 2.0 and after if your background-thread has access to the synchronizationcontext for the user-interface-thread then you can call the send methods to marshalling the callback to the user-interface

2330129
private-key	rsa
a simple rsa implementation tends to leak private information through side channels especially timing in simple words computation time depends on the process data which allows an attacker to recover some possibly all of the private-key bits

2330129
private-key	rsa
another points is that once you have your rsa code up and running you may begin to envision extensions and other situations what if the private-key i want to use is not in ram but in a smartcard

2330136
show	next
the ul gets populate with the results and .when there are more than pagesize results 10 in my case the next link show up

2330136

2330208
directory	folder
the nhibernate assemblies were not being properly propogated to my application s runtime directory because i was using the standards vs2008 folder structure bin debugging etc

2330214
contains	any
the common conventions is to have them in their own separate namespace usually in the form of which you can then use to decide whether or not you use them in any particular piece of code which contains types the extensions normally operate on

2330219
key-value	key
inorder to achieve my goal of having a service that can accept a completely arbitrary list of key-value pairs as a raw json string and then decide what do do with them without having to know the key named beforehand i combined casper and aaron s advice

2330223
implements	extends
if you re extends from an object or implements an interface you don t really want to be passing object like that

there are open source and commercial jpa implementation toplink-essentials eclipselink hibernate-entitymanager openjpa kodo etc and any java ee 5 or java ee 6 application-server must provide support for its use jboss uses hibernate-entitymanager glassfish v2 uses toplink-essentials by default glassfish v3 uses eclipselink by default weblogic uses kodo by default etc 1

2330292
glassfish	weblogic
it is for example possible to use hibernate instead of kodo with weblogic or instead of eclipselink with glassfish

2330317
contains	elements
one of the columns contains a cell that has input and img elements in it

2330329
qthread	qobject

my site is working fine in firefox safari google-chrome and opera but for some reason ie7 is not recognizing css padding on any anchor tags

2330373
javassist	cglib
is it still possible to force hibernate 3.3 or 3.5 to use cglib instead of javassist

2330382
logging	trace
the first thing to do is to try and isolate the performance issue down to a section of the website - is there one part of the application that see poor performance .when you find that you can increase the trace logging to see if you can see the query causing issues

2330393
show	next
on a mac the title of program which has focus is show in the top left corner of the screens next the the apple menu

2330492
meta-inf	jar
you can use it to merge disparate jar files and things like meta-inf specifications files

2330504
firefox	safari
you can see the example here best viewed in firefox or safari right now

2330507

however upon closer inspector it appears that during debugging cassini put the execution assembly and each referenced assembly into its own directory in the following location c users... appdata local temp temporary asp.net files root...

2330524
configuration	environment
the fact that you don t get this problem in your first two environment is a matter of luck not configuration

2330529
any	set
setting the target for each plist only adds it to the target building like any other file - to actually tell the .app to use a particular plist file as the plist file with relevant info you also need to set it in the target settings

2330539
mouseover	mouseout
i used bind mouseover and bind mouseout simply because that s what i m used to doing

2330543
symlink	archive
i m writing an un archiving tool and the way it is designed it first creates a regular file from the archive before it examines the special attributes and may decide that this item is a symlink in fact

2330626
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

2330631
jquery	.post
i know very well that this is an old .post but it seems that the genious people designing jquery which i figured you must be using have made the most optimal solution to your problem as i understand it

2330642
bubble-sort	quicksort
you should really use quicksort in c or std sort in c++ instead of a bubble-sort like this

2330642
c-strings	c++
if it s c++ and you take t.e.d. s advice to use std string instead of raw c-strings you don t even have to specify a comparison because the operators will be used and will do the right thing

2330653
protected	public
it should be protected or private and it should only be tested indirectly by unit-testing your public api

2330654
children	nodes
if a nodes belongs to a namespace it s children by default belong to the same namespace

2330657
filesystems	symlink
iirc the filesystems stores symlink information in the inode table and not in a regular file .so there s no direct way of turning a file into a link

2330662
symlink	unlink
you have to unlink to kill the file and then symlink to create a symlink as a replacement

2330681
contains	elements
it appears contains just gives the elements that contains the text and not the string itself

2330683
required	checked
also required field are checked with javascript

2330688
required	checked
my current solution is to just let the field be required and free form then before i save their .profile checked to see if fedex will return a quote

2330697
any	set
the initializer and pre-configuration of this delegation has to happens-before any properties are set on the task

2330733
spaces	output
c++ - o n time o 1 spaces and the output is sorted

2330736
png	gif

32-bit	64bit
device drivers designed for the 64bit versioning of windows won t work on computers running a 32-bit versioning of windows

2333120
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
we ll assuming your talking about amd64 em64t x86_64 and x86 for 64bit and 32-bit respectively

2333120
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86	virtualization	vmware
you can run amd64 code on x86 processor only by emulation qemu or some kinds of virtualization i believe vmware might support 64bit guest os on 32-bit hosts os on 64

2333120
32-bit	64bit
as you re developing the application it shouldn t be too hard to develop both 32-bit and 64bit building of your code

2333120
32-bit	64bit
for mac you can ship a single binary that has both types of code in it or mac osx can run your 64bit binary on a 32-bit kernel only on a x86_64 capable processor though

2333120
binaries	install
for windows and linux you ll either have to ship separate install or ship some smart install that selected the correct binaries at install time

2333122
difference	count
could anybody points me please what the difference is between making functor of set insert and set count in the below fragment

2333136
32-bit	64bit
the terms 32-bit and 64bit refer to

2333136
32-bit	64bit
understand the difference between 32-bit and 64bit and you will see why it s not possible

2333139
double	int
i have a with dynamic value from an enum like string int double bool datetime

2333139
checkbox	textbox
i want a checkbox for bool textbox for string calendar for datetime etc

2333143
versioning	upgrade
as the later one is an upgrade versioning you will only need to learn new features introduced with it like

2333143
versioning	migrate
for instances if you are using .net 4.0 later on .when versioning 4.5 or 5.0 comes in you are not going to migrate

2333169
32-bit	64bit
in terms of actual timing numbers this will depend on 32-bit versus 64bit how much memory you have how large the files are the access pattern s and to a large extent the types of physical disk hardware

2333193
response	timeout
looking at the http traffic the response is a 504 gateway timeout

2333198
getter	setter
one of the field is called images with only getter and no setter

2333207
any	set
uiimageview by default has userintegrationenabled set to no .so scrolling or any integration wouldn t work by default as a subviews of uiimageview

2333211
hide	show
essentially .when you click on this button it either show or hide the tab control which contains status messages and resize the form to fit the remaining controls shrink or grow

2333212
ms-access	mysql
db ms-access this is just for trying things out at first intend to shift to mysql

2333216
any	set
can you set a breakpoints in updateprogress and see anything in any of e s properties

2333217
hide	show
one way to do this is to create the controls all together and show hide the ones required depending on selectedvalue dynamically

2333270
calayer	uiview
it starts with calayer display and from within that methods uiview drawrect is called to be precise first uiview drawlayer layer incontext context is called and from within this methods uiview drawrect is called

2333270
calayer	uiview
how does the calayer display methods obtain the context of uiview

2333270
calayer	uiview
which is used in uiview drawlayer layer incontext context within calayer display methods

2333297
order	add
literally if you are on the order page you would be allowed to add a new customer to the systemd on this page as well and then associate it with that order

2333307
equals	getter	getter	setter
in our legacy java ee application there are loads of value object vo classes which typically contains only getter and setter maybe equals and hashcode

2333314
hide	show
just add a code to resize the form every time the show hide details button is click

2333327
symbolic-computation	maxima
this page maxima for symbolic-computation should get you started â downloading installing a few examples and then points out additional resources to guide you on your way including a quick cmd reference cheat sheet and some guidlines for writing your own scripting

2333328
radio-button	selected
recently i worked in a project where i used 5 radio-button to selected a page numbers

2333330
spring	jsf
my project jsf richfaces spring works fine with glassfish v2 + jdk6u17

2333336
required	checked
this is for a website i use to have a pageview backend db layer where pageview call the backend every backend public function checked if the user meets the required authority then call the db or any other code

2333336
required	checked
the function that required mod privileges goes into moduser which inherited from normaluser which is nice and i now only checked if the user is authentication once instead of many time the result is only fetch from the db the first time .so speed didnt improve

2333349
export	report
it uses itext behind the scene to export report to pdf

2333351
value	field
in one example you re comparing the value of field to the numeric value 1 and in the other you re comparing it to a string 1 a one character string that contains the text 1

2333373
firefox	opera
i know the above works fine on firefox and opera and it does not work on ie6 surprise surprise

2333380
value	field
the maximum value of php s int might be smaller than the types of the field definition

2333382
nserror	nsurl
- void parsexmlfileaturl nsurl url parseerror nserror error

2333382
callback	methods
set self as the delegation of the parsing .so that it will receive the parsing delegation methods callback

2333390
expression	brackets
this won t work for parameters that contains function-calls or other uses of parentheses - the balanced brackets matching problem isn t solveable using regular expression

2333392
any	set
but .when i used it as a html file it is display the image.should i set any url in settings.py for this

2333411
value	field
note that i m only setting the passwd field because the username and domain field are pre-populated with the information already stored in the registry the identity value mentioned in my original question

2333420
qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview
i am creating a subclassing of qabstractitemmodel to be display in an qtreeview

2333420
qabstractitemmodel	qmodelindex
my index and parent function creates the qmodelindex using the qabstractitemmodel inherited function createindex and providing it the row column and data needed

2333423
value	field
a typical way to achieve this is to generator the hash value for an object contains n independent field as an n -digit numbers with a base big enough to hold the different hash value for the individual field

2333423
value	field
of course the concrete base depends on what value can your field take - i have no info about that.

2333425
value	field
if the value of the field is null return 0

2333444
bluetooth	usb
a linux server is connect to a bluetooth usb dongle for receiving data from embedded sensor devices in the lab and a siemens tc35 gsm modem via a rs232 serial link

2333456
specifications	w3c
w3c css specifications explains how css selector should works there is a div.warning and e#myid which are not exactly like yours but suggest it should work maybe it s explain in the page i didn t read it all

2333481
traversal	parent
what we do here is basically traversal all the ancestry of the current object and append the slug on the go replace the getparent by whatever methods you use to retrieve an object s parent

2333500
put	get
it must get a default price from somewhere else not in this table and it must also get an overrides price from this table and put the two pieces of information together

2333508
version-control	git
i m using maven for building and git for version-control

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and .when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
at the moment the .when mouseover the cycle stops but does not selected the correct item once i mouseout then mouseover again the functionality works perfectly

2333520
value	field
maybe making the field unique will help this way mysql will checked the value

2333522
export	csv
in my ruby-on-rails application admin can export the user data into csv format

2333566
malloc	free
the c libs then manages these pages and maintains lists of what is free and what is allocated giving the user addresses of these blocks .when asked to with malloc

2333566
malloc	free
this area may contains garbage or it contains other malloc d memory it may contains the memory used for stack variables or it may even contains the memory used by the c libs to manage the lists of free allocated memory

2333566
malloc	free
corruption of the c-library s malloc free management memory causing crash .when malloc or free are called

2333566
malloc	free
malloc free and pointers are very fragile in c and to a slightly lesser degree in c++ and it is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot accidentally

2333581
export	csv
you would be much better off export the .profile photos as a set of pngs and save the filename in the csv file against each recording

2333588
xsd	xml
but to use jaxb you need to have the xsd for this xml file

2333617
where-clause	sql	selected	textbox
for example only add a where-clause to the sql if the user has entered something into the textbox otherwise just a simple selected

2333645
one-to-many	entity
except the image entity have location entity one-to-many relation named location relation and userbase have image relation instead of userspecial

2333649
contains	any
admittedly it s a little silly to use the curlies in this case but the block can contains any arbitrary expression in particular subscript expression

2333649
parentheses	braces
if they were though you could use parentheses instead of braces

2333662
selected	button
selected the image that you put recently in button attributes and selected button size by ctrl+3

2333677
value	field
at the moment the search is very poor - you can take time to set up searches and specify which field you want to search on which value to filtering by perhaps by an analyst or category etc but this takes time and more often than not it returns poor results and it would have been easier to try and tracking it down yourself manually

2333703
rendering	redraw
i think that the animation continue but the rendering systemd will realize that the rectangle is invisible and will not waste time redraw anything

2333706
logout	login
just make sure you re consistent see login logout vs sign in sign out vs login sign out â a short roundup

2333710
logout	login
i ve switched to using sign in sign out sign up for my own apps on the basis that it s slightly less technical language than login logout

2333712
contains	any
but since the graphing is connect there are nodes o1 and o2 on each of these paths such that the path between them o1--o2 doesn t contains any other nodes on these two paths

2333713
zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	codeigniter	codeigniter	symfony
if you want to do it your own way you can try symfony codeigniter expressionengine is building using codeigniter or zend-framework

2333720
any	set
the program invoked inherited the calling process s pid and any open file descriptors that are not set to close on execute

2333720
any	set	default	reset
any signals set to be caught by the calling process are reset to their default behavior

2333722
switching	screens
but anyway i think you should show dialog or switching view in second screens

2333752
usb-flash-drive	floppy
boot device can be a usb-flash-drive a floppy drive or a hard disk

2333758
default-value	default
there is no way to specify the default-value - it is always value construct by the default zero parameter constructor

2333762
object-reference	instances
while trying to set the value of the employee class with the following code i m getting the error messages object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2333767
contains	elements
i get an error the format of a configsource file must be an elements contains the named of the section that highlight the second line 2nd example code

2333783
contains	elements
if you want the arrays to actually contains construct test elements then you can use this code

2333797
default-value	default
wrap the map in your own class that provides a default-value and implements to insert that default

2333808
contains	any
also the identifier must follow the same naming rules as any other labels in php it must contains only alphanumeric characters and underscore.js.js and must start with a non-digit character or underscore.js

2333837
decimal-point	digits
but you re specifying to use 20 digits after the decimal-point which surely doesn t match the description

2333848
python	c++
doesn t work in python code called from c++ embedding

2333851
python	perl
i need to rewrite some perl code in python

2333867
firefox	opera	mathml	xhtml
a browser is not the right tool if you want to debugging xslt that transforms xml to xml unless it is a browser like firefox or opera and your target xml format is a format like svg or mathml or xhtml the browser knows to rendering

2333867
contains	any
and in your case you do not even have any text nodes that contains non white spaces characters .so there is nothing to display

2333879
append	input
the below is a piece of code i use to append data to my output streaming but input should be very similar

2333883
elementtree	lxml
elementtree or lxml

2333883
beautifulsoup	elementtree	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	lxml
no direct equivalent but beautifulsoup and lxml can parsing and elementtree and lxml can generator

genshi	mako	jinja2	genshi	jinja2	mako
genshi jinja2 mako cheetah and too many others

2333886
esapi	owasp
not built-in but checkout the owasp esapi filtering it should do what you re looking for and more

2333886
security	owasp
it is a great open source security libs written by the smart guys girls at owasp open web application security project

2333893
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the big difference is you re leaning the classes the lifecycle whether it be asp.net-mvc or webforms or whatever

2333895
getter	setter
the conventions you are referring to is to adopt an anemic-domain-model as opposed to rich domain model where entities are simple pojos annotations as beans entity with just the bare minimum in terms of getter and setter

2333904
swing	swt
essentially the two apis you ll need are jdbc and swing or an alternative such as swt

2333918
difference	zero
embedded carriage returns and whitespace in data_defaults and check-constraint definitions may be highlight as difference even though they have zero effect on the schema

2333925
google-chrome	firefox
using either google-chrome or firefox + firebug you have a right click + inspect elements option that s great for cases like this i recommend either combinations

2333939
contains	elements
i have a xml that has .so many elements and most of that contains attributes

2333942
google-chrome	firefox
edit the following works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

i have my program written in c++ and it is can be successfully compiled on ubuntu 9.04 with g++ 4.3.4 and solaris os with g++ 3.4.3

2333952
versioning	upgrade
now i have upgrade my ubuntu to versioning 9.10 and g++ to versioning 4.4.1

2333957
anonymous-function	function-call
you need to wrap your function-call in an anonymous-function

2333963
domain-object	repository
domain service encapsulates business-logic that doesn t naturally fit within a domain-object and are not typical crud operations - those would belong to a repository

2333981
realloc	free
.when you call realloc as you have you throw away the new address and there s a good chance that the old address has now been free

2333981
realloc	free
the reason realloc returns a new address is because expansion of the buffering may necessitate it being move if that current block is surrounded in the memory arena in other words it can t just expand into a free block following it

2333981
realloc	free
keep in mind that realloc doesn t have to return a new pointers it may give you the same pointers if for example there was enough free spaces after the block to satisfy the new size or if you re reducing the size

2333981
realloc	malloc
that s because realloc null 7 is identical to malloc 7 - realloc is perfectly capable of starting with a null-pointer

2333990
multiple-languages	locale
i am talking specifically of supporting your own software s user-interface in multiple-languages and locale

2333998
xsd	xml
what is the difference between extensible markup xml and xml schema xsd

2334003
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
using 3-tier i was execution this query in data-access-layer i want to call this query in applicationlayer throgh business-logic-layer

2334009
xsd	xml
actually the xsd is xml itself

2334009
xsd	xml
the xsd is not mandatory for any xml but it assures that the xml could be used for some particular purposes

2334020
pdf	xmp
i have a pdf with some meta data in xmp xml format attached to the end

2334020
contains	any
also i can only rely on third party libs if they don t contains any p invoke stuff etc.

2334035
selected	checkbox
this solution also works on windows 7 with visual-studio 2008 32-bit versioning where in the 5th step you just need to selected the checkbox in the last grouping box privileges level for run this program as an administration

2334041
hide	show
i need to set up jquery to cycle through tables making sure it show hide the right one

2334047

2334115
64bit	x86
wpf application run as 64bit process on 64bit os unless compiled specifically to target only x86 just like any other .net application

2334132
put	get
to get a has one relationship you would put the addressid on the the persontable

2334172
32-bit	64bit
i looked up some of my old notes from .when i was studying some of the difference of running our product with a 64bit building versus a 32-bit building

2334172
32-bit	64bit
thus a comparison of a 32-bit building versus 64bit on a 64bit machine has value

2334192
.when	ready
it s a simple tree of display object and .when the .app is ready i

2334194
32-bit	64bit
sizeof int 4 if the int is 32-bit 8 if it s a 64bit

2334202
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
i don t know the inner workings of gmail s keyboard event capturing but i recently wrote a simple keyboard shortcut navigator .so i don t have to use the mouse to click links for google-chrome

2334232
powerpc	arm
you don t say if this is for powerpc intel or arm which makes a difference

2334234
heuristics	greedy
usually heuristics are used in the .so called greedy algorithms

2334241
ignore-case	equals
these two representations are equals for all purposes and the culture-aware string comparisons in the .net will correctly identify them as equals with either the currentculture or the invariantculture with or without ignore-case

2334241
hashtable	sorted
if there are many cases to be compared and performance is an issue then the option describe above could be replace with a sorted dictionary or hashtable

2334246
ip-address	hostname
http works by first resolving the hostname to an ip-address if required then by passing the hostname or ip-address if no hostname was given .when it connect to that ip-address

2334255
selected	button
i would like to know how can i use jquery to selected multiple items without having to press the shift button on my keyboard in a simple html dropdown elements

2334257
proof-of-correctness	heuristics
a heuristics has no proof-of-correctness often involves random elements and may not yield optimal results

2334258
contains	set
while an algorithm is a methods contains finite set of instructions used to solving a problem

2334263
haxe	mxml
my advice is learn flex focusing strongly on mxml or learn haxe

2334271
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
it may be a long way away but consider some years in to the future where 64bit os and cpus are ubiquitous consider how 16-bit fade away .when 32-bit took over

2334271
32-bit	64bit
if your application is 32-bit and all your competitors have move on to 64bit by then your application could be seen as or accused by your competitors as out of date slower or incapable of change

2334271
32-bit	16-bit
maybe even one day support for 32-bit applications will be dropped or incomplete can windows 7 run 16-bit apps properly

2334276
selected	textbox
i am trying to add two dropdown boxes with set location .so that the user can either selected one of these location or use the textbox to input the data

2334312
event-bus	mvp
as describe in the excellent mvp tutorial i m working with history with a central valuechangelistener and an event-bus handlermanager

2334338
attributes	properties
however .when you use the debuggerdisplay attributes you can see the properties you deem most important right in the results view of the quick watch windows .when debugging code that contains collections

2334345
configuration	logging
miglayout s debugging mode could be then switched on and off declarative using logging configuration

2334357
checkbox	button
basically what i am trying to do is create a sort of console application wrapper for the dll that would create a new instances of the dll s form and then make certain checkbox checked and click certain button

2334360
while-loop	cursor
you should be able to do this using a while-loop instead of a cursor

2334379
put	get
however depending on the device used by the phone you may be able to get the systemd to put it into monitor mode if you have root access

2334381
one-to-many	entity
you just have to create the middle entity and do two one-to-many relations

2334392
panels	grid
.so basically you have a grid at the top and at the bottom you have the details for whatever item you selected in the grid appearing in a panels

2334392
value	field
i did not want the user to be able to accidentally change the value in the field .so i went with labels

2334392
keyboard	mouse
however now there are some users saying they need to be able to selected a part of the item in the labels say the first 3 characters or the last 2 using the mouse or keyboard

2334392
selected	textbox
.so sure it s a textbox and you cannot edit it but you cannot copy selected from it either

2334408
selected	textbox
selected items in the listview i want the textbox text properties to be updates

2334409
hash	md5
as a repository contains more than the artifacts poms the metadata md5 and sha1 hash files... deploying means not only copying the artifacts but making sure all this information is correctly updates

2334429
google-chrome	firefox
or .when your user install google-chrome import their bookmarks from firefox that pointed to particular spots inside your webapp and suddenly the bookmarks don t work as they did before

2334439
attributes	properties
to get a strongly typed view you can either use the prompt from the vs asp.net-mvc tools and right click on an action and choose create a strongly-typed view then selected the proper business object to act as your model or you can directly alter a page by changing it s page directive s inherited attributes to system.web.asp.net-mvc.viewpage where somemodel is the model that implements the list properties and is the model that will be bound to the page

2334440
right-to-left	hebrew

input-field	textarea
i have some modules i made that have input-field in the admin- system- configuration section and iâ d like to get the new editor to show on the textarea there but i can t find where they are defined

2334447
pointers	stack
normally the c compiler output code which stores in a conventional register ebp on x86 a pointers to stack frame for the function

2334447
32-bit	x86
in some situations this can yield a slight performance increase mostly due to reduced code footprint that s better for caching and to the extra available register especially on x86 in 32-bit mode which is notoriously starved on registers

2334461
put	get
i put my sqlite file in the assets folder and i write a dao calss to get data from database but the information from log.e means i can not open the database

2334468

the client recently was forced to upgrade the machine on which this application ran to windows 7 from windows-xp

2334536
python	ruby
in a nutshell i need to translation the following ruby code into python

2334542
spaces	output
a big advantage to using these functions is that if you decide to change the format of your numbers leading 0 s padding spaces octal output long longs whatever you will not overrun your memory

2334545
attributes	properties
i want to implements an attributes for our busines.sobject-properties that takes a delegation and the needed parameters for that one .so that i can work with reflection read out the attributes and perform a validation on the properties value

2334571
compare-and-swap	atomicity
afaik you need either an atomicity compare-and-swap instruction or you need to be able to disable interrupts

2334572
webforms	asp.net
it uses asp.net webforms bunch of jquery-plugins and whatnot

internet-explorer	firefox
i got that effect using jquery fadein but i lose the transparency of the div just on internet-explorer 7 8 on firefox it works fine

2334592
value	field
then insert-into your audit table the value from the table-variable add a field to the audt table .so you can mark the recording as rollback and possibly one for the error message.

2334601
toolbar	tabs
it allows you to write text to and read text from a windows without the windows having any other user-interface google-chrome such as toolbar menus tabs etc

2334612
jquery	.post
in the event it s something like a .post with a code line in the jquery libs you can navigate the callstack within the firebug plugins to try and figure out where the initial javascript call is being invoked

2334625
instances	private
you need to supply the bindingflags to get a particular instances s private contents

2334626

malloc and free rely on rather complex dynamically built structures

2334627
64bit	x86
i am trying to access a dll located in the c program files x86 folder in a 64bit processor pc

2334644
javascript	dom
there should be a significant performance boost since you aren t using javascript dom to cycle through all the elements

2334648
submitchanges	datacontext
the submitchanges methods of the datacontext will throw a changeconflictexception if the row was changed since linq-to-sql fetched the row

2334651
drupal	django
we would need to know a lot more specifics about your setup inorder to really answer this question but it sounds like at a basic level all you need to do is use drupal to modify another database the one django s using and possibly redirect to the django .app

2334651
drupal	django
possibly redirect to a page in your django .app depending on if the redirect is needed or if the user can stay within drupal

any idea what the correct annotations would be for doing this mapping

2334746
any	set
any ideas on how to set up mapping for these tables and corresponding

2334754
distutils	ctypes
i m abusing distutils to compile an extension module for python but rather than using the python-c-api i m using ctypes to talk to the resulting shared libs

2334757
json	xml
while the backend handle the authentication security and the business-logic and send or receive only json or xml messages

2334765
abstract	extends
then in each module impl a and impl b you create a test that extends the abstract test and call the test methods defined in the tests module

2334770
attributes	properties
you must retain object for later use defined properties with retain attributes instead of assign and not forget to release your ivars in dealloc methods

2334786
selected	button
selected location for the same and click on ok button

2334786
selected	button
step 3 in new cloud service project windows selected asp.net web role and click on button and say ok

2334786
web-config	app-config
step 16 make sure that your web-config or app-config does not contains malformed xml

retain around each of these assignment expression or switching the attributes in the properties declaration to be retain instead of assign

2334888
user-controls	ascx
is it possible to use a templatefield or any field from a gridview inside a user-controls ascx

2334891
sniffing	traffic
but as slaks noted this won t prevent traffic sniffing

2334891
sniffing	traffic
to add sniffing deterrence you ll want to encrypt traffic to your subversion server

2334903
display	width
haven t tried for width because i either set width in pixels or not at all and let display block

2334903
font-size	width	text-align	font-size	text-align	width
text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font-size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better

2334930
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
therefore we get the next elements and show it by removing the hide class months.eq curr .removeclass hide

2334934
user-controls	itemtemplate
one put your user-controls into the itemtemplate footertemlate of the templatecolumn

2334942
expression	evaluation
this makes it perfectly legal as long as the temporary object is alive which is till the end of evaluation of the full expression

2334943
genetic-algorithm	heuristics
a good example is where you have a very hard read np-complete problem you want a .solution for but don t have the time to arrive to it .so have to use a good enough .solution based on a heuristics algorithm such as finding a .solution to a travelling salesman problem using a genetic-algorithm

2334963
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
alternativeley you can just add multiple treeview within the hierarchicaldatatemplate and specify indiviual binding for that each treeview

2334977
google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 532.2 khtml like gecko google-chrome 4.0.221.6 safari 532.2

2334986
silverlight	wpf
the most modern way to do gui programming on windows is wpf or even silverlight

2334996
constructor	object
for example you could make a static timer object and add a tick handler in the form constructor

2335013
android-emulator	adb
you can find the ports for running android-emulator with the adb devices cmd

2335029
environment	building
why not building a building of your embedded environment for x86 and run that in a vmware session

2335031
python	c++
you can t export c++ class to python

2335033
implements	abstract
i didn t do this with maven modules but it should be simple if you implements an abstract test case ala

2335035
temporary	copy
i create a temporary table which is a mere copy of another table the original table has a variables named that s passed as the procedure s parameter and because mysql doesn t support variables table namedd i have to create a copy - can t use the original directly

2335035
while-loop	cursor
but .when i try to fetch from the cursor in a while-loop my variables are not filled with data from the cursored table.

2335037
textmate	vim

selected	button
i want that main windows remains blocked until user selected one row in selection windows and confirm it by button

2335132
any	set
well is there any way to building a bridge between any of these blog .softwares and my .software .so that i could tell users that they can downloading marsedit for instances and then points it to url x and set it to blog .software y and then it will just work

2335151
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i see some answer using nsmutablearray wt s different between this and nsarray

2335162
pascal	delphi
both borland pascal 7 and delphi 2007 have got the procedure str which takes a numbers a length and precision and converts it to a string like this

2335162
pascal	delphi
i want to know because i am in the middle of porting some borland pascal code that uses double to delphi 2007 and .when i compare the output i get inconsistencies that result from rounding in the str procedure

2335163
primitive	int
supposing that i have a reference to an existent javascriptobject that holds a primitive types like an int value how can i get this int value

2335179
shell	bash
or you can just use the shell eg bash

2335189
silverlight	wpf
if you have very little windows development experience i would strongly suggest skipping winforms and move straight to wpf or even out-of-browser silverlight instead

2335203
getter	setter
if you have or need java styles getter and setter you can also use the beanproperty annotations

2335203
getter	setter
if you instead use the beanproperty for a val instead of a variables the setter won t be created only the getter

2335204
daemons	systemd
part of this systemd include a monitor daemons whose purpose is to take tab-separated value files turn them into xml that dazzle recognizes and pass them to dazzle for labels generator

2335214
plugins	add-on
then i found that many programmers are using the new fwk 4.0 contracts and that blew up my mind i didnâ t even know that exist .- i was trying to reinvent the wheel again.- .so there are plenty of plugins tools add-on kits frameworks etc and not everybody are aware of all of them

2335227
joomla	drupal
perfect sense but you need to possibly support a standards all of these have links to more information but basically most mainstream cmss i ve worked with drupal joomla postnuke etc all use xml-rpc and some form of blogger api

2335231
oracle	mysql
yes on mysql they may choose auto_increment and on sybase serial and on oracle sequences etc etc but from the user code points of view that one will should work on any spec-compliant implementation

2335263
arguments	default
a function if defined with a mutable attributes as a default arguments is exactly the same as a class with a static attributes that is a mutable list

2335270
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
since google-chrome does not have a separate search-box like firefox ie and safari have this functionality is required

2335287

currently we are using inno-setup as a bootstrapper to install the msi prerequisites

2335291
sql-server	mysql
are you using mysql or microsoft sql-server

2335292
automapper	nhibernate
i have two object mapped by nhibernate automapper with a manytomany relationship

2335315
dictionary	arrays
i ve had a similar problem before and it was because i was passing the arrays dictionary to the controllers from the appdelegate

2335320
put	get
i have a problem with with my output .when i write to i file i get squares .when i put endl to change line

2335324
optgroup	selected
the second selected list also needs to have optgroup in it

2335328
deployment	install
deployment wise if you have visual-studio standards edition or above you can quite simply create setup project which will take care of creating the install copying the database to the correct place on the user s machine etc

2335359
buffering	streaming
it is useful because it brings all the extensibility of std streaming s to using character bufferinging ostreamings extensibility and locale support buffering memory-management is hidden and .so on

2335359
ostringstream	std
if you want you can pass it std cerr std cout or an std ostringstream implementation i use it with a std ostringstream implementation

2335378
revision	svn
although i think this is a little too active and i tend to use either the svn revision or a overall project versioning numbers

2335392
scala	java
howwever in java scala interoperation a methods which accepts a java object will expect a scala any anyref

2335396
value	field
tested locally and the input types field gets its value set

2335398
annotations	mapping
sounds very like this bug unfortunately no fix ready using annotations seems you might get it working with xml mapping file for those classes though

2335411
logout	login
for a while i can even logout and login with previous passwd

2335416
communication	messages
lock-free communication of fixed messages between threads process processor

2335416
contains	elements
most important lesson i ve learned is that a ring buffering of can never contains more than elements

2335431
environment	building
i know that i can use different profiling in maven to perform different building tasks in different environment

2335451
value	field
one could potentially rewrite resetform to work on non-forms by manually setting value back to default-value on form field and the same with defaultchecked and defaultselected

2335458
multiplication	division
bit shifting is the same as division or multiplication by 2 n

2335466
any	bag
are there any reliable .solutions out there for generator those properties bag domain object in .net .so i don t have to write them

2335473
python	php
you need to look into server-side scripting languages such as python php and asp.net windows-server only to named a few

2335476
plugins	add-on
some of these dlls are plugins add-on extensions that are dynamically loaded using loadlibrary according to a configuration file read by the exe

2335491
communication	messages
inorder to communication with each other and get work done messages are sent between the actors

2335516
json	xml
you could use xml json html or even pass javascript to be evaluated

2335521
filehandle	eof	filehandle	seek
this way if you are too conservative about guessing .when dazzle has finished your database will still be updates in a timely manner and the only cost will be some useless seek and read call on a filehandle at eof

2335536
data-structures	tree
i ve been writing a few data-structures lately like stack linked lists binary-search tree and now hashtable

2335536
malloc	strdup
however i m not using strdup nor malloc to allocate spaces for that string

2335536
malloc	strdup
i ve always used malloc or strdup where appropriate .when handling dynamic strings or i would get lots of segmentation faults

2335543
code-generation	mygeneration
there is no solution in nhiberante for that but you can write a small scripting using mygeneration codesmith or some similar code-generation tool

2335559
put	get
what ends up happening is that all the videos get put into one list

2335564
16-bit	8bit
it has two data types varchar 8bit and nvarchar 16-bit

2335566
contains	set
initially i created the contains grid with a column set to auto in the hopes that it would fill the remaining spaces pushing the last column over to the right edges but grid columns don t really work that way

2335576
environment	execution
the design environment uses a slightly different runtime than execution the package directly .so these types of difference are not terribly uncommon

2335586
temporary	copy
store a temporary value into a specific stack slot make a copy of it onto stack use it discard it but the original copy of the temporary value stays in stack slot

2335612
web-config	app-config
i d like to avoid copying the web-config entries to an app-config in the unit-testing project as it takes extra effort to synchronized the files

2335664
localization	translation
the localization works just fine .when storing all text translation in the same file

2335665
fflush	gets
everything that is fflush to the left margins is execute .when the file gets execute

2335665
fflush	gets
.so the function is defined and its default-arguments set once .when the program gets execute because the def statement is fflush left

2335677
administration	enterprise
.net enterprise security policy administration and deployment

2335688
value	field
you re correct that getwidth returns the width of the field after it s been laid out that s why it s 0 but getpreferredwidth will return the value that s given to the layout manager and is probably what you want

2335688
display	width
if a button s preferred width is say 36 pixels and the remaining width is 20 pixels you ll draw a button in a spot where you don t have enough room to display it

2335691
contains	set
i set up a test scenario with an iis virtual folder and dropped a docx file that i know contains info in the title subject properties in my virtual folder s physical path

2335712
radio-button	selected
is it possible to call a php function .when an html radio-button is selected

2335737
radio-button	selected
in the php function behind the php page determine the radio-button pressed based on the parameter named and or value and finally display the rest of page conditional based on the selected radio-button using if-else or switching statement

2335738
callback	methods
i was able to avoid this in another form project by using delegation callback and invoked methods but somehow it doesn t work in this wpf project

2335752
environment	building
eclipse is adding it because your eclipse is set for 1.6 compliance...you should try to keep your building and eclipse environment on the same versioning of java

2335753
directory	folder
open the folder you wish to recover click on the time machine icons and browse the directory as if it was 1999 all over again

2335825
droppable	draggable
how to draw a line between draggable and droppable

2335828
ruby	php
i m not expierenced in ruby like in java and php i m affraid that there maybe a strange rules

2335834
dialog	pop-up
click an ajax-inserted li elements pop-up a dialog box with a textinput .when the input is above 100 submit the information for verification against the server

2335859
environment	building
generally for anything other than trivially simple project you ll want a real make building environment .

2335863
wamp	php
i m having a critical issue where my wamp installation for php 5.3.0 is not finding a file which exists within my computer

2335868
binary-search-tree	skip-lists
they include sample code for things like binary-search-tree graphing skip-lists nodelist etc

2335872
pointers	stack
you ve got a hashtable pointers in the call stack .so you need to allocate the memory for the struct

2335873
droppable	draggable
specifically draggable and droppable

2335896
internet-explorer	firefox
.when i do single-sign-on over spnego in internet-explorer or mozilla firefox they create a service ticket in my ticket caching .so there definitely has to be a way to do this without setting the registry key

2335896
single-sign-on	security
for us this means now that we can either abandon single-sign-on which is unacceptable for us or that we do the authentication on the client side of our application because we can only read out the username but not verify the ticket on the server which is a major security risk

2335907
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentexception argumentnullexception argumentoutofrangeexception etc

2335927
any	set
if bullet is a class any time you construct one then unroot it let it go out of scoping or set it to null you re going to be adding something the gc needs to collections

2335953
sql-server	postgresql
multiple-instances of the server can run at the same time but all data comes from the same database on some servers it is postgresql in other cases ms sql-server

2335953
any	set
what i do is before any server starts the hour-long process i set a boolean flag in the processtable which indicates that this recording is locked and is being process not all recordinging in this table are process locked .so i need to specifically mark each recording which is needed by the process

2335953
any	set
the problem is that 2 server instances might both be activated at nearly the same time and .when both checked the processtable there may not be any flags set but both servers are actually in the process of setting the flags but since the transactional hasn t yet commited for either process neither process will see the locking done by the other process

2335953
sql-server	postgresql
please note that i need to support both postgresql and ms sql-server as some servers use one database and some servers use the other

2335957
uitextview	nsstring
if embedded you can load it into an nsstring object and then set the text properties of the uitextview with that

2335959
configuration	logging
because hibernate 3 is using simple logging facade for java slf4j per the docs if you are relying on log4j 1.2 you will also need the slf4j-log4j12-1.5.10.jar if you are wanting to fully configure hibernate logging with a log4j configuration file

2335960
oracle	mysql
this would be a simple query in oracle since it supports hierarchical queries using connect by but i don t think there s a comparable solution for mysql

2335964
temporary	copy
it seems like a temporary copy of our application is getting created and the program is getting ran from that

2335987
value	field
.when the serialization tries to do its job it doesn t find a field in e that matches 0 .so it fails or generator a xml that doesn t match the wsdl which restrict the value to the enum members

2335991
xcopy	cmd
add a cmd-line xcopy cmd to the runonce registry key to copy the new dll from the subfolder to the final exe folder where you want it to go

2335991
command-line	cmd
the runonce key contains command-line cmd which are run once on reboot and then removed from the registry .so they don t run again

2335995
configuration	environment
do this in configuration environment production.rb and use

2335998
32-bit	64bit
could it be that either the scripting or the application runs as a 64bit program and the other as a 32-bit program

2336028
bitwise-xor	xor
you are doing an xor of boolean value which is easy to model into a bitwise-xor which javascript has

2336030
scala	java
.so in scala all object are descendant from any and that include both what java considers object and what java considers primitive

2336030
scala	java
everything that is considered a primitive in java is descendant from anyval in scala

2336030
extends	sealed
until scala 2.10.0 anyval was sealed and programmers were unable to extends it

2336030
scala	java
up to scala 2.9.x a user could not extends any or anyval nor reference them from java but there were other uses they could be put to in scala

2336030
typedef	struct
ps in my own view java is likely to follow c# in allowing struct primitive and maybe typedef as parallelism without resorting to them is proving difficult to accomplish with good performance

2336058
hash	md5
neither md5 nor sha are encryption algorithms they re hash algorithms

2336060
boolean	int
it will work for your example since the boolean true and false value are converted into 1 and 0 because the bitwise-operators work with 32-bit int

2336068
hash	md5
you can t decrypt md5 or sha1 hash they are one-way hash which means they are non-recoverable

2336085
py2exe	exe
if you want to make your python program an exe you might want to look at py2exe

2336115
sql-server	mysql
i have a need to support two separate database engines - mysql and sql-server

2336115
sql-server	mysql
mysql has implicit default for columns while sql-server does not

2336115
sql-server	mysql
mysql timestamp column is different from sql-server timestamp column

2336115
sql-server	mysql
the way mysql references object in a different database is different from how sql-server does - differentdb.table mysql vs differentdb.dbo.table sql-server

2336130
manipulators	iomanip
inorder to use parameterized streaming manipulators like setprecision n you will have to include the iomanip libs

2336143
any	set
your hostsing provider might have set up the hosts and any possible login credentials for all the php pages on their machines

2336145
export	report
but .when we export the crystal report to pdf a lot of strange box characters get append to the end of some of the free textfield like this

2336162
administration	account
i am logged on to the server and in sharepoint with the .app pool account which is also a member of the domain administration grouping local administration grouping and sharepoint farm admin grouping

2336182
versioning	migrate
al.so as the domain model changes .so long as the code can cope with getting back object from an old versioning of the domain classes one can avoid having to migrate the whole database at every change

2336207
order	join
that is split the date into components reverse the order join them again and do a string-comparison

2336208
digits	base
the question is how many base 36 digits are required to represent a numbers having 32 base 2 digits bits

2336208
digits	base
the numbers of digits is determined by the logarithm of the numbers in the desired base

2336213
vtk	itk
as somebody has mentioned you could use itk which could be used with vtk as a visualization toolkit

2336215
selected	cell
if the cell you want to be able to click and subsequently not selected a row is in it s own column then the following apple example is very useful

2336215
click	mouse
if you have a cell within another cell you can still use that approach but you ll need to do a bit more work to determine whether the mouse was click within your sub-cell

2336252
double	int
it sounds like what you want is to find each int in the s-expression then double it while keeping the rest of it the same

2336280
checkbox	button
i would like the button on my webpage to toggle the visibility of my two checkbox

2336285
margins	padding
i tried adding spaces to the margins padding and line-height of the ul but nothing seems to work

2336289
constructor	object
here are all available constructor for date object in javascript

2336294
any	set
this uniformity would also be great .when working on the user-interface as it would be easier to set the maxlength on input-field and any data validation code

2336302
contains	any	contains	elements
is there any advantage to having a single monster .css file that contains styles elements that will be used on almost every page

2336323
linked-list	arrays
if you wanted to try to eliminate the need to iterate the list which could be very large depending on what you are going to allow for each repaint you could try to implements a double linked-list within the arrays

2336335
uiimage	nsdata
i felt that there might be a speedup with not allocation a new nsdata and uiimage each time .so i defined them in my class

2336335
uiimage	nsdata
it seems that if cellforrowatindexpath is being called for each cell that is visible and my code is synchronous there should be no reason why the nsdata and uiimage variables should persistent over the call they are wiped out by the init methods

2336335
uiimage	nsdata
is there any merit in allocation a reusable member variables rather than allocation a new nsdata and uiimage each time i want to load a thumbnail

2336339
export	report
.when i export it to excel i want the report to be exported in hierarchical format with having + - sign

2336342
header-only	boost
i ask this because the boost website talks about the bgl being a header-only libs that does not need to be built

2336345
malloc	free
suppose char p malloc n assign more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

2336372
malloc	free
the malloc block header contains information about the the size of the block and .when free is called it returns that amount back to the heap

2336394
extends	sealed
best thing to avoid this is provide an abstract-base-class for pluginss that is not marked serialization and does not extends mbro and to only bring back primitive or sealed types you defined back across the boundary from the plugins domain

2336405
extjs	flex
how to embed the flex grid in extjs framework

2336410
promise	future
this answer would not help you right now but hopefully it can be of interest for you as it promise solution for your problem in a near future

2336434
worksheet	excel
one of the things i like about this project types is that i can use caching dataset in the excel templates or worksheet to handle application-state that persistent after the user saves the file

2336434
worksheet	excel
is there a standards or recommended way to versioning stamp the excel templates or worksheet

2336440
xml-binding	xstream
there is a framework that will work on android which does java to xml-binding using annotations in a similar manner to jaxb it is called simple and weighs in at less than 270k thats a tiny fractions of whats required for xstream or jaxb

2336464
radio-button	selected
how can i selected a specific radio-button in column 1 if i am given a value that corresponds to column 2

membership	guid
i have created an object that call persons that is inherited from sql membership table aspnet_users they are linked by userid guid with 1-to- 0..1 relationship and they both belong to userset

2336477
ruby-on-rails	django
is django s admin panels intended to just be temporary scaffolding that is to be used only during the initial development of the application and to be replace by custom code similar to ruby-on-rails scaffolding

2336489
postgresql	mysql
postgresql scale farther than mysql

2336522
png	gif
i know that png gif are lossless while jpeg is lossy

2336522
png	gif
but what is the main difference between png gif

2336531
copy-constructor	constructor
without the constructor the types are unrelated .so the regular copy-constructor wouldn t work

2336546
png	gif
gif if needs animation or transparency that works on ie6 note png transparency works after ie6

2336549
attributes	properties
yup the properties attributes has a formula properties

2336552
png	gif
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

2336560
png	gif
compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

2336561
png	gif
gif has 8bit 256 color palette where png as upto 24 bit color palette

2336571
contains	elements
div elements are block-level elements that by default stretch as far to the left and right as their contains blocks will allow

2336571
put	get	display	width
inorder to get the width of the div to auto-adjust you ll have to convert it to an inline elements using the same styles as you put on the p display inline

2336572
radio-button	selected
if this value is what you re looking for then selected the radio-button

2336573
any	set
usually i try to set my folder to have permission 775 but some web-hosting refuses to let php writes or move files to any folder unless it has permission 777 it may be open_dir or safe mode

2336574
png	gif
png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet .so that .when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

2336575
png	gif
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

2336582
png	gif
i usually go with png as it seems to have a few advantages over gif

2336582
png	gif
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animation

2336595
attributes	properties
i have a checkboxlist in my page with the datatextfield and datavaluefield attributess set is there an attributes that i can use to specify a properties that indicates if it should be checked

2336595
any	set
i m hoping to just set the datasource and not have to have any code-behind to set the checked properties

2336604
value	field
column value by using the field

2336606
communication	messages
people don t know what each other are thinking they must send messages to convey information they have the choice of ignoring incoming messages considering them or communication with other people

2336648
silverlight	wpf
adding silverlight to wpf doesn t make much sense because you can accomplish whatever you need to do in regular wpf for the most part

2336648
silverlight	wpf	silverlight	xbap
i assume what you may be considering since you mentioned xbap is to rewrite or recompile your current wpf xbap application into a silverlight application

2336694
checkbox	textbox
i have updatepanel that content checkbox textbox 3 dropdownlistfor with cascadingdropdown extender

2336727
put	get
from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an arrays

2336730
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works in firefox and opera as well .so i m assuming it works in safari and google-chrome too

2336733
queue	fifo
you can use a fifo queue that stores your positioning and thus avoid your recursive call

2336736
ip-address	proxy
you should include both the ip-address and the entire x-forwarded-for hedaer in the authentication cookiess to prevent cookies theft behind proxy

2336736
aes	rsa
if you re dealing with sensitive data you could generator a random aes key in javascript then send it to the server along with the passwd encrypted with rsa

2336738
http	ssl
if your hosts doesn t support http then a service like cloudflare universal ssl can be used to ensure all browsers connect to your site using http even if your server doesn t support ssl tls

2336738
http	ssl
http certificates can be obtained for free using let s encrypt or start ssl there is no legitimate reason not to support http

2336743
defined	declare
i ve seen examples where a recording or table is returned the types of recording or table having been created declare beforehand but it seems like if the table has already been defined i should be able to utilize that and thus not have to worry about syncing the types declaration code if table changes are ever made

2336750
toolchain	platform
from the document i ve read .so far these ones for example this involves compiling the toolchain of the target platform

2336752
subtract	add
if you add you must subtract but the absolute-value is an implementation detail that should be ignore

2336755
.when	ready
the event triggers .when all content including images are ready is the load event .so in this case it would be appropriate rather than the more-commonly used methods

2336761
cross-compiling	toolchain
i m currently working on getting mono and moonlight built for my palm pre using the cross-compiling toolchain and the optware makefile handle the majority of dependencies already

2336767
any	set
the documentation only says that set puts it in a signalsed state - it doesn t seem to make any claims about .when waiters will actually get that signals .so i d like to be sure

2336768
value	field
you can create a form onsubmit handler in javascript that replace the passwd field with a hash of the original value

2336769
contains	any
the good news is these don t contains any libs code

2336770
hide	show
there s a lot of customization you can do to the admin by adding custom modeladmin classes hide field show additional field allow for editing of related-items on the same page or limit filtering the options that appear in a foreign key field

2336770
filtering	sorting
you can also make things easier for users to find by adding sorting filtering to the front page search field

2336771
spring	jsf
some of my spring beans should be serialization during the render-response phase of our jsf application and then deserialization at the beginning of the next request

2336787
cursor	row
since you are selected just one row top 1 why not just use a standards locking hint and forget the cursor

2336835
static-code-analysis	stylecop
i am not asking the static-code-analysis which is provided by stylecop or fxcop

2336835
code-coverage	ncover
inorder to ensure the unit-testing code-coverage we need to run the application and ensure using ncover or similar tool

2336853
contains	set
we started a new project and realized that we needed a general purpose javascript libs that contains a nice set of string functions md5 base64 allows extensions etc

2336868
any	set
the reason for this is that .when one initializer the model they also set a bunch of parameters that i do not want to overwrite for any reason

2336883
selected	button
user can selected the file he wants from a list of available files radiobuttonlist and click on downloading button to downloading it

2336883
radio-button	selected	radio-button	button	selected	button
i want the user to downloading multiple-files one by one by selected the required radio-button and click on the button

2336883
selected	button
but after downloadinging if i selected some other file and click on the button to downloading it click event of the button does not postback and the second file will not be downloadinging

2336900
setinterval	settimeout
if you are calling this function in a loops as bobince mentioned in his her comment you should change it to a series of settimeout call or setinterval to give control back to the browser

2336907
contains	any
i have the navcontrollers in my delegation along with the tabbar controllers and any time the user click to another tab i want the rootview on the navigation controllers to be show if and .when they click back the the tab that contains the uinavcontrollers

2336910
buffering	streaming
do i have to implements something like a proxy-server and buffering the streaming data manually

2336929
directory	folder
publishing the web .app to a folder on the laptop and create an iis virtual directory points to that folder

2336930
any	set
to answer the initial question yes you can do this in sed and no you do not want to do it unless you have some bizarre set of constraints that prevent you from using any other tool

2336940
contains	any
if p does not contains any wildcards then only item iv applies

2336977
shell	bash
i write a shell scripting bash for a quick and dirty job

2336977
buffering	streaming
although those might not work correctly if the scripting file is large and there are limits on the size of streaming buffering and command-line arguments

2337024
radio-button	textbox
i want to use fbml as a canvas and would like to display a textbox onclientclick of radio-button

2337024
selected	textbox
if a user selected other as option it should make appear a textbox

2337033
required	checked
as long as you are timing the exam on serverside you can use a cookies to store the data required to remember the options checked

2337043
annotations	mapping
i am aware that i could get the index information another way like annotations on .net types corresponding to database tables or by requiring a index mapping be provided ahead of time

2337047
16-bit	8bit
.so assuming you re dealing with at least 16-bit registers and you want to split the registers on 8bit boundaries then the function

2337047
symbolic-computation	maxima
for additional resources on maxima including a ready reference cheat sheet see resources maxima for symbolic-computation

2337053
for-loop	loops
and now that we have the timetamp of last monday we can write a simple for-loop that loops 7 time adding 1 day each time like this

2337053
for-loop	arrays
modify that for-loop .so it stores the dates in an arrays

2337060
contains	set
it also contains a nice set of string manipulating methods in goog.string namespace

2337061
serialization	marshalling	double	int
in beej s guide to networking there is a section of marshalling or packing data for serialization where he describe various functions for packing and unpack data int float double ..etc

2337077
prototype	strict
i should be able to quickly prototype and only .when i need to work with designer and only then should i have to be more strict about something like this

2337086
windows-vista	windows
it s something similar for windows-vista and windows 7 but i m on an xp machine right now

2337092
contains	set
each row in the result set contains a properties which is an entityset itself

2337103
delphi	c++
c++ if you need to go beyond some delphi capabilities and or target non-windows platform natively

2337103
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
ruby perl php python etc each have their pro and cons for scripted applications

2337103
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
ruby and php are imho better to target web-applications .when multiplatform is a need while perl is a good language to perform heavy text process in a lot of differnt situations and python being a good general purpose tool

2337124
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe i was just too lazy-evaluation here.

2337147
ubuntu	linux
operating systemd is ubuntu linux

2337152
function-call	inline
the methods you write for class a can be inline to avoid function-call overhead mdash

2337171
double	int
it makes more sense to say than since t can be non-class types like int or double

2337198
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

2337199
click	mouse
anyhow .when the user input invalid data they can t click off using the mouse because the textbox_validating event cancels like it should and the control can t lose focus until they enter acceptable input

2337221
windows-server	windows-xp
i know the solution provided in the answer to my first question works as expected in windows-xp and vista but is not working on windows-server 2003

2337229
value	field
it assign a value to a field

2337252
margins	padding
how do i minimize the padding margins .so i can use the whole page

2337322
contains	any
is there any ability to building maven artifact which will contains only resources but no sources and which can be reused by other project

2337325
revision	updates	triggers	insert
i have an after insert or updates or delete triggers that i m writing to store every recording revision that occurs in a certain table by copying the insert and updates new value into a mirror table and for delete the old value

2337344
contains	elements
as other answers have said ultimately you will need to cycle through the page and find and disable contains elements

2337354
windows-xp	windows
the reason this worked in the dev machine windows 7 and not production machines windows-xp did not have anything to do with the operating systemd

2337363
carbon	cocoa
screenshot is from the carbon emacs package but i want the same behavior in cocoa emacs 23

2337370
exception-handling	error-handling
in this particular case exception-handling should be rare enough that wrapping it shouldn t be a useful thing and will likely just get in the way of error-handling down the line

2337382
google-chrome	firefox
i think it only works on google-chrome not working on firefox 3.6

2337391
getter	setter
since all my di mapping are defined in the way of properties getter and setter i created a base-class like this

2337391
attributes	properties
by the way i like to use properties as my import and export since the attributes have nothing to do a class business-logic

2337392
value	field
the two querys are not the same as in the second query you are evaluation the actual value of the field columnname

2337394
versioning	upgrade
create a new versioning that will have your changes .so that if users want new features they need to upgrade their codebase

2337403
contains	elements
i can t figure out a discrepancy between the time it takes for the contains methods to find an elements in an arraylist and the time it takes for a small function that i wrote to do the same thing

2337403
contains	any
the documentation states that contains performs a linear search .so it s supposed to be in o n and not any other faster methods

2337407
contains	elements
data elements like social security numbers phone and zipcode you can be simple must be a certain length and contains only numberss u.s.

2337411
directory	folder
i tried placing the entire amazon folder inside the systemd libs directory and then tried including libs with this- load- libs amazon fps client

2337413
user-controls	ascx
ascx - user-controlsbase user-controls

2337430
punctuation	words
unfortunately google bing altavista yahoo and excite all stripes the punctuation and just show anything with the words windows in it

2337437
spring	jsf
it makes all the difference - i ve been using spring with jsf for quite a long time and hadn t had any serialization problems

2337437
spring	jsf
this integrated spring with jsf by providing spring beans using the request and session spring scoping to jsf pages

2337438
value	field
let s say i have a field myfield in sometable and i want to count in how many rows myfield value do not belong to a domain defined by the value of myotherfield in someothertable

2337438
value	field
if i try to run the exact same query except for varchar typed field its returning value is 0 even though i know that there are wrong value i put them there

2337445
triggers	insert
this would certainly cost performance but you could try to defined your triggers after insert and another one before updates or delete and in the triggers do something like

2337446
subclassing	base-class
.when i subclassing this qevent i need to supply the base-class this value

2337453
push	pull
i can see how you can use the acl extension to control the push pull to a particular repository by certian users but can you control web access to a repository using the acl extenstion

2337485
contains	set
set up your searchresults action to return a partials view contains only the part of the page to be updates .when the search is performed

2337485
callback	methods
then use the callback mechanism on the .post methods to replace the contents of that div with the partials view result returned from your searchresults action

2337499
triggers	insert
if a triggers existed on serverb.tablea that fired .when a row was insert or updates would the triggers fire as rows are replicated from servera.tablea

2337524
binaries	install
for generator executable for standards ubuntu 8.04 and centos 5.3 systemd you could install the distributions in virtual-machines and do the necessary compilation from within the virtual-machine to guarantee the resulting binaries are compatible with the libs versioning from each distribution

2337524
environment	building
another option would be to setup chroot building environment instead of virtual machines for the target distributions

2337524
environment	building
you could also building toolchain targeted at different environment different libs versioning and building under your ubuntu 9.10 environment without using virtual machines or chroot environment

2337530
debugging	trace
for the sake of debugging the former is better - .when you want to trace the execution or log some info between creation and returning

2337536
tokenize	parsing
using boost tokenize to parsing recording see here for more details

2337549
margins	padding
i know i can use box-sizing or -moz-box-sizing set to border-box to get that div s total width including borders and padding but not margins to be that computed 100

2337561
silverlight	wpf
i want to rendering a lot of circles or small graphics within either silverlight or wpf around 1000-10000 as fast and as frequently as possible

2337569
directory	folder
.so i assumed that mysql default directory was the wamp folder

2337574
treeset	treemap
treeset treemap hashset hashmap etc

2337578
constructor	object
setting up relations between object passing this into a constructor or setter

2337579
margins	padding
it would help to know what s your points but knowing this all - i advice you to use wrapper div having width and padding or just having width and my-div having margins

2337601
objective-c	swift
code-snippets in swift 3.x 2.x and objective-c is here

2337619
registration	login
i d like to create a modal styles registration login box for my expressionengine site

2337651
arrays	loops
this would mean initializing the arrays before loops

2337674
progress-bar	progress
ok now i have a service downloadinging in background data from an external api and i want .when to updates the progress-bar every second with the progress of the downloading

2337686
shell	bash	subshell	bash
the bourne shell would run the while-loop in the current shell but bash runs it in a subshell â at least by default

2337699
communication	messages
alternatively you can use some sort of interprocess communication systemd key words .net-remoting and code the focus snippet into the target .applciation and then from your .application just send the focus messages to your second .app

2337728
value	field
i just need to make sure that a field excepts only numerical value and only 4 int long basically a year

2337749
contains	set
in ssms 2005 or 2008 right click on the heading stored-procedures tables etc then on filtering settings then for the schema change operators to does not contains or containss etc and then set a value to filtering them.

2337785
maxlength	numeric
you could use a simple plugins that allow only numeric character and add maxlength 4 .so the user can t types more char

2337796
32-bit	64bit
the program itself probably wouldn t generator any different code for a 64bit windows than for 32-bit

2337817
json	xml
finally devs will be able to request all response in either xml json or php serialization arrays

2337823
postgresql	oracle
i have been working on porting some oracle code to postgresql and i am noticing some nomenclature difference schema vs databases etc

2337857
linked-list	arrays
about the memory limit how about creating a custom list class that internally is a linked-list of lists or arrays

2337858
json	xml
have a n terminate first line specifying the protocols mime-type xml json etc.

2337872
entity-framework	ado.net	binaries	install
once you run the install you ll need to grab the microsoft.data.entity.ctp.dll file mine was in the c program files microsoft ado.net entity-framework feature ctp3 binaries directory

2337878
.when	ready
.when a branch is ready to be deployed to production it gets merged back to the trunk and deployed

2337897
sql-server	mysql
i have been tasked with converting a sql-server database into a mysql 5

2337900
queue	fifo
note - the queue isn t a fifo

2337905
default-value	return-type
if return-type is not specified the procedure returns nothing the default-value for object

2337917
dependency-injection	singleton
once your project gets larger you can look into using dependency-injection to avoid this singleton problem

2337918
moss	wss
i don t think that ad grouping are synchronized as user profiling in moss wss

2337940
dialog	pop-up
simplify pop-up dialog using simple panels only

2337940
button	popup
abstractaction encapsulates text icons mneumonics accelerators reusable in button popup menus handles toggling enabled disabled states can be shared among multiple components it also is the basis for inputmap actionmaps for mapping keyboard strokes to actions

2337940
keyboard	mouse
i m not talking about mouse keyboard junk but high level events

2337940
checkbox	button
the controllers doesn t care if the user click a button menu or checkbox

2337940
javafx	swing
javafx is not yet there and suffers from lots of swing s sins

2337956
silverlight	wpf
checkout the writeablebitmapex libs for silverlight which will surely work with wpf too

2337985
placeholder	required
.lib can be either the same as .a or a magical so-called import libs a thin placeholder which causes you to required a .dll at runtime

2337991
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
free works on dynamically allocated memory memory allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
free frees the memory spaces pointed to by pointers which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
malloc	free
you re essentially telling the runtime to free the memory at address 0 which has not been previously allocated by malloc

2338035
webserver	upload
d upload the page and the .profile on a webserver is doable but a pain on the organization level not to mention an extra source of failures what if no 3g coverage

2338065
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera
this is not something that can be seen in internet-explorer 8 google-chrome or opera

2338095
np-complete	subset-sum
your problem is a variation on the subset-sum problem and is np-complete

2338110
if-statement	loops
this is just a tiny variation with a exceeds a threshold conditional - just an extra if-statement in your loops

2338124
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
the pointers that you can legally pass to free are pointers obtained by previous call to malloc calloc realloc and null pointers

2338128
sql-server	oracle
i think this is an approach that will work for you - especially given based on your comments your need to support both sql-server and oracle

2338136
selected	button
once that is setup open the run configuration for your project click on the plugins tab and selected the add required plugins button

2338138
groovy	java
i m not sure about in groovy but in java .so i assume groovy too... you could do minus nullpointerexception checked

2338139
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox 2.x+ and google-chrome seems to not have much problems with that if the request url is identical

2338162
configuration	environment
probably the hardest bit is ensuring the configuration files are correct for each environment but if you aren t changing it you don t deploy it

2338162
versioning	upgrade
one thing to note is not using client versioning 1.6x with a 1.5x svn server as this is playing havok with our merge process until we upgrade see

2338162
deployment	install
each server in our deployment environment has the tortoisesvn client install .so that the sysadmins have a gui for updating the checked out repository

2338162
environment	building
one is for repositories of source code and the other one for the eventual building that are deployed in each environment

2338195
any	set
i have can set up a network udp connection between them but i want to avoid the transfer of the whole data by any means

2338199
show	next
lately i ve been seeing behavior where after an updates svn show certain files as conflicted but .when i try to edit the conflicts there are none the next conflict and previous conflict button are disabled and if i scroll through the file none of the line are marked red

2338214
default-value	arguments
you can use 0 c++ s equivalent of null for the default-value of a boost-function arguments which will result to an empty function-object

2338223
swing	awt
i can at least say what the edt it that s the event-dispatch-thread the thread where all awt and swing operations are done

2338224
implements	extends
there is thus no need to discuss technical points things like cayenne 2.0 is intrusive you have to implements an interface or to extends a superclass cayenne 3.0 has pojo support but is still in beta after more than 2 years...

2338241
linux	unix
on pthreads most unix linux systemd you use the shm_ apis in sys shm.h

2338256
order	add
this required no disposal or clean up you just fire and forget although you need to be aware that the workitem are not guaranteed to be process in the same order you add them in it s likely .some will be process simultaneously .so if you care about order this is no good

2338283
margins	padding
the padding and margins of the printing document are controled in the printingdocument1.defaultpagesettings value

2338285
internationalization	localization
then there is the format fmt taglib which is great for internationalization and localization i18n and l10n

2338330
assign	add
add a class to all divs except the first and assign margin-top -50px to it and make sure that this is only applied to ie 6 7 and 8 if in compatibility view

2338338
pthreads	openmp
however openmp is very specialized for loop-level parallelism than general pthreads win32 thread api

2338351
32-bit	64bit
there s an easier solution than trying to run a 64bit program on a 32-bit os including execution through an emulated or virtual 64bit platform on top of the 32-bit os recompile it for the 32-bit os

2338370
virtual-machine	vmware
but the problem is that .when i ve created a new virtual-machine in vmware 6.5 and lunched the application the toolbar looked this way

2338375
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works beautifully in ie and firefox but for the love of me i cannot get it to work in google-chrome

2338437
subtract	add
now doing the add and subtract methods of this class are pretty simple

2338438
textbox	button
i have created a simple application with 1 textbox 1 button and a validation control

2338467
double	int
this libs is an example of what is possible for float and double arrays similar results should be possible for int-arithmetic since sse has int instructions as well

2338471
32-bit	64bit
in fact snow leopard boot into a 32-bit kernel but compiles applications 64bit by default .so this is quite common on os x

2338498
children	nodes
this is comes from a kvp object and .so these can be different in terms of numbers of nodes and their single children

2338499
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have client side security feature to prevent phishing

2338500
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
multiplication is repeated addition division is the opposite - repeated subtraction

2338500
subtract	time
.so what you ll do is checked how many time you can subtract the divi.sor from the dividend

2338500
subtract	time
for example 3 can be subtract from 10 3 time without going 0 .so the integer-division quotient is 3

2338513
attributes	properties
a debugging tool would allow you to step through the process and provide some feedback encountered this attributes iterated through properties and didn t find a corresponding public one skipped

2338514
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit application does not run on a 32-bit processor period

2338518
loading	png
i m loading a high quality 64 by 64 png formatted icons in the following way

2338521
value	field
if possible selected the complete field and filtering out the required value on the client side using a more powerful programming language than t-sql

2338521
value	field
in fact relational databases are not designed to work with string-separated lists of value at all .so an even better .solution would be to split that field into separate field in your table or into a subtable if the numbers of entries varies

2338522
postback	ajax
an ajax postback can return a pv

2338532
implements	extends
i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider properties it s a lot to tackle

2338548
haskell	erlang
how would erlang or haskell help in this situation

2338549
webserver	security	credentials	security
since you cannot do ssl at the webserver and you are not a security expert look for an existing secure authentication service that you can utilize and let them handle both the ssl and the complexities of handling credentials for you

2338569
profiling	debugging
we used sql profiling too to debugging the failure but couldn t see the bulk insert statement for this table

2338570
administration	credentials
first process- launchd as administration will need a way to supply credentials - launchd another process using shellexecute and supplying the runas verb

2338584
order	add
add those and you ll likely get an answer in short order

2338595
json	xml
if you used some hierarchical representation of data xml or json the situation would be a lot easier because you wouldn t have to transform the data structure from linear list arrays to hierarchical in this case a list of lists

2338601
haskell	erlang
that said either erlang or haskell would work if you want to do it that way but probably won t make a huge difference for what you re asking

2338602
malloc	free
the same kind of leak exists with memory allocation calling new but never delete or calling malloc but never free for instances or file pointers never closing opened file pointers

2338604
put	get	contains	any
what i did was create a wrapper which is a partially-implementsed abstract-base-class that uses any standards caching libs as the backing caching just needs to implements the contains get put and remove methods

2338604
put	get
intercept all call to the get put add and remove methods

2338604
decrement	increment
as per some advice given to me on an earlier question today the entry implements a countdown latch which is increment whenever the entry is acquired and decrement whenever it is release

2338604
put	get
because the getoradd still implements a get followed by an optional put this methods is synchronized serialization against the put and remove methodss but only to add the incomplete entry not for the entire duration of the lazy-evaluation load

2338608
static-typing	typechecking
a nice thing about code-generation is that the code is statically typed .so you get compile-time typechecking which of course is one of the benefits of static-typing

2338609
selectedindex	selecteditem
it should be enough to set the selecteditem or selectedindex properties and then it will be rendering correctly

2338623
scala	java
scala is a jvm language that combines object-oriented and functional styles supports the actors concurrency model and runs at nearly the speed of java martin odersky the creator of scala also wrote the current sun java compiler

2338623
scala	java
.so if you should run into a concurrency bottleneck you might want to sprinkle a bit of scala in with your java

2338624
reflection	runtime
at runtime some code could use reflection to find the attributes

2338627
silverlight	wpf
if that is the case then you would want to use a generic-list or observablecollection if wpf silverlight .so that the items could be display in the user-interface

2338653
credentials	account
if you carefully isolate those service from each other by assign each a unique user and managing file-permissions accordingly yes you are still in hot water if someone compromises the credentials for an account but the damage they can do is limited to that one service

2338661
entity-framework	data-access
last year i developed a data-access service for our project using entity-framework .net3.5 of course and using julie lerhman s book as a guide developed state tracking poco object

2338661
entity	poco
2 snapshot based snapshot is taken .when poco entity graphing is retrieved returned graphing from client is compared with that snapshot and difference are compared...seems good to me

2338668
decimal	hex
after that dec and hex are the total size of everything in decimal and hexadecimal and filename is of course obvious.

2338673
global-asax	web-config
you could create your own configuration section that would be part of your web-config and then use the setting to control the behavior in global-asax session_start

2338687
nsmutablearray	nsuinteger	nsmutablearray	nsarray	nsuinteger	nsarray
to fetch an entry from a nsarray nsmutablearray you can use nsarray objectatindex nsuinteger index

typing a character while focused in the listbox doesn t cause the textbox to get updates

2338703
put	get
if you have a tip using another attributes types i just need to get this data to put in the div let me know please

2338705
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
the idea is that i can take whatever filtering grouping sorting has been set on the existing view and then create other views from that base view in effect layering or aggregation my filtering etc

2338738
sql-server	sql-azure
sql-azure is different sql-azure is sql-server in the clouds and for that service you simply need a connection-string very much similar to a normals sql-server connection-string

2338745
assign	add
a strictly-following-the-specification non-optimizing compiler would first add 2 and 2 and then discard the result then call the function mul and discard the return-value and finally evaluate 4 which then is assign to the i variables

2338778
32-bit	64bit
you wouldn t dream of doing this on 32-bit .net but on a 64bit systemd with 12 gb of ram maybe just maybe you might want to do this

2338781
any	set
if you simply want to delete any row of a set of duplicates or just want to delete a random row for some reason then it s safe to omit the order by and do something simpler

2338793
contains	elements
you also want the contains elements to increase its horizontal dimension inorder to expand to the required width of the text code

2338797
contains	set	contains	elements
with this new option set it is possible to get uint32.maxvalue 4 294 967 295 elements in a multi-dimension arrays though a single dimension arrays is still limited to 2 146 435 071 elements 2 147 483 591 for single byte arrayss or arrayss of a struct contains nothing ut a byte

2338799
firefox	safari
the second one creates the correct screenshot but it only works on firefox and our tests usually pass on firefox and fail in other browsers .so it is crucial to capture screenshot for the other browsers mainly ie and safari

2338805
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie and google-chrome on a pc but in firefox on a mac and pc it resets after four

2338812
python	perl
i can t install new .software .so hopefully it s .something that would already be install -- less vi .something in a python or perl .lib etc

2338824
ubuntu	debian
details are in the debian ubuntu package

that makes functional-testing possible without a huge toolkit trying to simulate mouse click etc

2338894
g++	gcc
it compiled fine with g++ and also with gcc

2338894
g++	gcc
i m assuming that g++ is c++ compiler and gcc is c compiler

2338907
triggers	insert
if this was in sql-server you could create a view of your main_table then write an instead of insert triggers on the view

2338907
triggers	insert
that way as you insert a recording into your main_table view your triggers can parsing it into your child tables

2338915
lighttpd	apache
lighttpd apache nginx

2338917
display	height
google-chrome display this properly .so you might want to checked the hitedge and height variables to make sure they are properly assign and defined

often time i ll start work without doing an hg pull and an hg update. .when i try to push my changes i get an error

2339006
localization	translation
this question might help iphone localization is it possible to translation nib files.

2339027
unsigned	short
i figure that because an int is 2 bytes at the shortest 1 if you count char .so i should be able to store 4 unsigned int with a max value of 15 in a short int and i know i can access each one individually using and

2339041
progress-bar	progress
or notify the parent dialog of progress .so that the parent dialog can updates a progress-bar or .something like that

2339047
primitive	int
you usually allocate an arrays of the larger primitive types int or longs and have some abstraction to deal with the mapping

2339070
unsigned	short
in c and for the sole purpose of saving spaces you can reinterpret the unsigned short as a structure with bitfields or use such structure without messing with reinterpretations

2339072
subclassing	base-class
anyway for getting data from qsqltablemodel whereby i assume you mean the base-class you re subclassing use

2339093
contains	set
since my codelookup object contains a reference to the codelookuptable i can make the selectedcode setter set the codelookuptable and thus the itemssource properties first if it hasn t already been set

2339096
attributes	properties
the typical methods for adding attributes to an actionlink is to pass in an anonymous object with a custom properties for each object

2339243
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
see viewdidload below for where the uinavigationcontroller gets attached to the uiview

2339247
haskell	erlang
remember though haskell s aimed at great performance on multicore erlang s a bit different emphasising distribute systemd more and not .so much raw performance see the benchmarking game lang2 hipe the haskell s almost always much faster and uses much less memory

2339286
environment	execution
in the jre tab choose execution environment

2339301
scons	cmake	autotools	scons	autotools	cmake	build-system	cmake	build-system	autotools	build-system	scons

code-duplication is often a necessary evil in java method-overloading but not in python

2339395
streamreader	streamwriter
you should close your streamreader and streamwriter in using statements like this

2339434
tcp-ip	tcp	tcp-ip	udp	udp	tcp
most games like the ones you cite use udp for this one of the tcp-ip suite of protocols. udp is chosen over tcp for this application since it s lighter weight allowing for better performance and tcp s reliability features aren t necessary

2339447
unique	words
words - unique words should have a unique to stop duplicates

2339464

2339542
low-level	hardware
some parallels programming to maximize the power of hardware like multicore cpu and gpu are still more restrict to low-level language like c++

2339550
jquery	.post
though the form in the page .post fine and i receive the data in my salesforce once i make an identical .post structure to this form and then .post with jquery i get a 405

2339550
jquery	.post
is there a difference between a .posted form and a jquery .post as far as what the receiving website can see

2339558
googletest	gmock
i ve been looking into googletest and gmock and it does support mocking non-virtual methods

2339570
python	java
one thing you might be used to in java that you won t find in python is strict privacy

2339570
python	java
instead python has much more transparency and easier introspection than java

2339573
webforms	asp.net
i ve got an asp.net webforms .app that i ve written which uses the asp.net-ajax toolkit

2339575

xsd	xml
3 you can t ignore the validation of elementss and attributess ie if an elements attributes appears in xml it must be well-defined in the corresponding xsd

2339664
.when	ready
you should perhaps be looking at jms or something like websphere mq they both can act as messaging systemd - you receive the messages-queue it in a different queue and then .when the process application is ready it pull the next messages process it and informs the calling process back

2339670
display	width
i want to force the reader s email-client to display my php-generated plain text email with a fixed width charset

you will al.so have to set the textbox to not cause validation in the button s click event .so the validation event will not fire .when the form is closing thanks to powerlord for points this out

2339703
quirks-mode	doctype
it sounds to me that you need to add a doctype to your page to force ie into standards compliant rather than quirks-mode

2339712
attributes	properties
the access attributes lets you control how nhibernate will access the value of the properties at runtime

2339712
attributes	properties
no naming strategy should be used with this access strategy because the value of the named attributes is the named of the properties

2339712
value	field
nhibernate uses the value of the named attributes as the named of the field

2339712
value	field
nosetter nhibernate will access the field directly .when setting the value and will use the properties .when getting the value

2339712
attributes	properties	value	field
a naming strategy is required because nhibernate uses the value of the named attributes as the properties named and needs to be told what the named of the field is

2339729
background-image	transparency
has a background-image no transparency issues here but the child controls are a problem

2339729

order	add
later in query .when you use order by columns the columns are not in result set .so you need to add those missing columns in your selected list too

2339755
g++	gcc
i m confused that cygwin install g++ gcc without make but whatever

2339771
arrays	loops
you should compare each byte of your arrays you can make a simple loops or use the sequenceequal linq extension methods if available

2339781
object-reference	instances
in fun you are creating a separate object aa and then copying the value of the object-reference returned by a instances to it via the assignment-operator

2339781
constructor	private
this won t work because both constructor and destructor are private

2339789

2339832
command-prompt	cmd
cmd are run from qt command-prompt

2339833
qtcpsocket	qtimer
it also makes it possible to use classes that required the event-loop such as qtimer and qtcpsocket in the thread

2339833
qthread	qtimer
per the documentation above some classes like qtimer required a running event-loop for which you must call qthread execute

2339844
value	field
the val methods is used to query or set the value of a form field

children	nodes
what i want is .when i expand the root nodes on the children of root nodes to be show without they being expanded

2339860
callback	methods
the only code that s guaranteed to be called .when a generator instances is simply abandoned garbage collected are the __del__ methods for its local-variables if no references to those object exist outside and the callback for weak-references to its local-variables ditto

2339865
rollback	commit
but you can t commit the inner transactional and rollback the outer transactional the outer transactional will also rollback the inner transactional

2339911
scp	ssh
however look at the completion code for scp in etc bash_completion.d ssh if you have that

2339916
constructor	object
this can be done with the following constructor note that i don t know how you are going to persistent the object to the database .so i m guessing

2339932
implements	final
however .when i try to implements this in practice static-variables that are final too i get the error show in the screenshot below

2339935
checkbox	button
.when i click another button and switching to another datasource this checked checkbox is still checked but the officers 0 .isonduty for this datasource is false

2339946
buffering	streaming
in this case for unix look at unixprocess class.it does a fork and execute and wrap file and buffering streaming around native file descriptors

2339946
stdin	pipe	stderr	stdout
it opens pipe and give them as stdin stdout stderr to child and other side of pipe are used by parent

2339949
attributes	properties
then you can change your code to be more flexible getting the properties named from the attributes value like .so

2339949
attributes	properties
this way you can add remove properties and not have to change your code as it reads from the attributes on the elements

2339965
command-line	cmd
they could be documented in a single place for the others too but with the above cmd you can clearly see what is and isn t defined and exactly what value are used after applying all of the other command-line switches

2339981
directory	folder
the hgignore file sits in the working directory next to the .hg folder

2339995
windows-xp	windows
the very first chapter explains exactly how the .net-assembly is loaded prior and after windows-xp since xp the windows loader is .net aware which radically changes how .net applications are started

2340000
put	get
get the random rows from by ajax and put the value

2340026
callback	methods
a callback is a pattern whereby the guy you have called can in turn call a methods on you

2340028
decimal	octal
the color.decode methods throw the numberformatexception if the specified string cannot be interpreter as a decimal octal or hexidecimal int

2340029
postback	ajax
we are using ajax updatepanel in sharepoint web part to avoid postback certainly it is the easiest approach out there to provide ajax functionality.but at time it feels like the performance is horrible

2340033
richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces	tomahawk	icefaces
another points is that you will not be able to use third-libraries components such as the ones proposed by richfaces icefaces tomahawk and .so on

2340042
triggers	insert
you can make a triggers on datbase which automatically updates insert rows

2340045
bad-request	http-error
http-error 400.0 - bad-request

2340046
decrement	increment
in these cases we increment the count for each start event and decrement for each end event

2340067
required	checked
if you know that your dn required a passwd you might want to checked that it is not null before you try creating your pdo-object

2340069

the customer infrastructure is windows oriented and the sge solution required a unix or linux machine for the central manager + installing ms service for unix on the computation hosts

2340117
controllers	routes
providing a controllers in the hash you give url_for should match the default routes that ruby-on-rails generator for you .when you create an application but that s not very dry

2340125
buffering	streaming
fflush the output streaming and forces any buffering output bytes to be written out

2340125
buffering	streaming
the general contract of fflush is that calling it is an indication that if any bytes previously written have been buffering by the implementation of the output streaming such bytes should immediately be written to their intended destination

2340748
affinity	cpu
you can set affinity masks to tie a particular thread to a particular cpu if you want to

2340753
constructor	object

the concept is to selected the multiple-files from listview then on button click it should make a folder in some desired drive

2340916
google-chrome	firefox
this used to be easy - according to my then staff firefox had good standards support and the best tools - .so get it right in firefox first then adapt to cope with everything else now its a lot less clear as ie8 has a very decent set of dev tools and is better behaved than its predeces.sors and google-chrome is now getting into the act - again with a good set of tools and extensions

2340916
google-chrome	firefox
my gut feeling is probably firefox google-chrome ie8 in that order - but i m not doing anywhere near enough css work to assert that that s right

2340935
callback	methods
the java way for doing callback relies on passing object that implements the callback interface for example actionlistener with its actionperformed methods

2340941
populate	row
you need to 1 decide how many wordss n you want on a line this determines the numbers of columns in your table 2 divide up the text you want to rendering into n words chunks then 3 populate every other row in the table with the chunks text and the rows in between with the stats

2340943
contains	elements
.when the page arrives at the browser there is no way to determine which elements are rendering from dynamically generator controls .so the difference is what the rendering elements contains

2340950
quirks-mode	doctype
browsers use the doctype to determine if they should go into standards aka strict mode or quirks-mode

2340961
quirks-mode	doctype
if you don t have a proper doctype the page will be rendering in quirks-mode

2340967
children	nodes
for instances someone once pointed me to libs aterm and mentioned that the author had clearly thought about this and that the representation on disk was bottom-up children of a nodes come before the nodes itself in the data streaming

2340979
void	main
main program does initiation and starts watcher thread in void main i have the line

2340979

what i would like is a graceful shutdown that upon getting a terminate signals shutdownthread is run sets a flag and interrupts all threads and wait for the threads to interrupt it or it timeout .so that the remaining threads can be killed

2340979
.when	ready
at the same time i would like the program to end gracefully an interrupt is sent to saver threads .so that it dump the results out and then interrupts back to tell that we are ready to quit .when the user ends it

2341053
margins	padding
and nothing to be proud of it just show a list without any margins or padding

2341075
ruby	php
.so let me first say .something about ruby javascript php

2341239
python	java
a static methods in java does not translation to a python classmethods. this kind of thing is really limited and unhelpful

2341239
python	java	getter	setter
getter and setter are not required in python they way they re required in java

2341239
getter	setter
first you have better introspection in python .so you don t need getter and setter to help make dynamic bean object

2341239
getter	setter
however you have the properties decorator which will bundle getter and setter into an attribute-like construct

2341239
getter	setter
.when necessary we can bundle getter and setter to appear as if there s a simple attributes

2341239
python	java
code-duplication is often a necessary evil in java method-overloading but not in python

2341239
arguments	default
that isn t as helpful as the simple advice to use default arguments value wisely

2341276
postgresql	mysql
i know this should work with mysql but you might want to double checked for postgresql

2341292

however given that mysql does not have any special support for hirachical queries like oracle s connect by statement these would be complicated anyway

2341310
http	ssl
export compliance specialist that sending information over http is forcing the data to go through a secure channel from ssl therefore it falls under the u.s

i tried all combinations of opera 10 firefox 3.5 enctype multipart form-data no multipart form-data and dev server mod_wsgi

2341321

much better to spend your time testing the code that actually matters than becoming obsessive-compulsive about making every last line show up as green in emma or cobertura

2342058
strcpy	memcpy
see if any call to functions like memcpy strcpy etc

2342058
pointers	stack
checked if some raw pointers arrays manipulation writes beyond it s boundary to cause a stack corruption

2342059
python	java
google-app-engine supports both python and java application development

2342063
selected	cell
click any cell in the row to selected the row

2342066
aggregate-functions	sum
with grouping by anything that isn t in the grouping by clause needs to be in an aggregate-functions count sum max etc in the selected statement

2342076
apache	vhosts
to get a really nice looking url you really need either mod_rewrite which can be done without .htaccess instead the rules would go into your apache vhosts configuration file or with one of the iis url-rewriting product

2342100
handler	service
what you need to do is upload the data to the server either via a wcf service or an ashx handler or such

2342111
python	java
can i run java and python code in the same .app

2342111
python	java
each versioning of the .app must specify a runtime language and it is possible to have versioning x of your .app running java while versioning y is running python

2342148
any	set
just as an fyi item you can also drop the panels on a form put any other controls on it positioning them set caption etc

2342159
concatenation	comma
i guess you wanted to concatenation the string pieces to form the entire error messages .so you ll have to use the dot instead of comma

2342164
git-repo	repo
considering the git limits a repo per clearcase-ucm component is the right size for a git-repo

2342164
revision	svn
no need to import all the history of clearcase which has no notion of repository baseline unlike the svn revision

2342173
scala	java
which way could this be done in scala at the moment i am using the defaulttablemodel from java libs

2342182
contains	elements
.so i made a wrapper div with a 1000px width to contains most of my body elements except the footer

2342187
environment	building
this may be especially helpful if you are developing some kind of platform that your customers users may deploy in custom environment unspecified at .war building time

2342192
document	editing
under specify the document and item events to audit checked editing items

2342223
textbox	button
there is a textbox and button

2342223
textbox	button
the user types the search and presses the button which fires some javascript that gets the text from the textbox and post to searchresults accordingly

2342224
asp.net-mvc	wcf
today s frameworks like wcf and asp.net-mvc have a good support for restful tree-structures

2342236
getter	setter
the distinction is important because the setter and getter methods usually don t just assign or get the value but rather retain the value

2342258
javascript	dom
i guess the important thing to realise is that a lot of what you do in javascript is actually just working with the dom

2342258
javascript	dom
the javascript language is great but the dom is rubbish

2342258
javascript	dom
.so the distinction isn t between using javascript or using jquery it s more about using the dom vs using jquery

2342277
javascript	dom
learn javascript loops types prototype and just forget the dom methods because jquery is more elegant for that

2342278
contains	set
.so that it gets the category as a set then the subcategory is a subset of this for example i have a category of eg which contains two subcategory eg-eg and eg-ie which themselves are a list of category codes for example

2342296
ssas	olap
ssas - analysis service for olap

2342298
configuration	logging
the points of having different priorities is to allow you to turn up down the level of detail on a particular component in a reasonably fine-grained way - and only needing to change the logging configuration rather than code to see the difference

2342300
javascript	dom
learn javascript first and about dom object literals closures and currying

2342300
.when	ready
.when you master these things you are ready to use a libs

2342307
configuration	logging
this will depend on the logging configuration

2342312
populate	row
.when i populate an arrayadapter at first the rows in the visible part of the screens will be blank except the first row which will be an undesired result

2342312
imageview	textview
here what i have tried is to put the value in the object of class home into two textview and an imageview which may vary upon the value returned by variables item.type_text

2342320
design-time	designer
works very well in the designer since it allows you to switching tabs at design-time and drop controls on each tab

2342332
export	report
i m having problems export a 3305 page report 95000 recording using cr 8 to rtf

2342332
export	report
.when export a large .doc the report module hang at about 63 of the export process

2342332
export	report
the customer wants this feature to work and is not presently willing to filtering the report and export in smaller chunks the nature of their work required them to have it as one single document with a single date stamp at the bottom of the page and other reasons.

2342332
worksheet	excel
i think excel is only good up to 65000+ recording per worksheet

2342368
google-chrome	firefox
also i get the same behavior between google-chrome and firefox

2342378
scala	java
the appalling java generics on the rowsorter are annoying .when used with scala

2342386
autocad	cad
i have work a couple of years at developing my own dxf-viewer in java you could drop your own dxf file or an url on the viewer for 2d drawings. br the published information from autocad is a good base but doesn t explain how it works. br becoming member of the open design alliance will give you the possibility to convert several cad formats to dxf

2342399
command-line	cmd
you can provide the desired database in the command-line and skip the cmd against the other databases using

2342418
vistadb	ado.net
i am reading the database-schema for vistadb 4.0 database using the standards ado.net dbconnection.getschema api

2342420
output	mode
batch-file mode results in nontabular output format and escaping of special characters

2342422
selected	button
at the bottom of each page of 20 recording is the selected button

2342423
quirks-mode	doctype
ie6 will fall into quirks-mode if you put anything including an xml-declaration before the doctype

2342426
32-bit	64bit
32-bit vs 64bit

2342431
value	field
i would like to construct a view where i have additional columns where the value will be extraction from the field above

2342490
constructor	object
the album constructor would automatically set the properties that are unique to album object based on what was loaded .when creating myobject album

2342496
silverlight	wpf
considering that silverlight is a subset of wpf there are many potential issues

2342496
silverlight	wpf
that being said if you are determined to do a ports then you need to do a namespace analysis to validation that all of the namespaces you are using in your wpf .app exist within the silverlight runtime

2342496
silverlight	wpf
silverlight 4 brings more parity to the party in that it allows you to run as a trusted desktop .app and brings more of the wpf functionality in but still not equals

2342504
base-class	accessor	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	accessor
edit modified my misleading title -- i am hoping to find a solution that doesn t involve code-generation or copy-paste techniques and rather to be able to write the skeleton of the code once in a base-class in some form and have it be initializer into lots of subclassing as the accessor for various properties

2342527
extends	super
since this mixed list is consuming items of types a or b i applied bloch s pecs rules producer extends consumer super to determine that i need here

2342528
order	add
work that out and based on that perhaps add some columns that will be used only for order

2342533
postback	ajax
however i haven t used this code in quite a while because i typically do ajax postback now to avoid this problem

2342538
javascript	dom
if you re going to work with the dom as admittedly most do since most javascript is used for client-side web development then jquery will be helpful

2342538
javascript	dom
however don t confuse it with the language javascript - jquery is just another libs for dom access albeit a very ubiquitous and imho great one

2342551
contains	elements
you want to be able to guarantee that items which you fetch are of types a .so it can t be as that could be a contains non-a elements

2342558
put	get
then to get them from javascript strings into images you d have to use data urls which don t work in ie6-ie7 and are limited to how much data you can put in them

2342601
key-value	key
writing a scalar function which receives the string contains the key-value pairs and the index of the value to get or the key of the value to get as its arguments and returns the appropriate value would make your problem easily solvable

2342612
required	checked
double checked your modules description with the interfaces they should offer to other modules and see if this required change to the original task list and how this affects the data they manage

2342618
push	pull
and the general advice seems to be to do a pull then a push

2342633
while-loop	infinite
i m getting an infinite while-loop in .when i try to validation if the first character entered is a letter

2342644
lookup	any
paxdiablo is correct and you can t guess the algorithm without making any other assumption or just having the whole sample spaces - then you can defined the algorithm by a lookup table

2342652
cassini	iis
is this page hosted by the visual-studio personal webserver cassini or iis

2342662
selected	button
click the add button and selected your .gwt.xml file

2342684
silverlight	wpf
between command-pattern and the loose binding that wpf and silverlight use i don t feel that abstraction would be useful

2342691
textbox	button
can any one guide me how to show whole textbox with button after appearence of keyboard

2342712
virtual-machine	vmware
i run vmware on centos and run vista on that and have flexbuilder install in the virtual-machine

2342714
defined	declare
this should be read as declare a variables patient1 and defined it to be a hash and in this store the value red under the key symbols ruby

2342721
value	field
in the mean time if you use references instead of mutable field you can shorten this up because references are first class value field are not

2342754
firefox	safari
firefox safari etc

2342761
arrays	loops
each time through loops you alloc a new arrays

2342769
arrays	loops
you can either autorelease the arrays or release it at the end of loops

2342779
python	java
write another .app in java publishing it as a web-services and call it from python but that s not what you are looking for

2342801
ciimage	nsimage
i m sorry i don t really know why your code doesn t work but approaching it a different way and i think more efficiently than your cvimagebuffer to ciimage to nsciimagerep to nsimage to nsdata albeit at a slightly low-level -

2342826
stderr	stdout
i have a program that writes information to stdout and stderr and i need to grep through what s coming to stderr while disregarding stdout

2342841
stderr	stdout
first redirect stderr to stdout â the pipe

2342841
stderr	stdout
then redirect stdout to dev-null without changing where stderr is going

2342841
stderr	stdout
the operation makes file-descriptor 2 aka stderr refer to the same open file description as file-descriptor 1 aka stdout is currently referring to see dup2 and open

2342841
file-descriptor	pipe	file-descriptor	dev-null	dev-null	pipe
the operation then changes file-descriptor 1 .so that it refers to an open file description for dev-null but that doesn t change the fact that file-descriptor 2 refers to the open file description which file-descriptor 1 was originally points to â namely the pipe

2342881
any	set
is there any way i can set the spacing of that underland

2342895
constructor	object
the object you re returning uics probably doesn t have a blank constructor

2342918
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
add next back links that use javascript to hide the current image and show the next one

2342921
any	set
where page was the page part of the url params were any form parameters only get was supported not .post which prevented file upload and thus made burning the flash a pain udata is a token passed in that was set .when you registered the function .so you could have the same function serve multiple urls or ranges with different data and resp is a file handle that you write the http response headers and all out to

2342923
python	ruby
think of as the kind of thing that s hard to express in python or ruby

2342923
python	ruby
much of the rest you can live without and use python or ruby and you ll be happier and more productive

2342924
value	field
.so basically the behavior i m trying to implements is if a field is left blank or is assign a value equals the calculated one use the calculated value otherwise store the assign value

2342929
calayer	uiview
drawing in a view actually draw on its layer and likewise drawing in a calayer that backs a uiview will appear to draw to the view

2342954
json	xml
which protocols to use - json soap xml any other

2342957
linux	unix
in a unix like os such as linux the windows manager is even a completely different user-space process

2342970
filtering	grouping
on c# winforms project i have a small table a filtering box an add button and a done button grouping together and they all fit together within 250x250 pixels

2342970
button	popup
i figured this could be done using a popup modal screens or by making room on the main screens until the user presses the done button

2342971
subtyping	generics
the compiler won t let you assign a subtyping in to a super-type listing using generics

2342974
put	get
i know it loads and execute tags .when a page loads and that you can attach functions to various windows events but where things get fuzzy is .when for instances i retrieve a remote page via ajax and put its contents into a div

2342976
android-emulator	adb	android-emulator	ddms	ddms	adb
if this is on the android-emulator use ddms file explorer or adb pull to downloading a copy of the database file and confirm its contents

2342979
python	perl
personnaly i prefer using perl or python for such tasks

2343006
gridview	listview
then i would also like the ability to click the button and change the listview back to a gridview with column headers

2343007
value	field
for an int field foo the c++ output from protoc will include a methods void set_foo int32 value in the class for the given messages

2343011
twitter	gmail
then i tried to know functionality on gmail and twitter

2343014
swt	rcp	jface	rcp	jface	swt
i would like to adopt this same look in my rcp .app but i can t find in the swt or jface apis anywhere how to force the widget to use this slimmer look

2343051
defined	declare
if that happens and myfct.js declare myfunction it will not be defined .when we try to use it with the inline scripting

2343058
javascript	dom
you can also create the table programmatically with javascript by using the dom to create a tablerow cell and control elements

2343065
http	ssl
if i have a web application and i receive credit-card data transmitted via a .post request by a web browser over http and instantly open a socket ssl to a remote pci compilant card processor to forwarding the data and wait for a response am i allowed to do that

2343071
instances	private
one solution is to declare some uialertview as private class instances like that

2343137
jquery	dojo
however you can downloading and install any javascript libs such as jquery dojo prototype etc that will help you do ajax

2343144
multiplication	addition
the only reason to use the log-likelihood instead of the plain old likelihood is mathematical convenience because it lets you turn multiplication into addition

2343146
contains	set
this product contains the complete set of vector re-usable boundaries for urban areas and settlements in england and wales

2343150
contains	elements
you should handle this case and decide what numbers you want to put into rownumbers you can put -1 to indicate that the corresponding column contains no non-zero elements

2343152
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
openoffice.org has extensive documentation on the binary format for the excel spreadsheet here this is a pdf document which outline the biff layout and structure

2343162
http	ssl
pci-dss section 4.1 for example required encryption .when transmitting over public open networks which you have covered with ssl and http at both ends

2343162
antivirus	security
while there are sections you can ignore since you don t store the card data there are other sections that deal with things like network security firewalls antivirus access-control monitor and tracking testing etc

2343190
filtering	grouping
you need to use having for filtering grouping value

2343197
stderr	stdout
this api lets you specify a lot of startup options among which there is the possibility to redirect stdin stdout stderr but will only start executable

2343197
stderr	stdout
and it can t redirect stdin stdout stderr

2343197
required	checked
the console is allocated reused inside createprocess actually iirc it has to do with the windows pe loader that checked the required subsystem in the pe header

2343197
stderr	stdout
iirc for gui applications stdout stdin stderr are just bit buckets they points to nothing useful and all io to them is discarded

2343197
stderr	stdout
the windows std streaming are the ones that are redirected .when you specify stdin stdout stderr redirection in createprocess

2343197
stderr	stdout
the crt stdin stdout stderr finally are yet another abstraction built by the c runtime libs

2343217
hide	show
it works fine but i want to show and hide a div with rounded corners

2343251
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it required an adobe account free and gives you firefox 2.0 - 3.5 winxp osx ie 6-8 winxp safari 3-4 osx and google-chrome 3.0 winxp

2343254
markup	xhtml
starting with a semantics clean xhtml file and using xslt to inject both the css stylesheet and any non-semantic markup required by it

2343254
google-chrome	firefox
browser support for the pi seems decent but i haven t found anyway to triggers alternate stylesheets via javascript or browser user-interface firefox google-chrome

2343257
hide	show
using jquery i am trying to create a function to show and hide the div below the table tr that has been click but .when i click in one all the divs will sliderup also slider down it is not working

2343292
communication	messages
but after i hit refresh i get requesting... at the bottom of the screens and the progress-bar goes slooooowly logarithmically approaching the end - which indicates that it doesn t actually do anything except waiting on something and once it reaches the end which takes several minutes an error messages is display saying a communication failure occurred with the selected mobile data service

2343293
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
all major engines mysql postgresql oracle and sql-server will optimize it to exactly same plans

2343333
calling-convention	dllimport
dllimport project1.dll calling-convention calling-convention.stdcall

2343334
push	pull
developers always push to the testing repository but only pull from the mainline .so they only ever pull in tested code

2343334
push	pull
if they need to shared untested changeset they could push pull directly between each other s local repositories

2343345

in adition consider that stored-procedures are an api for access for everything including ssis tasks maintenance and etl jobs other applications deployed on the database etc

2343467
primitive	int
conn.getresponsecode returns a primitive int which can t be null

2343474
mouseover	mouseout
you have to handle the mouseover and mouseout events at the table level and find the tr or td tag that was the source of the event and do any behavior at this points

2343489
subclassing	superclass
i don t think it s possible to simply cast an object of subclassing into superclass and then serialization it

2343493
filtering	sorting
i have a page with a datatable with sorting and filtering functionalities both taking place in the db

2343493
filtering	sorting
the only session-scoped beans contains the sorting and filtering of my interface

2343528
margins	padding
i tried adding smaller height in styles removing all margins padding etc and nothing seems to help

2343535
superclass	inherited
the class is a simple class having field that are only int strings and floats and inherited similar field from one parent superclass

2343547
return-type	arguments
however the function you re passing can t be applied this way because the return-type doesn t match the arguments types

2343551
constructor	object
the constructor only starts running after a piece of memory exists for the object instances to exist in although it doesn t fully exist until the constructor finishes

2343555
any	set
edit after looking at the treeloader source it looks like you should overrides requestdata to properly set the url based on the nodes and you ll probably want to change getparams to either return nothing or any special query-string params you have

2343563
subclassing	superclass
you can transfer with above code object which are instances of superclass or any of its subclassing

2343574
javascript	dom
if you don t feel like learning xpath you can use the same old-school dom walking techniques you would use with javascript in the browser

2343583
derived-class	base-class
you could overrides tostring in a base-class then use reflection on the instances to discover the public properties of the derived-class

2343585
dlopen	dlsym
it is also possible to load the libs s weak symbols using dlopen and dlsym and pass the call on if necessary

2343603
32-bit	64bit
i wonder if the charset auto is confusing things...like it default to ansi on 32-bit but unicode on 64bit and something is going wrong somewhere in the middle

2343607
attributes	properties
the virtualpath attributes basically says go compile that other file first and the result-of its compilation will be the types of this page s master properties

2343607
attributes	properties	base-class	inherited
if you just want to use different properties that are declare in different master pages the you can take nick craver and nathan taylor s advice and declare a base-class that would have all those field properties and have all your master pages inherited from that base-class and then have your mastertype directive specify that base-class via typename attributes

2343609
hide	show
.when the linearlayout is show i want to detection if the user click anywhere outside of the panels .so that i can hide it again

2343615
keyboard	mouse

2343616
selectedindex	selecteditem
i already used selectedvalue selecteditem selectedindex but they all return the string representation of my object

2343643
subclassing	superclass
in concepts of oo subclassing is always a superclass

2343649
environment	building
you can also set building it using the following instructions iphone development guide - specifying the buildingtime environment

jquery	.post
user submit form to scripting via jquery .post

2343838

my goal is to take a collections of checkbox textbox pairs and for all of the checked pairs i would like to create a key-value pair of the checkbox s value and the associated textbox s value

2343913
checkbox	textbox
i already the data being sent from the form in a manageable format which will allow me to relate a given checkbox to a specific textbox it s just a matter of figuring out how to get all the pieces where i need them

2343914

that means that i have to issue the request from wicket facilities and not from external clients like http-unit htmlunit selenium

2343920
constructor	object
object are initializer by their original constructor

2343957
textarea	textbox
during the function that hide the text and display the textarea you could sniff for the dimension of the cell and resize the textbox to match

2343957
textarea	textbox
and of course if you want to use a textarea instead of a textbox you can sniff set the height just as easilly with height .offsetheight respectively

2343961
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have to use this control on a webforms page since its a server control although this is actually a asp.net-mvc project

python	c++
write it in python .profile it and if you need to speed parts of it up write them in c++

2344106
python	c++
python and c++ are similar enough that the familiar advantage with c++ will be irrelevant pretty quick

2344106
python	c++
i say this as someone who has developed primarily in c++ and has recently gotten serious with python

2344106
python	c++
i like them both but i can get python code working a lot faster than c++

2344106
dictionary	map
seriously dictionary beats std map in usability

2344108
managed-code	native-code
if not then it s possible the program is simply crash out in native-code and execution never properly returns to managed-code

2344109
jquery	.post
i am working on an application which send an ajax .post request i m using jquery currently every 1500ms

2344113

2344202
contains	any
any panels provides the same functionality as delphi s frame a composite contains other controls

2344203

subversion git and all version-control software solve all of these problems for you

2344216
selected	button
particularly i d like the button to look flat unless the user rolls over them or they are selected like in eclipse

2344228
default-value	arguments
note that getattr also takes an optional arguments that allows you to return a default-value in case the requested action doesn t exist

2344235
value	field
apparently that one has issues with datetime field and does present an incorrect value

2344246
scalatest	mockito
if you like scalatest s featurespec syntax and specifications mockito syntax for example you can put both jar files in your classpath and use both at the same time

2344246
scalatest	junit
one other philosophical difference is that i do try and make it just slightly easier in scalatest to use a functional styles .when you need to shared a fixtures whereas specifications by default continue the tradition of the setup and teardown approach popularized by junit in which you reassign variables before each test

2344251
.when	ready
don t know exactly how this would work out in javascript but you could create a list or arrays of your request fifo types of list .so .when ready you push your request or whatever value needed to create your request into the arrays after set interval you take from the arrays and send request

2344255
order	add
one way would be to include a timestamp sent with the javascript and on the receiving end you could add each call to a queue which you then execute after order it by timestamp desc

2344256
directory	folder
however you will need to make sure the dll is either in the same folder as your executable or in a directory that is in your systemd path

2344262
prerequisites	installshield
this project uses installshield s bootstrapper to install several setup prerequisites

2344262

i tried putting the labels inside the input but firefox and google-chrome at least seems to parsing them as siblings even though they re clearly nested in the input source

2344276
put	get
it seems i get an error if i try to put anything in the size parameter above 8000

2344277
32-bit	64bit
then in x64 buildinging set one project to building 64bit and the other 32-bit

2344277
32-bit	x86
in x86 building set one as 32-bit and turn off the other.

2344280
revision	svn
svn s linear revision numbers are -bad-

2344281
hash	md5
.so if you want to cheat in your ps3 game you ll first have to hack that passwd out of the md5 hash i guess

2344283
any	set
the characters valid in a url are represented in any character set i know of and i wouldn t use different collations between tables and columns - you ll get illegal mix of collations problems on any attempt to join them or perform any other kind of cross-column or cross-table operation see my recent problem here

2344299
json	xml
why not ask your clients to set the accept header to application xml or application json depending on what format they want

2344424
hide	show
i want a conditional that asks if the div newsinfo also has the class jopen then show else hide

2344434
ref	out
this is because tryparse uses an out parameter not a ref parameter

2344436
solaris	linux
on solaris os and linux a .profile is also generator .when a quit signals is received kill -quit pid

2344438
put	get
int.tryparse is safer since if you put something else in varstring for example fsfdsfs you would get an exception-handling

2344463
getter	setter
i do have a public setter getter for the mapper instances variables

2344468
unpivot	pivot

2344503
poppler	cairo
the plugins is using cmake s pkg_check_modules macros to find cairo and poppler libs

2344509
digits	base
one way to do it is to look at each possibility for digits matching as a digits in a numbers on base 4 and implements something close to a counter jumping over some instances since there are usually less than 4 letters mappable to a digits

2344520
swfupload	uploadify
you can try uploadify or swfupload

2344520
swfupload	uploadify
in my opinion uploadify easier to implements than swfupload and it is very customizable

instances	private
for instances the most open types would be is limited private

2344571
32-bit	64bit
i assume this is a .dll used by 64bit windows to replicate 32-bit os behavior .so i simply take the same scripting and do the conversion on the 32-bit xp

2344595
nstextview	nscell
by replicating the behavior of nscontrol and its nstextview superclass but in an nscell form you can filtering the events passed on to your sub-cells by location event types or other criterion

2344595
nsbuttoncell	nscell
.so in designing your interface you need to consider whether the nsbuttoncell and nstextfieldcell s are better off in nscontrol s in the normals view hierarchy or as sub-cells in your nscell subclassing

2344605
postback	ajax
i recommend an javascript-framework with ajax postback

this statement should do a shallow-copy in case of arrays of pointers .so please see the code of copy-constructor and the main function i have mentioned the problemes in the code

2344678
arrays	loops	contains	elements
the only way i can see to attack this is to create a text file contains all of the ticker symbolss having the program read that into an arrays and then run a loops that first opens the first filename in the arrays perform the calculations printing the output close the file then loopsback around moving to the second elements the next ticker symbols in the arrays

2344690
linux	osx
ideally you also have access to an osx linux systemd and can work on that

2344718
textbox	button
i ve done this with a textbox and a button and it seems to work fine

2344731
versioning	upgrade
however it is trade off .when we want to achieve this and our user really do not want to have file versioning details .when we uninstaller upgrade the patches

2344753
buildpath	libs
you could add the junit.jar you want to use as a file in your project add it to the buildpath and remove the eclipse defined junit libs from the buildpath assuming it was there

2344774
hardware	monitor
that seems like another possible alternative since it would put the responsibility for confirming availability of the fax hardware monitor the queue fault handling etc

make sure all of your database field contains languages are set to utf8-general-ci or at least one of the utf8 options i find general-ci best for my use

2344865
jms	jta
you will start from a simple webpage and then building toward a webservice with jpa jms jta ejb etc

2344882
constructor	object
or to forget about constructor you can just make a wrapper around object

2344888
value	field
i m using drupal s views 2 and need to retrieve min value from field in a custom table

2344890
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
as per this .so question you should actually place it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2344902
appfuse	spring	archetypes	appfuse
you could use one of the numerous appfuse archetypes hibernate spring and the presentation framework of your choise to create an appfuse application

2344902
archetypes	appfuse
if you want some guidance my recommendation would be to go for an appfuse archetypes

2344916
dictionary	map
you can also use a dictionary to map methods to actions

2344922
enumerator	any
the intriguing thing about .count is that it can be called on any enumerator regardless of whether the underlying class implements icollection or not or whether it has a count properties

2344945
arguments	default
by default perl consumes the command-line arguments as input files for

2344955
thickbox	jquery
take a look at the documentation on the thickbox website for more examples jquery thickbox

qmainwindow	qthread
this qthread is initializer in my qmainwindow class ie the gui thread i am not calling move to thread

2345027
arrays	map

2345047
arrays	loops
and then loops through the arrays

2345069
attributes	properties
the section grouping itself doesn t have any configuration properties or attributes - it s just a containers for configuration sections

2345069
contains	elements
the configurationsection is the item that can contains attributes elements collections etc

2345072
union-all	union
from the look on the query i can only suggest to split it in two by moving the or from join clause and use union-all to union the results

2345073
if-statement	loops
in the second section using the do-while loops you don t checked for eof before execution the if-statement

2345076
communication	messages
i am trying to get a wcf service configure with messages security no transport security such that it can communication with java clients

.when reading about benchmarking and performance-testing what are some red-flags to watch out for that might not represent real results

2345100
any	set
i ve tried doing an n -phase systemd where all rows are insert with any columns that are under foreign key constraint set to null

2345101
value	field
you should be setting the selectedvalue properties and and defining the value field as b in your databinding

2345103
base-class	inherited
if you use a lot of com object you could inherited from a base-class to handle the disposal

2345105

json	xml
setting cache-control no-cache on the xml and json response

2345155
firefox	safari
i ve seen it work fine with the latest versioning of firefox and safari but have had some problems with ie

2345164
xmldom	xpath
i know the logic with xpath but sql-server does not support the ancestor-or-self axis and xmldom seems to choke on the notation

2345164
order	add
the xpath should selected nodes with id 2 4 6 in any order .so i can add an attributes to all of them

2345164
contains	any
maybe finding all nodess that contains the specific nodes with id 6 at any depth

2345168
order	add
to be fully supported hash based collections would need to add hashequiv implicit parameters to their construction and use the implicit import equiv and hashof methods instead of the object instances methods like treeset etc do with the order traits but in reverse

2345170
put	get
if you put a breakpoints on a line the break occurs before that line gets execute .so it s no surprise that you don t get any data

2345171
arguments	default
php s setcookie has the arguments but it s fifth on the list .so you may need to set and to their default value inorder to get at it

2345176
httpd.conf	hosts
need to edit httpd.conf and add a virtual hosts

2345189
32-bit	64bit
multi-platform support linux 32-bit 64bit windows mac os x

2345204
click	mouse
the only thing i can think of is acting on a listselectionevent based on whether the selection is still changing the user is still click and dragging the mouse or whether the event represents the final selection event

2345229
enumerator	any
and i can pass any enumerator of to query and get back and an enumerator of which matches the query criterion

.so if you use rms users may have to reconfigure your application every time they upgrade to a new building versioning

2345330
python	c++
i d recommend moving to python rather than c++ if you re coming from a web design background

2345362
url-encoding	url
for example the character # must be encode within urls even in systemdd that do not normally deal with fragment or anchor identifier .so that if the url is copy-paste into another systemd that does use them it will not be necessary to change the url-encoding

2345376
spaces	output
.when i run into these issues i normally do .something like this to checked what my output is for example showing tabs versus spaces and .so forth

2345379
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
you could use a doubly-linked-list which is a linked-list that also stores the address of it s parent

2345382
arrays	loops
the easiest thing to do to skip the headers would to just remove them from the arrays after loops is done

2345423
digits	zero
if you required the binary strings to be a certain numbers of digits long keep leading zero then change x.to_s 2 to printf 04b x where 4 is the minimum numbers of digits to use

2345440
linked-list	arrays
create an empty arrays of size n a pointers into this arrays starting at index 0 and start iterator from the beginning of the linked-list

2345452
put	get
if not get the fulltext results and put them in the caching

2345471
touch-events	touch-event
my problem is that whenever the user drag their finger along the screens .so many touch-events get sent to the touch-event handler which i think runs as a separate thread that my frame-rate plummets

2345475
selected	button
based on what the user selected once they press the submit button they will be sent to the house form car form and or children form

mouseleave	mouseenter
i that design fpgui had to handle absolutely everything creating mouseenter mouseleave events translation co-ordinate systemd for containers components handle fake component focus states etc.

2345496
object-pascal	pascal
and yes fpgui is fully implements in the object-pascal language using the free pascal compiler to give me cross-platform support

2345505
selected	textbox
no circular references all previously selected items must be removed from the next textbox to be selected

2345507
perl	php
you could also not limit yourself and learn other useful languages such as java perl php and lisp

2345514
sigaction	signals
sigaction 2 could be used to setup handler functions to react to specific signals the sa_restart flag here affects whether certain systemd call are interrupted or restart

2345519
emacs	vim
but i sometimes alternate between emacs and vim and would like to have the same capabilities there

2345558
cross-compiling	toolchain
a cross-compiling toolchain allows compilation of code for the ps3 on windows which can be useful given the resource constraints systemd memory on a ps3 console running linux which can impact compile time and make the use of a ps3 as a desktop awkward

2345559
debugging	trace
with debugging mode there is a defined in-place you can confirm this by checked the building options .when you right click on the solution and selected properties which if used you can issue the trace call

2345574
attributes	properties
i created a dummy validation attributes who s isvalid overload always returns true and used this attributes on a properties

2345574
attributes	properties
now you need to attach the dummy validation attributes to a properties

2345600
associations	model
i have a bidirectional one-to-many associations in my domain model where i m using jpa annotations and hibernate as the persistent provider

2345600
value	field
unfortunately hibernate won t save value assign to the parentid field due to which it required .when the same column is mapped to multiple properties

2345600
value	field
is there any nice way to go behind hibernate s back and sneak value into that field without having to drop down to jdbc or implements an interceptor

2345608
selected	button
i have settled on learning the first example involving starting a worker thread .when the particular button is selected

2345618
twitter	tweets
is there an api twitter api does not provide this that i can use to determine the most common links in 200 tweets for example

2345618
twitter	bit.ly	twitter	tweets	tweets	bit.ly
what i want to do is to get the latest 200 tweets and then determine what are people talking about i am sure that the tweets will contains links because i will ask the twitter api to return tweets that contains links only but i will also want to make sure that my code will understand that two urls are the same even if they have different bit.ly links

2345644
.when	ready
.when you are ready to query you create temp-tables to store aggregate data

2345651

in modern bash shell there are also associativity arrays

2345652
enterprise	platform
and also the hidden costs of building on enterprise software platform

2345661
any	set	arguments	default
you can put a set of default options if you have any at the points where i wrote your default options go here but any arguments that you provide to tidy will be append to the perltidy command-line overrides your default

2345661
arguments	default
if you use a .perltidyrc you might not have default arguments -- that s fine -- but then again you might want to have a default like that sets up default only for .when you re working in vim

2345671
build-process	msbuild
you can achieve this by creating a msbuild project file master.proj that controls the build-process as illustrated in the following example

2345688
specifications	w3c
knowledge of w3c s specifications

2345692
void	main
public static void main string arguments

2345697
web-config	app-config
for connection strings the commonengine in turn looks not to the app-config but to the website s web-config file that s my own preferences -- i prefer to have our production constants all in one place

2345697
web-config	app-config
what s the proper test logic here to use app-config .when a web-config file cannot be found

2345710
windows-server	windows
we are getting the error below calling c windows syswow64 regsvr32.exe on windows-server 2008 r2 x64

2345748

why not simply show or hide the form elements as required rather than redirect to other potentially-multiple subsequent forms

2345750
utility	gnu

2345838
contains	any	contains	elements
either blabla or is not an object and thus can t contains any elements

2345846
derived-class	base-class
other c++ casts take care of adjusting these .when say down-casting from pointers to base-class to pointers to derived-class reinterpret_cast and c-style casts don t

2345861
buffering	streaming
basically just take some inputstreaming could be something like a socket.getinputstreaming and have the streaming s buffering autmoatically redirect to standards out

2345862
duplicates	lookup
.so i can easily do a if x in set lookup and eliminate duplicates

2345867
buildpath	libs
another way to do that is to edit the java buildpath right click on the project and selected properties and remove your android libs if there are more than one remove them all

2345873
display	height
if the elements is hidden by changing the display css styles to none then the elements doesn t take spaces on the page and you will have to give it a display styles which will cause the elements to rendering in some spaces at which points you can get the height

2345878
any	set	log4net-configuration	nlog	log4net-configuration	log4net	log4net	nlog
my problem however is that there s a dependency on log4net or nlog and i can t find any documentation on how to configure it to either integrated with my current log4net-configuration or remove it altogether set the logging to null .so i don t conceivably have two log4net-configurations running

2345898
interface-builder	iboutlet
you could give the button a named in the class info tab of the inspector windows in interface-builder then declare it as an iboutlet in your .app delegation

2345906
type-safety	generics
you cannot avoid a cast because the sdk you are writing to which is not your code was not designed for c++ much less type-safety and needs the casting to provide generics parameter types with a c binding

2345907
duplicates	elements
this is how you remove duplicatess and maintain the order if you care algorithm - how to delete duplicates elements in a list efficiently

2345918

python	java	python	c++
of course i m biased because bruce s a friend and a fellow python enthusiast but his books on java and c++ are very and justly popular on their own anyway quite apart from my bias

2346025
python	c++
web apps are not the typical field for c++ use although of course you can use any language you prefer i don t even know of a popular widespread c++ framework for web apps -- and i m pretty expert at c++ even though these days i do much more python excellent language for web apps btw

2346028
python	php
c# asp.net is better for website but if you re really a beginner you ll want to start by learning html and then javascript php c# asp.net and or python

2346068
variables	boolean
created a boolean variables in conditional explorer called recent year with the following expression

2346069
factors	matrix
incidently .when the stiffness factors tends towards infinite the resulting vector becomes a binary matrix hence making the fcm model identical to that of the k-means

2346069
multiplication	exponentiation
with regards to performance the fcm therefore needs to perform k numbers of clusters multiplication for each points for each dimension not count also the exponentiation to take stiffness into account

2346218
expression-blend	designer
things like code-generation with t4 templates ligth mvvm frameworks use expression-blend hire a designer to hanle ux

2346222
arrays	map
if you were making something like that table which is just a grid i would try to map the leds to a 2d arrays

2346222

this loops would contains another set of loopss that iterates through each pixels in that arrays and writes the color in each elements out to the corresponding hardware

2346223
abstract-class	subclassing
but in its basic and common form a class using pimpl points to a single implementation .so there is no abstract-class with distinct subclassing â just one class forwarding declare and compiled elsewhere

2346225
32-bit	64bit
if you re bit tired and types in something like it will actually compile -- and produce some worthless result -- typically something like an 8 or 16 digits hexadecimal numbers 8 digitss on a 32-bit systemd 16 digitss on a 64bit systemd

2346232

2346343
google-chrome	firefox
ie versioning 6 and firefox and google-chrome all support full 8bit transparency pngs but for ie6 compatibility you have to do the above css-hack

2346422
contains	set	value	field
you need to set it to the named of the field as opposed to the value as the binding mechanism uses the properties descriptor framework to figure out how to map those strings to the properties columns which contains the data

2346430
json	xml
our .app provides some data xml json and we need that cms display this data on some static pages i m thinking of javascript gadgets that just connect to our grails same-host-same-port-different-context .app

it s also fine to have the controllers s main view be a containers uiview and have a uitableview as a subviews of that

2346443
linux	unix
sshfs is a linux unix feature and microsoft does all it can to not make it work on windows after all that would allow to easily and securely migrate from windows to linux

2346443
virtualization	virtualbox
you need to set the virtualbox network adaptor to bridged mode to make sshfs work with virtualization

2346454
nsurlconnection	nsurlcache
does nsurlconnection take advantage of nsurlcache

2346466
virtualbox	vmware
.vdi is a virtualbox supported format but not supported by vmware

2346466
virtualbox	vmware
the .vmdk files are vmware images - you should be able to load them fine using the vmware tool virtualbox supports these too but the converse is not true

2346470

python	c++
if you honestly wanted to implements something roughly similar to his python example in c++ i think something like this would be closer

2346607
python	c++
this does essentially the same thing as the python does and is about the same length as well -- the c++ has more syntactic fluff but they have exactly the same numbers of line-of-code that really do anything though there s no question that the individual line in the c++ versioning are longer

2346607
python	c++
don t get me wrong i m certainly not trying to claim that development with c++ will be as quick or easy as with python

2346607
python	c++
...along with a factually accurate though grossly misleading claim like the c++ code has only half as many statements as the python implementation.

2346622
arrays	loops
programming construct like loops variables arrays are pretty common and standards you will recognize instantly how to use them straight away

2346639

2346658
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
the c-style cast will work like a static_cast would if the code had used public inherited instead of private -- it s aware of where in the derived-class each base-class object lives and adjusts the result .so each resulting pointsers will work because it s been adjusted to points at the right place

2346722
contains	set
i need to store a big hash set able to contains up to approx 200 millions 40 bit value

compatibility	platform
the api is easy to maintain usable from a variety of platform and ensuring backwards compatibility is reasonably straightforward

2347031
environment	building
perhaps it is possible to building an environment where you always start from scratch a virtual-machine but it may not be possible

2347042
stderr	stdout
doesn t interfere with stdout stdin or stderr

2347053
javascript	dom
the browser does http call on a background-thread and you use javascript to modify the dom .when the result returns

oracle	mysql
i would recommend sqlyog but there is a more professional tool navicat lite for mysql it has versioning for other sql too like oracle or sql-front

2347243
python	ruby
of course it would have been possible to automate this with a scripting-language like python or ruby but it would have taken far longer to write and would be less flexible - the last example would have been difficult since regex alone would not be able to handle nested brackets to convert bar foo xxx to foo xxx .bar

2347252
variables	boolean
and you can also remove the boolean checked for the variables in the while conditional

unfortunatelly my eclipse installation is about 260mb big but i assume that a pde building does not required all of those plugins in a standards eclipse installation

2347535
installation	building
all of my dependencies i actually have in a custom target-platform folder .so i guess the only thing i need from my eclipse installation are the dependencies which pde building actually needs

2347538
contains	elements	value	field
i binding the properties of the new entity to input elements use the value properties where backing bean is jsf managed mean and newentity is field of the backing bean whcih contains a new instances of my entity

2347540
getter	setter
automatically generator setter and getter

2347541
notepad++	textpad	syntax-highlighting	komodoedit	komodoedit	notepad++
are you looking for an editor with syntax-highlighting then textpad komodoedit notepad++ are good

2347543
silverlight	wpf
.when i added the silverlight dll in the wpf application i got the following exception-handling

2347555
ruby	php
if you are asking about a more general web editor html javascript and you are more likely to be using php or ruby you really need to give a try to pspad

2347562
visual-studio	release-mode
it works perfectly in debugging mode or in release-mode .when launchd from within visual-studio but the release-mode binary usually crash .when launchd manually from the command-line not always

2347569
silverlight	wpf
you cannot use silverlight directly in a wpf application as they do not use the same versioning of the .net thus the error messages

2347569
silverlight	wpf
if you have a wpf .app you have more than what silverlight can give to you

2347569
silverlight	wpf
if you are building a solution with multiple product and one is wpf for the desktop one is silverlight for the web you need to create 2 different project in vs

2347575
value	field
exception-handling in thread main net.sf.jasperreports.engine.jrexception-handling error retrieving field value from bean varchar at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.jrabstractbeandatasource.getbeanproperty jrabstractbeandatasource.java 123

2347582
value	field
in the admin site a pop-up display allowing the user to submit a new field and then that new value is populate on the original form

2347582
directory	folder
it s currently in an admin directory outside of my project folder

2347593
contains	elements
it contains the following error root elements is missing

2347596
bluetooth	usb
bluetooth and wifi and even rndis usb connections are all network interfaces and therefore will be enumerated

2347601
carbon	cocoa
you can building cocoa carbon based applications on xcode but these won t compile run on vs

2347601
emacs	vim
all in all xcode is your best shot at an ide if you re not a vim emacs fan

2347640
carbon	cocoa
this is because you re now using native cocoa versus the previous carbon implementation

2347647
versioning	upgrade
i can see how i can manually building an msbuilding file that call candle and then lighting but i need to make it building install that can do upgrade .so can i use the buildinglabel or .something of that area to regenerate new guids for the newer versioning

2347650
attributes	properties
my problem is i d like to use the my custom resourcemanager solution to fetch validation error messages .when for example using the required attributes on a properties

2347653
any	set
from memory i think it isn t set by default it will overwrite any existing dom id which could mess up your css if you are using dom id selectors

2347669
selected	cell	input-field	selected
-single-click on a row doesn t make the cell show a text input-field only selected the row

2347669
selected	cell	input-field	selected
-clicking a cell in an already selected row show a text input-field ready to be edited

2347681
value	field
if you put on the field then validation should fail before the value can be assign

2347685
google-chrome	firefox
case in points i wanted to rent a movie from itunes the other day and since itunes itself is an ab.solute dog on my windows-xp netbook we re talking press pgdn and wait five seconds -- this on a netbook that will happily play video and run complex ajax-rich website even in ie i thought hey i bet i can browse this stuff on the web and .so went into a browser i can t recall whether it was firefox or google-chrome and tried to do .so

2347685
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome or firefox using a protocols handler it s never seen me use before to launchd a third-party .app without .so much as an do you really want to run this

2347690
contains	elements
what i want to do is have an html document object which contains an arrays of all form elements as one of its properties

2347712
windows-server	windows-vista
sharepoint 2007 required windows-server but sharepoint 2010 can be install on windows-vista and 7

2347736
.when	ready
.when you are ready to defined the elements in greater detail then class html-object becomes interface ihtml-object and you then create specialized classes for each tag

2347751
constructor	object
if you have a constructor then all members that had been construct will be destroy correctly via destructor while unitialised object will not be touch and the memory for the current object will be release as if never allocated another good reason to use the initializer list

2347751
constructor	object
you pass the factory object to the constructor

2347793
listbox	textbox
the aspx code for the panels is huge hundreds of line long but it basically looks like this simple example only with lots more asp textbox and asp listbox

2347793
listbox	textbox
the worst bit is that it doesn t do it in this simple example nor even in a page that i created that had all the original asp textbox and asp listbox but filled with dummy data

2347830
order	add
now i want to add another parameter order

2347834
malloc	free
it s like in c where you can malloc a certain amount of memory and free afterwards - the runtime will have to manage to know the size allocated previously

2347842
webforms	asp.net
application is written in asp.net webforms 3.5 sp1

2347846
selected	checkbox
while i am insert the checkbox selected list item to the database-table i am getting this error error converting data types nvarchar to bit in the table i have a field called disease with bit datatypes

2347846
selected	checkbox
here is selected checkbox item code pls somebody points me out where is my error or give some new idea how can i do the same in better way..

2347858
average	max
for document of less than 256k on average storing them in a varbinary max column seems to be the best fit

2347868
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
and as iâ ve mentioned before this error does not occur in ie opera safari google-chrome

2347869
markup	xhtml
my conclusion was and i believe it still stands today that even though xhtml and css are meant to be isolated from each other as content and presentation respectively the reality of the matter still makes the look of the website pretty much depend on the document structure - markup xhtml - and thus css alone will not give you the magic wand to make your website change its look completely based on a stylesheet

2347893
32-bit	64bit
a long-long types is at least 64bit a long types is at least 32-bit

2347906
log4net	nlog
i believe you can choose between nlog and log4net

2347910
if-statement	loops
if you are capable of coding using only variables for assignment if-statement for decisions and for loops for looping your code execution will be far faster

2347913
document-management	alfresco	documentum	alfresco
document-management systemd such as documentum and alfresco store the files on a shared and this allows you great flexibility with respects to backup and and redundant storage

2347926
subclipse	collabnet
i use eclipse 64bit with subclipse a collabnet for merging.

2347927
concatenation	comma
using comma instead of concatenation saves you some memory due to php not having to concatenation at all but just flushing whatever you throw at echo

2347933
contains	lookup
the other is a dynamic web project which contains the jsp from which i do a jndi lookup to get the stateless session bean

2347938
checkbox	textbox
and have you checked what happens if you have both a textbox and a checkbox with the same named

2347956
profiling	debugging
on my setup i get a numbers of different dlls loaded during debugging due to profiling and typemock which essentially does its magic via the profiling hooks

2347958
.when	ready
consider that we ve a class named foo that fires ready event .when it s ready

2347958
.when	ready
now it fires ready event .when it s taskpool fires success event

2347993
python	java
your example won t work with java or python .so i have corrected and annotations your main

2347995
nvidia	ati
whether you have an nvidia or ati card might also make a difference as they don t always support the same extensions

2347998
installation	environment
just add an environment variables points to the platform directory under your birt installation

2348042
default-value	default
javascript has for retrieving the default-value stored value from page load of an input even if you wipe the input and replace the contents you can still get the default back

2348044
communication	messages
in oop object don t necessarily communication with each other by passing messages

2348045
subclassing	base-class
i want to call a function from a base-class member and have it resolve to the subclassing versioning

2348059
jquery	.post
this would need a lot of changing and rewriting but you can create a new easing function for jquery and .post it to animate

2348060
rollback	commit
the only thing you ll do that will have an impact is .when you ll commit or rollback

2348069
communication	messages
object communication by sending and receiving messages

2348069
early-binding	late-binding
may be the only interesting difference is that message-passing at least in smalltalk always rely on dynamic-dispatcher and late-binding while in the case of methods invocation one can use static dispatcher and early-binding too

2348069
data-members	private
for example the famo.us effective c++ book contains the corresponding recommendation item 22 declare data-members private

2348076
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have tested in ie firefox google-chrome and safari and are all working

2348076
firefox	safari
the solution i have works based on iframes without the need for constants polling in ie and firefox however due to limitations in other browsers the location hash is used in safari

2348077
arrays	loops
i want to have a foreach loops where the initial arrays is changed inside loopss

2348077
arrays	loops
is there any way to change the initial arrays inside loops .so new elements will be added and the foreach will use the new arrays whatever is changed

2348082
exception-handling	try-catch
if you wrap the code in your backgroundworker in a try-catch block or change your visual-studio settings to display all exception-handling-handling you will see an exception-handling that explains what is going wrong

2348083
pure-virtual	base-class
you would even have a pure-virtual function-call if you did not have an implementation in your base-class

2348084
silverlight	wpf
visual-studio 2010 has an improved wpf silverlight editor

2348088
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
the base-class constructor is called before the constructor of the derived-class .so the derived parts of the object are not created yet .when the base-classes constructor runs

2348088
constructor	object
the object will behave like an object of the base-class types until the base-classes constructor is finished and the derived classes constructor starts

2348088
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
this means that call to virtual-functions will not call implementation defined in the derived-class they will just execute the versioning from the base-class

2348099
64bit	x86
if the target machine runs a 64bit versioning of windows try setting the project + properties building platform target to x86

2348100
function-calls	main
you can do do this by doing function-calls from the main entry-point to functions that are implements in the various shader object

2348107
for-loop	arrays
what you need to do is move the assignment inside the for-loop and checked the length of the arrays every iterator

2348107
arrays	loops
be careful this will cause an infinite-loops white will be added to the end of the arrays at every loops

2348111
arrays	loops
which means adding that is actually the solution you were looking for to modify the arrays from inside the foreach loops

2348116
.when	ready
for one developer it s unnecessary just develop on your staging branch and merge into trunk .when ready

2348119
rollback	commit
in sql-server an intermediate rollback rollback to the beginning of the intermediate transactional an intermediate commit does nothing

2348119
rollback	commit
the outermost rollback rollback the whole outermost transactional even if there were commit in between the outermost commit commit the whole outermost transactional

2348119
rollback	commit
you can rollback to each of the previous savepointss by providing their named but issuing a commit or rollback without the savenamed points always commit or rollback the outermost transactional

2348120
build-system	cmake
i have decided to use cmake as i want to keep the same build-system for both platform

2348140
constructor	object
your object is being initializer with the first constructor which takes no parameters

2348173
iasyncresult	idisposable
in fact waithandle implementss the idisposable interface .so the class implementss iasyncresult should itself implements idisposable

2348190
implements	abstract
this is a perfectly valid and coherent way to implements the old abstract idea that object communication by message-passing

2348190
communication	messages
for example object managed by some middleware systemd communication by passing messages via a queue facility

2348204
emacs	vim
i doubt every single scala programmer uses good ol vim or emacs along with scalac to do their work

2348238
postgresql	mysql
if you want a simple lightweight db i d suggest looking at sqlite for small apps like what you re describing the convenience and ease-of-use are a major win over using a full-scale production db engine like mysql or postgresql

2348263
uibinder	gwt
if .so then consider using uibinder which is include in gwt 2

2348265
worksheet	excel
is it possible to open a single worksheet single tab at a time from excel file that contains many worksheet

2348320
base	zero
the segment register specified the base address of the upper 16-bit of the 8086 s 20 bit address spaces the lower 4 bits of that base address were in essence forced to zero

2348320
32-bit	x86
the segment registers in modern 32-bit or larger x86 processor still do that

2348320
32-bit	64bit
but with the address offset being able to specify a full 32-bit of addressing or 64bit on the x64 processor and page-tables able to provide virtual-memory semantics within the segment defined by a selector the programming model essentially does away with having to manipulate segment registers at the application level

2348339
restart	reload
i ve gotten some good mileage out of jrebel .when working on lift web apps -- it will reload changes on-the-fly without server restart

2348350
attributes	properties
since you declare the properties with the retain attributes the synthesized setter will automatically send a retain messages as well as releasing any previous value

2348362
zend-debugger	xdebug
install xdebug or zend-debugger to see what s wrong

2348371
boolean	int
and have two field labeled field_a and field_b accepting int and boolean

2348413
firefox	opera
ie firefox opera rendering the alternative text inside img for broken images

2348413
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari also do this but the text will be cutoff you unless you set the height weight of the image

2348431
pointers	stack
and returning pointers to the buffering probably means you are going to crash your process if you try to write at the returned pointers address of buffering that s address on stack

2348433
google-chrome	safari
wkhtmltopdf uses an embedded copy of the webkit rendering engine used in safari google-chrome etc. to save a webpage to pdf including all images no flash-video though i guess

2348436
specifications	w3c
xml would be another -- for example microsoft uses xaml an xml dialect for exactly this purpose and the w3c has a fairly new widget packaging specifications using another dialect of xml

2348495
digits	zero
.so represents zero or more of any character represents zero or more a represents zero or more digits

2348547
quantifiers	pcre
pcre lazy-evaluation and greedy at the same time possessive quantifiers

2348596
revision	svn
i find myself using the following often to get a limited numbers of revision out of our huge subversion tree we re soon reaching svn revision 35000

2348600
value	field
to give an example take this query insert-into table field value 1

2348603
environment	execution
i want to learn programming in sql from some sql tutorial sites of which i heard of here but i need some environment for execution query s

2348624
subproject	libs
my coworkers were less enthusiastic about the libs .so its use remained constrained to this small subproject

2348638
restart	reload
i can t get through it .when i restart the server and reload the page i do not get the error but on every other reload i get it i looked into a php tmp dir too see if there are any files and as i see they aren t there

2348655
implements	extends
to use it you extends it and implements the newinstance methods which creates a new value in case of a caching miss

2348657
implements	extends
public class testdialog extends dialog implements android.view.view.onclicklistener

2348669
arrays	loops
in c for performance you would probably implements this with a loops instead of using recursion and by directly modifying the contents of a character arrays instead of concatenation strings

2348675
selected	checkbox
however i want the background to change to the focused color .when selected rather than a checkbox checked off

2348686
contains	lookup
the screens will contains data entry forms with edit field grid lookup calendar etc

2348689
division	modulo
to get each digits you have to look into the division and modulo operators

2348723
order	add
i can add a new order by

2348733
debugging	trace
thus in the sample above i log only warnings from nhibernate and everything from mynamespace.mybusinesscore including debugging and trace

2348734
freebsd	linux
selected 2 or even better epoll 4 on linux or kqueue 2 on freebsd and mac are very convenient frameworks for handling io on multiple sockets

2348739
value	field
use primitive if there is always a meaningful value required field

2348752
put	get
my problem is how do i then get form-manager.php to take that info and put it into the 3 variables it needs to updates twitter

2348753
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
however one option is typically to take advantage of inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged and tracking these yourself in the viewmodel

2348768
space-complexity	time-complexity
o n time-complexity o n space-complexity

2348771
decrement	increment
now to replace the duplicates traversal your numbers arrays and if the current numbers appears more than once decrement its count and replace it with a numbers that appears 0 time and increment that numbers s count

2348777
bittorrent	torrent
i have been looking at monotorrent and while investigating the whole bittorrent thing i saw that a torrent file may also specify web seeds which are basically standards http downloading but which can work as an initial seed

2348847
callback	methods
if you are not using listactivity then you can use the setonitemclicklistener methods of the listview to set a callback for this event

2348868
boost	stl
this is generally only .when you re doing pointers math on traditional arrays or cstring not stl boost based collections in c++.

2348874
primitive	int
this is good because it allows you to store both a generics pointers and a primitive value like a int

2348881
administration	account
windows provides mechanisms to restrict access to certificates private key to administration account and with passwd

2348882
firefox	opera
opera and firefox work just fine without anything special needed just view-source and see

2348888
value	field
then show this field in the form but use its value to populate model_a

2348889
constructor	object
to put this into practice move the object creation code out of the cacservice s parameterless constructor and put it in a factory instead

2348890
contains	any
i would like to know if there are any readily available .net ajax controls for handling panels resizing upon addition deletion of the labels it contains and also suggestions on going about implements the drag drop functionality

2348912
data-structures	segment-tree
i can think of two possible data-structures for solving the problem one using segment-tree and the other using a bit

2348913
attributes	properties
i have an entity called stock and in properties attributes called code price description.

2348927
json	xml
i can just put the configuration data directly in the file latter if i want to read from a json file a xml file or multiple sources i just change the conf.py and make sure the data is accessed the same way

2348928
.net	wcf	asp.net-mvc	wcf
are there any strong opinions on the best way to implements a restful .net api wcf standards asp.net-mvc or even http listener

2348946
duplicates	contains
edit to detection and remove duplicates with start and end swapped you could make sure that your data always contains these value laid out in the same order

2348957
udp	tcp
i want to measure messages latency and throughput for both tcp and udp using c sockets

2348960
python	c++
since boost-python doesn t seem to have a built-in conversion between an std list and a python list i was hoping to be able to write a methods in c++ that could do this conversion for me and later .when i am mapping the c++ classes to python classes i could attach this methods

2348967
put	get
i have asked similar questions before but i think i put it broadly and did not get answers i was looking for

2348967
processor	cpu
every cpu has peak performance depending on numbers of instructions processor can execute per second

2349021
firefox	opera
i m developing a web application and i noticed how irritating mouse gestures can be on it .so is there a way to disable them firefox and opera particularly

2349023
udp	tcp
i posted an answer to that question and provided some numbers from my own testing of udp versus tcp

2349025
administration	account
no you can t prevent the computers administration account from accessing or taking ownership of any folder

2349025
administration	account
you can prevent restrict account as you have describe but the administration will always be able to change the security settings

2349031
lighting	shading
opengl fixed functionality only does shading equation for each vertex not for each pixels like per-pixels lighting .so if your polygons are very large the behavior may appear incorrect

2349035
udp	tcp
there already exists a program called ttcp which test tcp and udp performance

2349035
udp	tcp
systemd using the udp or tcp protocols

2349067
put	get
if i put an if clause there then the rest of the widget dont get loaded

2349069
font-size	display
it s strange because if i change the font-size or the dpi then some of the letters that display correctly become garbled and other letters that were garbled before then display correctly

2349072
text-editor	editor
i have written an advanced text-editor component fixed-width syntax-highlighting etc. in delphi using windows api combined with the tcanvas elements and it works great except for one thing if i set focus to another control inside the same application that display a caret as well such as a tedit stealing focus from my editor component the caret of the new editor such as tedit is not show

2349081
rollback	commit
think of a transactional as a resource which you can create start edit .post changes through and delete commit rollback

2349081
shopping-cart	cart
now i ve read a specific arguments a couple of time in my research and its related to how we re supposed to think about transactional in rest and the example given is the shopping-cart where you implicit have isolation because the cart is yours

2349086
32-bit	64bit
i usually work on this project on my archlinux 64bit but on theese holidays i do on a 32-bit systemd

2349099
value	field
your data filling scripting generator too many nulls value .so selectivity of value of this field is very low

2349106
swing	awt
addendum 2 see painting in awt and swing paint vs

2349116
windows-server	windows
i ve written a server programm lets call it progie this progie working just like a clock on my windows 7 my ms vs is install on windows 7 after compiling the progie and transfer it to windows-server 2003 i tried to run the progie but no chance

2349137
contains	elements
i am managing to create a modal box on the click of an elements which contains a form....i would like the form to have focus on the textarea field .when it appears but am unsure of how to achieve this

2349154
keyboard	mouse
however there has been one useful addition inputbinding.command and inputbinding.commandparameter are now bindable dependency-properties which makes it much easier to handle keyboard and mouse events

2349175
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
i ve a preferences for django ruby-on-rails or sinatra or another python ruby solution but any will do really

2349184
silverlight	wpf
i wish i had learned silverlight first rather than wpf

2349184
silverlight	wpf
that way i wouldn t keep trying to use wpf specific solutions in silverlight apps.

2349192
dlopen	dlsym
programmatically that d dlopen and dlsym

2349204
authentication	login
then you can put all the authentication guff into user and it s available to all three - all through the same login form

2349206
sftp	ftp
it is also handy that the ide will automatically upload code to a remote site using ftp or sftp and that it supports remote-debugging with xdebug

2349221
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
since python implementation of regular expression is based on the pcre standards kodos should benefit developers in other programming languages that also adhere to the pcre standards perl php etc...

2349221
linux	unix
runs on linux unix windows mac

2349236
constructor	object
i want to put this information into a javascript date object for easy use but i don t believe the date object would recognize this kind of format if i simply plugged it into the constructor

2349239
firefox	opera
all major browsers i ve checked ie firefox and opera completely ignore the rfc specifications in this part

2349241
scala	java
create an object which implements a java interface in scala

2349241
scala	java
i want to implements a custom lucene query parsing in scala and be able to let others access it from a java application

2349245
arrays	map
it should be easy to map your leds to a 2d arrays

2349261
scala	java
some of the scala features such as singleton object will compile to code which is hard to use from java but using scala classes through a java interface is an easy way to write compatible code

2349261
scala	java
some questions about java interoperability are answered at and in the book programming in scala

2349261
scala	java
can i use existing java code from scala

2349261
scala	java
accessing java classes from scala code is no problem at all

2349261
scala	java
using a scala class from java can get tricky in particular if your scala class uses advanced features like generics polymorphism methods or abstract types

2349261
scala	java
since java doesn t have such language-features you have to know something about the encoding scheme of scala classes

2349261
scala	java
do i need to convert java data-structures to scala and vice versa

2349261
scala	java
you do not have to convert java data-structures at all for using them in scala

2349261
scala	java
for instances scala classes can subclassing java classes you can initializer java classes in scala you can access methods field even if they are static etc

2349266
tuples	any
i wanted to filtering out any none results and wanted to return an iterator rather than a tuples though i suspect that there might be little advantage in doing this conversion

scala	java
you will need to take advantage of the scala java joint compiler if you want this all in the same project

2349272
scala	java
the first cmd invokes the scala java joint compiler which will compile the scala sources and just enough of the java sources to satisfy any dependencies

2349272
scala	java
the second cmd invokes the java compiler with the recently-compiled scala classes on the classpath

2349273
required	checked
.so it appears that spell checked is not built-in but required an additional plugins

2349277
swing	awt
overrides the updates ... methods is an old awt trick and should never be used with swing

2349298
updating	updates
as with any of such approach this improves reading data because they are readily available but updating data becomes more costly because you need to updates the replicated or precomputed data

2349312
data-members	constructor
you have to declare the data-members without specifying anything more than the types and then initializer it with the special constructor initialization list syntax

2349313
.when	ready
.when you re ready to publishing your changes for the rest of the world to see use hg push to push them up to the farm repository

2349368
any	set
i m trying to set it up .so that i can drop this decorator on any page handler methods and verify that the user has everything set up correctly

2349370
expression	brackets
i do not necessarily need to evaluate the expression but i need to parsing it and be able to return a boolean to indicate whether the expression is parsable or not brackets not matching etc

2349370
required	checked
recognized function named and checked for their required arguments

2349389
radians	sin
the sin function in java.lang.math expects a parameter expressed in radians

2349414
scala	java
i have implements a custom org.apache.solr.handler.requesthandlerbase and custom org.apache.solr.request.queryresponsewriter in scala 2.8 with java 1.6.0 and solr 1.4.0

2349414
scala	java
i would say the main thing to overcome is to convert from java collections object like list and vector to scala collections object and vice versa

2349471
git-rebase	amend
this happens .when you amend a commit the tip of a branch or during a git-rebase or apply a patch that include a â œfrom â header that is different from your configure identity

2349474
getter	setter
whether it is a propertyinfo or the methodinfo that reflects the setter or getter is immaterial

2349479
any	set
any object in your .app can set and get the publicstring string properties but no external object can set or get the private

2349480
bison	yacc
if you want to stick to c roots try lex yacc or bison

2349484
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
the key doesn t have to be a database id it can be a guid that is new ed up .when the object is initializer and does not get changed for the entire lifecycle of the object it is a properties that has a getter but no setter - as it is a properties it will persistent across service boundaries .so your object will still be identifiable

2349487
doxygen	latex
i need to make a pdf versioning of this and using doxygen s latex output appears to be the way to do it

2349512
difference	count
i don t think there will be much of a difference between those two queries the difference being selected a field which is part of an index in the second case and count one line in the first.

2349515
distinct-values	contains	contains	set
grouping by returns a result set that contains distinct-values for field in your grouping by clause .so apparently you have multiple recording that have the same medication_name but different doses .so you are getting two results

2349515
aggregate-functions	sum
you can use any aggregate-functions on dose max min avg sum etc.

2349519
for-loop	loops
how i can read the following files using the for-loop can loops ignore the characters in filenames

2349530
python	java	python	c++	python	ruby
i personally would pick a more modern language in which to implements my c compiler project both for the simplicity it s easy to d l package for python ruby c++ or java and because it will look better on your resume

2349550
hash	md5
how does this apply to md5 sha1 sha2 hash

2349555
arguments	default
this has the benefit that you can default the error arguments pointers to 0 and code that can ignore the error because it could live with an empty string return for example or if it knows in advance the input is valid would not need to bother

2349563
configuration	environment
in visual-studio 2010 you can maintain multiple web-config and use a transformation to generator the correct configuration for an environment

2349563
configuration	environment
the transformation file can overrides the value of a particular configuration item for the environment

2349563
environment	building
whenever we target building for that environment the transformation are applied to the default web-config file

2349571
wordpress	magento
i am integration blog wordpress into our magento site

2349572
data-structures	tree
this doesn t mean you cannot but you will need to know essential data-structures such as linked lists and tree

2349572
x86-16	mips
this could include a android-emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86-16 32-bit

2349572
bison	yacc
yacc yet another compiler compiler or bison from gnu is a tool designed to make writing a compiler or translator parsing easier

2349577
digits	zero
04d 3 for example would format the numbers 3 with 4 digits and leading zero

2349584
spaces	output
a good hashing algorithm including most of the ones you ll see in the wild will attempt to spread the resulting hash over the entire output spaces as evenly as possible and thus minimize collision

2349584
hash	md5
you ll see people refer to md5 as a broken hashing algorithm .when in reality it s just a poor one to use as a cryptography hash

2349623
python	java
i said usually above because some tools do automatically anchor the match at the beginning python match or at both ends java s matches but that s pretty rare

2349624
union-all	union
union-all is faster than union but won t remove duplicates

2349632
google-chrome	firefox
my website www.zerozaku.com is compatible with google-chrome and firefox but ie has an issue with my mini-chat overflowing out of the box

2349632
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it on ie8 firefox google-chrome

2349638
constructor	object
if you go that route you end up with the constructor taking two dozen object essentially points to all the rest of the application it needs a pointers to the rendering too .so it can be draw

2349648
oracle-service-bus	osb
i need to integrated my application using osb oracle-service-bus

2349651
triggers	insert
make sure to create an index on it and you may also create two triggers to automatically updates the column on insert and on updates

2349688
selected	button
i have managed to display the selected item columns in a datagrid and a button content but just cannot figure out how to make the .app understand it is the same data

2349701
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms doesnt enforce separation of presentation model by design

2349715
postgresql	mysql
it seems to me that postgresql and mysql are a bit abandoned

2349715
python	ruby
are there ways to work with other frameworks in ways that the code won t be hosted on the server i accept python ruby anything vms and others

2349741
put	get
you see if the user is found in db username and passwd are valid then the user will be put in session scoping logged in and the servlet will redirect to .some main page this example goes to else it will set an error messages and forwarding the request back to the same jsp page .so that the messages get display by

2349747
32-bit	64bit
however i cannot get to cast it into anything useful get back the original int char and for what i understood it could be because i am in a 64bit systemd and the size of a pointers to void is different from the size of a pointers to int the program is supposed to be used in both 64 and 32-bit systemdd

2349761
environment	execution
in the unix programming environment kernighan and pike walk through 5 iterator of making a calculator working from simple c based lexical analysis and immediate execution to yacc lex parsing and code-generation for an abstract machine

2349774
multiplying	modulo
as we are working modulo 2n we must also deal with the tricky case where both factors are non-zero but multiplying to give 0 mod 2n

2349774
difference	factors
observe that the difference between the two factors q - p and p + q + 1 is 2p + 1 which is an odd numbers - .so one of the factors must be even and the other must be odd

2349774
factors	primes
if n and hence 2n is a power of 2 this required the even factors to be a multiple of 2n because all of the primes factorss of 2n are 2 whereas none of the primes factorss of our odd factors are

2349777
32-bit	64bit
intmax_t should be an int types that is 32-bit on 32-bit compilers and 64bit on 64bit compilers

2349792
subtract	add
yes the iterator for std vector are random-access iterator .so you add subtract integral value to get other valid iterator

2349820
rjava	jri
is it possible to run r in process through rjava jri

2349820
rjava	jri
in a sense jri is the inverse of rjava

2349820
32-bit	64bit
32-bit and 64bit

2349834
python	java
of course if you use a cross-platform language such as java or python and do not use any platform-specific code in your implementation then your program can run under both environment

2349839
python	perl
to learn more about this downloading a significant open source program for example perl or python and see how its configure scripting makes arrangements to compile in either place

2349846
python	java
anyway there are the java and python languages.

2349847
persistent	transient
memcached data lives in memory and isn t persistent .so is for more transient data

2349849
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
this is why interpreted-language like php perl python and java are becoming .so popular but even these don t all support the same set of features on each platform

2349867
parentheses	operators
i recently discovered that in c++ you can overload the function-call operators in a strange way in which you have to write two pair of parentheses to do .so

2349871
contains	any
it looks pretty generics and useful .so my question is is such a class contains in any of the c++ toolkits boost loki etc.

2349876
beautifulsoup	mechanize
the fully functioning codebase is here -- it required the mechanize and beautifulsoup libs which can be install via easy_install

2349895
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application has a uitabbarcontroller at the root and uinavigationcontroller items for each tab bar item

2349903
execution	exit
without seeing more code anything that causes the program to exit unexpectedly rather be killed by the operating systemd such as a segmentation fault or entering some form of code structure that does not allow it to return to your flow of execution necessitating a kill via ctrl+c

2349921
authentication	login
it s because you are posting the from to the index action whereas you should be posting it to the login action where your authentication logic is in

2349932
google-maps	bing-maps
are there some online service either with bing-maps google-maps something else that provides such information in some parsing format

2349959
value	field
but .when i query these entities putting a filtering based on the enum value it is always returning me all the entities whatever value i specify for the enum field

2349975
fflush	stdout
what happens if you fflush stdout after each call to printf

2349981
base-class	inherited
it s a common anti-patterns for a class to become too fat have too much functionality and related state and while this is commonly observed about base-classes whence the fat base-class monicker for the anti-patterns it can really happen without any inherited involved

2350016
arguments	default
the clear advantage is if the arguments are of user-defined classes this member initialization would result in call to copy constructor as opposed to default constructor if done using assignments in the constructor s body

2350020
duplicates	contains
now if foo also contains methods other than func whose implementation is independent of the value for num and you don t want to duplicates their implementation in the specialization of foo you can apply the following pattern

2350042
compact-framework	.net
how can i use enterprise libs to do a data-access-layer in c# for sql ce and .net compact-framework

2350061
hashtable	set
yes set is basically a hashtable just like dictionary -- the difference at the interface don t imply many difference below it

2350065
synchronous	.when
yes it might seem strange that you re process an asynchronous call synchronous but this typically only happens if there is already a connection waiting to be accepted .when acceptasync is called

2350068
elisp	lisp
i ve found that xah s elisp tutorial is an excellent starting points in figuring out the basic of emacs lisp programming

2350084
value	field
now i just need to find a way to insert a text string into the corresponding field that identifies what table the value is coming from

2350086
configuration	environment
i thought that was lame .so i added the code to the environment configuration to leave everything singular

2350087
expression	evaluation
some decades ago the c language and similar languages was most often considered high-level as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation parameterized recursive functions and data types and structures while assembly was considered low-level

2350092
javascript	dom
there are very few immutable data types in javascript or the dom

2350114
derived-class	base-class
you can even send and receive more complex types like .when you have a base-class but want to send or receive an object of a derived-class you would do that using the knowntype attributes

2350129
getter	setter
one thing i have been reading about is the use of getter and setter

2350129
arrays	map
i want enemies to follow way points .so i was going to make an arrays of way points and make that a properties of a map object

2350137
derived-class	base-class
wcf provides the knowntype attributes to allow a service operation to receive an object of the base-class and deserialize it into an object of a derived-class

2350158
reflection	runtime	value	field
you can inspect these at runtime by using reflection to get the value of the private field then callings the public getinvocationlist methods of the delegation class without reflection

2350160
contains	any
in this case the contains class could put the delegation into any data structure a list or even ignore it though this would be unlikely

2350160
value	field
it would be like trying to find the field that is used to store a properties s value

2350191
specifications	w3c
i tried looking through the w3c specifications but i couldn t find any specificationsific details on how stuff should be put into the value attributes

2350198
ipad	ios
edit as of the upcoming 4.2 sdk the iphone and ipad versioning of ios have been unified under a single sdk

2350203
beautifulsoup	lxml
you should be using a html parsing such as beautifulsoup or lxml instead

2350215
contains	any
a good way to find out if the binding contains any errors is to checked our output for any binding error messages during debugging

2350253
checkbox	textbox
i have textbox and checkbox in asp.net page

2350258
contains	elements
i have an asp.net 3.5 page which has multiple span elements with id contains lblerror

2350258
contains	elements
how can i get all the span elements whose ids contains lblerror

2350270
httphandler	httpmodule
if you re developing using the local asp.net webdev server you must remove some of the httphandler and httpmodule and then add them back to the section

2350272
web-services	api
we have a java-based web application that makes a couple bursts of asynchronous http call to web-services api s

2350274
callback	methods
callback is a perfectly rea.sonable and popular dp in python but that s because passing around first-class callable functions bound methodss classes instances of classes with a __call__ methods etc etc is .so wonderfully easy pretty trivial actually

2350283
cryptographic-hash-function	hash
you may wish to use a hash based on a keyed cryptographic-hash-function to defend against this

2350301
stderr	stdout
another trick you might try is to re-direct stderr to stdout in your cmd .so that your program only has to read the stdout

2350306
solaris	linux
linux mac solaris

2350306
perl	php
and scripting languages php perl etc

2350307
json	xml
i believe there are a few other libs out there but it s just as easy to roll your own because like macha says above twitter s api gives you the option to have the feed in xml or json format

2350314
emacs	vim
emacs and vim give you lots of functionality with a bit coarser interface

2350320
google-chrome	firefox	browser-plugin	google-chrome
in terms of specific utilities i think having a good browser-plugin like firebug firefox or the built-in developer-console in google-chrome are really handy for seeing whats going in the specific html or javascript

2350331
click	mouse
for doing this in ssms expand the table named and then press write click of your mouse on it

2350336
put	get
what i don t get is how i can put 23 chars into a buffering that is malloc ed as 16 chars...when i change loops to 24 characters i get an error though at least in linux with gcc ...but why not earlier 17 characters should break it...no

2350341
.net	wcf
see peer-to-peer programming with wcf and .net 3.5

2350342
push	pull
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

2350342
user-permissions	administration
push notifications need team foundation server administration level user-permissions to create which means that only administration users can use your application

2350351
malloc	free
remember to free the points if you choose the malloc way

2350354
getter	setter
don t just add getter and setter to everything without purpose

2350354
getter	setter
getter setter on everything simply means that you ll have a universally inefficient implementation

2350354
getter	setter
setter getter are gatekeepers

2350354
getter	setter
many ex-java coders i ve worked with put setter getter on attributess unnecessarily every attributes

2350354
getter	setter
the total impact of getter setter is minimal in a high-level design

2350360
listbox	textbox
i am new in programing i need help regarding how to filtering listbox via using textbox in c# application

2350360
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
i mean enter some text into textbox and filtering same time in listbox if items exit in lists then selected into textbox else open new form-for creating the items kindly give me example for the same

2350361
dictionary	arrays
it is sparse-matrix allows multi-typed key in the same arrays and supports set dictionary arrays stack queue and imperative functionality

2350380
file-access	filesystems
is it possible to get a filesystems as a single block .so that the the file-access read write operations can be faster

2350407
createfile	drive
to open a partition for raw reads you use createfile with the filename . x where x is the drive letter of the partition

2350415
authentication	login
the component is responsible for creating all the logic behind your login persistent all login attempts from a user configuration for redirects etc and your authentication plugins for checked if everything is correct

2350417
contains	set
the resultstemp set will contains an object of types .post which has the newest date

2350421
google-chrome	firefox
7 but in firefox google-chrome avant ie8 no problem at all..

2350424
python	ruby
both python and ruby are excellent in this area

2350424
ubuntu-server	linux	ubuntu-server	ubuntu	ubuntu	linux
ease of deployment how easy is it to get up and running on windows-xp 7 server 2003+ linux centos 5.2 ubuntu ubuntu-server 8.04+ and os x 10.5+

2350424
python	ruby
i have reviewed python and ruby

2350424
python	ruby
python satisfies all the requirements and ruby seems to as well though i am not sure about ease of deployment on windows and the availability of libs

2350435
python	perl
i use both perl and python extensively for scripting on windows .so i wouldn t hesitate to use either for deployment

2350439
python	ruby
ruby is decent but python is excellent

2350450
contains	any	contains	elements	overlapping	padding	overlapping	margins	margins	padding
and failing either of those i d start looking at any other styles that would be overlapping not necessarily being inherited just affecting the visual spaces on hover like padding and margins and background colors of contains elements

2350453
value	field
instructs the serialization methods of the xmlserializationr not to serialization the public field or public read write properties value

2350481
contains	elements
a fairly standards way of using fieldset to contains form elements is just to use it as a basic building block like a div

2350481
contains	elements
think of it as a contains div that has semantic value and that you can use the legend elements in

2350488
webserver	nginx
as a first step see nginx s access-log to see webserver is receiving request correctly

2350511
perl	php
php and perl syntax are quite similar

2350511
perl	php
i am sure you know how to convert the for loops etc in perl to php

2350511
perl	php
if you are unsure about the syntax search the perl docs or internet and find the equivalent in php

2350511
perl	php
you should be able to develop an equivalent php scripting by looking at the sample perl one

2350522
webforms	asp.net
i m developing an asp.net webforms application with visual-studio 2008 sp1 and c#

2350524
required	checked
specifically c is not required and is designed intentionally not to perform bounds checked

2350532
contains	lookup
once an initial search is performed say searching all product where named full-text indexed contains the words screens the productattributess table can produce the distinct list of all different attributesid hence attributes named by lookup in attributess table for product satisfying this first search criterion

2350532
common-table-expression	subquery
also this is written with a common-table-expression cte but could well be written as a subquery

2350535
xsd	xml
this exported xml needs to be valid against an xsd

2350554
firefox	opera
works fine in firefox opera etc

2350557
value	field
.when the value of a field is 2001-12-14 i get the following error

2350563
xsd	xml
two things write a plugins for excel or convert the excelfile to xml and create the xsd

2350564
defined	declare
language you have to declare defined

2350565
required	checked
the dictionary is initializer per thread .so any additional threads for running the checked would required synchronized between the threads which is too costly

2350578
safari	opera
the thing is that opera v 10.01 and safari v

2350594
registration	login
the login register functionality comes in-built with drupal you will just need to sign up as an admin yourself first and if you have the email set up correct you should be able to carry out a test registration

2350600
rollback	commit
then i d create an interceptor on top of that one that pick up transactional manages a connection and commit rollback

2350602
web-hosting	hosting
since usually web-hosting is provided by hosting company they may have configuration ready for running your applications may have it turnable on off or even take money for this

2350602
telnet	ssh
usually it s running at ports 22 and you many checked it with cmd telnet yourserver 22 windows and linux - if it doesn t reject your connect - means ssh is configure

2350616
hide	show
if the final goal is to use them as the .source of an img tag then you could do ab.solutely nothing to hide them as tools such as firebug will show directly all the http request that the browser performs .so it s not even necessary to look at the .source of the html page to obtain the image paths

2350638
.net	wcf
all new web service development on the .net platform should be done using windows communication foundation wcf

2350648
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
the google ajax search api documentation provides some code-snippets that demonstrate api access in java php python perl and flash

2350649
children	nodes
.when i get a nodes and try to access parentnodes or the children its types is actually geographicnodes and not the appropriate subclassing

2350651
any	set
is it any way to set a language for it without a recompilation

2350656
temporary	copy
copy files to a temporary folder

2350692
value	field
those field need to provide good selectivity don t index on a boolean value you d just loose time traversal complex binary-search structures .when you might just as fast or faster look at the whole list

2350703
key-value	key
at here i d like to match.add key-value but i cannot figure out how to get the key from the groupcollection which in this case should be the named of the capturing-group

2350726
getter	setter
you try making field_name a properties and do whatever in getter or setter

2350728
value	field
here is a full example off the top of my head which should be reusable for all field that want to modify the value on setting

2350731
windows	ms-dos
i haven t been able to get anything re-compilable out of a decompiler since the days of ms-dos com files not to be confused with windows com

2350735
localization	translation
what would be the best practice for sharing localization object in this case resourcebundle where i do save all translation across many gui object in-app

2350737
puts	gets
i want to make one thread that puts value to a queue .when it gets empty and wait for this conditional while it is not

2350738
default	reset
i want the user able to order the tags alphabetically by click a checkbox if this checkbox is unchecked the default order is reset

2350745
selected	button
then wire up your button to handle selected the different tabpages in the tabcontrol

2350745
user-controls	tabcontrol
note if you want to insert secondary forms or user-controls into the tabpages of a tabcontrol that s not a problem of course simpler to use user-controls

2350745
hide	show
note there are fancier ways you can hide the tabs like using a derived tabcontrol as show here on codeproject tabcontrol on a winform without showing the tab header

2350753
floating	overlap
floating works .when the combined image widths don t overlap the width of the browser windows but .when i set the image styles height to 100 they don t float left they stack up over each other

2350754
treeview	grid
i am having treeview which contains grid and that grid contains textboxes.

2350754
hide	show
i just want to hide show some columns at runtime of the grid in treeview.

2350760
any	set
if user doesnt set any parameters in query-string it will return all blogs

2350782
margins	padding
if you use the html structure i lay out in this question you can simply float your labels and input to the left and adjust padding margins until things are lined up

2350786
uitableview	uiswitch
i have a working uitableview filled with some options for my .app and i want to add uiswitch to them just like the settings .app how do i do this

2350788
common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
by lisp i mean the most common dialects like common-lisp and scheme

2350801
void	main
public static void main string arguments

2350803
subtract	time
this is my approach i reserve last time that a user .post a .postback to server in a session and in every .postback subtract this value from current value

2350815
binary	hex	decimal	hex
we know the decimal 65 hex 41 binary 0100 0001 and the ascii character a all have the same binary representation .so to tell which we are using we have a series of deliminators - numbers preceded by

2350823
any	set
the weird thing is that my stored procedure is not even supposed to return any result set

2350826
contains	elements
as far as i know enforcing a single types for elements in a numpy.ndarrays has to be done manually unless the arrays contains numpy scalar there is no built-in checked mechanism your arrays has dtypes object

2350832
put	get
once i get this selected to work i then need to somehow include it into my insert into.....selected statement to put all the data into testmatch table

2350845
safari	opera
on ie7 safari opera it works

2350864
any	set
stubs does not set any expectations

2350875
dictionary	arrays
if your purpose is simply the if clause then what i would do is to defined two dictionary with the key as the color and the value as the arrays of burbles with the value be the location of the burble

2350875
dictionary	arrays
you can then easily checked this dictionary the value of the arrays of orange color to see how many items there are

2350900
hide	show
the view hide show but without any animation

2350919
32-bit	64bit
the long types is at least 32-bit and the long-long types at least 64bit both including the sign bit

2350950
pointers	stack
in this example a is the variables on stack at location 0x1234 and p is on stack at location 0x1236 a 16-bit int pointers systemd

2350959
ecdsa	rsa
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signature - ecdsa signature are considerably smaller than rsa signature of an equivalent security factors

2350978
google-chrome	safari
have you tried using the built-in developer-tools for safari and google-chrome to checked if you get a response with http-status code 200 from your request

2350997
derived-class	base-class
i have a tempated base-class checked and publically derived-class childchecked

2350997
base-class	inherited
the base-class also have a partials specializatin but i inherited the childchecked class from the general templates class not from the partials-specialization of the class checked

2350997
derived-class	base-class
.when i call the constructor of the base-class from the initialization list of the derived-class compiler gives error now if i remove the partial-specialization of class checked then compiler gives no error .so here is the code

2351008
python	java
python language for the java platform

2351014
hide	show
you can then hide the containers add the points get the getboundszoomlevel show it again and it should work fine

2351016
groovy	java
in groovy especially you can defined interfaces in java or groovy and implements them

2351016
groovy	java
.so the more you work with interfaces the more you are writing java in groovy you can write fortran in any language

2351019
textbox	button
on this find form is a textbox and 2 button find and findnext

2351020
arrays	loops
infinite loops iterator - loops that count each item in an arrays or hash - and general loops like c styles

2351020
haskell	scheme
to answer your question fully haskell and scheme are two examples of languages that do not have standards for loops built-in

2351030
contains	set
the set up a new class for each different bg you need lpa fcs etc which contains only the bg image

2351041
callback	methods
i m writing a browser helpers object for internet-explorer and i need to call javascript methodss on all open browser instances from a static or a global callback methods

2351041
callback	methods
if i have a static callback methods in my bho class which thread would that callback arrive on

2351048
contains	any
of course the pointers doesn t contains the location it points to any more than a letter containss the building it is addressed to

2351070
contains	any
this way the game entity doesn t contains any positioning information and this is managed by another object

2351072
any	set
but i don t have any suggestion for how to remember to set it on each window.

2351076
filtering	grouping
the issue i am facing is .when i am trying to create a grouping result object based on filtering that are applied to jobs

2351086
latitude-longitude	location
assuming i have an approximate location latitude-longitude of a user how do i find the city that is nearest

2351093
push	pull
often you ll only have a single other clone to push pull from

2351093
push	pull
then foo-clone will have as its default push pull path

2351093
push	pull
you can then use hg pull alice to get her changes or hg push experiment to push to your own local experimental clone

2351093
push	pull
these are just shortcuts you can always push pull using an explicit url

2351105
haskell	prolog	haskell	erlang	erlang	prolog
functional-programming languages haskell erlang generally don t have loops nor do function-level languages fp j or logic languages prolog planner

2351113
contains	any	contains	elements
as far as i can tell from the jquery source if your returned html fragment doesn t contains any tags and doesn t have a couple of other not-too-likely characteristics then jquery is probably trying to stuff it into your elements by using the innerhtml properties

2351126
ubuntu	linux
i am invisaging a similar user experiance to how an end user may updates an application in a linux distrubution the updates manager in ubuntu

2351128
ftp	scp
mercurial is not a general scp ftp rsync file-copying program .so don t expect to see this functionality in the core

2351145
ubuntu	debian
there is no windows equivalent of ubuntu debian s apt repositories or third party repositories

2351145
webserver	upload
you will have to manage updates by upload a new versioning of your .app to your webserver - not sure how you d avoid doing that whatever the systemd

2351160
python	c++
you can t subclassing any of the wxwidgets types because they re in the c++ domain and only nominally wrapped in python

2351180
selected	button
this affects everything from the search button on the bing.com homepage although it default to ie7 document mode to the selected and add to cart button on the apple store

2351213
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
supports all major web browsers internet-explorer 6+ firefox 1.5+ safari 2+ opera 9+

2351213
google-chrome	safari
sicne they support safari though you should have very few if any issues in google-chrome

2351220
stateless	stateful
i am going through the java ee 6 tutorial and i am trying to understand the difference between stateless and stateful session beans

2351220
stateless	stateful
can somebody give me a simple hello world types example of a stateless session bean that behaves differently .when you change it to stateful

2351221
propertychangelistener	listener
your user-interface needs to know about locale changes .so you may have to introduce .some listener interface for all your user-interface components propertychangelistener propertychangesupport and not change the locale directly

2351224
dictionary	arrays
you can also easily store and retrieve serialization object or native types arrays dictionary numbers strings

2351226
hide	show
just add a few call to hide show your load screens div whatever

2351230
python	java
both java and python are strongly typed

2351230
python	java
.so java is statically typed and python is dynamically typed

2351230
reflection	runtime
for example although java is statically typed every time you use reflection or a cast .when using containers of object they you are deferring the typechecking to runtime

2351231
data-members	private
.so your private data-members is indeed state but it s not shopping-cart

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful in this context don t mean quite what you might expect

2351233
stateless	stateful
global-variables inside a session bean stateless or stateful are something else entirely

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateful session beans will have a pool of beans created since a bean can only be used in one conversation at a time whereas stateless sesion beans will often only have one instances which will make the global variables works but i don t think this is necessarily guaranteed

2351237
stdin	pipe
.when bash start execution sox -d -t wav - | lame - test.mp3 because of the pipe character bash will fork two process to execute each cmd and then connect stdout from the first process with stdin to the second one

2351247
perl	ruby
string interpolation perl ruby though a feature of cl21

2351247
haskell	scala
monadic iterator construct which can be overloaded for other uses haskell c# f# scala

2351247
haskell	scala
pattern-matching haskell f# caml scala others in cl there are libs like optima

2351247
common-lisp	scheme
this just refers to the common-lisp and scheme standards because particular implementation have added a lot of these features independently

2351248
hide	show
now you modify your viewmodel .when you want to hide or show an item in the tree

2351273
strlen	scanf
read the numbers in a char arrays a with scanf s a or better with fgets and output the char arrays reversed by outputting each character starting from strlen a - 1 to 0

2351289
google-chrome	firefox
all variables are ok and works perfectly in firefox google-chrome

2351298
contains	elements
i have a wsdl which contains 3 schema inside it s types elements

2351315
codeigniter	joomla
like a proper one i ve used things like joomla in the past to make awesome stuff but have now finally got my hands dirty with php mysql and codeigniter

2351327
ironpython	ironruby
i have embedded an ironpython scriptinging hosts into a simple c# application but now i need to know the best practices for locking down security on a user generator ironpython or ironruby scripting

2351330
jquery	dojo
use of existing web technologies make it easy for me mainly a web developer to design and develop applications based on html5 css3 javascript jquery dojo which can be ported to a web platform in the future with greater ease

2351330
python	java
i may encounter limitations with what can be done in javascript vs languages like c# python java etc

2351341
keyboard	mouse
.so that you could change the step size without actually moving the mouse or the keyboard focus from one spinner to another

2351359
hash	md5
if performance isn t important simply take a secure hash such as md5 or sha1 and truncated its output to 32-bit

2351372
getter	setter
.when you synthesize your words properties the setter and getter methods are generator behind the scenes .so there are already functions for and you can read about this in the objective-c primer or the programming language documentation

2351372
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is possible because nsmutablestring is a subclassing of nsstring

2351373
contains	elements
i have a login form that is hidden by default once a user click on an observed elements the elements contains the form slider down using effect.blidndown in scriptaculous

2351401
cucumber	webrat
i used following step-definition with cucumber and webrat and everything worked fine

2351413
compatibility	legacy
the use of raw-types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code

2351413
type-safety	generics
this seems to defeat the purpose of the type-safety provided by generics but you can always use to accomplish this

2351427
codeigniter	symfony
and before you ask yes iâ ve looked at zend codeigniter symfony etc. and no they donâ t seem to cross the boundary between server logic and client logic

2351463
scala	java
you will learn some parts of the java libs by learning scala because even the scala libs use them

2351465
shutdown	restart	environment	restart
hitting c-z runs the except code calling shutdown and close functions but i m not able to restart my program until the socket timeout gnu linux environment

2351477
protected	public
stuff such as autoloader which i wrote about a couple of paragraph earlier didn t exists in php 4 -- same for public private protected and lots of other oo-related things...

2351484
buffering	streaming
.when you streaming this way al can move immediately from the end of one buffering to the start of the next

2351485
instances	private
functor enables you to use even more complicated states for example a shared state static field and a private state instances field

2351487
instances	destroy
stateless session beans slsb are not tied to one client and there is no guarantee for one client to get the same instances with each methods invocation some containers may create and destroy beans with each methods invocation session this is an implementation-specific decision but instancess are typically pooled - and i don t mention clustered environment

2351502
mobile-devices	blackberry
mobile-devices supported inorder of relevance iphone 3g iphone 2g blackberry droid powered mobiles other

2351505
scala	java
however some awareness of the difference in collections may be good a scala list is not a traditional java list and apis may expect the latter

2351537
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
you can enter value in textbox and invoke the click events for button and links but i have not figured out how selected a option drop-down ..

2351547
hide	show
i am using the follwoing jquery to show hide an other title field on page

2351553
python	c++
i have a c++ libs that i building using scons which is eventually linked into among other things a python extension

2351553
distutils	scons
does anyone know of a way to integrated distutils into scons .so that it can take advantage of the knowledge scons has about which files need to be rebuilt

2351555
deep-copy	object
if your object gets passed around a lot it will also be faster because there s no need for a deep-copy everytime

2351556
selected	cell
.when i selected a cell i want to add the text from the cell to the underlying uiview at the same positioning

2351557
contains	elements
here s what i have .so far which works for me if the linearlayout contains more than one elements

2351557
contains	elements
if it contains only one elements the right column is pushed out to the right of the screens

2351562
any	set
i can t save the view if i don t set any fields-for display

2351571
radio-button	checkbox
fragments of the page are annotations with the classname toggleonswitch and another class that tells what checkbox or radio-button determines visibility

2351575
any	set
any thoughts on how i could set retrieve such data

2351584
silverlight	wpf
i need to do this in a silverlight project but also interested in wpf solutions

2351591
tab-completion	zsh
it actually allows for a great amount of integration between git and zsh s tab-completion

2351596
selected	cell
if i m getting this right you want to start by finding the positioning of the selected cell

2351611
jquery	dojo
of course there are all those ajax javascript libs like jquery prototype dojo mootools etc... though they strictly aren t utilities but incredibly useful

2351618
contains	any
doesn t contains any strange 0x0 characters

2351624
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
however i looked at the developer-tools of safari and google-chrome under windows and firebug in firefox and all three rendering the dom incorrectly

2351626
buffering	streaming
calling getbuffering will return the streaming s internal buffering which will be larger than the actual data

2351633
constructor	object
i need the file object to pass to another constructor

2351665
click	mouse
there are 3 cases .when a context menu needs to be created unless i forgot one... on a right mouse click .when the menu key is pressed and for shift + f10

2351665
click	mouse
sometimes the shift+f10 works correctly but in the same cases the menu key is somehow invoking my right mouse click handler resulting in incorrect behaviour.

2351673
internet-explorer	firefox
in internet-explorer it should be event.srcelement in firefox event.target

2351686
margins	padding
jquery s .width allows you to do things like get the width of an image and .css can be used to modify the css of an elements including width margins and padding

2351690
constructor	object
is it possible to pass constructor arguments to instances object which i place on the stage

2351690
constructor	object
are the instantiations of instances object centralized .somewhere as with .net winforms .so i can just edit the constructor

2351691
margins	padding
you can remove those custom inline margins and padding if you add overflow auto to the .itembody instead

2351691
inline-styles	css-tables
you can get rid of the inline-styles altogether though if you use css-tables

2351697
contains	any
haven t implements this one but the idea i have is to use any order-statistic algorithm to find a partition contains the top 10 of numbers and then sort them using merge sort

2351702
conditional	operators
css doesn t provide .so far as i m aware any means for conditional operators or logic-based operations

2351704
celementtree	elementtree
the celementtree module is a c implementation of the elementtree optimized for fast parsing and low memory use

2351704
celementtree	elementtree
on typical document celementtree is 15-20 time faster than the python versioning of elementtree and uses 2-5 time less memory

2351707
celementtree	elementtree
it is the same libs same api same features but elementtree is implements in python and celementtree is implements in c

2351710
celementtree	elementtree
elementtree is implements in python while celementtree is implements in c

2351715
smalltalk	lisp
the idea of encapsulating a function as an object dates back to lisp and smalltalk

2351717
json	xml
however i d like to expose the service as xml json and jsonp

2351722
quicksort	in-place
follow the quicksort procedure of in-place swapping

2351726
decrement	increment
all loops unrolling does is reduce loopss overhead of increment decrement comparing for the stop conditional and jumping

2351734
rollback	commit
though depending on how you want your commit to appear to tfs you may want to use the collapse extension to squash your changes into a single commit this can make rollback in tfs easier

2351734
environment	building
clearly this approach is not well suited to this environment particularly since at one points it was impossible to building the solutions in an arbitrary directory

2351734
revision	updates
they are implements .so that they can be used in any place where hg is expecting a revision .so merges updates etc

2351746
json	xml
and it would solve at least two of your three points xml and json

2351757
json	xml
if the object is derived from tpersistent xml or json serialization are easy to do with open source libs

2351757
versioning	migrate
for automatic versioning see this article migrate serialization java object with xstream and xmt

2351764
llvm-gcc	bitcode
i m using clang or llvm-gcc for compiling a c file to get a bitcode file using the -emit-llvm option which contains debugging information

2351764
llvm-gcc	bitcode
in a third and last step since we need some runtime libs we link the bitcode against some other bitcode files using llvm-gcc to get a final binary

2351764
contains	any
this binary i cannot debugging since it doesn t contains any debugging information although all linked bitcode files did contains them

2351780
json	xml
as for accepting xml and json in one service using uritemplates i describe two techniques in this presentaion full source code also available here

2351783
mousedown	mouseup
there may be difference like whether it appears on mousedown or on mouseup or even on the mac on ctrl +click of the single mouse button

2351783
keyboard	mouse
you should therefore not handle mouse and keyboard events directly but handle the wxcontextmenuevent instead

2351783
keyboard	mouse
note that it will be called after both mouse and keyboard events

2351786
dlopen	dlsym
if however i modify the main application to not link against testc and testd but instead load them at runtime using dlopen dlsym then the dynamic_cast fails

2351787
textbox	button
i have a page with a textbox a button and a labels control

2351787
inline-code	code-behind
how do i show the value of s in the labels control using inline-code but not using the code-behind

2351794
daemons	systemd
may be it could be a daemons catching systemd call and identifying something

2351808
linked-list	arrays	hashtable	set
i wish there was a transparency flag in the zend hashtable data-structure that would be set in cases where the arrays was created using arrays_push or that would allow for scaling like a c arrays instead of a linked-list

2351813
scala	java
scala relies a lot on java libs

2351813
maven	sbt
if i can make one advise here it is to avoid maven at first and use sbt as a building tool

2351820
type-inference	currying
f# s grammar type-inference systemd simply seems unable to recognize a .net constructor like new string as a currying function which prevents you from using pipelining

2351832
web.py	django	pylons	django	pylons	web.py	turbogears	django	turbogears	web.py	turbogears	pylons
don t dev web code by hands use turbogears pylons web.py or django

2351832
beautifulsoup	lxml
don t parsing html xml with hard tools use lxml or beautifulsoup

2351855
constructor	object
it seems object constructor aren t composable .so you can t pass them as a function

2351856
virtual-machine	virtualization
probably the only way to effectively sandbox such a dll is .some kind of virtualization .so the code is not run directly but in a virtual-machine

2351856
python	lua	python	java
.some high level languages are better at sandboxing lua java other are not .so good afaik currently there is no official restrict environment implements for python

2351869
strong-typing	types
strong-typing generally means that there are no loopholes in the types systemd whereas weak typing means the types systemd can be subverted invalidating any guarantees

2351869
static-typing	typechecking
to see the difference think of c the language is typechecking at compile-time static-typing but there are plenty of loopholes

2351878
double	int
see c# converting list int to list double

2351882
any	set
i am not sure if that s what you need but .when you defined textbox through designer you can set it s text properties to any value

2351885
base-class	inherited
you inherited from yet call a base-class constructor as if you inheriteded from

2351898
value	field
copying value from old field into new ones .when the format changes

2351901
pulseaudio	portaudio
you need to choose a device named pulse for portaudio to work with pulseaudio which is the sound server used for sound card sharing on the biggest linux distros nowadays

2351934
scala	java
there are things about java that are directly relevant to scala and which you should understand

2351934
primitive-types	reference-type
the difference between primitive-types double float etc and reference-type subclassing of object

2351934
instrumentation	debugging
jvisualvm for runtime instrumentation of code to debugging memory and performance problems

2351940
contains	set
must be set to the directory contains akismet.py not the filepath

2351941
groovy	java
groovy can call any java object which the code above appears to be

2352003
textwrangler	bbedit
you can use a tool like bbedit or its free sibling textwrangler to fix this problem

2352011
children	nodes
on the first document you would iterate through the root nodes recursively note it doesn t have to be an actual recursive methods but semantics it would be recursive behavior analyzing the nodes and all of it s children nodess

2352021
google-chrome	firefox
.so appears small box .when i click it in firefox or google-chrome - alert box appears

2352053
version-control	git
you might want to try some distribute version-control systemd like mercurial or git which should be more comfortable while you aren t connect to the central server since they ll still allow you to view logs create branches merge while offline

2352057
32-bit	64bit
i personally don t see much of a difference between 32-bit and 64bit

2352060
order	add
for some reason this causes all versioning of ie to go nuts and add the search bar to the bottom of order by input and remove styling

2352063
object-reference	instances
it s saying object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2352068
32-bit	64bit
.when people refer to 32-bit and 64bit assembly they re talking about which instruction set you ll use - they re also sometimes called ia-32 and x64 in the intel case which i presume you re asking about

2352068
32-bit	64bit
there is a lot more going on in the 64bit case .so starting with 32-bit is probably good

2352073
executable-jar	jar
i wonder if there is a way to extraction a re.source file packaged in an executable-jar file and save it to a local drive .so .when a user downloading my jar file and double click on it it will first save one file from the re.source to his c drive then run my program

2352076
checkbox	textbox
i m trying to mask textbox with 2 different masks .when a checkbox has been checked using jquery

2352076
checkbox	textbox
i tried my code with html textbox and html checkbox and it is working ok but .when i tried my code with asp textbox and asp checkbox there is no response

2352079
32-bit	64bit
today s 32-bit and 64bit operating systemd are still started in real-mode then switching to between the relevant modes

2352079
32-bit	64bit
note that 32-bit code will also run on 64bit windows but not the other way round

2352086
windows-xp	windows
it seems to work fine on windows-xp and vista but not windows 7

2352090
dictionary	map
.so if i m using map to create a dictionary will the operation of insert new value be atomicity

2352096
environment	execution
the framework runs on a versioning of the common language runtime that is optimized for gaming to provide a managed execution environment

2352096
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
the runtime is available for windows-xp windows-vista windows 7 and xbox 360 also can be played on zune hds

2352126
python	php
how does yt hide the php-extension and i know yt is probably written in python or something other than php but i have seen this done in wordpress and other php written apps

2352128
logout	login
i have made a web application that uses master page for login logout operation

2352141
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
other browsers such as firefox google-chrome opera konqueror or links didn t have such issues

2352152
put	get
this can be very helpful if you decide that you want to serve restful urls after all and can be made to work with http-request modes get .post put delete head

2352155
overwrite	copying
it s much easier and safer to use revision control software instead of copying files to usb-drive and back since it s easy to overwrite some changes that way

2352156
communication	messages
since messages queue provide an asynchronous communication protocols they were a good fit for this task

2352156
communication	messages
according to the vxworks application programmer s guide google-search the primary intertask communication mechanism within a single cpu is messages queue

2352175
contains	elements
in your example the templates and the layout both contains a full page with html head and body elements resulting in invalid markup

2352199
core-animation	core-graphics
if the blend sample code youâ ve seen targets iphone os thatâ s because core-graphics and core-animation both operate on premultiplied alpha .so drawing into a cgbitmapcontext produces premultiplied data and non-opaque view contents need to be in premultiplied alpha format to composite correctly over other views

2352212
constructor	object
that line starting with a colon will tell the compiler which constructor of bar to invoke .when it is creating a foo object using this specific constructor of foo

2352212
constructor	object
if you don t specify a constructor of bar to use to create the bar sub-object of a foo object then the compiler will use bar s default-constructor

2352212
copy-constructor	constructor
if you invoke a compiler generator constructor of foo the compiler generator default and copy-constructors for you under certain circumstances then the compiler will pick a corresponding bar constructor foo s default-constructor will invoke bar s default-constructor foo s copy-constructor will invoke bar s copy-constructor

in asp.net http handler can contains a validation elements

2352340
credentials	account
however you must account for the credentials for this connection which can be the tricky part

2352352
default	reset	traffic	packets
thus if you tunnel all your ssh traffic through netcat you reset the tos of the tcp packets to the default ones

2352359
subtract	add
if it s a fairly small range -5.0 to +5.0 then it will be quicker to repeatedly add subtract 1.0 until you get within range rather than calling expensive functions such as floor

2352365
callback	methods
instead .when t2 has completed the t2 call callback methods which handles the results call endinvoke and informs the t1 that the task is finished

2352365
callback	methods
a if callback methods is supposed to inform t1 .when the task is finished then why isnâ t this callback methods called inside t1 and not t2

2352365
callback	methods
2 is there some standards pattern how callback methods should inform t1 that t2 has finished

2352365
callback	methods
3 should callback pattern be used even .when t1 needs to receive the returned value of asynchronously called methods

2352366
value	field
you could updates the default value of the field of your database to prevent problems using

2352371
postgresql	oracle
while they may not be reserved-words in the flavor of sql you are currently using you never know .when you might be supporting other types postgresql oracle etc.

2352373
32-bit	64bit
i usually compile everything in 32-bit unless i specifically need 64bit such as database servers. the servers in question will be hosting virtual servers and have 8gb ram hence why i ve kept them 64bit

2352373
32-bit	64bit
however .when compiled in 32-bit on a 64bit systemd getpwnam returns null .when a user does exist

2352387

2352455
dotfiles	git-add
.when i types git-add . dotfiles in git_dir are added but not from subdirectories

2352460
base-class	superclass	derived-class	base-class

2352486
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
in sql-server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g

2352501
double-quotes	single-quotes
you may use single-quotes instead of double-quotes because escape sequences are not recognized within single-quotes

2352502
constructor	object
you can use linq for this assuming you have constructor setup on your business-objects that handles a sqldatareader and an object to copy

2352518
nsmutablearray	nsarray
what you should keep tracking of is merely which classes take ownership of an object nsarray and nsmutablearray do for example and in which situations your own code should shouldn t take ownership of an object

2352525
firefox	safari
i am developing an annual report site which needs to be compatible with major browsers such as ie firefox and safari at least

2352525

2352570
binaryreader	writer
however i was very surprised .when i noticed that .net s binaryreader writer works with a little endian notation

2352582
document-management	alfresco
i imagine it s more of a document-management integration at this points but alfresco can handle wcm as well

2352606
environment	building
tie this in to a continuous-integration environment where the latest code is periodically pulled out of source control built and then all the unit tests run and you have pretty quick feedback in an automated fashion if any code changes break the building

2352615
put	get
4 stick with ugly schema and put xs any within an optional extensions elements - it nests it for no good reason other than the official .net doesn t get confused but it works

2352619

2352626
constructor	object
i want to convert this into a file object and only a file object - i need to pass it to another constructor that required a file

2352642
arrays	loops
generally speaking the idea is to loops through the arrays once while

2352673
python	ruby
your analysis and preliminary research are pretty impressive and the cost of postponing your decision is higher than the marginal value of python over ruby or vice versa

2352681
arrays	loops
for programming with loops and arrays nothing beats david gries s textbook the science of programming

2352691
visualsvn	collabnet
are the capabilities of visualsvn standards edition and collabnet svn equals

2352707

is never going to be null as with any object you get back from a constructor call

2352707
constructor	object
the only way you don t get an object back from a constructor is if the constructor throw an exception-handling

2352721
lighttpd	apache
i ve heard of some other options lighttpd nginx etc. and was wondering what benefit using these would provide over using apache

2352722
children	nodes
notice that with alm which is what you are using getting the children nodes is quite difficult its possible but required extra work

2352729
scripting-language	static-typing
c# doesn t make for a very good scripting-language due to it s compiled nature and static-typing

2352733

the key here is the resp bit it tells jquery to selected the same elements you were before but only inside the context in the second parameter in this case your ajax response contains the new elements that need love

2352758
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
in this case although it is certainly possible there is no particular reason to use the json format in the file - csv xml or anything like that might be just as or more appropriate

2352777
cos	sin
note of warning you can change the rounding mode used here by directly tweak registers on the cpu but don t do that you ll break a lot of stuff including msvc s implementation of sin and cos

arrays	loops
in an openmp parallel.for loops i can declare a statically allocated arrays as private

2352902
constructor	object
physical constness may be enforced by placement of an object in readonly memory only for classes without constructor

2352910
constructor	object
the constructor writes into the object as part of the construction process but this doesn t work if the memory for the object is readonly

2352910
constructor	object
physical const only works for object that can be initializer at compile-time and thus have no need for a constructor

2352930
constructor	object
if your object has a constructor it can t be put into a readonly section by the linker since that readonly-ness would stop the constructor from constructing

2352949
compatibility	legacy
i was running into the same issue on a corporate lan and eventually realized the desktops were unpatched to keep compatibility with legacy software

2352972

2353152
spaces	output
the will not include the spaces in output

2353157
dictionary	arrays
you forgot to alloc the nsdictionary and the nsarrays .so the arrays and dictionary can not save the value

2353161
malloc	free
a segfault within free or malloc usually means that you ve corrupt the heap somehow either by freeing something more than once or freeing something that was never allocated

2353161
malloc	free
the memory for those members ignoring any memory they might dynamically allocate internally was not allocated by a separate call to malloc new and .so .when you free them you mess up the heap

the .app is already able to updates twitter and in time will be updating our online event calendar .so it makes sense to have it all in one central place

2353186
ref	out
for ref out you ll have to defined a local and use stloc ldloca etc

2353190
memcached	apc
and we are using apc + memcached as caching systemd

2353190
memcached	apc
there are two three main difference between apc and memcached .when it comes to caching data

2353190
memcached	apc
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 time faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

2353198
file-descriptor	pipe
maybe the flag so_reuseaddr is used for pipe hence you re not seeing an increment in the file-descriptor numbers

it s blindingly obvious in where implements both interfaces could potentially break the type-safety that s supposed to be guaranteed by generics by simply invoking the non-generic ilist.add methods

2353744
page-fault	kernel
instead they set up your page table in such a way that on the first access to the memory you asked for the cpu will generator a page-fault at which points the kernel handles this and looks for physical memory that will be used for that virtual page

2353746

although it s not specifically stated in the readme i am assuming this means that taps is only compatible with thin mongrel webrick

2353749
environment	execution
your function is now execution in a new global environment

2353772

2353869
ip-address	hostname
a 550 error is often returned by the smtp server .when the sending hostname cannot be inverse resolved to the originating ip-address

2353869
hostname	router	ip-address	hostname
for example the machine i am typing this on has an unroutable ip-address of 192.168.1.103 and my hostname could be so.example.myhouse which works fine because my router pretends that packets from my desk come from 69.59.196.211 which is my wan address

2353869
reverse-dns	dns
even if i used the dns named which maps to 69.59.196.211 stackoverflow.com the smtp server may do a reverse-dns lookup to checked that 211.196.59.69.in-addr.arpa maps to stackoverflow.com

2353908
tree	trie
a radix tree will provide a better memory usage for strings than a regular trie if you have a lot of strings with common roots prefixes which is probably the case for a dictionary words with many forms - although that would probably depend on the language

2353924
controllers	routes
i could probably hack something together by fetching all the routes and then sectioning them by the inverse relationship to there respective day but i am worried that then i will not be able to take advantage of the fetch controllers delegation methods for updating the table .when managed object change

using python properties is not straightforward because of the way django.models.models magically set their instances attributes based on class attributes

2356095
32-bit	64bit
i know you can compile to a 32-bit target on 64bit linux by using the -m32 flag but is it also possible to compile to 64bit on a 32-bit machine by using the -m64 flag

2358059
directory	folder
should this directory be placed in webapps folder in tomcat containers

2358063

2358375
font-size	height	font-size	width
also is there an easy way to get the height and width of a font-size

2358375
font-size	height	font-size	width
.so it looks like the font-size is the height and the width can only be determined without knowing the actual character on monospaced fonts since proportional fonts have varying widths

2358506
triggers	insert
a triggers to prevent invalid data to be insert

2358512
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the reason i ask is that asp.net-mvc sort of stripes away a lot of the magic that webforms gives you in terms of treating a stateless protocols as actually having state

2358512
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you were like i stated before more of a drag and drop types of webforms person than asp.net-mvc might be a bit challenging but i would say its a good challenge and something that will ultimately make you a better web developer

2358814
triggers	insert
anytime i see a value clause used or the value from insert or deleted set to a variables i know the triggers is bad and needs to be rewritten

2358814
triggers	insert
sooner or later someone will need to do a batch-file insert or updates and your triggers will silently cause the wrong thing to happen

2358820
json	xml
you have to get the list from your server through json or xml

2358834

2358834
child-process	spawn
you will want to remove the revalonstartup directive and replace it with a handler call which does the same configure apache to spawn only one child-process hence the whole fork thing and connect gdb to it

2358835
python	java
other languages such as java python ... use a different way of noting the api of a libs effectively including all the necessary information in the actual libs and thus usually need no separate package except maybe for documentation and additional tools

2358845
defined	declare
i don t know the details of why this service class needs to know what controllers it is being called from but perhaps you can just declare an enum that defined the different use cases and pass that in in its constructor

2358945
selected	checkbox
i am trying to building a downloadinging section where the visitor completes a form and then selected checkbox to open downloading dialog

2358975

2359242
dictionary	arrays	selected	button
optional selected the arrays controllers and set the classname in attributes to whatever class your items are nsstring or you can use the default nsmutabledictionary and add key in the box below which consequently lets you wrap your items in a dictionary and add different key for what you want to show in pop-up button and what you want to have in background

2359242

2359303
duplicates	sorted	sortedlist	sorted	sorteddictionary	sortedlist	sorteddictionary	sorted
if you can t wait for that release or don t want to target that versioning of the framework the closest thing you will get is sortedlist or sorteddictionary neither of which allow for duplicates entries and both of which offer sorted behavior you may find useful

2359313
contains	set

profiling	trace
run a trace in the profiling pick the blank templates selected the deadlock graphing event and on the new tab that appears events extraction settings save each checked save deadlock xml events separately in its own file

2359591
attributes	properties	required	checked
in winforms there is the checked properties in wpf the ischecked properties and the xaml required the x named attributes

2359603
frame	width
i assume that i need to calculate width of the text and stretch the overlay image frame vertically .when the text words wrap

2359605
perl	php
but i think i d be choosing php over perl because of support for fastcgi which improves reliability and performance on the windows stack

2359605
ruby-on-rails	django
finally ruby-on-rails and python django aren t well supported options on iis and will be non-existant on shared-hosting platform

2359605
ruby-on-rails	django
this is mostly due to the amount of console access you d need to knock things into shape to be able to run ruby-on-rails django

2359620
32-bit	16-bit
if you have 32-bit processor and you will use 16-bit value for memory economy it will be aligned to 32-bit

2359620
32-bit	16-bit
.so i think it is not .so important use 16-bit uint instead of 32-bit value

2359624
implements	abstract
implements abstract properties with overrides

2359637
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textbox
looking at webresource.axd that webform_initcallback methods iterates through the entire form and attaches some kind of events to every single textbox checkbox radio-button etc

2359637
scriptmanager	updatepanel
.so i guess i really need to abandon scriptmanager and updatepanel altogether here

2359651
versioning	upgrade
be careful though -- ubuntu s updates manager will happily upgrade this versioning of libodbc-ruby to the broken 0.9997-2

2359657
32-bit	16-bit
my guess is that on some architectures 0xffff will be a signed 16-bit value while long is a signed 32-bit value

2359666
account	userid
it also leaks data .when presented external to see the numbers of users registered just create a new account and checked your userid

2359676
arrays	loops
use elem.each to loops through the second arrays on each entry do a this.inarrays checked against list.makearrays - .so you re look at each item in the second arrays and seeing if it s present in the first one at which points you can perform whatever operation you re looking for

2359678
fflush	gets
but in general yes you should close better dispose via using .so it gets shut down upon exception-handling the streaming .when done otherwise you might not fflush .some data to the underlying unmanaged destination

2359678
compression	streaming
and there are some streaming that don t actually fully fflush on fflush - they need to be close d compression streaming in particular

2359682
buffering	streaming
closing streaminging fflush the write buffering and writes any unwritten data to the streaming

2359694
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know the difference between asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc and i ve seen quite a few videos explaining that they both run on top of asp.net and i ve used both

2359694
webforms	asp.net
however my question is how would one develop right on top of asp.net without webforms or mvc.net

2359763
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2359769
defined	declare
python doesn t need variables to be declare initially .so you can declare and defined at arbitrary points

2359770
duplicates	elements
changing the id to a non-numeric eliminates the duplicates elements

2359778
.when	ready
.when you use php as server side web scripting-language it will be faster than c++ program running as a cgi this is because for cgi a separate process needs to be created and some setup must be done while php scripting are running inside httpserver module and are just ready to go

2359800
webforms	asp.net	templating	markup
asp.net 1.0 and 1.1 originally consisted of a class-library and templating markup webforms

2359800
system.web	.net
imho the system.web namespace represents the effort to incorporate asp into the .net

2359800
system.web	.net
this is probably why the system.web namespace has grown to include code for web-services ajax json asp.net-mvc and in .net 3.5sp1 asp.net-dynamic-data

2359801
concatenation	comma
in particular i m looking at line 2 where they seem to be using comma for string concatenation

2359822
any	set
.so you need a set of criterion and .some metrics inorder for this conversation to have any meaning at all

2359830
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari
here s my solution to the problem using mootools which works in firefox 3.6 safari 4.0.4 and internet-explorer 7

2359830
display	height
then for browsers other than internet-explorer it will display the full height iframe once the loading of its content is complete and remove the loading graphic

2359835
revision	svn
svn has a single global revision level and individual items have a sparse-matrix spaces of versioning

2359836
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
which i guess could be considered basic asp.net without a webforms or asp.net-mvc

2359842
google-chrome	safari
i am also at a loss as to how to solve this problem because i can t figure out how to use any of ie s debuggers if they even have one and seeing how i already tested this and made it work in two browsers technically three since safari runs off webkit just like google-chrome i just don t have the drive or capacity to imagine what could be going wrong

2359851
contains	elements
i ve got two arrays where i want to find all the elements in array0 where the full string from array1 is contains in the string of array0

2359861
revision	svn
and that leaves the local-only commit as a weird probably unsafe commit between two svn revision

2359873
contains	set	click	mouse
afaik it cannot be done or is long-winded way of doing it the loadcursor function can load the cursor from an embedded-resource or a file on disk with an extension .ani hence my answer in support for the usage of realworld cursor editor which can create an .ani file contains animated cursor the other way of doing it is to use the control panels mouse click on pointers tab-page on the dialog itself to set it as system-wide settings

2359881
callback	methods
i think the callback within the jquery.ajax methods makes this kluge work somehow but without an ajax call i can t put any follow-up messages

2359885
pbkdf2	hash
you ve hash it by applying something like pbkdf2 or bcrypt to it for storage right

2359892
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
google-chrome firefox safari ie

2359899
entity-framework	ado.net
i am currently looking at microsoft s ado.net entity-framework

2359932
checkbox	textbox
because i can still tick on the checkbox even if i have this code is the readonly properties only for textbox

2359939
expression	brackets
square brackets are a range of expression

2359951
firefox	safari
.when i try to upload the pdf myself using firefox on os x or safari or ie 6 7 8 it works just fine

2359970
lightbox	jquery
i personally have good experiences with lightbox2 and jquery lightbox plugins

2359996
.net	wcf
with .net 3 came wcf which allows a range of different types of service not just web-service hosted in a range of .net applications and service not just iis

2359998
jsonp	ajax
as scunliffe mentioned you are trying to do a crossbrowser ajax without using jsonp

2360000
lightbox	colorbox
then instead of points the link for each to a new page you might want to consider having the images load in a cool way such as a javascript lightbox colorbox some of the other answers suggest

2360004
ms-access	dbf
i m using an ms-access 2003 front end to access the data on a network-drive owned by a visual-foxpro 9 application via odbc and it seems to be unbelievably slow - there s about 1400 recording in one particular table and it takes a good minute to load up on the access interface although .when using a basic dbf viewer or the application that the tables belong to it s instantaneous

2360018
contains	any
the int value of page in fact of any string that contains no digits is 0 .so that s why you see it becoming 0

2360021
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to do the same thing with firefox google-chrome

2360042
google-chrome	safari
it works in ie7 ie8 fx 3 safari and google-chrome .so no need to handle cross-browser issues

2360052
contains	elements
queue is a templates class as well .so you ll need to specify the elements types contains in your queue

2360068
return-value	arguments
the conventions for ordinary function-calls on linux is similar -- the order of registers is rdi rsi rdx rcx r8 and r9 .so all the same except using rcx instead of r10 with further arguments on stack and a return-value in rax

2360078
revision	updates
if you run your own subversion server you can commit changes to document from your working directory which contains all the document you are working on and send them to the server which then updates your repository .so that the latest revision of each document is display

2360115
attributes	properties
.when you use that attributes rather than put it on a properties of your model class you put it on the class itself

2360121
arrays	loops
do you think there might be a way to printing section i in your final loops without looking it up using sections i thereby negating the need for the arrays completely

2360124
webserver	upload
.so i ve decided to upload the files onto the webserver spaces rather than the mysql spaces but each time i try to upload anything i get the following error

2360132
cvs	git	version-control	cvs	version-control	git
subversion or svn is a version-control systemd others are cvs git mercurial

2360139
subclassing	superclass
what s the correct syntax to defined my subclassing in a way that lets me keep the typing generics letting me pass they types along to the superclass and interface

2360143
any	set
we can assume that the allowed sets sizes is the same k for all a_i to find a 1 k matching as any other set size can be ignore

2360149
value	field
.sometimes there can be a value in the primaryuse column that isn t listed as one of the dropdownlistfor items and .so my application crash .when trying to bind the dropdownlistfor s selectedvalue to that field

2360151
postgresql	oracle
i like postgresql because i come from an oracle

2360154
put	get
they don t actually get the real model metadata the displaynameattribute to put together a more flexible localizable messages

2360167
value	field
many database systemd also allow you to store a null value in field designated as boolean to allow them to represent three value yes no and unknown null

2360169
callback	methods
callback will be interfaces .so just like you can mock the service methods on the client side you can mock the client callback on the service side

2360185
entity-framework	data-access
the three things that will not change in this project are the fact that we are using the entity-framework to do our data-access the fact that we want thorough unit-testing and that our user-interface is asp.net

2360198
gwt-rpc	gwt
gwt syncproxy allows you to access gwt-rpc service e.g methods from pure java not jsni code

2360204
value	field
i m trying to create an mdx query on the tfs cube which gets the historical value of the estimate field

2360209
slidedown	slideup
i have an interface that makes heavy use of the jquery slideup and slidedown effect to expand items in a tri-state kind of way

2360214
google-chrome	firefox
you need to change visual-studio s default browser to firefox google-chrome

2360216
keyboard	mouse
instead of sendinput i would try sending keyboard or mouse messages directly to the child windows

2360225
void	main
if you really must call void main string arguments you could get the display by calling display.getdefault which will either create a new display or use the one from the rcp-application

2360232
gwt-rpc	gwt
gwt syncproxy allows you to access gwt-rpc service e.g methods from pure java not jsni code

2360236
subtract	add
incidently you want to add 1 to strlen named not subtract 1

2360236
strcpy	memcpy
or if you want named stored in your recording without a terminating null then you need to use memcpy to copy the string into your recording not strcpy

2360238
shallow-copy	deep-copy
it s not clear under exactly what circumstances a shallow-copy is good enough or .when you might have to write a deep-copy

2360256
mouseover	mouseout
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

2360267
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine on firefox safari google-chrome but not on ie

2360274
strcmp	scanf	strcmp	atoi	scanf	atoi
if that is indeed the case try not to use scanf use fgets to retrieve choice and use atoi to conver to int or strcmp to compare against 1 n etc.

2360275
repository	entity
but beyond this level of validation we would not be able to say that the bo entity is valid in your business domain and or repository

2360275
repository	entity
- in this we need to validation if the bo entity is valid within the context of the repository where it is being persistent

2360275
repository	entity
.so to keep the entities pure you will need to split the validation into these 2 step - one performed by the entity itself the second by the repository which is persiting working with the entity

2360311
constructor	object
fortunately imageicon has another constructor that understands url object and .so there s no need to call getpath

2360320
ubuntu	debian
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

2360320
versioning	upgrade
upgrading via apt-get didn t get me to a high enough versioning .so we instead use force to make the upgrade go through

2360320
versioning	upgrade
for me sudo ports -d -f install expat pushed the upgrade through over-wrote the apt versioning and allowed me to progress

2360321
value	field
the default binder in mvc2 will attempt to bind the value in the form that is posted to the action based on the named of the field in the form

2360346
value	field
assuming that you want to put the username which is stored in the session into the value field of your form i would do something like

2360374
textmate	emacs
there are some old post out there about how to set up a pure python xcode-project like this one but in the end you might be better off using an editor you re already familiar with like emacs or if you don t mind spending a little bit of money textmate all along with a free vcs like mercurial or git

2360383
perl	php
the best way to see what is actually happening is to run the process under strace -e trace network and try to match up the network systemd call with the perl and php statements

2360404
checkbox	button
you probably want to call that .when your value is changing in addition to .when you click the checkbox ie .whenever you click on your calculator button or on textboxt1.textchanged or whatever and only if your checkbox is checked

2360404
textbox	button
you likely also have code elsewhere maybe calculator button or something that will change the value in your textbox something like.

2360453
contains	elements	margins	padding
the fragility creeps in if you add margins to the contains elements especially the elements which is why i used padding instead

2360470
attributes	properties
i notice that you have the attributes on the description properties but it is of types object

2360473
jqgrid	.post
how to use serializerowdata option with editrow methods in jqgrid to .post a json data to server

2360485
hashtable	set
if you hash the set edges in the parent graphing you can go through the subgraphing s edges checked if each one is in the hashtable and in the correct amount if desired

2360491
python	ruby
i don t know ruby but python has a function ord that translation a unicode special character to its unicode code points

2360506
pointers	stack
and it s really hard to walk stack back in the debugger .when there is no frame pointers

2360509
contains	any
that is unless you are making a string contains the xml file yourself without any libs but that is a bit insane

2360534
centering	fixed
viewb should be horizontally centeringed on coordinate 300 unless its left edges gets within 20 pixels of viewb s right edges in which case viewa s left edges should stay fixed at 20 pixels to the right of viewb s right edges and viewa s horizontal centering get pushed to the right.

2360550
selected	button
i m currently using the buser-interfacelt-in user-interface selected row press trashcan button in footer confirm but i d prefer to have a delete button in each row and implements my own user-interface for confirmation

2360553
dependency-injection	singleton
you can use the singleton pattern or if you want to go the route of a dependency-injection framework which is about much more than just creating singleton but well worth looking into most di containers have the ability to create only a single instances of an object

2360559
constructor	private	instances	private
by making the constructor on class c private and having a public static methods that takes care of giving you the right instances of c you can ensure that a and b will always get the same instances

2360582
any	set
the second control called changedcal1 has the setting of firstdayofweek set to monday to test if it had any impact on the control and the last one called changedcal2 has the firstdayofweek set to sunday which is the default setting for a mac

2360584
json	xml
the result will be in json or xml format that i can parsing through c#

2360614
pointers	stack
declare a variables on stack in the function parse_command that variables goes out of scoping and pointers to it cease to be valid .when parse_command returns

2360618
javascript	dom
if the directory is on the same domain and your webserver is setup to show directory indexes then you could use javascript to request the url and load it into the dom for data-extraction

2360618
json	xml
the other suggestions of having serverside scripting output json or xml would be an improvement

2360619
firefox	opera
i changed your language checked to use http_accept_language and to also not be case-sensitive opera uses en-us where firefox and ie use en-us in my tests

2360622
constructor	object
this approach also allows you to deserialize an object split across any numbers of files because sequenceinputstream s constructor accepts two inputstream object one of which could be another sequenceinputstream

2360631
strcpy	memcpy
the best way to copy char arrays into another char arrays is to use either memcpy strcpy or similar methods that accept pointers to src dest and size to be copy-paste

2360640
anonymous-function	eval	setinterval	settimeout
side note try not to use eval this is what passing a string to settimeout or setinterval does pass a function or anonymous-function instead like i have above

2360651
internet-explorer	firefox
it turns out that firefox and internet-explorer both have different approaches for adding class named

2360662
duplicates	elements
note that to maintain the smooth-scrolling effect you would have to duplicates the first and last elements in your list

2360666
derived-class	base-class
by conventions base-class doesn t recognize its child .so you will most likely lose the additional data carried by derived-class

2360672
put	get
if you really wanted to get slick you put the database polling code in a backgroundworker thread .so your gui never blanks out while you wait for a sql-server connection

2360674
downgrade	upgrade
could i use subsonic s bare migration framework and just have a set of sql files to do the upgrade downgrade

2360681
downgrade	upgrade
could i use migrator.net bare migration framework and just have a set of sql files to do the upgrade downgrade

2360682
account	userid
i thought maybe i can attach a userid parameter while making change request to the server and server side will compare the current userid with this userid parameter to make the change request process or return a refresh cmd to make the out-of-date page be refreshed to the current account s if the ids are not same

2360683
rubygems	bundler	bundler	gem

however i started using cucumber and webrat in the selenium mode to test some ajaxy features of the site and whenever i was running the feature webrat was telling me that the ruby-on-rails server was started but i always got a xhr_error where selenium couldn t find the url

2360683
cucumber	selenium	cucumber	webrat	bundler	gem
i just want to be able to run cucumber and webrat + selenium successfully while using gem bundler but this is driving me nuts

2360689
hide	show
i d like to add some checkbox not on each row just in a control panels besides the table to show hide grouping of rows using javascript

2360690

2360833
tcpdf	fpdi
fpdi extends tcpdf

2360851
rollback	commit
the effect of not having this enabled is that an uncommitted insert or updates will block a selected in another transactional until the first transactional commit or rollback

2360855
radix-sort	heapsort	radix-sort	quicksort	radix-sort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
one reason you might not see it as often as you d think you would is that radix-sort is not as general purpose as comparison based sorts quicksort mergesort heapsort

2360866
progress-bar	progress
what i actually tried is to read the directory and display the file named and at the same time the progress control should show the progress..i created a dynamic static to display the file named and progress-bar control to show the progress...what happens here is its first display all the file named one by one and then after that its showing the progress...so am bit confused..can anybody explain me how to do that or refer me some articles...if u want i can .post the code

2360876
pointers	stack
in the case of an x86 platform the contents of the ebp base pointers and esp stack-pointers cpu registers which hold the address of the current stack frame and of the stack-pointers for any given function are used to follow the chaining of pointerss and move up to the initial stack frame

python	java
a lot of people like eclipse with pydev for python although i don t know how wel it works on os x with apple s mishandling of java

2360892

windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows
this is not really a problem since versioning 3.0 of the .net is include with windows-server 2008 windows-vista and windows 7 from wikipedia

2360908
vbscript	jscript
if you haven t already read why vbscript and jscript custom actions suck

2360911
hash	md5
and just because it s a hash doesn t necessarily mean it s one-way well by definition it does but there are utilities to generator md5 plaintexts and i would guess it s only a matter of time before it happens to others

2360927
subtraction	addition
lagged fibonacci generator have a maximum period of 2 k - 1 2 m-1 if addition or subtraction is used and 2 k-1 if xor operations are used to combine the previous value

cucumber	selenium
it will find mongrel and start the server you can then run the cucumber feature that uses selenium and it will work

2360953
hide	show
something like that but i am unsure how to get the div that is currently show and hide it

2360953
hide	show
i could iterate through all the childelements and hide each div and then show the one that is being click but maybe there s a better way

2360958
version-control	git
the next step is newer distribute version-control systemd like git or mercurial

2360958
rollback	commit	.when	ready
they can work 100 locally including commit and branches and rollback and everything and .when ready push a set of changes upstream

2360962
globalization	localization
.net has some extremely rich localization and globalization capabilities

2361792
hash	md5
example of calculating the md5 hash of two files now tested

2361809
attributes	properties
if adwizarepeatbox adwizarepeatbox adwizaslavebox and other don t extends single class that has properties attributes than you better search reflection namespace for an answer or rewrite your code .so that they would extends single class

for a specific screens i m looking for a jlist that i could filtering the same way you can filtering a jtable using a rowfiltering

2362131
arrays	map

haskell	erlang
erlang or haskell for something out of the ordinary

2362137

2362199
jtable	jlist
you could consider using a single column jtable instead of a jlist

2362199
filtering	sorting
if you follow this approach you ll get filtering and sorting for free providing you re using jdk 6

2362209
filtering	sorting	jtable	jlist
imho glazedlists should do filtering as well as sorting for jtable jlist and jcombobox

2362218
value	field
instead of field nazwa value

2362220
selected	checkbox
furthermore i m using better_selected which turns selected lists into lists of checkbox easier to selected mulitple value on long lists

2362220
selected	checkbox
thus the checkbox always returned some value either the id if selected or 0 zero if not selected and i ended up with something like search phrase category 0 0 0 0 ... 0

we use a custom urlrewiter on our .net sites and set a wildcard mapping to redirect any request to the .net isapi filtering for process

2362336
random-seed	generator
you will probably want to investigate the particulars of that on your systemd and give it a new random-seed in each thread or use a different random-number generator depending on what you find

2362343
arrays	loops
to accomplish exactly what you were describing take snapshot and save snapshot you could store those in an arrays in that takesnapshot methods or you could loops through the list.dataprovider do get the bitmaps

2362343
python	ruby
then you d just need to pass them to a backend language ruby python php... to save

2362348
lookup	any
you are using a table with no clustered index heap table as it is called that is generally not very efficient for selected because any meaningful query required either a bookmark lookup or a full table scan

the rightbarbuttonitem can contains any view as long as you wrap it in a uibarbuttonitem

2362597
lightbox	thickbox
i suggest to go for some other solution like thickbox lightbox or any other solution if you want to apply your own styles for your popup.but in my opinion facebox is better

2362600
udp	tcp
first i ll just paraphrase stevens from unix network-programming section 22.4 .when to use udp instead of tcp

2362600
udp	tcp
udp should not be used for bulk data transfer file transfer since you would have to built-in all the functionality arleady in tcp to make it work right

2362607

i want to say search for any entries contains the words package i assume with someselector search +mysearch+ and add the class collapsible to all parent li entries and add the class highlight to the actual matching entries

2362611
shell	bash	bash	zsh
if you have the luxury to use different shell other than bash try zsh or ksh

constructor	object
since the constructor is internal .when writing unit test cases i won t be able to create the object of category

2362620
linked-list	nodes
none of the nodes can be directly referenced from outside the linked-list .so there s no case where there would be a reference to any of them outside my class but i m unsure if java would correctly garbage collect the remaining chaining nodes

2362641
selected	button
i have a grouping of button that should act like toggle button but also as radio button where only one button can be selected pressed down at a current time

2362641
selected	button
it also need to have a state where none of the button are selected pressed down

2362645
constructor	object
another reason for having internal constructor is .when you have a factory-method that may return a polymorphism object but once again consider if it would be a problem to expose the constructor if it doesn t mean compromising invariants

2362653
unsafe	out
as far as i found out the difference are that linq required .net 2.0 unless you hack it which is unsafe and illegal while nhibernate works with 2.0

linux	unix
the unix linux folks tend to heavily favour use of existing libs because they are used to every machine being a development machine that can rebuild its own software from source

2362780
compatibility	platform

2362874
selected	listbox
if you re inside a templates can use triggers you could also just checked whether listbox has any selected items

2362886
output	cat
again this relies on subshell execution - the .. - to avoid the cat refusing to have the same file for input and output

2362888
controllers	routes

sql-server	postgresql
i want to develop some applications in .net c# winforms with a sql-server as back-end haven t decided yet postgresql mssql or other

2363021
getter	setter
wcf object are designed to be data transport object and any logic that resides behind setter and getter is dangerous at best

2363021
attributes	properties
to work around this i d suggest decorating only automatic properties and field with the data-members attributes which will prevent any other logic from being triggers

2363040
contains	elements
the problem is that this works great for static html that was available on page load but .when one creates html5 elements afterward for example ajax call contains them or simply creating with javascript it will mark these newly added elements them as htmlunknownelement as supposed to htmlgenericelement in ie debugger

2363054

this rules will rewrite any request that contains â œnoticeboardâ in the url path to noticeboard2.php in the same directory

2363166
any	set
unfortunately this only works for single events because recurring events do not have a time properties well you can set one but it doesn t have any effect - which brings me to my next stackoverflow question.

2363174
decrement	increment
increment or decrement the int and load the appropriate screens

2363174
linked-list	dictionary

2363195
google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
i would say gecko firefox and friend or webkit safari google-chrome and friend

2363196
mouseclick-event	mousedown
another suggestion which was to write a mousedown or mouseclick-event handler for the user-controls and in that call this.setfocus

2363202
directory	folder
use activator.createinstance or similar reflection methods and put the new dlls in a sub folder of the bin directory

pick a documentation-generation tool such as pydoc or epydoc i use epydoc in pyparsing and use the markup syntax recognized by that tool

2363268

but the problem with undefined behavior is that because the standards doesn t guarantee it if you later change os or compiler or upgrade to a later versioning of the same compiler you can t rely on the behavior remaining the same

2363276
callback	methods
note that you can also specify this with annotations on the callback methods

2363294

this is in sharp contrast with say a true restful http-get like the one you can make on an amazon-s3 resource where your get is guaranteed not to modify the resource you get back

2363322
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox pc mac safari mac but in ie8 on pc it returns unexpected error on line 3 or any other line that uses the flashmovie object

2363354
bmp	png
how can i load a bmp or png from disk and create a brush from it

2363359
put	get
then you should have a thread collections who will get items from that list and get the file if he timeout he should put the task back to the collections

2363360
click	mouse
.when i click a mouse it fires just for click event

2363363
constructor	object
here bruce s trying to explain that .when you call a virtual function inside an object s constructor polymorphism isn t exhibited the current class function will only be called and it will not be some other derived-class versioning of that function

2363363
constructor	object
this is valid and i can understand it since the constructor for a class will not know beforehand if it s running for it or for someother dervied object s creation

2363368
callback	methods
you can specify a callback in jquery s load methods which is called after content is loaded into div

2363373
server-side-includes	ssi
the only solution i found for this is making html files and then using ssi server-side-includes

2363379
membership	guid
if you are happy to replicate the asp.net membership stored-procedures in your sql database you could get away with creating a class that like the sample inherited from membership-provider and only provide an overrides of the createuser methods to create an int based key rather than a guid based one

2363384
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	arrays	loops

2363407
required	checked
in response to query about checked that each re.source file contains the same re.sources - if you re using the re.source class re.sources.re.source1.myfirststringre.source to access your re.sources then switching configuration will result in building errors if the required re.source doesn t exist .so you ll find that quite quickly

2363407
contains	elements
for the truly paranoid if your building-process takes 3 days to building all configuration or something equally mad at the end of the day .resx files are just xml files - you just need something to checked that each .resx file with the same filenamed contains the same numbers of data elements with the same named attributes

2363412

noncopyable	containers
because streaming are noncopyable you can tecxhnicaly put them into standards containers

2363609
preprocessor	lexer
i m going back over an old project where i added preprocessor functionality to essence and i realised that my previous solution of writing a domain specific language and associated lexer parsing was overkill

2363609
python	php
i d rather not use php as python is much easier to distribute as part of a larger project ironpython or jython

2363613
.when	ready
.when data are ready a postmessage is sent to the form which updates

2363651
sbcl	ccl
his solution was for cmucl but it worked with the essentially identical run-program function on the closely related sbcl and with minor changes it will work on ccl as well because ccl s run-program is basically a clone of the one from cmucl sbcl

2363739
python	ruby
it uses ruby instead of python and is geared toward teaching basic programming concepts to complete beginners

2363765

2363823
unsigned	bigint
.so as not to waste spaces on byte-level precision by actually storing the limit as an int that would required a full bigint for things like 100gb you might want to instead do .something like limit_amount int unsigned and limit_unit enum b kb mb gb

2363851
getter	setter
to do this you can t really use automatic getter setter and you need to set isdirty in each setter

2363855

value	field
i ve got some drop downs and if they have something other then an option with a value of 0 selected then i want the coresponding expiry date field to be required

2364274
ref	out
this variation works slightly different considering the fact that it is not really necessary to uphold the invariant at all time since it does not matter if a black object refers to a white one as long as the gc knows that this white object used to be and still is accessible during the current gc cycle either because there are still gray object referring to this white object as well or because the a ref to this white object is put onto an explicit stack that is also considered by the gc .when it runs out of gray object

2364279
any	set
failbit is set whenever a read operation fails to extraction any characters whether this is because it hit eof or not

in this simple .app it would be possible to just hide the other screenss that aren t show but in the more complicated .app there s just too much state information to manage screens information properly and easily

2364340
hide	show
edit i ve tried the hide show thing on some dialog and it just doesn t seem to matter

2364349
udp	tcp	udp	mtu

twenty years before python 1.0 was published knuth already foresaw the key syntax aspects that was to become such a hallmark of python and independently haskell release a bit earlier than python -- from personal discussion with knuth peyton jones and van rossum i can attest they all claim that these three inventions of indentation for grouping were entirely independent from each other just a case of great minds think alike -- or in charles fort s words it was just steam engine time

2364598
variables	boolean	contains	any
formal proof of code including early exit are of course not a jot harder than for equivalent code with single points of exit if nothing else because the famo.us proof by corrado bã hm and giuseppe jacopini show how to perform a mechanical transformation from any flowchart to one contains only sequences selection and repetition but of course the transformed program -- just like any other program trying to avoid the early-exit styles -- is prone to having more nesting than needed and extra boolean status variables which interfere with reliability directness and efficiency -- making early-exit much superior in languages that support it well

2366670
udp	tcp
if you know that server is listening on both tcp and udp checked the firewalls on both machines and along the route

2366676
default-value	default
this might work depends on if you mean the default-value defined in a default constraint or in code

2366681

2366750
php-ini	fopen
if your php configuration allow you to fopen url allow_url_fopen directive in php-ini

2366781
implements	extends
also since you can implements many interfaces but extends only one class you can only provide your own superclass if you implements runnable

2366791
push	pull
thus they are able to push to pull from other repositories

2366791
push	pull
it doesn t mean it will keep tracking of where it has been cloned although your own repository can keep a list of remote repositories from which to pull from push to

i will be generator classes that extends existing classes in the application assembly implements additional interfaces adding methods and overrides virtual and abstract members

2366928
pagespeed	yslow
pagespeed firebug extension like yslow that checked for various website optimization techniques but can also minify your css for you

2366942
arrays	loops
although among many other changes i would make here you could entirely handle a file on each loops iterator and avoid having an arrays of named entirely

2366960
positioning	slider
is there any way to make this work properly .so the scripting gets the exact div height and then the animation slider to the correct positioning

2366963
constructor	object
because otherwise it would have to create an object and running the constructor could cause negative side-effects

2366983
crypt	salt
is there a way in php 5.3 to get crypt blowfish salt starting with 2a results identical to those generator by php 5.2

2366998
derived-class	base-class
it s based on the dominance rules if there is an ambiguity in lookup and the ambiguity is between namedd of a derived and a virtual base-class the named of the derived-class is taken instead

2367004
value	field
.when i wrote my program i didn t know there would be a class by this named but at runtime i found out a class by the named of my_class_x123.java exists and i want to use its field such as abc and xyz above how to get those value

i tried copying it to the project directory the bin folder and the c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.nnnn folder but it still can t find it and it won t tell me where it s looking

2367086
linked-list	nodes
if the object themselves act as linked-list nodes then you can remove an object directly simply by swapping four pointers really fast

2367087
getter	setter
after looking at the code in your question i realized that you need getter and setter for those attributes

2367101
substitution	replace
i have a batch-file that looks up a variables say called newpasswd that contains the passwd abc12345 and i want to use perl substitution to replace the value like the following

one of my lecturers showed me the sony vector math libs which is used in the bullet physics-engine and it s great as far as i can see

2367194
interface-builder	iboutlet
.when you can t do something using interface-builder only then it s time to write code that mix iboutlet and code or do it in code only

2367200
function-pointers	function-call	function-pointers	virtual-functions
if you want function-call to be resolved at runtime you have to either use explicit indirect call call through function-pointers or use language-features that are based on runtime call resolution like virtual-functions or you can use plain branching with good-old if or switching

2367211
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 for windows works as does ie 8 and safari on both platform

2367222
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you could easily apply most of the principles to a webforms site as necessary though i d recommend going with asp.net-mvc if yo have the choice...

2367226
ready	live
2 just because something is commited to the repository doesn t mean that it s ready to go live - it s quite often an intermediary building that could be riddled with bugs

2367226
configuration	environment
if you use a multi-server environment in asp.net don t forget to updates the machine key in the configuration files or your shared encrypted caching like the viewstate won t work across servers

2367226
web-config	app-config
4 i ve got a .post building step that only triggers on publishing that replace my database connectionstrings with production ones and also changes my production app-config value from false to true in the publishinged web-config app-config files

2367228
return-value	arguments
otherwise as in your case the arguments object ids return-value of the built-in function id are used for comparison

as long as it gives you non-null value you can return some contains an elements to generator and the state which could change if you wanted

2367247
configuration	logging
there seems to be some kind of default logging configuration being used it is ignoring my log4j.properties file entirely but i can t find where it is getting the information from

2367256
value	field
if you just need the class field you don t even need to create an instances just as long as you use reflection to get the class you can use getdeclaredfield methods to get the named of the field and their value

2367259
constructor	object
you can always load your target jndi.properties into a properties object which is a subclassing of hashtable and pass that to the constructor

2367274
private-key	rsa
is it possible sign a plain text string with rsa private-key on google-app-engine with java sdk

2367278
children	nodes
then you can only add the children nodes that have a match in the departmentitemrelationship table

if it s the first case case it would be way easier to do this in python or perl rather than in sed

2367379
selected	button	dialog	pop-up
.when the user selected a foobar in the list and click the edit button i want the foobar to be show in a pop-up dialog windows .so it can be edited

2367396
.net	wcf
now in a .net environment let me first set out that i would rather not use soap specifically or even wcf generally

2367408
pentaho	talend
tools like pentaho and talend offer you a great deal of flexibility and you don t have to write a single line of code

2367409
mta	sta
one threading issue you will encounter is that wpf required sta threads and wcf uses mta threads

2367409
mta	sta
this is not a significant problem since you can have a pool of sta threads to get the same performance as you would from mta threads

2367417
callback	methods
the system.threading.timer has a callback methods

2367427
defined	declare
also you ve declare the function taking arguments by value but defined it taking arguments by reference

2367459
callback	methods
if the time simply changes the callback methods then you just need to checked the correctness of that methods not how the systemtime works

2367477
revision	svn
maybe there is a proper term for this but what if you want to simply downloading a specific revision of a file directory to disk and never want to commit any changes - say as part of a building release process - and you don t want the svn meta information

2367496
rome	feed
in my application rome api tries to validation the feed against and dtd in w3c and after some time it fails since w3c blocks that ip

2367496
rome	feed
is there a way that i can disable xml feed validation in rome

2367507
codedom	.net
in your scenario both of them would probably work fine though codedom may need higher-privileges because it actually needs to invoke c# compiler which is a part of any .net installation

2367514
filtering	sorting
if i m filtering and sorting by a there is no need for the first query to populate b using the line

2367571

treeview should have an itemtemplate the hierarchical and the itemssource set

2367713
jquery	.post	callback	methods
if you are posting data not in a form because you could simply set the form s action to the current page and the data being posted isn t directly related to the content of the next page you can use the callback of jquery s .post methods to redirect the user

2367722
value	field
for example if you have a byte and within that byte there are two 3-bit field and 2 wasted bits knowing which bits are in which field are active .when the byte value is something like 11 will make things slightly faster than having to use pen and paper

2367727
websphere	ibm
the advantage of using spring over standards jdk 5 java.util.concurrent.executor is that if you re on application servers that need to use managed threads ibm websphere or oracle weblogic you can use the workmanagertaskexecutor to hook into the commonj work managers

2367734
mstest	nunit
i realise that there are many older questions addressing the general question of nunit v mstest for versioning of visual-studio up to 2008 such as this one

however using fiddler and ie we can see that the following is sent .when we populate the id textbox and click the send button

2367752
ubercart	cck
look into an integration of ubercart and cck .so you can set up your own field for this

2367759
mstest	nunit
my recommendation is following if nunit satisfies you - use it forget about mstest

2367764
where-clause	sql
you can also explicit enumerate your table before applying the where-clause to it thus preventing the generator of an sql that cannot be mapped

2367802
buildpath	libs
right-click on the project in project view selected buildpath- configure buildpath then libs tab

2367807
stderr	stdout
running this scripting but redirecting stdout thus showing what gets printed on stderr you get

2367824
any	set
is there any way i can set up the servers existing crontabs to points to an include like this

2367842
flat-file	edi
converting an edi messages to a flat-file is a bad idea you are probably going to loose data and messages meaning

2367845
perl	awk	python	perl
use tools like awk python perl where they work with field and delimiters easily best of all modules that specifically tailored to process csv is available

2367864
value	field
as the named stack frame suggests changes that were already made to global state like static-variables changes to field value and the like will not be undone only local-variables are reset

2367864
execution	restart
you need to be aware of this - i often consider it a useful feature to explore different paths of execution without having to restart the application or a particular lengthy process that led to the current stack

2367867
administration	account
i run on xp under an administration account

2367869
installation	upgrade	directory	folder	versioning	upgrade

2367872
tcl	lua
tcl lua or even javascript comes to mind

2367874
ironpython	ironruby
have you thought about ironpython or ironruby

2367885
disconnect	transfer
it doesn t disconnect at a certain byte transfer size

2367903
linked-list	dictionary
i thought about as in spent an hour implements then slammed my head against a wall for being such an idiot a methods that put the typess in an order based on their hashcode then put them into a dictionary with each entry being a linked-list of handler for pairs of that types with a boolean indication whether the handler wanted the order of arguments reversed

2367921

checkbox	textbox
for example adding a checkbox and a table to a control and then finding the checkbox checked whether it has been ticked and if it has been ticked get the value from the textbox

2367978
arguments	undefined
it is unspecified which of the arguments to + is evaluated first - but that doesn t even matter because in c and c++ modifying the same object twice without an intervening sequences points is completely undefined behavior

2367978
expression	evaluation
by the evaluation of an expression

2367980
post-increment	pre-increment
the c standards does not guarantee that the post-increment will actually happen after the pre-increment

in other words designing the security into the web-services and using the portal only as an example of how to put it all together

2368041
double-quotes	spaces
remove spaces escape double-quotes etc... thoughts

works in firefox ie6 - 8 safari google-chrome and opera

2368100
np-complete	np-hard
my points being that the problem as stated is .so vague as to admit np-complete or np-hard problems

2368103
hide	show
you could easily use that to show or hide whatever you needed to

2368122
any	set
now you can set the function member on any given t instances and call it

2368129
margins	padding
you just have to be exact with your combined use of line-height padding borders and margins

if you re using a standards capistrano deployment put the file in the shared folder and updates your deployment task to create a symlink to it in the current release s directory

2368167
ruby-on-rails	django
i m willing to building a restful service using django i m coming form ruby-on-rails background and facing some problems that could be defined using the following questions

2368200
credentials	security
hgwebdir has no security model to speak of i would think that creating directory and files on the server would required some sort credentials

2368213
python	php
however that may differ from php to python to whichever other language you want to use

2368224
scaletransform	pan
im trying to create a simple pan and zoom .app using silverlight 4 but im having trouble updating the translatetransform and scaletransform properties after i run an animation on them

2368225
subclassing	accessor
the nswindowcontroller subclassing has an nsarraycontroller that is bound to the .post entity and a readonly managedobjectcontext accessor that points to

2368228
arrays	loops
i d like to use a foreach loops to insert a _post associativity arrays into a database using insert-into

2368244
value	field
insert-into will insert the value into field that already exist if they don t exist an error occurs

2368292
webforms	asp.net
i m using the reportviewer control with visual-studio 2008 in a asp.net 3.5 webforms application

2368299
processor	cpu
.when multi cpu and later multi core systemd began to be built more sophisticated systemd were needed to insure that lock and xchg would synchronized all of the memory subsystemd including l1 caching on all of the processor

2368299
atomicity	lockless
about this time new research into locking and lockless algorithms showed that atomicity compareandset was a more flexible primitive to have .so more modern cpus have that as an instruction

2368310
mp3	wma
general-purpose compression scheme such as wma or mp3 are likely to cause more delay and they also may not be able to operate well at very low bitrates

2368333
uiimage	calayer
the standards approach of using -renderincontext to generator a uiimage from a calayer does not work for opengl-es content

2368340
sql-server	ms-access
i m currently working on migrating an application from ms-access to ms sql-server

2368351
sql-server	ms-access
if you are planning to upgrade a microsoft access database to sql-server 2008 use the sql-server migration assistant ssma rather than the upsizing wizard built into ms-access

2368361
superclass	inherited
if not i was just going to add a named column to the central table and because all the polymorphism model inherited off a superclass just add a callback that pushes the named across to the central table whenever the item is created or updates

2368388
continuous-integration	build-server
i want to set up a continuous-integration build-server for a c# asp.net-mvc project

2368397

the languages that can be highlight in nano by just uncommenting a line in the nanorc file are assembly awk c++ css html java objective-c ocaml patch perl php pov python ruby and sh

2368398
facebook-apps	facebooker
sounds like sadly facebook-apps will have to use ruby-on-rails 2 until facebooker becomes compatible

2368440
punctuation	words
to leave case intact and treat punctuation symbols as words replace normalize_line and normalize_word

2368472
page-fault	kernel
user process enters the kernel via systemd call or a trap page-fault and requested data file contents is not yet available .so the kernel puts said user process into sleep state and switches to another runnable process

2368473
value	field
however in that case i knew the value i wanted to submit and i was able to assign the value to the field in the form alter before the form was submitted

2368473
value	field
the difference with this issue is that i don t know the value of the field until it is submitted .so i can t assign it in the form alter

2368477
compact-framework	binaryformatter
as the title mentioned i want to encode a image .obj into some kind of text data compact-framework not support binaryformatter correct me if i m wrong

2368480
formatting	printing
i would like to printing the richtextbox contents with formatting to any device context for example i would like to printing on panels or any other control which is associated to actual printing device

if you ve already created a separate appdomain can t you just create a new instances of a castle containers within the private appdomain

2368491
.net	wcf
or take a look at wcf in .net 4

2368501
binary	hex	decimal	hex
now if you cannot convert from hex to binary to decimal quickly either in your head on paper or using a calculator you are going to struggle

2368512
groovy	java
roo and play are both java based and grails is groovy based

2368521
environment	execution
an appdomain is basically an isolated execution environment for managed-code

2368555
arguments	default
a common programmer oversight is that defining a list as a default arguments or class initializer is evaluated only once

2368565
user-controls	tabcontrol
i did this because previously all of the areas of the application were not user-controls and they were just collections of controls in a tabcontrol

2368571
malloc	free
.when we call new delete and malloc free we are actually using the crt heap

2368595
file-descriptor	stdin
if a file-descriptor triggers and it isn t stdin or the connect descriptor then it is one of your clients attempting to send you data

2368613
udp	tcp
keep in mind that this also depends on whether you use tcp or udp sockets

2368640
arrays	map
as an aside almost any time i m directly indexing an arrays like in ruby rather than using a higher-order methods such as map or each i take that as a sign that i m probably missing something in the standard-libs and the algorithm will probably be less efficient than the highly optimized libs function

2368659
sweave	latex
i have written a python implementation of sweave called pweave that implements basic functionality and some options of sweave for python code embedded in rest or latex document

2368661
duplicates	contains
my suspicion is that one of those lists that the singleton is providing contains duplicates or something else unexpected

2368679
decrement	increment
supposing that i don t have access to the string object and .so cannot call string.begin and string.end and all i can do is increment or decrement the iterator and test the value

it is simple and works for both our tcp and udp implementation

2368700
any	set
is there any other properties combinations of properties that need to be set inorder to get the tooltip to show as usual over the form

2371312
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the styles it s correctly applied in all browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 3+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 3 4 but in safari 4.0 it is not

2371312
google-chrome	safari
i can make work in safari but then it break in google-chrome

2371327
derived-class	base-class
the reason for which the virtual base-classes constructor are called from the most derived-class is that it needs to be construct before any classes having them as a base-class

2371338
tablecell	cell
i haven t tried it but it might be possible to simply interrogate the accessoryview properties of the cell and find the checkmark and replace it with another image it s almost certainly an image. i think that cell styles is just a default styles tablecell with an image cell that holds the checkmark

2371368
classname	inherited
i have no idea what the standards specifies but this code for instances is correct because the outer classname instead of the inherited classname is accessible

2371368
abstract-class	base-class
where there is no mem-initializer-list because the constructor has no ctor-initializer and the entity is not a virtual base-class of an abstract-class

2371368
default-constructor	ambiguous
if the compiler s default-constructor would simply lookup classname a inside of c it would have an ambiguous lookup result with regard to what subobject to initializer because both the non-virtual a and the virtual a s class-names are found

2371368
base-class	inherited	lookup	any	classname	inherited
if the destructor would simply call this call would not be valid because of the ambiguous lookup result-of a as an inherited classname you cannot refer to any non-static member-function of the direct base-class object from the scoping c see 10.1 3 c++03

2371381
deployment	install
i have a local wordpress development install and a deployment install on the live site

2371410
one-to-many	entity
what you re describing is a one-to-many relationship between registration and another entity

2371419
any	set
without any validation groupinging any button triggers validation that are not set to causesvalidation false as all the controls are considered in the same grouping

2371421
contains	elements
then measure the speed if that s not good enough describe details how large are your arrays what data do they contains will there be a lot of equivalent elements and is stability important and get further advice

2371430
formatting	import
i have a bit of formatting cell alignment currency dates etc . for some cell but i need to merge the top 3 cell and then import an image

2371431
realpath	unlink
run your filepath through realpath then checked if the returned path is writable and if .so unlink it

the elements tasklist may contains at most one title and at most one description additionally any numbers incl

2371463
compact-framework	.net
please make sure that all the functions of the .net does not work in .net compact-framework

2371480
daemons	systemd
if you are doing longer-term delay more than say 30 seconds or the jobs are .somewhat important to perform abeit later then it al.so has a binary logging systemd .so that any daemons crash would still have a recording of the job

2371488
arrays	loops
with each iterator of loops the variables thismeter contains the next object in the arrays

2371495
callback	methods
the predispatch callback methods does not exist in an action helpers

2371502
deployment	install
a better way of going about this imo would be testing changes locally checked them in and having a deployment mechanism that checked out the latest revision of the application and install it somewhere to browse

2371505
contains	set
as i have it set up if the content cell is height 100 then the page is larger than the windows by the size of the title row yet if i switching this to auto the cell is the right size for the windows but the contains div does not fill the cell

2371508
implements	abstract
.so your class has either to implements the methods non abstract or to be declare abstract

2371509
shell	bash
like the above article demonstrates i ve run a worker inside a bash shell scripting exiting occasionally between jobs to cleanup or re-load the worker-scripting - or if a given task is given to it it can exit with a specific exit code and to shut down

2371525
debugging	trace
for debugging purposes i d like to trace the internal id of some object

2371550
setinterval	settimeout
there is an alternative to settimeout called setinterval which will call the function you pass as arguments at regular intervals

2371550
clearinterval	setinterval
calling setinterval will return a value which can be passed to clearinterval to stop the function from being called

2371552
order	add
because you can only add and remove--not insert elements or add remove a range--i don t think you can keep the existing order of any inorder sub-segments other than the inorder segment from 0

2371552
order	add
unless i ve misunderstood your question you re interested in the order of add remove operations .so you don t care about actually transforming the list since you already have the transformed list

2371561
dictionary	hashmap	dictionary	arrays	hashmap	arrays
the adobe documentation on associate arrays seems to imply that dictionary are hashmap

2371561
dictionary	arrays
you can use the dictionary class to create an associativity arrays that uses object for key rather than strings

2371561
dictionary	arrays
such arrays are sometimes called dictionary hash or maps.

hide	show
using jquery with radiobuttons to hide show table rows

2371599
export	csv
is there a way to import export order by csv in magento

2371601
contains	any
classes defined as abstract may not be initializer and any class that contains at least one abstract methods must also be abstract

2371601
defined	declare
methodss definedd as abstract simply declare the methods s signature - they cannot defined the implementation

2371607
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval is to me often more flexible because it lets the timed code adapt and possibly cancel itself

2371645
python	perl
how to append a correct eof character to this file using perl or python

2371656
any	set
you can set any backend data as an attributes in any of the request session or application scoping and use el the things in jsp to access display them

2371665
firefox	safari
edit i got firefox and safari switched around due to the mac reference

2371702
double	int
because a double has a much bigger maximum value than an int supports

2371702
double	int
asking for the ceiling on a double that has a value greater than int32.maxvalue or even int64.maxvalue would not be possible if it returned an int

2371708
hide	show
if your layout is a widget this will return a on which you can call show or hide

2371708
hide	show	qgridlayout	qwidget
if your qgridlayout is not a qwidget you can nest it within a qwidget and you can show hide that widget instead

2371709
double	int
the range of the largest int types is still much smaller than that of double

2371750
widget	button
if i monitor the ram usage of the program each time i click the button to open one of these new widget it increases the ram and .when i close the widget it doesn t seem to be freeing the ram

2371756
base-class	inherited
then .when tobject.free call destroy control will go to your versioning first and then go to the base-class s versioning .when you call inherited

2371761
display	height
indicates the height of the display object in pixels

2371761
display	height
the height is calculated based on the bounds of the content of the display object

2371761
display	height
this code iterates through all the object that are added to its display list and show their y height and getbounds height value

2371768
directory	folder
am i assuming correct in that you have a hidden folder under your virtual directory

2371768
directory	folder
you need to fake the folder as a virtual directory which gives you access to the configuration button and remove wild card mapping

2371768
directory	folder
then remove the folder as a virtual directory

2371788
any	set
it s because you don t have any product with the id -1 you have to set the default-value at null and insert null value instead of -1

2371800
subtract	add
i have a simple test for this add 1 to a counter .when call is started subtract 1 on success

2371834
directory	folder
either create the directory programatically or offline or create the folder on the base path

2371864
value	field
i do this by setting the inital value of the form field to this json string

2371864

however if there is an error in the form-for example a required field has not been entered the value of the autocomplete field is now 12 45 43 66 and not the json string which it required

2371866
base-class	inherited
a custom page handler but al.so any asp.net page can inherited from your custom base-class .so you wouldn t necessarily need to do a handler

2371867
input-field	checkbox
the syntax gets a bit awkward though .when you need to click a specific control in a collections of similar controls checkbox input-field

2371868
binary	octal
you can also use #b for binary #o for octal numbers or #36r for base 36

2371878
getter	setter
the properties directive is equivalent to declaring both a setter and a getter

2371883
punctuation	words
2 medium add the wordss to a hashtable then split the input into wordss you may have to use regular expression replacing to remove punctuation and try to find each words of input in the hashtable

2371886
hash	md5
i have then turned the user s passwd into a hash value using md5

2371888
windows	ms-dos
2 on windows where you are programs reading a file in text mode honour the ancient conventions inherited via ms-dos from cp m of regarding ctrl-z aka z aka x1a aka sub aka substitute as an eof marker .when reading from any file not just a terminal

2371888
radio-button	selected
you can search by doing ctrl-f typing x1a in the find what box and selected the extended radio-button in the search panels

2371920
textbox	button
the control s textbox and the button are present but does nothing

2371921
jquery	.post
i am trying to test jquery .post

2371928
key-value	key
assign the arguments to the variables of the same key i know in php to reference a variablesiables named from a key you can use key-value is there an equivalent in as3

2371941
selected	checkbox
.when the checkbox is selected is added to the

2371941
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
the trouble is that if the user hits the back button the checkbox are still selected page caching but the css is not re-applied

2371952
json	xml
i m not sure if it s a better alternative to spring-json but with spring 3.0 you can just annotations some methods in your controllers and it will return json or xml based on the http accept header

2371969
click	mouse
it looks like all mouse events click move etc. don t get raised .when they are on the inactive area of tabcontrol

2371969

i ve even tried subclassing tabcontrol but the derived-class events aren t raised too

2371988
windows-server	windows
b if i access the file using ssis on any 64bit platform windows 7 64bit vista 64bit windows-server 2008 i get the error a valid file named must be selected.

windows-server	windows-xp
c accessing the file using ssis from 32-bit environment windows-xp 32-bit windows-server 2003 32-bit there is no problem

2371999
debugging	trace
i turned on trace debugging and i do not see any errors in my logfile

2372022
declarative	imperative
both are declarative or set based rather than imperative meaning you ask for what you want - you don t loops through and process individual items one by one

2372023
boolean	int
c did not have native boolean types .so this was an int

2372025
buildpath	libs
other info i have tried modifying the project s buildpath source section and adding the local code jar to the buildpath libs but nothing seems to fix this

2372035
rar	zip
scan the entire classpath for jsf jar files and use some zip rar tool to determine the include manifest.mf file for the actual jsf versioning

2372041
itextsharp	itext
i am trying to programmatically create a numbers of pdf document with a watermark on each page using itextsharp a c# ports of java s itext

but that means modifying the svn repo to isolate design as an external reference then git-svn clone and add in the cloned git-repo a submodule reference

2372048
url-scheme	mailto
no you can not add an attachment to a messages with the mailto url-scheme

2372078
dictionary	arrays
arrays is different in that it will perform some tricks on int key and dictionary is different in that it doesn t convert key to strings but uses any object value as key

2372105
updating	updates
make sure your footer is a user-controls or that the versioning is stored in either a database-table or a re.source file .so that you updates once rather then going through each page updating

2372108
look-and-feel	nimbus
if your clients all use java 6u10 or newer use the nimbus look-and-feel

2372108
look-and-feel	nimbus
use a third party look-and-feel preferably one that extends the synth look-and-feel like nimbus does

2372161
push	pull
this will allow you to clone commit to push and pull project and their associated libs as a grouping

2372174
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve written multiple articles on integration vab with ado.net entity-framework

2372178
triggers	insert
but since the age of a client does not change due to a database transactional insert updates delete triggers is out of question

2372193
hide	show
qlayout parentwidget gives you the widget which owns the layout which you can then show and hide

2372203
any	set
then i need to go back to the original two input sources caching in a collections to prevent a re-read and remove any recording that exist in the ssn set derived previously

2372264
arrays	loops
since items is dom elements arrays you could loops with for

2372291
constructor	object
i know that .when a constructor fails the completed member object will be destroy

2372315
32-bit	x86
assume that you re working a x86 32-bit systemd

2372332
json	xml
it s possible that these binding libs are more work than export your tables to xml json but it s worth looking at them at least

2372334
fadeout	fadein
this way the fadeout does not start until the fadein is done

2372340
django-haystack	xapian
i m using django-haystack and a xapian backend with real time indexing haystack.indexes.realtimesearchindexing of model data and it works fine on my ubuntu-server

2372354
constructor	object
an object that is partially construct or partially destroy will have destructor execute for all of its fully construct subobjects that is for subobjects for which the constructor has completed execution and the destructor has not yet begun execution

2372392
reflection	runtime
this solution cannot tracking runtime dependencies based on reflection see my comment below

2372406
histogram	plot
to verify that this is in fact returning a gaussian distribution you can generator a series of these then plot a histogram

2372406
histogram	plot
if you plot that histogram in excel or graphing tool of choice you ll see the bell shaped normals curve

2372424
revision	updates
i would like to be able to simply updates and get all revision from the trunk and the branch of course while my committed changes only affect the branch

2372426
spaces	output
these files can be on the internet .so the limit is not the amount of spaces to store the input and output nor is it the compile-time it is the numbers of developers it required to write all that code

2372428
javascript	dom
php is used to building the html code which forms the dom tree on which javascript functions like getelementbyid operate .so it s completely impossible to use them meaningfully within php code

2372441
any	set
as i mentioned in a comment any subclassing will set those types parameters and expose nothing to the user

2372445
python	perl
.so i ve been using perl for several years now and i m starting to dabble a little in python

2372449
ruby	php
you mention you can only use java ruby or php for the parsing of this

2372456
subtract	add
the only obvious difference is that instead of subtract they basically add pre-negate the bytes and add

2372463
contains	set
implementation will almost certainly include mean a set of cgi scripting for browsing the catalog and may also contains a standard-library module for automatically fetching and installing modules if the sig decides that s a worthwhile feature.

2372485
value	field
it just .so happens i don t have any population field or gross field with a null value .so i changed these to non-nullable field in the sql table designer

2372508
contains	set
the object contains in the set must have defined

2372518
virtual-machine	parallels
ruby 1.8 has green-threads these are fast to create delete as object but do not truly execute in parallels and are not even scheduling by the operating systemd but by the virtual-machine

2372519
put	get
by separating the tabbar from the navigator in this case the view stack you can put it in a different parent and get the result you re looking for

2372562
arguments	default
as of gwt 1.5 it must have a default zero arguments constructor

2372569
revision	svn
therefore some time in the future the cmd would look in the svn log to find .when the revision of the last merge was in this case 335

2372592
protected	public
java allows 4 levels of access private protected public and default

2372624
bash	zsh
right now i m using because bash and zsh set the environment variables to the last-run program

2372629
jlayeredpane	paint
what you need to do is using canvas instead of jpanel and jlayeredpane and you can either overrides the paint methods of the canvas or use bi.getgraphics and blit the background and the characters on a loops using either of these methodss in the correct order

2372630
abstract-class	derived-class
no you would have to still have the method-signature in the abstract-class but implements it in the derived-class

2372644
double	int
where a b c d e f are double and t is int

2372662
filtering	sorting
checkout richfaces datatable datatable with table filtering and table sorting

2372662
filtering	sorting
but yes i forgot one small note if you need to go to the database and handle your filtering sorting on db level you will need to provide your own implementation of datamodel by extends the org.ajax4jsf.model.serializabledatamodel

2372678
solaris	linux
i know sun woracle mdb on solaris gnu gdb on linux

2372693
double-quotes	single-quotes
oh i forgot to say that both single-quotes and double-quotes worked the same for me cmd.exe doesn t make the distinction that bash et al makes

2372720
perl	php	perl	c++	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	ruby	python	perl
activemq is a very widely used messages broker that provides client apis for java c++ c# perl php python ruby and more

2372725
implements	abstract
if it isn t implements by any of those classes then all the classes would need to be abstract

2372733
xsd	xml
i am sending this xml to a conversion module that converts the xml from the dataset schema i am using the dataset xsd file to other schema by xslt map

2372737
exponentiation	division
which can be vectorized and parallelized but the division and exponentiation can be very expensive

2372739
ubuntu	osx	macports	homebrew
on ubuntu osx homebrew package rename macports package p5-file-rename or other systemd with perl rename prename

2372752
callgrind	valgrind
have a look at callgrind part of the valgrind toolset

2372758
libxml2	libxslt
following the first step in the guide which involved building and installing the libxml2 and libxslt package seemed to be successful.

2372763
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 comp mode google-chrome and firefox

2372780
malloc	free
in my program i m not using malloc or free

2372780
malloc	free
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2372780
malloc	free
what practices should i pursue about malloc ing and free ing memory with linked lists

2372784
required	checked
it only needs 200 squared 40 000 checked rather than 4 million to obtain the joint information for each numbers then depending on exact need for output format formatting that info may required very substantial effort again -- if you absolutely required as final result 4 million stanza-pairs section as the output then of course there s no way to avoid 4 million output operations which will be inevitably very costly

2372801
malloc	free
you should be using delete with a new and free with a malloc

2372802
selected	listbox
how do i allow the user to checked or unchecked the checkedbox but keep the item in the listbox selected

2372817
arrays	loops
this eliminates the addition of t to arrays for every iterator of loops the incrementation of t is replace by the incrementation of pstart for small sets of iterator think less than 3 in that case loops should be derolled there is no real gain

2372818
method-signature	signature
the compiler expects to find an implementation for every method-signature and distinguishes the implementation by their signature

2372820
malloc	free
there s rarely a reason to use malloc and free in a c++ program

2372822
checkbox	button
note that for some input elements checkbox radio button the handling is a little weird

2372850
myfaces	mojarra
there have always been two major jsf implementation sun mojarra the reference implementation and myfaces

2372851
contains	any
just on this points and assuming â œddaâ refers to the ukâ s disability discrimination act the act doesnâ t contains any guidelines on web accessibility in particular

2372851
any	set
.so thereâ s actually just one set of guidelines unless youâ ve got any more examples

2372853
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
you should use new and delete in preferences to malloc calloc realloc and free

2372873
malloc	free
new and delete can more or less to be considered the c++ versioning of malloc and free

2372873
malloc	free
the malloc free pair are not c++ aware and just allocate and release a block of memory with no attached constructor destructor semantics

2372874
instances	private
if you have instances methods in your mainframe for example and you need to access these methods from anywhere in your application you could make these methods private create public static-methods and make those static-methods get the mainframe instances and invoke the private methods

2372883
hash	md5
i then observed a difference in the md5 hash of the failing iso with the one that worked..

2372883
hash	md5
md5 hash 0c5c6b7e4e80b66cd299b1dba6a819db

2372888
xlsx	xls
if you re looking at excel 97-03 xls or excel 2007 xlsx files then i d recommend flexcel

2372903
qstackedwidget	qgridlayout
then for each widget in the qstackedwidget you should associate a separate qgridlayout

2372904
google-chrome	safari
it s yellow in google-chrome and blue in safari and gets in the way of any custom focus styles i try to implements

2372911
value	field
then followed the same process in the repeat sections on the field set a rules that .when the value s changedthe isdirty is set to true

2372923
filtering	sorting
you will always have memory problems .when the java code hauls copies the entire dataset of a datastore a rdbms in java s memory and then do the sorting and filtering right in java s memory using java code

2372923
where-clause	sql	filtering	sorting
the sql language offers you under each the order by clause to do the sorting the where-clause to do the filtering and the db vendor specific limit offset clauses subselects functions to return only a subset of recording based on firstrow and rowcount or lastrow

2372923
filtering	sorting
it will always required the entire dataset being available in the java memory because the filtering and sorting needs to happen with pure java code or javascript

2372935
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string as the first parameter of setinterval or settimeout

2372943
.war	jar
checkout the jaxb versioning that you have in your .war and make sure that they are not conflicting with a jaxb jar that jboss may have in its .lib directory

2372951
32-bit	64bit
to find out about dependencies required by specific modules try using dependency walker dependency walker is a free utility that scans any 32-bit or 64bit windows module exe dll ocx sys etc. and building a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules

2373008
packaging	building
what i found i need to do is to delete the cod file and run a clean on the project not just building it then run the packaging rapc cmd

2373032
webforms	asp.net
we are using mvp supervising controllers for asp.net webforms with 3.5 sp1

2373037
malloc	free
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2373037
malloc	free
trying to use both means that you will inevitably screw up and delete a malloc ed item or free a newed item giving a subtle bug

2373050
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it s supported in ie firefox 3.5 google-chrome safari and opera 10.50

2373054
duplicates	lookup
but to be nice to your users you should first lookup in your table if a duplicates entry would be insert

2373078
malloc	free
in my program i m not using malloc or free

malloc	free
there is no need to use malloc free in c++ code there are a few situations where you are using c libs that required malloced memory but they are explicit documented and few

2373078
malloc	free
should i be using malloc and free anyway

2373078
malloc	free
what practices should i pursue about malloc ing and free ing memory with linked lists

2373083
arrays	loops
count down from t to zero and increment arrays each iterator might be slightly faster - certainly on an arm processor this would save one cycle per loops

2373094
contains	any
one file contains approximately 80 individual short sound recordings which can get played back by my application at any time

2373106
double-quotes	single-quotes
if you are writing asp.net then occasionally you have to use double-quotes in eval statements and single-quotes for delimiting the value - this is mainly .so that the c# inline-code knows its using a string in the eval containers rather than a character

2373115
show	next
if you had relied on the messagebox to show detail and just have a next to the erroneous field as per my clients req s then it wont work as intended

2373124
buffering	streaming
this basically involved reading the sound data into a buffering using one thread and streaming the data from the buffering to your sound card using another thread

2373132
required	checked
that way pages that can be ruled out for some javascript functionality will only required a single checked

2373158
environment	restart
as an example eclipse is able to load new plugins and actively insert them into the running environment for immediate usage apply without restart

2373162
.when	ready
if you are under windows you can do asynchronous file operations -- what they call overlapped -- to tell the os to load a file let you know .when it s ready

2373171
double-quotes	single-quotes
author may also use numeric character references to represent double-quotes and single-quotes

2373179
mstest	nunit
as many here have pointed out nunit has frequent updates while mstest is only updates as often as the ide

2373179
binaries	install
it s easy to install one click and i just points it to whatever nunit binaries are in my svn-externals folder

2373180
selected	checkbox
for example i selected checkbox with id chb2 and want that second row is removed

2373187
javascript	dom
in javascript you can t do anything at the local disk filesystems let alone with a elements in the dom tree

2373189
contains	set
.when i use sizeof with each the size is 24 in spite of the set contains 3 4 or 5 chars

2373190
nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
you can use nsurlrequest or nsmutableurlrequest to construct the request

2373216
postgresql	mysql
i wonder if most open-source databases mysql postgresql etc. have either a hard or a practical limit on how many tables they can manage without being impeded

2373224
selected	listbox
.so far .so good - the problem now is that i can t selected items from the listbox anymore

2373260
selected	button
hit enter or click the open button without selected anything to attach to the volumes directory itself

2373307
key-value	key
you might also want to consider having more than just key and value in the key-value table

2373309
keyboard	mouse
another remark be consistent though there might be different ways get access to the same functionality all of them should work in the same way i d be very pissed of if copying with the keyboard shortcut did a different thing than copying with the right mouse button xd

2373314
selected	checkbox
.val â œâ â on an option or a checkbox is no longer ambiguous it will always selected by value now not by text value

2373357
variables	boolean
with a boolean variables

2373363
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
if your customexception extends runtimeexception it is an unchecked-exception then you will be fine

2373400
rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	jruby	mri
also of course this extension is specific to macruby and not part of the ruby specifications and not portable to mri yarv jruby xruby ironruby maglev rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly blueruby smallruby or any other ruby implementation

2373412
contains	elements
would it be possible to references the elements of blah3 contains blah and blah2 using pointers

2373438
attributes	properties
i need to be able to defined object and their properties attributes

2373439
arrays	loops
if both your arrays have the same numbers of elements just do one loops and do all your operations on both arrays at the same time

2373452
contains	lookup
why not have lookup table that contains the code and description

2373459
any	set
my new properties accepts any value until the itemssource is set after which it stays synchronized with selectedvalue or selecteditem

2373478
textbox	button
.when i enter the data in the textbox and press enter instead of click the login button it click one of the imagebutton

2373478
click	mouse
.when i click the login button with the mouse it works fine

2373487
contains	elements	background-image	background-color
as noted by easwee the opacity is inherited by contains elements which is why you can t overrides it and is why i prefer to use the background-color background-image approach

2373489
restart	reload
reload in the case of mod_wsgi is easy since only the wsgi server needs to be restart not the whole webserver not that restart the webserver is all that hard mind you...

2373508
erlang	python
afaik you can t do hot code reload in python without potentially losing packetss for that you would need something specifically designed for hot code reload such as erlang or else just have a dumb socket receiver which receives and queue packetss and a smarter backend process which does code reload and packets handling

2373511
textbox	button
for kicks try adding a button next to the textbox and reflow the repeater .when the button is click instead

2373514
contains	elements
.when an elements is floated its parent no longer contains it because the float is removed from the flow

2373523
any	set
reading running ant via java i think you can write a simple wrapper that will properly set a classpath and add any 3rd party libs to the resulting classpath

2373528
selected	checkbox
also .when i am selected checkbox1 from properties dropdown menu no checkbox in designer gets highlighted..

2373540
python	java	python	c++
i have a java front-end and a c++ back-end which i am thinking about rewrite it in python in some near future

2373540
json	xml
are there any libs to deal with cross platform rpc json xml etc.

2373557
selected	checkbox
.when you selected the checkbox from the dropdown look at its properties- is visible set to false

2373566
triggers	insert
the only time you should bother using the clearfix methods that insert invisible content to clear is if you need an elements to be visible .when it overflows the elements you re applying it to otherwise triggers haslayout + overflow is golden

2373571
unmanaged	c++-cli
i have also found a crude c++-cli mtp wrapper- it has next to no functionality but is a good demonstration of mixed managed unmanaged code

2373579
folder	dir
folder the view named working dir c project dir

2373580
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the gallery display in ie8 and firefox but not in google-chrome opera or safari

2373580
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in google-chrome there are 2 divs that don t get assign the same classes as they do in firefox and the ul that contains the images is-empty

2373591
python	java
as for the frontends in java python you could make use of apache xml-rpc don t know anything about it or python xml-rpc very easy to use

2373603
url-encoding	url
note markdown seems to break on the spaces in the above url and url-encoding the spaces results in a 404

2373606
put	get
the thing is i want to get all the project-related data from user1 and put it in a treeview but on the server all the files are in the same folder with randomly generator named

2373635
required	checked
later .when i checked the updates cmd was passing all the parameters required by the updates stored procedure and extra ones corrsponding to the re-named field

2373635
gridview	radgrid
i am using a radgrid rather than the standards gridview but it seems to work there as well

2373659
filtering	sorting
another approach is to filtering the lists by sorting and doing a foldr operation combining adjacent elements if they match

2373671
textbox	button
provide textbox and a search button

2373671
textbox	button
create a stroed procedure which searches the database based on the textbox entries onclientclick of the search button

2373685
attributes	properties
now .when querying against ad using ldap system.directoryservices you may choose what properties attributes you wish to get loaded by the directorysearcher class

2373685
attributes	properties
now i would like to benefit of those attributes that i put on top of my user class properties

2373685
attributes	properties
i know how to get these attributes and i know how to get my properties

2373685
attributes	properties
reflection attributes and properties selection

2373685
attributes	properties
edit this looks like what i want c# setting properties value through reflection with attributes

2373691
logout	login
with some events like login logout with it s activity date and time

2373699
directory	folder
i am trying to make a webserver in c# i need to get the requested url and then list the files and folder requested.this is good to get the first directory

2373710
implements	extends
i realize i can make another comparableandclonable which extends the two but i don t have control over .some of the code .so i can t go make my future-s object implements comparableandclonable

2373715
nonblocking	epoll
you should set the socket to nonblocking and .when epoll indicates there is data to read

2373726
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the same router used by asp.net-mvc can be used in asp.net webforms if you are using .net 3.5 sp1 or 4.0 and iis 7

2373731
ref	out
.when your contains more than one then wcf will return the first one as return-value from the service call animalspeciescode in your case and all others are returned as out or ref paraemters

2373731
contains	elements
in this case the compounddata should be the return-value from your service call - contains both elements you need

2373733
formatting	import
delphi xe allows you to import and export formatting configuration in the ide instead of putting a specific file in a specific folder

2373737
myfaces	mojarra
for full information - i took out mojarra and left in myfaces

2373749
realloc	malloc
this application exe allocates memory dynamically from heap using malloc and realloc

2373749
realloc	malloc
i want to calculate the maximum size allocated size allocated on heap using malloc realloc by this application program .when i run particular test case

2373749
malloc	free
a there can be a scenario that some memory of 1kb is malloc ed then free and then a memory of 2kb is malloc ed

2373749
malloc	free
.so i have to really see whereall malloc free is happening in this code and add code for this which i want to avoid

2373749
realloc	malloc
1 .so are there any tools freeware licensed to find size of maximum or total memory allocated dynamically using malloc realloc

2373761
windows-xp	windows
on the windows platform specifically inet_pton is not compatible with earlier versioning of ms windows-xp 2003 et al. unless you roll your own

2373772
realloc	malloc
it you do have access to the source code that you wish to analyze replace all malloc realloc call with call you your own function that would perform the analysis

2373772
realloc	malloc
in this implementation you can perform the analysis and then fallback to standards malloc realloc

2373777
rabbitmq	activemq
if you want a multilanguage standards -- meaning you are not tied to using a specific broker intermediary like activemq sonicmq or webspheremq -- i strongly suggest you look at the amqp standards and related brokers rabbitmq qpid openamq

2373799
constructor	private
to prevent accidental creation on stack make all constructor private and or make the destructor private and provide friend or static functions that perform the same functionality

2373801
executable-jar	jar
because .when i run it in the netbeans mode i can look into the subdirectories to list the class named but .when run in the packaged executable-jar file mode on another machine the src dir isn t there .so if in my program i try to list jar entries and find the class named that way it won t work .when run in netbeans because it isn t jared yet

2373804
for-loop	arrays
then create a for-loop much like you ve done to add as many enemies as you want to the arrays and give them some positional info and also to add them to the stage

2373808
constructor	private	constructor	object	abstract-factory	factory-method
you can prevent an object being declare with automatic duration on stack by making its constructor private and providing a factory abstract-factory or factory-method to control creation of new object

2373813
notepad++	textpad
you could try using a text-editor such as textpad or notepad++ to try and edit the .rpt file

2373826
authentication	login
what i want is to be able to force a user to login to view this page but then successfully redirect them back to it after successful authentication

2373830
python	java
besides that there are a ton of languages you might choose python and java are popular

2373845
any	set
and then maybe have a query set up where you could find any users that had a sum offense level over the last t days that were greater than or equals to the value of the bannable offense level

2373859
getter	setter
let s say i have a simple class vector2 as given below note that i am aware that x and y should be private with getter and setter these have just been omitted for brevity

2373866
markup	xhtml
a which required no data using the xhtml closing slash to reduce markup

2373872
google-chrome	safari
the following problem happens on both safari and google-chrome .so probably a webkit issue

2373872
google-chrome	safari
on safari and google-chrome .when c is rendering the form on page c has the types submit button named submit but value show up as a

2373872
hidden	reset
.so far the only fix i can come up with is use javascript to reset the types hidden and types submit variables value after page c loads to make sure the value are correct

2373880
backslash	regex
note that in the replacement a quadruple backslash is now interpreter as two backslashes rather than one since the regex engine is not parsing it

2373887
highlight	selected
otherwise here s an alternative that uses display that keeps each selected item in the hierarchy highlight which seemed to be what your question was asking for

2373891
python	c++
the main exception-handling to that would be google which still primarily use c++ and python

2373901
unmanaged	c++-cli
in a plain vanilla winforms .app c++-cli set to clr i have the following template-function flagged as unmanaged

2373911
constructor	object
i ve already populate a database with 500 object using the second constructor and all the data in the db looks correct with the ome eclipse add-on

2373923
any	set
it can talk to any sql database with a standardized instruction set called db api 2.0

2373923
postgresql	mysql
this means taht if at any points you want to change from mysql to postgresql you simple change

2373923
python	php
python also contains many libs that might come in handy and if optimized correctly will be faster than php

2373923
python	php
after programming in both php and python i can honestly say that there is no situation where i would prefer to use php over python

2373925
malloc	free
if there is a reason to use a separate storage and result you will probably get better milage using and delete instead of malloc 4 and free

2373939
subtract	add
what would be the correct and efficient sql syntax to add all payment dues and subtract it from all payment made for a specific user

2373948
onitemselectedlistener	spinner
i m creating a spinner and i ve added an onitemselectedlistener to it

2373950

listitem	selected
set the value of your listitem to the url you want to redirect to .when the item is selected

2374010
dictionary	arrays
you can create a string arrays or a dictionary that maps each enum member to a string for user integration

2374012
ostream	std
the std ostream class required a std streambuf object for its output

2374012
stringstream	fstream
this is used by the fstream and stringstream classes which use the features of ostream by providing a custom implementation of the streambuf class

2374012
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling checked for java exception-handling throw

2374022
revision	svn
see my response to the similar question mark svn export with revision

2374032
put	get
the perfect solution would be able to run stand-alone no big dependencies and required just to put in the api-key login data to get started

2374051
inlining	inline
the inline keyword hardly plays a role in whether or not the compiler does any inlining

2374063
any	set	inlining	inline
if your compiler does any inlining at all it will be able to inline get and set methods defined and used within a given class

2374070
constructor	object
a functor is a scary sounding named for the object you pass into the module constructor

2374076
numeric	zero
it is also possible you may have serial numbers that are not totally numeric or which start with leading zero

2374087
value	field
i want to be able to re-use this itemrenderer for multiple-columns how do i access the datagridcolumn .so i know which field to assign to the text value

2374112
treeview	listview	display	height
for the question of how you woud visually display the associated with each nodes the usual way would be to combine the treeview with a listview and synchronized their location and item height then display the on the same row as the corresponding treenodes

2374112
treeview	listview
there s an excellent example of a combinations treeview listview on codeproject that has been maintained updatess and extended for years phillip piper s a much easier to use listview first published 2006 last updates october 2009 its functionality is .so rich that if compares favorably imho with commercial components

2374126
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
does r6rs or chez scheme v7.9.4 have a libs function to checked if a list contains duplicates elements

2374126
duplicates	elements
alternatively do either have any built-in functionality for sets which dis-allow duplicates elements

2374137
windows-xp	dos
since windows-xp vista 7 came out the good ole set of dos batch-file cmd has been greatly upgrade although not many uses them or even rtfm for

2374138
arguments	default
no default arguments is not a part of signature and is not a part of the function types

2374138
arguments	default
but default arguments types has no effect of parameter types i.e default arguments types has no effect on signature

2374138
arguments	default
if during the compilation compiler notices that some arguments is missing it will use the default arguments as specified by you

2374138
arguments	default
the evaluation of the default arguments is done in the context of the caller

2374138
arguments	default
if you specify a temporary object as a default arguments a separate temporary will be created every time you call the function using the default arguments and destroy immediately after the calling expression ends

2374138
arguments	default
if you specify an existing object with static storage duration as a default arguments then it will be stored wherever you defined it

2374138
default-arguments	arguments
if you declare default-arguments but never actually use them if you specify the arguments explicit every time then the compiled program will have no trace of these arguments whatsoever which is why i called them compile-time syntactic-sugar

2374138
arguments	default
to include what johannes says in the comment below even though the default arguments .when used is evaluated in the context of the caller at the moment of the call it is not done by textual substitution as in might appear from my examples above

2374138
arguments	default
most notably the name-lookup for the named used in default-argumentss is done at the points .when the default arguments is specified in the function-declaration not at the points of the evaluation in the caller

2374153
xcopy	cmd
furthermore by changing the useshellexecute from false to true on the xcopy cmd i can make this succeed in both use cases however the cmd fails to run in a third use case

2374164
hide	show
it display things normally on the screens of course but .when you go to print-preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. .so in other words it hide that first column and it al.so hide the second column

2374195
subtract	add
the advantage is that you can selected the field simply by changing the numbers enclosed in curly-braces without having to add or subtract literals copies of the pattern manually

2374200
click	mouse
as i try to mouse over the sub-menu the submenu disappears before i can click

2374200
click	mouse
by click and holding the mouse button i can usually get the sub-menu to stick around

2374215
combinations	permutation
have a look here for string permutation permutation using a combinations generator python

2374235
asp.net-mvc	webforms
based from your given knowledge and experience use either asp.net-mvc or webforms or combine them if you want then start it from scratch

2374255
instances	self
for instances in ruby you can modify any object at runtime since classes are also object you can modify the class it self and add methods at runtime delete methods or add and delete attributes at runtime

2374264
treeview	treelist
what you re actually looking for is a tree-grid hybrid control aka multi-column treeview or treelist

2374269
constructor	object
in the last constructor call constructor person but if it does is it mean that two person object are created .when i call

2374272

2374275
web-config	app-config
modify your app-config or web-config to insert this at the correct location

2374284
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
opera google-chrome safari firefox .

2374305
constructor	object
the this in your last constructor is just telling that constructor to call the default-constructor as part of the process of constructing the object

2374314
webforms	asp.net
asp.net uses buildprovider and codedom to generator code for webforms user-controls

2374318
constructor	object
think about your object before creating your constructor

2374321
bufferedimage	graphics2d
i m trying to create a fast image generator that does lots of 2d transformation and shape rendering .so i m trying to use a bufferedimage and then acquire the graphics2d object to perform all my drawing

2374341
linked-list	nodes
should my copy-constructor access the data on each nodes of the original linked-list directly

2374345
instances	private
this gives instances of person public methods to access the person s named and height but the accessor for the person s weight are private

2374353
listbox	textbox
that way the listbox can use focus as is normals but as soon as a key is pressed focus jumps right to the textbox

2374371
pointers	stack
the amd-64 calling-convention is similar to the old fast-call conventions in that some parameters are passed in registers in the 64bit case rcx rdx r8 r9 for pointers and xmm0-xmm3 for floating-point and the rest are pushed onto spill spaces on stack

2374374
compression	streaming
have the proxy wrap the input output streaming with compression

2374374
fflush	gets
compression buffering the data until it gets enough worth compression or is told to fflush

increment it .when you hit a and decrement .when you hit a

2374403
button	popup
the applet can spawn popup windows jframes .when the user click a button that s in the panels

2374403
button	popup
every time i click on a button to popup a windows my applet flicker as it repaint

2374416
ref	out
the second entry allows you to use the field as a valid parameter for ref and out parameters which would seem to be an advantage to using the field versioning

2374417
myfaces	mojarra
choose a jsf 2.0 implementation mojarra as it seems and remove all myfaces and facelets libs

2374432
getter	setter
adding logic to the getter or setter won t break existing code

2374437
any	set
i am trying to set the selected value for a multiselectlist but the page does not display any value as selected

2374437
constructor	object
i am currently trying to pass a list of selected object in via the constructor

2374437
constructor	object
what gets me is that .when i inspect multiselectlist object the selectedvalues properties contains the items that i have passed into it using the constructor but it still does not display

2374457
any	set
is there a mode of sql-server set noexec on that would cause sql-server to not perform any actual data modifications not take any locks but fill the buffering with needed data

2374464
contains	set
the model properties statesofpractice which will be the set of selected properties value .when the form is posted should also contains the default selected value .when the view is rendering

2374465
attributes	properties
i not sure this a good solution but if you use the json.net libs you can ignore some properties by adding jsonignore attributes

2374470
ubuntu	linux	virtual-machine	virtualbox
i m trying to overwrite certain pieces in kernel memory linux 2.6.31 ubuntu 9.10 in a virtual-machine using virtualbox via a kernel-module

2374470
ubuntu	debian
the problem seems related to ubuntu because the same code does not fail using debian

2374473
silverlight	wpf
i was wondering if it is possible to convert a wpf application to silverlight without days of work

2374473
silverlight	wpf
i have a wpf application that uses a 2003 access database order and my client wants a silverlight versioning as well

2374476
data-structures	linked-list
i think it is still a very valuable exercise to implements your own linked-list as it helps you to learn the details of pointers data-structures etc

2374481
youtube	vimeo
video embeded from youtube vimeo etc

2374483
getter	setter
from inside your custom class you d specify getter and setter if you wanted to access them from outside the class

2374486
execute	declare
in a while 1 infinite-loop will allocate stack spaces for a stack frame information about where to return to if .when the function returns and any local-variables that are declare in the same function will be allocated once on stack regardless of how many iterator loops execute

2374489
contains	any	value	field
this and any regexp-based solution assumes that the value of the first two field do not contains comma

2374497
digits	zero
matches the empty spaces between each character because this is the empty string zero digits

2374508
python	java	python	php
first there was java then came php and currently is python

2374508
carbon	cocoa
but the fact of the matter is development of general purpose desktop-application still required use of libs like carbon cocoa for mac gtk qt for linux mfc for windows

2374515
installation	building
the eclipse installation i was using for headless pde building

2374515
selected	button
maybe you could use the target-platform selected the plugins you need hit the button to selected required ones then somehow export a building that would effectively just collect all those plugins

2374536
json	xml
updates to clarify - i m looking for the simplest way to marshall a subset of javabeans properties to xml or json maybe

2374548
cassini	iis
if you re using a remote-server not cassini or iis on localhost then change the to in the snippet above

2374564
show	next
the getter call during apply request value phase is mandatory because jsf needs to know which input value were initially show .so that it can eventually do any validation and or call any valuechangelisteners in the next phase where applicable

2374575

2374865
javascript	dom
you canâ t really draw onto an html page using javascript rather manipulate dom elements â but thatâ s more commonly useful than drawing as your question recognises

2374868
json	xml
but you do have the ability to run map-reduce if your data is json or xml i think

2374868
mongodb	couchdb
unlike couchdb or mongodb where you have to futz with multiple configuration files

i suppose you could set another cookies variables that contains the expiration date and then .when you change cookiess set the expiration date to that again but a user could simply change it to expire in years

2374978
any	set
i am unable to find a real solution to this problem - and would be surprised to find out that one exists - as the copy-paste functionality is generally hidden inside the class code and not exposed through any standards set of signals slots

2374981
hash	md5
a hashing algorithm such as md5 is not a good solution for this as hash by definition to not assure uniqueness they create hash that have a finite numbers of value

2375019
getter	setter
al.so in java for example you have no way to restrict access to a member variables without changing its visibility .so you often find yourself prematurely creating getter and setter and making the variables itself private or protected

2375019
getter	setter
in python for example that problem doesn t exist because you can make getter and setter behave like variables for direct access they re called properties there

2375037

dotnetnuke	umbraco
.so far i have looked at umbraco which looks good but the help is poor and the getting started video section is-empty and dotnetnuke which again looks good but i get the impression its aimed at non developers plus to has much more than i need and want

2375291
dotnetnuke	umbraco
what i m after is a simple cms systemd that really just controls text and images i dont need all the fancy stuff thats in umbraco and dotnetnuke all the design and css i can do myself

2375291

2375395
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
if you dynamically link with the crt you can redefine malloc realloc and free like this

2375395
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
the implementation of mymalloc myrealloc and myfree can then simply use malloc realloc and free be sure not to use the #define in the source file that implements mymalloc ... or you could use the native windows functions

2375416
value	field
give it the same primary key columns as the main table plus a sequences numbers column and columns for a field named and value

2375416
value	field
this also permits you to specify default value for the custom field just store them in the prototype entries

2375533
primitive	int
my understanding is that this is because the operators can only be overridess to assign to a variables and since int is a primitive types we cannot overrides its default implementation of

2375547
children	nodes
the only way css even considers the dom text nodes is the empty pseudo-class selected elements that are empty do not have children neither text nodes

2375551
contains	set
now self.tips which is a retained nsdictionary properties on my root view controllers is set up to contains arrays of nsmanagedobject

glad to consider any resources in c++ python perl php or javascript

2375683
ip-address	proxy
http.proxyhost - the dns or ip-address of the proxy

2375683

32-bit	16-bit
there is no direct support in the logic show for loading half-words 16-bit just bytes and full 32-bit words

2375729
put	get
besides the javascript code you get is heavily optimized and with gwt 2.0 the javascript file containss javascript css and even images for example .when possible strings are put into variables for performance rea.sons - but these variables are usually grouping together and put in one place in the compiled javascript file .so even if you could .somehow get to the code that creates your form it could contains references to .some undefined variables

2375737
callback	methods
to make sure that you are always execution callback methods on the main thread and thus preventing concurrency issues

2375738

2375860
exception-handling	try-catch
i would prefer to see the rest of the code outside the try-catch .so it is clear where the exception-handling you are trying to catch is coming from and that you don t accidentally catch an exception-handling that you weren t trying to catch

2375860
variables	boolean	exception-handling	try-catch
i think the closest equivalent to the python try-catch else is to use a local boolean variables to remember whether or not an exception-handling was throw

2375868
contains	any
i could of course put all the properties into javafx code or provide another stylesheet for every existing stylesheed that would contains the same data and change stylesheet right after adding any component but i would like to find some elegant solution

2375912
required	checked
this would required some after-the-fact double checked by humans but you might find the person s named s in there

2375913
cursor	row
the minimal approach would be changing the cursor while hovering over the row

2375925
variables	boolean
i tried to have a global boolean variables called blocked initially set to false creating a conditional like

2375931
boost	stl
to fit on lots of platform they have invented their own solutions to things that are now in the stl boost

2375934
screens	tablet
however zoomtext has a bug that prevents tablet tracking from working correctly meaning finger and pen integration with the screens is incorrect

2375948
json	xml
but you ll have to building the jsonp handler or you can use your favorite libs to do it switching to json output format from the xml you choose and create the callback to parsing the result and do the stuff you need on the page

2375953
chdir	cmd
the chdir cmd is a shell built-in .so it has direct access to the working directory of the shell that execute it

2375956
python	java	python	php
they provided php and java samples but i need python our site is in django

2375968
lookup	any

2376021
chi-squared	cdf
however my d language-implementation search in this file for dagostinok could probably be trivially translation to java if you already have functions for computing skewness kurtosis and the cdf of the chi-squared distribution

2376027
any	set
for example if the size of the panels is 300 x 300 and the row and column is set to 5 x 5 is there any way we will know the coordinate and not only by looking on the column and row

2376053
perl	awk	python	perl
tools to break strings up like awk perl python does the job easily for you perl python has support for csv modules for more complex csv parsing

2376074
linux	unix
you might want to try using the merge statement which is the ansi-sql statement for an updates join this has been available in db2 for linux unix windows since v8.2

2376084
revision	utility
tortoisesvn has a nice handy merge branch- trunk utility but to do it this way round do i have to manually merge specific revision ranges

2376128
buffering	streaming
one thing that i find confusing is why you are both enabling full bufferinging within the streaming object via the call to setvbuf and doing your own bufferinging by reading a full buffering into buf

2376140
stdin	eof	stdin	pipe	fread	eof
as someone else mentioned feeding stdin over a pipe causes loops to exit because the end of stdin has an eof which causes fread to return null exiting loops

2376160
contains	elements
the above assumes your arrays elements are string s like 22 asomething rather than a specific data structure contains occurrences and some text

2376173

what i want to do is create the base-class first and then based on some rules initializer one of the subclassing but using the already created base-class

2376204
export	csv
if i export as a comma-delimited list and set the header to be a csv file it opens fine and all grid line even those outside of the exported data are showing

2376235
webforms	asp.net
in this specific case i would probably take the same approach that the asp.net webforms validation take - simply have the emailattribute validation return true if the value is null or empty

2376245
percentile	median
median is the 50th percentile

2376245
average	median

2376327
versioning	upgrade
my problem is that if in a later updates i decide to store more data or store the same data in a different way i need to be careful i don t lose or corrupt data for users that upgrade i want users to be able to use data created by an old versioning in the new versioning like their high scores from before

2376327
value	field
i could then updates the score object to include a date field and use default value for date if an old object does not include a date

2376327
versioning	upgrade
i m particularly concerned about situations from the above where one person upgrade from versioning 1.1 to 1.2 and one person upgrade from 1.0 to 1.2

2376336
reverse-dns	dns
you are probably doing either a dns lookup or a reverse-dns lookup

2376343

i need to get the column value which column and row value which row no on excel worksheet wherever i focussed

2378218
scala	java
i want to rewrite in scala the example from sun s tutorial about concurrency in java

2378222
order	join
.when you reach the greedy one again join all remaining request segments in original order and assign them to the greedy catch-all route parameter

2378247
double-quotes	single-quotes
you need to use single-quotes instead of double-quotes

2378248
double-quotes	single-quotes
but the important thing is that you should surrond literals with single-quotes and not double-quotes

2378249
revision	svn
a similar thing that we did for svn was to run svn --info in the command-line and then obtain the revision numbers

2378257
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if i understood you correctly all you should have to do is create an nsarray with one or more uinavigationcontroller instances and assign it to the uitabbarcontroller s viewcontrollers properties

2378286
union-all	union
.so use union or union-all

2378298
python	java	python	perl	erlang	scheme	erlang	python	erlang	perl
i am proficient in java javascript and have dabbled in python perl erlang scheme

2378331
contains	elements
sizeof 1 is 2 because 1 is a char arrays contains two elements 1 and 0

2378339
configuration	environment
the benefit is you can promote the same aar file through different test-environments picking up the relevant settings for each environment in the environment specific configuration file

2378346
children	tree
i want to building a tree to link up those children and parent

2378371
getter	setter
could you make the string not public and add a getter and a setter .so that you can easily have a breakpoints on the change of this field

2378373
any	set
fail the unit test if any of the properties aren t set to the expected value

2378384
value	field
.when i enter value in the form field and press button submit insert the data in the db

2378397
perl	awk
i d prefer using basic cmd instead of perl awk etc but all solutions are welcome

2378399
64bit	x86
i suppose i am focussing on x86 but i am generally interested in the move from 32 to 64bit

2378399
32-bit	x86
i have also heard that 32-bit mode on the x86 has to fflush its caching .when context switching due to possible overlapping 4g address spaces

2378414
click	mouse
you might wonder what that is if you mouse over or click it it could expand the b that text highlight the that for example

2378425
python	java	python	ruby
but the downside is probably that implementation would be not as easy as with some modern languages like python ruby java etc

2378425
python	java	python	c++	python	ruby
we have a lot of skills in c++ in the company a little in java and no skills at all in python ruby

2378425
python	ruby
how do python and ruby perform on such a small systemd

2378441
getter	setter
this will enable you to change the behavior of the getter and setter for the properties in the inheriting class

2378441
any	set
edit as for your question of using a variables in a base constructor before an inheriting class has set it one way to solve this is to defined an initialization methods in the base-class overrides it in the inheriting class and call it from the base constructor before accessing any field

2378447
hide	show
a button to toggle the ime show hide

2378447
contains	any
my manifest contains the attributes and i ve also added to the scrollview s attributes in the layout xml but this doesn t appear to make any difference

2378449
contains	elements
i have a list which contains 5 elements a b c d e

2378451
value	field
you can change the value of a protected field but by overrides it you d essentially be saying i want to replace the field not the value

2378455
frame-rate	fps
you ll find that if you tracking your frame-rate with something like mr doob s stats class as you begin to fill up the movieclip the fps will plummet

2378479
derived-class	base-class
if you access a virtual member through a pointers to the base-class you ll never access the member defined as new in the derived-class which is the difference mentioned in the second part of your question

2378484
32-bit	64bit
now we ve noticed that .when the c# applications are run on a 64bit systemd the 64bit runtime is automatically used and of course the 32-bit dll can not be accessed from the 64bit runtime

2378484
32-bit	64bit
i m thinking of creating two helpers classes in c# one that import the functions from the 32-bit dll and one that import from the 64bit dll then creating a wrapper class with one function for each import function that call either the 32-bit importer or the 64bit importer depending on the bittyness of the os

2378502
32-bit	64bit
and compile application for 32-bit and 64bit

2378502
32-bit	64bit
another way was to create an interface for the import and implements 32-bit and 64bit versioning separately

2378502
32-bit	64bit
if 32-bit initializer the 32-bit implementation else initializer the 64bit implementation

2378505
32-bit	64bit
regardless of the benefits i would suggest that you always compile your program for the systemd s default words size 32-bit or 64bit since if you compile a libs as a 32-bit binary and provide it on a 64bit systemd you will force anyone who wants to link with your libs to provide their libs and any other libs dependencies as a 32-bit binary .when the 64bit versioning is the default available

2378505
32-bit	64bit
that said the whole 64bit vs 32-bit thing won t help you with asymptotic-complexity at all .so if you are looking to optimize your code you should probably be looking at the algorithms rather than the constants factors like this

2378511
radio-button	selected	radio-button	button	selected	button
this is the form where i declare the methods in which i want to retrieve the value from the add button .when a radio-button is selected

2378524
duplicates	elements
maybe you have a duplicates id in one of the elements

2378542
interop	regasm
i have played around with com interop for a few hours today but afaik the only way to make these work is to register them with regasm - and unfortunately this isn t an option in the client environment

2378543
contains	set	value	field
set this field or properties in the methods that has the variables contains the value you want to shared

2378543
value	field
now from the child from reference the parent form instances and you should have access to your field contains the value you want

2378574
versioning	migrate
actually i think this should be updating your schema.rb file versioning based on my observations of how the migrate task is defined

2378581
value	field
and to make things really complicated i would also like an api where value added things can be added such as map reducers indexes recording with field searching

2378602
selected	cell
well .when the user selected a cell it expands or collapse subcells with row animation

2378605
configuration	installation
apache installation differe a lot as to how they organise configuration files

2378613
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to the newest versioning

2378614
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
execute in webkit -based browsers i tried in safari and google-chrome but in firefox internet-explorer and opera it works as expected

2378620
contains	any
i am dealing with some generator spans and i would like to find which one of them does not contains any text

2378629
csv	xml
concerning your conversion from xml to csv it is difficult to tell you how you can achieve that without knowing the format of your xml data

2378629
csv	xml
however the simplest thing is to parsing the xml then writing in parallels the content of your csv file

2378633
authentication	login
dwr is getting confused .when server-side authentication filtering attempt to redirect ajax request to the login page due to an expired session

2378640
interop	regasm
i think that all regasm does is write all .some stuff to the registry .so you could effectively do that from your vb code on startup if its not there and then you might be able to load the interop assembly

2378670
double	int
the types attributes can be one of string int double date or currency

2378674
deployment	install
.when i use package and deployment wizard to make an install of my vb6 application

2378677
dictionary	map
my own recommendation would be to expose your api only through the built-in map or dictionary interface provided by the language until such time as it becomes necessary to provide users with a higher level of control

2378696
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
you re probably trying to mix different architectures 32-bit and 64bit code or x86 and arm

2378750
revision	svn
it uses git-svn log --all to find the highest svn revision numbers fetched .so far and fetches everything from that points onwards

2378750
revision	svn
unless the svn revision are changed there is no reason git-svn should fetch the same revision over and over each time

2378755
contains	elements
as in the title and each elements of the arrays iv should contains a random numbers between 0 and 255

2378772
32-bit	64bit
this is most likely due to the fact that we have 16 x 64bit general purpose registers and 16 x sse registers instead of 8 x 32-bit general purpose registers and 8 x sse registers

2378776
response	timeout
lets face it if we trusted systemd to give a response in a timely manner why would be need to set a timeout value

2378779
mobile-devices	mobile-phones
i don t have money to buy mobile-phones iphone etc but i do want to make my web-applications available to mobile-devices

2378831
python	java
plenty of languages have zeroconf binding including java and .net and there s an example of using it in python here

2378831
perl	php	perl	c++	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	haskell	c++	haskell	ocaml	haskell	python	haskell	perl	ocaml	perl
this list of binding for dbus include php python perl java .net c++ haskell ocaml squeak and plenty more besides

2378837
radio-button	selected
i can t see how to add my question to the accepted answer but i tried to follow the instructions given in his example but i couldn t get the ijim interface listed in the implements interface dialog .when selected the project radio-button there were no interfaces listed even after i compiled the idl file choosing instead to navigate to the types libs did not help either

2378847
python	java
i personally would choose python for scripting for which shell is not really suited and for which java may be overkill

2378854
getter	setter
perhaps you can add a getter and setter for your tweening into your test class

2378868
linux	unix
i know people kick off buildinging on non-windows boxes by getting the building controllers a windows machine to ssh over to the mac linux unix box using plink.exe and kick off a scripting on there

2378884
display	height	display	width
if you add pixels after your height and width measurements to indicate the size in pixels the page should display better

2378899
optimistic-concurrency	nhibernate
for quite some time i was reading about the optimistic-concurrency in nhibernate

2378902
messagebox	alert
the output i get .when i tried to display it in an alert messagebox is this

2378914
show	next
next time the user login checked the permissions and and show only the allowed menus

2378938
linux	unix
similarly mac os x and linux are both implementation of the single unix specifications

2378942
filtering	sorting
a wcf service would only ever return data - not object with behavior dataview contains a lot of behavior - sorting filtering etc.

2378954
export	csv
i have a text actprintinger â printing to iphone .when i try to export this to an csv file

2378976
duplicates	sorted
more generally sort both lists then scan the sorted lists which makes finding the duplicates much more efficient

2379030
apache-fop	docbook
i m using pandoc to convert markdown to docbook doing stuff to it then rendering the docbook to xsl-fo using apache-fop

2379046
change-password	login
i use it on my site and you can use membership controls straight out of the box login forms change-password etc. or you can roll your own

2379068
attributes	properties
this break .when the properties named and attributes named are not the same such as .when the properties named is a reserved-words like class or used for something else like styles

2379101
versioning	upgrade
as for a libs you should definitely include a versioning numbers .so that applications can link against different versioninging and can continue using an older versioning even if a newer one exists until the application has been upgrade to handle the new versioning

2379102
arrays	loops
instead of using a while-loops and accessing the arrays elements by index you should use a foreach loops which will only get you elements from the arrays

2379105
versioning	upgrade
it should still be possible to create versioning 1 object with the versioning 2 api .so users of the libs can upgrade gradually

2379105
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
in this case consider using either optional-parameters .so you can extends without breaking backwards-compatibility and deprecated methods where necessary

2379109
jquery	.post
if you are using jquery try to use .post where you can add the .post parameters as key-value-pairs

2379140
any	set
is there any way to create an image out of mysql result set in php using gd graphics libs

2379151
factors	numeric
now if you convert this factors to numeric you ll get

2379198
value	field
also i prefer ifnull to coalesce .when getting only one field s value

2379212
variables	boolean
of course the easiest way is to required the user to put spaces between boolean operators and variables but are there any other way to do this

2379220
dictionary	arrays
dictionary hassets hashtable associativity arrays or similar are the thing to look for

2379234
textbox	button
i have an asp.net page with a textbox and a button

2379234
textbox	button
in the textbox i enter let s say a named laurel and click the button

2379234
selected	textbox
the textbox is related as a control parameter to a datasource and this datasource pull the content laurel from the textbox to building a query selected all order of customer laurel and send them back to the browser where they are display in a list gridview for instances

2379234
textbox	button
enter the named hardy in the textbox and click on the button the cycle above runs again and order of customer hardy are display

2379234
textbox	button
.so i have hardy in the textbox but don t click the submit button but instead i click on next page of the pager control to view the second page

2379244
controllers	routes
all the request are handled by one controllers which routes them to the appropriate webmethods functions

2379244
memcached	apc
flexibility to either store in files apc or memcached

2379253
delphi	basic
checkout the first portion of delphi basic enumerations subranges and sets

2379259
http-request	postdata
if you want to get anything back to php you need to make a new http-request and include the data in it either in the query-string get data or messages body postdata

2379268
triggers	insert
you could do this by implements an insert triggers which fetches and assign the next identifier for entity analysis

2379277
git-rebase	git-remote
.so do git-remote updates in rep_a it will probably warn it is not fast-forward updates as you seem to do git-rebase on both ends and then the histories should be identical

2379297
private-members	private
if you have any private functions place them before private-members

2379297
constructor	object
constructor first in the public section because people have to call that before they have an object on which to invoke any functions

2379297
protected	public
within the public protected private sections find some groupinging logical to any users of the libs and write a one-line comment in front of each grouping

2379309
return-value	undefined
if expected return-value is some kind of primitive i would consider undefined

2379321
positioning	slider
you know how much you have jumped using the slider .so maybe you could store the new positioning into a variables and ignore the updates from player until they get comfortably close to the new slider positioning

2379338
xsd	xml
i am trying to create an xml file to conform to someones xsd this xsd allows for xhtml content within its description tag

2379349
enumerator	any
this is however no problem as any following foreach returns the positioning back to the start of the enumerator

2379383
value	field
i know you can get several informations about the field like ismandatory or something but i need to know the maximum value instead.

2379406
postback	ajax
the primary key is essential for the purposes of ajax postback

2379415
innodb	myisam
default maximum key length is 1000 bytes for myisam and 3072 bytes for innodb with additional requirement that each column in the key should not exceed 767 bytes

2379415
innodb	myisam
if your table is innodb or myisam with a single-byte encoding then you can create the constraint alright

2379417
memcached	apc
it provides backends for use with a numbers of caching systemd among them apc and memcached

2379430
any	set
btw this is a nonblocking socket if that makes any difference since i read that if o_nonblock is set and no messages are available it would set errno to eagain or ewouldblock

2379437
build-system	cmake
it s simple to use and it also integrated very well with cmake which would be very suitable as a build-system for small applications

2379473
playlist	playing
my player should perform some action such as loading the next item from the playlist .when the current audio finishes playing

2379474
contains	set
my searchable xml contains default intent action set to android searchsuggestintentaction android.intent.action.view

2379503
children	nodes
you would need to make sure that the worst nodes is sufficiently often affected in the candidate children which might be difficult .when the temperature drops

2379524
sql-server	mysql	sql-server	ms-access	ms-access	mysql
i m a student at college programming vb.net java and c# in the 3 years i m here and have worked with ms-access mysql and sql-server as database

2379534
build-system	scons
i m working on a c++ project using llvm and i d like to replace the llvm build-system which uses autoconf and make with scons

2379555
selected	listbox
this way each cmd knows exactly which listbox it was created by and can get the selected item from there

2379558
affinity	cpu
i was thinking about using windows 2008r2 and hyper-v but hyper-v does not allow setting cpu affinity for a virtual-machine is there any way i can make sure that a virtual-machine running a cpu intensive task will use only one core of the cpu the viewmodel is configure to use a single cpu and have the rest of the cores available for other task

2379558
vmware	esx
vmware esx server is an interesting choice since it provides the settings i need including hot memory add however it seems like a closed systemd

2379558
affinity	cpu
besides these two solutions can you recommend other hypervisors which provide facilities such as setting cpu affinity cpu limits and reservations hot memory add and which allow for custom applications running on the hosts server also provide apis to program such applications - maybe citrix xensource kvm i am not familiar with these solutions

2379582
populate	row	value	field
what i want to do is cycle through each elements in the arrays and put the value from the data row of the retrieve data table resul set and populate into the field of the class structure

2379583
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
there is a fundamental difference between function-pointers and member-function-pointers

2379587
udp	tcp
udp is a stateless protocols unlike tcp which is connection oriented

2379603
required	checked
this would al.so make it clear which functionality required which versioning of your interfaces .so that you don t have to checked whether the class implements the interface is implements just one or both methods

2379611
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
i al.so tried to use nsdatecomponents instead of nsdateformatter .so i changed the code for saving date with

2379615
webforms	asp.net
yesterday afternoon visual-studio 2008 suddenly started taking a really long time to open asp.net webforms project after several months with no problems

2379644
difference	factors
the difference is that the c code has .somewhat less overhead around the calculations .so you should perhaps expect a performace difference of factors 2

2379649
vmware	esx
i don t think vmware would support modifications to the server but you can get a command-line on the esx server as essentially you re right it s linux underneath redhat mod i believe

2379661
32-bit	64bit	compatibility	platform
php interpreter are available on both 32-bit and 64bit operating systemd but on windows the only official distribution is a 32-bit implementation requiring windows 32-bit compatibility mode while using internet information service iis on a 64bit windows platform

2379661
32-bit	64bit
the problem is there is no official 64bit versioning for windows yet try the 32-bit versioning as this should solve your problem

2379688
binaries	install
i could install the needed binaries in my local maven repository i just don t know where they are available

2379698
python	c++
supporters of highly dynamic-languages like python tend to think this way while supporters of static languages like c++ c# tend to disagree

2379698
python	c++
having worked on both kinds of project in the wild i can guarantee you that most python project don t have unit tests to cover even the basic function contracts but every c++ c# project has something that has the same effect - the compiler s checked

2379717
directory	folder
my application has several folder however and each time i want a cfc to work i have to save it in the same directory as those files that need access

2379722
configuration	installation
i take it that the database configuration and details were correct during installation otherwise it won t allow the successful installation

2379727
division	modulo
i have tested some things and for me mysql the division modulo in grouping by won t work

2379752
constructor	private
builder-pattern wants you to set the constructor as private and jaxb says 1 count of illegalannotationexceptions myclass does not have a no-arg default-constructor

2379760
value	field
try adding a dummy field with the same value in every document and try

2379768
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i ve tested this in firefox google-chrome and opera on both platform â results are practically the same

2379798
ajax4jsf	seam
it can be a bug in the view handler of mojarra that it should handle empty strings as well but it can also be a bug in the view handler of either ajax4jsf facelets or seam that it should never pass an empty string through up

2379799
constructor	object
however the object that is created is a throwable and if you look at the constructor for throwable you will notice that it call fillinstacktrace

2379803
hash	md5
or use a md5 digest kind of logic to use specific user params like generator a string username-email-id and hash it and send it in the email .when the user click it again try to generator the key and match it against the user key

2379855
javascript	dom
put as much javascript as possible at the bottom of the page helps rendering time a lot on javascript heavy sites - this defers them until everything else is setup resulting in a snappier dom and better user experience at loading

2379870
selected	cell
if you click on this cell the navigationcontroller move to a uipicker where the user can selected the numbers to be display

2379889
pointers	stack
especially note that all the lifetime concerns such as don t return a stack variables by address still need to be addressed just as if a pointers was used

2379904
shell	bash
you might also make sure that you re using a bash or related shell by typing echo shell

2379906
hash	md5
use binary 16 and store the md5 hash of the content there

2379917
error-handling	try-catch
i am curious what error-handling strategies people use as i would rather not wrap every proxy call in try-catch

2379939
selected	checkbox
however .when i add a new table to the sql-server 2005 database then try to create an entity-framework model on it it lets me click the little checkbox next to the table and finish but the .edmx ...designer.cs file consists only of four methods but nothing about the table that i selected as if the i hadn t selected it

obviously i do not want to states directory itself to be re-copied each time i backup the folder .so i need to .somehow exclude it from the copy

2379982
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the installation of the new versioning should simulate the upgrade process where you can test your data migration to your new model

2379984
selected	checkbox
if you have the table created already go to the structure for it in phpmyadmin selected the two columns title description with the checkbox on the left

2379992
web-testing	selenium
i am using selenium to do some web-testing

2379999

i want to offer the user a view to fill in a bunch of properties value and .when the view is posted i d like to have propertiesvalue object initializer based on the list of attributes that is passed in from the view

2380793
attributes	properties
thus the assignment of the value attributes will not work .when the associations with the properties attributes has not yet been made since the value_type cannot be determined

2380793
attributes	properties
i got this to work by adding the value_type of the respective properties object to the view and then having it passed in through the attributes set upon .post

2380793
attributes	properties
one other way is to make sure the properties object is attached first to the new propertiesvalue before initializing it with the other attributes but then the mechanism is leaked into the client object which not too clean either

2382095
swing	awt
awt still has it s place as the underlying technology that interface swing and the os jcomponent inherited java.awt.container after all .so its place in the low-level of user-interface

input-field	textarea
they use scripting to do everything with a textarea there is no input-field

2382410

webforms	asp.net
for more information on working with client-side scripting in an asp.net webforms application checkout client-side enhancements in asp.net

2382568
contains	elements
bottom line if you re using a with clause with many contains elements having to refer to the object itself isn t that big a deal

2382576
silverlight	wpf
you need to look richtextbox and flowdocument if it is wpf and richtextbox if silverlight 4.0

2382587
postgresql	mysql
at least mysql 5.x and postgresql 8.x jdbc drivers support it

2382604
google-chrome	firefox
here s something that kind of works quickly tested in firefox 3.5 google-chrome 3 and ie 8 that you might be able to tailor to your needs

2382609
contains	any
the beforeclass annotations identifies a methods that should be execute prior any tests cases contains in this implementation unit

2382610
instances	private
but then since your private member _exception is already initializer you don t need to re-instantiate it that is initializer an instances which doesn t make sense

2382635
firefox	safari
but in my browser tested on firefox 3.6 and safari 4.0.4 and i m using jquery 1.4.2 it seems the response body is-empty the response code is 200 and the headers otherwise look ok

2382637
entitydatasource	formview
on an aspx page is a formview bound to this entitydatasource

2382639
constructor	object
the problem i am having is that i don t have a constructor to initializer it in and i am not sure how else to just make it run one time without passing it to object or across a few different libs

2382643
children	nodes
if i load a page in an iframe run doc.queryselect to retrieve a nodes n append n to doc.body by doc.body.appendchild n and then remove all children from doc.body until it reaches n would n be guaranteed to be rendering the same way as pristine in firefox or ie

2382644
line-endings	newline
since line-endings matter i overrides whitespace .so that it ll only treat spaces and tabs as whitespace instead of treating newline as whitespace and thus ignoring them

2382662
getter	setter
looking at the classes in these libs you will notice that very rarely there are setter and getter which are there just to expose some internal variables

2382662
getter	setter
.so i think he has a points and it is this every time you press choose generator getter setter in eclipse or your ide of choice you should take a step back and wonder what you are doing

2382687
children	nodes
i may be missing something but why not copy the nodes delete the children of doc.body then append the nodes to the now empty doc.body

2382730
listbox	textbox
i need a containers for images like the listbox for textbox and since i won t know how many images are there i need some kind of a templates

2382731
put	get
you may be able to put this file in your port-80-accessible localhost folder if you have one and get the job done

2382732
synchronous	.when
.when this occurs the application is largely unusable as subsequent ajax request are queue up to process synchronous after the current request

2382765
hide	show
option one is to load each component into your parent containers grid canvas whatever with visibility collapse and then show and hide them as needed

2382765
silverlight	wpf
disclaimer this is based on my experience doing basically what you are asking in silverlight 3.0 .so there may be .some wpf quirks i am unaware of

2382777
json	xml
should xml json be looked at first before anything

2382778
value	field
i can insert anything on the form that uses a textfield to collect data but .when i try to insert the value of a radio-button the insert just leaves the corresponding db field blank

value	field
bit index 110 may be a flag indicating that the next 3 field are each 5 and 6 bit value contains the hour minute and second of the day

2382794
controllers	routes
since your question is mainly about controllers naming i would contrary to nissan fan s answer do at least this generalization to make router a bit more flexible and minimize the amount of routes you d have to defined

2382811
populate	row
it works fine in the first row but in the subsequently added rows i cannot figure out how to call the refreshpage funciton .so that i can populate the appropriate options for cbooffsettype

2382813
user-controls	ascx
it could also be something in the controls themselves particularly if they are ascx user-controls and not server controls

2382834
pointers	stack
stack uses linked nodess for storage .so first_ is a pointers to the first nodes

2382857
pointers	stack
top however is const qualified .so in top this is a pointers to a const stack even if stack instances on which top was called happens to be non- const .so you can t call checkelements which always required a non- const instances

2382871
python	c++
for a few years now i ve been using eclipse as my all-purpose file editor regardless of the language i use which mainly include c++ matlab and python with some xml throw in for fun

2382900
selected	button
now .when i first click to any one of link button triggers is runing good and show my selected whitout postback

2382915
abstract-class	subclassing
my impression is that this allows the abstract-class to provide a common implementation of a methods such as comparator without having to provide it in the subclassing

2382915
subclassing	inherited
however in this example unlike an inherited methods it would restrict subclassinging to invoking comparator on other instances of the same subclassing rather than any a subclassing

2382940
scala	java
scala is capable as a language of expressing everything java can and more

2382940
scala	java
.so why bother introducing scala into a java project

2382940
scala	java
.when i say pure scala i m taking it as read that you may wish to reference a jar file which was written in java

2382940
scala	java
but for the vast majority of cases i see no need to write java code in a scala project

2382948
default	reset
you need to reset cleartype to the default value

i haven t yet found a way to reset cleartype explicit but apparently the below explains what the default are

2382948
selected	checkbox
selected turn on cleartype checkbox

2382961
parsing	comma
you can request this information using nsurlrequest but the data comes back in comma separated value .so you will need to parsing out the quotes

2382994
javascript	dom
.so as simple as it .sounds how can i either with jquery or just javascript list all the handler or event listener that are attached to elements s document windows or present in dom

2383008

our build-server is running on linux ubuntu 9.10

2383096
put	get
their definition have to be known by all translation units that use them - .so put their definition only in the header file in that case - not in both the .cpp and the header file - that will yield to the error you get

2383101
selected	listbox
the problem is only the selected items from the listbox are submitted

2383106
cakephp	symfony	cakephp	kohana	symfony	kohana	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp
following that i d look to a framework - cakephp is simple to get up and running codeigniter and kohana are other options and symfony is quite popular

2383110
webforms	asp.net
i have developed a web application asp.net webforms

2383121
networkx	graphviz
i am not using graphviz because i am having problems with making it play nice with networkx

2383187
constructor	object
fwiw i get a path in the constructor for seeproductversions grab the xmldataprovider object from the resources and shove a new uri based on the path into source

2383205
constructor	object
what i could do is just manually pass the autowired value into the constructor of the new object

2383215
value	field
remember the field of the enum value named and code in this example are not needed for the identity checked and are only there for convenience

2383219
arrays	map
if the form input named match the column named in your database you do not have to map them to an appropriate arrays before insert to the database

2383221
postback	ajax
use ajax postback .when html elements changes re-serve the workbook with a modified open workbook macros that uses the postback data to display the proper worksheet and range

2383229
specifications	w3c
the w3c dom specifications has more info

2383245
devkit	gem
i have devkit on my machine and i am able to install other native gem

2383289
contains	elements
the other mentioned elementss are the only ones that are both allowed there and can contains the elements mentioned

2383289
contains	elements
this might mean that you need a contains elements or possibly that you ve forgotten to close a previous elements

2383290
switching	router
some hardware performs both switching and router service eg if there s 4 ports 2 of them are for one vlan and 2 of them are for the other it acts as a router between the two vlans but it also switchinges between the 2 ports on the same vlan

2383290
traffic	vlan
in the case of traffic going to a different hosts on the same vlan it will probably be unchanged all together

2383290
tunnel	vpn
you can however create a tunnel between two private networks over the internet using any one of a numbers of vpn tunnel solutions

2383300
informix	sybase
oracle sybase informix db2 or

in the field value i should be able to send to the servlet the information stored in item.title

2383311
http	ssl
i ve looked at all the http request for that page in both firebug and wireshark and non of it seems to be sent over plain http all the resources are being fetched over ssl tls

2383311
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.8 gecko 20100202 firefox 3.5.8

2383311
fiddler	charles
all three network protocols analysers wireshark fiddler charles show that all the request are over http

2383315
multiplication	exponentiation
you still get one or two modular reductions per iterator .so this will not be the fastest exponentiation algorithm ever modular reductions are substantially more expensive than multiplication

2383316
put	get
use os.environ to get the value of the environment variables and string interpolation to put it with the rest of the string

2383330
attributes	properties
however you are trying to use this properties in a source attributes which is used to points to files on the systemd where the setup package is being building

2383330
attributes	properties
windows-installer properties don t even exist while the .source attributes is being evaluated .so .source can definitely not support such use

2383350
directory	folder
maybe you can save the generator image to your resources folder and look at it that way just use finder to browse through your xcode project directory

2383356
constructor	private
but lock and unlock are not overrides and they need a private field _handle that is still null because the constructor used is the parameterless one

2383358
extends	final
final comment for your example set you can get the desired effect but it won t extends beyond three filesets

2383376
z-index	overlap
in this case i d set a background-color on the child menu and jack up z-index on hover only .so the bg will cover other child menus-- edit they ll still be visible but the text won t overlap

2383376
margins	padding
the more complicated solution means you have to make all child menus take up identical space--one way is to use negative margins and then padding to cover up that space--and let whatever child menu that s display cover up the open one again by greater z-index applied to the parent on hover

2383382
triggers	insert
i want to create a insert triggers that checked the valid data calculating on sql-server by taking the value from user before insert takes place.so i perform the calculations on stored procedure and now if data are valid then i want triggers fired.is it possible

2383414
triggers	insert
have a stored procedure that validation the data and then insert why does it have to be a triggers

2383414
triggers	insert
while technically what you ask for is possible with an instead of insert triggers that doesn t mean you should do it

2383418
lookup	any
actually now i think about it it doesn t need to query to find this out it has a global table of ccws that it has previously generator .so it can just lookup any new iunknown in there

2383420
callback	methods
i looked at what methods was responsible for triggers the callback and i realized it was one of my own with a debugger breakpoints in it

2383422
arrays	loops
i could think that he would if loops conditional is an immutable object string arrays

2383430
duplicates	contains
you ll need to either make it hold items directly which won t work in this case because the items pointed to are actually subclassing of item or give it a custom comparator if you want to guarantee that it won t contains duplicates items

2383447
fiddler	charles
i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler include should help out

2383449
text-editor	editor
i don t even know what do you understand as different between wysiwyg and rich text-editor the main difference might be that no web-based editor can be really what you get because there are lots of little problems

2383453
contains	elements
see a generator list of css selectors that correspond to all the elements that contains the highlight text

2383454
.net	wcf
not sure if this will help you - but you could use wcf and .net 3.5

2383456
innodb	myisam
this works great in myisam but i would like to change this table to innodb all other db tables are innodb to take advantages of foreign-keys and avoid table level locking

2383461
function-call	inline
on a more general basis the jit compiler should recognize this call to size as a call to a known instances .so that it may perform the methods dispatcher with a direct function-call which is faster or even inline the size methods call reducing the call to a simple instances field access

2383464
push	pull
you should be able to use normals push pull merge to get the changes back and forth

2383466
webforms	asp.net
the client application can be windows.forms desktop-application or webforms asp.net browser

2383473

2383499
mspec	moq
i don t use mspec but here s the test in moq

2383501
buffering	streaming
streaming sound shouldn t be a problem if you design something like a ring buffering in case you have lags in the network to avoid breaking the sound wave

2383522
required	checked
in my current .app we synchronized this data at startup of the .app as this is sufficient but in my previous systemd we had a background-thread running which would checked every minute or .so if each piece needs to updates eg every 24 hours for unimportant items 1 hour for important ones and asynchronously initiate the sync if required

implements	extends
basically you have to implements the listener pattern extends the arraylist class create unit tests for it based on at least what we required document the corner cases document the program itself if you want to and then send the test back to us

2383626
ostream	std
fwiw i recommend against using fwrite or std ostream write on classes structures and union

2383627
communication	messages
basic principles make data private to one thread and have the threads communication via messages queue

2383636

you will have to compute the logic of is any file in this set open separately

2383647
uitextview	uilabel
uitextview is not exactly like a uilabel wrapped in a uiscrollview

2383647

lighting	uniform	uniform	points
points that are far away from the camera past an arbitrary far cutoff fade out to some uniform color usually lighting gray

2383687
json	xml
at the risk of being laughed out of class one solution is to store the configuration in xml or for more adventurous json

2383687
json	xml
human-consumable interoperable outside of perl doesn t have to live on local pc both xml and json can be requested off of a configuration url and a bunch of standards modules xml-simple is usually good enough for configuration xml files exist on cpan

2383691
alignment	layout
that just leaves platform-specific issues - different layout on different platform etc due to alignment endianness and .so on

2383691
fwrite	fread
possibly a silly question but why not fread the data from the file straight into in instances of the struct doing essentially what you did with the fwrite but in reverse

2383721
textbox	button
if i move keyboard focus to a textbox in that user-controls then click button b do some work then click button a again i would like focus to be on the same textbox that i last used in user-controls a

2383722

2383791
arrays	map
i have made an .app that gets an arrays of addresses from a web service and i want to map them

2383802
double	int
one other thing to note with your code before you go back to us with a very similar question better remove the operators int and-operators double functions

2383802
double	int
in the original situation you had your addition was ambiguous because there were operator+ double double and operator+ int int built-in operators considered and they were equally well

2383824
value	field
the key in the dictionary is an enum field the value is an int

2383824
value	field
.when we lookup the field in the dictionary we re going to get the correct int value to feed to the database

2383826
perforce	git
out of the box git doesn t seem to work well for centralized development in a large 20+ developer organization with developers of varying abilities and levels of git sophistication - especially compared with other source-control systemd like perforce or subversion which are aimed at that kind of environment

2383826

shopping-cart	cart
i m building an e-commerce site for a client and for some reason in internet-explorer .when i click the add to cart button the shopping-cart messes up the quantities added into the cart

2383863
workitem	rtc
i would say that it could it looks like intellij offers an version-control integration points as does the jazz scm component but i am not familiar enough with intellij to say for sure looks like clearcase is already on the list .so they are adding support for vendors i would think that without a full fledged integration where your workitem are integrated into your development rtc starts to loose it s flair but may be not for your management

2383864
environment	execution
i did some work on a client-server web framework that used monads to distinguish between different execution environment

2383864
contains	any
the obvious ones were client-side and server-side but it also allowed you to write both-side code which could run on both client and server because it didn t contains any special features and also asynchronous client-side which was used for writing nonblocking code on the client essentially a continuation monad on the client-side

2383886
object-reference	instances
it throw object-reference not set to an instances of an object on the addhandler line and i have no idea why it is doing it i m a bit new with vb.net

under what conditional would one favor apps talking via a message-queue instead of via web-services i just mean xml or json or yaml or whatever over http here not any particular types

2383939
python	perl
perl 6 also runs on parrot which is a virtual-machine already capable of running another couple dozen languages including python

2383946
jquery	.post
then in your jquery .post

2383953
dictionary	arrays
this seemed to work fine but i was just told that the dictionary doesnt assure the same key order .so the resulting arrays might represent the words in different order making it useless

2383953
dictionary	arrays
my current idea to solve this problem is to copy all the key of the words dictionary into an arrayslist create an arrays of the proper size and then use the indexof methods of the arrayslist to fill the arrays

2383954
windows-xp	windows
.when we go to site certsrv and request a web browser certificate client certificate from ie7 8 on windows-xp and vista and windows 7 then issue the cert on the server certificate authority manager all combinations of the client os seem to install the client certificate properly in the personal certificate store

2383965
synchronous	.when
i think the distinction your looking for is messages queue versus request response the latter is .when the request is process synchronous

2384051
value	field
.when getversionex returns successfully on windows-xp the dwmajorversion field of the structure it produces is supposed to have the value 5

2384056
firefox	safari
a clue perhaps is that .when i open on firefox or safari on mac os x i don t see any dates

2384056
puts	gets
actually safari puts the date time that i opened the feed beside each elements. but somehow google-reader gets the unique dates for each elements

2384079
fwrite	fopen
if you do fopen fwrite to log make sure you use append a mode instead of w or duplicates page request will overwrite the log and you won t be able to tell that the query is running multiple time

2384097
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is a good one as is codeigniter and doctrine

2384099
windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows

2384199
valgrind	gprof
i ve heard of gprof and valgrind

2384199
valgrind	gprof
but seems gprof need instrumentation the program .so we have to rebuild the program and valgrind will slow down the program execution quite a lot

2384199
callgrind	valgrind
from valgrind introduction cachegrind runs programs about 20--100x slower than normals and callgrind which i need to profiling is based on cachegrind

2384205
jquery	.post	coldfusion	.post
i don t know about the coldfusion bit but you should .post this data preferably over ssl the jquery to .post would look like this

2384221
getter	setter
my work around is to bail on using properties and implements setter getter

any	bag
you can make sequences from your bag by any data traversal technique from random walk to genetic algorithms

2384269
implements	abstract
if the statistical process turns out to be too complicated for you to implements instead think of marking up your words bag with parts of speech research part-of-speech markup and provide your program with a variety of abstract sequences templates--you will still get sequences like a person will eat a hungry apple but depending on your needs that may be enough

2384280
hash	md5
the client runs all of those field through an md5 hashing methods to produce a hash key

2384281

2384313
gitolite	git-repo
small-group tracking branches if you use something that provides finer-grained acls like gitolite it s easy enough to do this but you can also create a shared branch by connecting various developers local repositories â a git-repo can have multiple remotes

2384351
icollection	ienumerable
those should be ilist ipartialperson or ienumerable t icollection t or readonlycollection t

2384356
average	median
if you have numbers that vary wildly you may find that the average isn t a quality summary statistic and should consider using median

2384378
value	field
in your case you have default-constructor which you want your reference to points to a dummy value it should be more appropriate to model it with pointsers field

2384398
click	mouse
since during the animation the coordinates of everything will be all over the place you probably don t want to be bothered with trying to translation mouse click on the moving desktop to the underlying control

2384402
environment	building

within the elements it is optional to specify the not-null unique types and sql-types attributes as nhibernate will determine them during runtime using reflection though i understand that for pedagogy purposes it is better to write those

2384416
attributes	properties
plus if you want your id properties named within your object class be the same as your table field you may just omit the column attributes

2384425
always-on-top	transparency
doing all that means there s a transparency surface always-on-top for the mouse to hover over and the other divs are brought in underneath that surface

2384430
subtract	add	subtract	time
i have had the same problem i wanted to add uiimageview s to my mainview and updates them like that i just used an nsmutablearrays of the viewcontrollers you want to display in the view then add or subtract from that as needed and every time you add or subtract from that arrays then call a methods from inside your mainview that goes through the scrollview and removes every view from the scrollview and then adds the appropriate viewcontroller to the scrollview

2384469
ssms	ssis
if you open the job for editing in ssms you can look at the job step and confirm that the dtsrun cmd references the ssis package

2384478
oracle	mysql

any easy to use utility tool profiling benchmarking that able to test what is the maximum users a web application able to support by analyzing session size cpu-speed memory size..etc and predict .when server is overpacked overloaded

2384579
defined	declare
it s quite standards to defined a class or struct perfectly equivalent except that the default is public instead of private and declare a variables of its types or pointers to such a variables etc -- it was ok in c with struct but as i already mentioned c++ s class save for public vs private is the same thing as struct and c++ mostly maintains upwards compatibility with iso-1989 c

2384586
jquery	.post
points two on this blog .post describe how to accomplish the task by using jquery but that introduces a javascript dependency

2384609

for example 32-bit intel x86 cpus have four main data registers named eax ebx ecx and edx along with a numbers of indexing and other more specialised registers

2384612
python	java
however for many possible distributions and many real-life cases where subarrayss just happen to be often sorted depending on how the overall arrays was put together timsort is often preternaturally good closer to o n than to o n log n -- i hear it s probably going to become the standards default sorting algorithm in java at some reasonably close future data it s been the standards sorting algorithm in python for years now

2384641
versioning	upgrade
can anyone verify that i need to upgrade subversioning on the client machine to match versioning on server 1.6.9

xsd	xml
i want to create an xsd which can generator the following xml

2385359
value	field
that s effectively what you re doing .when you put a value as a form field or a query-string

2385360
quirks-mode	doctype
for example - the moss pages are usually rendering in quirks-mode and adding a valid xhtml doctype should change things for the better

i can easily get the longest period available using min and max but how would i go about selected the maximum of minimum datetimes and minimum of maximum datetimes

2385454
if-statement	for-loop
you could put the for-loop inside the conditional of the if-statement .

2385454
if-statement	for-loop
but it might be more clear to put the for-loop before the if-statement

2385480
32-bit	64bit
i have a commercial product that s a dll native 32-bit code and now it s time to building a 64bit versioning of it

2385480
32-bit	64bit
.so .when installing on 64bit windows the 32-bit versioning goes into windows syswow64 and the 64bit versioning goes into.

2385480
32-bit	64bit
different named product.dll and product64.dll now client applications have to know whether they are running 32-bit or 64bit inorder to reference my dll and there are languages where that isn t known until runtime - .net being just one example

2385534
contains	set
essentially you just decorator your view function passing in the templates you want rendering and then just return a dictionary contains the extra context variables you want set context variables in addition to those that are set for you by requestcontext such as media_url

2385546
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
an unrolled linked-list is a linked-list in which each nodes contains an arrays of data value

.so that after selected the desired checkbox user click on delete button and we should delete that recording

2385623
decimal	octal
yu shouldn t prefix by 0 your numbers if you don t want to use the octal like using the normals decimal numbers

2385634
xsd	xml
my problem is that .when i try to serialization those classes to xml the attributes whose value match the default value defined in the xsd schema are not being serialization

2385636
switching	screens
you would need to do this for any relevant building configuration - such as for debugging and release - you can switching between these through the configuration combobox on that screens

2385645
any	set
.so i am trying two things either we can any way disable the returnurl or we can set default returnurl .so irrespective of the returnurl it goes always to the home page

2385650

at the minute .when we switching from our voip call and send it over gsm via the action_call intent it does everything we want except it brings up the native in call screens whereas we want our own in call screens to display here

2385702
mapping	unique
edit since you are mapping files to a unique handle you can use a or a or a

2385708
double	int
configuring with -duse64bitint -duselongdouble will make perl use 64bit int and long double

2385715
strtok	strdup
if that is the reason for seg-faullt you can create a copy of the char arrays before you pass it to strtok using the strdup function like

2385725
display	height	display	width
in my application i am display a image image-size is 90px width 90px height and below that i display title of the image in data list control horizontal display

2385728
printf	strtok
strtok writes to the string .so it s faulting but printf only reads from it .so it isn t

2385757
constructor	private
this ensures that you the class with private constructor control how the constructor is called

2385757
factory-method	singleton
an example a static factory-method on the class could return object as the factory-method choses to allocate them like a singleton factory for example

2385761

2385762
any	set
i am looking for a words that has three letters from the set mbipi any order

2385764
constructor	private	instances	private
by providing a private constructor you prevent class instances from being created in any place other than this very class

2385764
constructor	private
for reducing code-size public constructor call private constructor which in turn do all the work

2385788
authentication	login
if you are adding a log of the users that login then it would be more appropriate to put the code that adds the log with the code that authentication the user

2385791
postgresql	mysql
i have the same question as #1895500 but with postgresql not mysql

2385796
build-server	nant
we are currently using nant on our build-server with cvs as our source control systemd

2385796
version-control	cvs
subversion seems to be the most straightforward option to move on to from cvs but a distribute version-control systemd like mercurial has .so many advantages that it seems foolish to ignore them

2385820
sql-server	mysql
i have worked on the same scenario before using sql-server but now i m using mysql

2385853

the photos in the photo libs does not contains any named

2385994
put	get
inside the each loops i get all the nodes and put every named inside a variablesiables like this variables person xml.find named .find .text

2386015
getter	setter
in general classes are much less likely to have important code in their getter methods than their setter but it s still possible that accessing directly could break something in a future versioning of cocoa-touch

2386018
innodb	myisam
note on versioning 5.5 it works on myisam but not innodb

2386033
disconnect	transfer

you can extends blackberry controls with custom drawing or implements own one extendss field class

2386078
margins	padding
i have played around with the padding and margins but i cant figure out what is causing this

2386089
configuration	installation
even if i ve never used it i m thinking about using autotools for it to make the configuration and installation process easier for the customer and for me in the future

2386097
unsigned	short
in the c++ definition you use a pointers to a short unsigned int while in the c# methods you use a ushort

2386102
twisted	gevent
we ll cover parallels downloading with twisted gevent and others

2386104
keyboard	mouse
i know how pissed off i get .when developers implements custom interfaces in desktop applications and there i have an entire keyboard and mouse to help me navigate

2386122
click	mouse
a general solution depending on your gui framework add a mouse event handler that will catch click and mouse movements

2386126
device-orientation	portrait
if you want set the device-orientation to portrait or other mode you should overrides the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation

2386129
installation	building
if you are trying to building some kind of installation program for linux i suggest you look into rpmbuilding for redhat distros

2386130

textbox	button
please don t submit the rsvp as i don t want to spam my client but please just tell me if you see the radio button and if you can fill out the textbox

2386140
sql-server	oracle
consider an example of using multiple database servers like sql-server and oracle

2386140
sql-server	oracle
if you are developing an application using sql-server database as backend but in future need to change backend database to oracle you will need to modify all your code if you havenâ t written your code following factory design pattern

2386145
abstract-factory	factory-method
in this example i use factory-method to create abstract-factory of a certain types picasa in the example

2386214
silverlight	wpf
how to add a textblock to an ellipse in wpf silverlight

2386253
getter	setter
i think that i may have to fix my bindable richtextbox .so that it maintains two flowdocument object the one exposed to the world by its document getter and setter and the one inside the control itself

2386253
value	field
that is .when something sets the document properties on the object it saves that value in its private field and then copies the document s content into the content of the base document properties.

2386276
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
those containers will need a copy constructible elements and if you don t supply the copy-constructor it will call default copy-constructor of your class by deducing from your class-members shallow-copy

2386280
sql-server	mysql
i have an issue regarding an recursive count which works well in sql-server but i can not make this work in mysql

2386284
contains	any
specifically any class which containss pointers or references should contains them such as

2386291
attributes	properties
considering you have your nodes as a domelement or domnodes you can use the attributes properties of the domnodes class it contains a list of the attributes that the nodes has

2386291
attributes	properties
using that properties you can loops over the attributes getting the named and value of each one with their and properties

2386297
search-engine	web-crawler
.so the question is do google and other search-engine web-crawler understand that those link can t directly take you to the advertisement detail page but there is a javascript elaboration on the middle

2386344
linux	unix
the security model in windows nt-based systemd is very different from the unix one that the overwhelming majority of linux systemd use

2386344
filesystems	fat
this doesn t apply to the pathological fat filesystems if memory serves.

2386345
any	set
i don t set any cookies explicit and this is what print_r _cookie

2386348
spring	jsf
i ve created springmvc+spring web flow 2 + spring faces + jsf configuration but it s very complicated to create simple things there

2386386
page-fault	kernel
the kernel at a low-level would have an interrupt handler set up to trap that page-fault

2386386
page-fault	kernel
now since this is at the nuts and bolts level and residing in ring 0 code i would not think you can actually monitor that...you may get around that by creating a drivers to simply watch for a page-fault again dependent on the os privileges and internal data-structures occupied by the kernel and pass the information back out to user-land space.

2386395
contains	set
i have a table that contains a maximum value that needs to be get and set by multiple programs

2386437
getattr	setattr
the same restrictions applies to getattr setattr and delattr as well as .when referencing __dict__ directly

2386440
command-line	cmd
at the moment to each and every visual-studio solution i add the following pre-build event command-line cmd

2386443
spring	jsf
it s not spring-based though .so if your heart is set on spring then you need to look at other jsf implementation such as richfaces

2386458
spring	jsf
you can however use spring as di and or security framework in combinations with jsf as asp.net-mvc framework

2386470
.when	ready
.when the proposal is finally ready and you think it might be approved it can be submitted as a python enhancement proposal pep to the mailing list python-dev

2386488
ref	out
in addition to the missing ref on the inp_len declaration that maurits pointed out you need to make sure that your pointers sizes match

2386488
32-bit	64bit
if you re running on a 32-bit operating systemd you should be ok but if your code runs on 64bit too then you need to ensure that either

2386488
32-bit	64bit
you supply a 32-bit and 64bit building of the c++ dll and install the correct one for the interop to call

2386493
defined	declare
.so the ctor and assignment operators are declare private and not defined

2386497
rollback	commit
oracle will lock that row until you end your transactional commit or rollback and all other updates will wait until the lock is release

2386507
rhino-mocks	moq
i managed to do it with rhino-mocks as below but being new to both frameworks i wondered if anyone could tell me if the same can be achieved using moq

2386516
buffering	streaming
does anyone have any guidance for coding an approximation for the particle streaming coming out of a jet engine with afterburner in opengl using particle drawing using vertex buffering 4f color buffering

2386539
32-bit	64bit
in the other directions if you re afraid you re going to have a lot of holes smaller than the 8192-element arrays 64kb on 64bit or 32kb on 32-bit you can just reduce the bit-size for the bucket indexes through its constants

2386544
phpmailer	echo
the problem is .when there s an error phpmailer al.so seems to echo the error out .so if there s a problem it just send that info directly to the browser essentially breaking any error-handling i m trying to do

2386560
.when	ready
.when the document is ready you do

2386565
webforms	asp.net
i have a simple web .app built-in asp.net webforms c#

2386566
value	field
it s no secret that application logs can go well beyond the limits of naive log viewers and the desired viewer functionality say filtering the log based on a conditional or highlight particular messages types or splitting it into sublogs based on a field value or merging several logs based on a time axis or bookmarking etc. is beyond the abilities of large-file text viewers

2386571
perl	php
i know it is possible in some of the languages like perl php bash .

2386577
populate	row
i have populate the data with 10 columns 10 000 rows 50 column value per column 500 and 25 selected column value per row 250 000

2386583
constructor	object
it s really one obvious reason you want to building an object but it s not practical to do it in term of interface within the constructor

2386583
constructor	private
and a private constructor will ensure that the user is properly constrained

2386589
sql-server	mysql
you loaded the pdo_mssql extension -- which is for microsoft sql-server and not mysql

2386605
nsinteger	int
nsinteger is equivalent to int on iphone

2386613
show	next
you need the same function to set the image then prepare the next image to be show but it should look no further in the future than the next image

2386628
value	field
this is not possible because value is already a final member of enumerator - the obvious suggestion is to call your field val instead

2386632
sequences	unique
i need only unique combinations where sequences doesn t matter

2386640
python	perl
it s impossible in c unlike in more dynamic-languages like perl or python

2386644
malloc	strdup
i ve never used malloc to store more than value but i have to use strdup to order the line of an input file and i dont get a way to make it work

2386644
put	get	malloc	strdup
i though using strdup to get a pointers to each line and later put each one into a spaces according to the numbers of line reserved with malloc

2386649
singleton	facade
more generically some of the design-patterns in gof catalogue will also suit you such as singleton for run-once facade for abstracting the process logic strategy for different process logic state machine maybe for the daemons

2386681
perl	php
in my previous employment we were using ant for deployment configuration of a mix of perl php xml xslt unit test apache-config .

2386685
filtering	sorting
i mean the filtering and display is good but paging and sorting doesnt work

2386687
value	field
you should decide how to return your custom view for the last elements you can hardcode it return elements count +1 in getcount methods and return custom view in getview .when positioning elements count or you can add elements to the structure you will be taking data from arrays cursor etc. and checked if field of elements have certain value

2386690
implements	abstract
i thought about an abstract string table which is a constants in each child-model but how could this be implements as it s not possible to overrides shared members

2386727
callback	methods
any event handler is suspect as is any beginxxx methods that has a callback

2386727
any	set
.when set it will be used to initializer the culture of any managed thread instead of the default windows systemd culture

2386727
managed-code	native-code
exactly how it interacts with threads that got started by native-code and enter managed-code isn t yet clear to me

2386742
32-bit	x86
x86 architecture specifies the following 32-bit registers

2386742
16-bit	8bit
the first four of those in the above list can also be accessed as a 16-bit or two 8bit value as well

2386742
16-bit	8bit
the pointers and index registers do not allow use of 8bit parts but you can have for example the 16-bit bp

2386762
callback	methods
you can however use the callback methods and throw exception-handling from there like this

2386773
authentication	login
.when i prevent anonymous login by adding the following code to the web-config the authentication screens keeps popping up for every folder or file i want to access

2386782
command-line	cmd
may be they write about cmd that should be typed in a command-line

2386794
double	int
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real numbers

2386810
unicode	ucs
it also is the ucs value of ã in the unicode systemd

2386810
unicode	ucs
if you use string literals ã and get a string of two characters the string is in fact encode in utf-8 and you may wish to parsing the utf-8 coding to acquire unicode ucs value

2386815
put	get
i try to change the .post and get s in the asp.net-mvc application to asp.net-mvcapp controller.aspx action instead controller.aspx action but it doesn t work at all if in the explorer i put it throw the 404 to

2386844
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

2386844
keydown	keyup
e.g user presses k key the forms event handler are called keydown keyup key pressed and then the event handler on the currently active control are called

2386844
keydown	keyup
the only thing i can think of is a very tiny performance decrease as it needs to checked for event handles on the form-for each keydown keyup keypressed

2386845
mstest	nunit
in my current configuration every 60 seconds i am checked out the trunk using subversion running msbuild then either nunit or mstest

2386875
lwjgl	swt
i have a swt .app that opens a opengl windows using the lwjgl libs after a button is pressed

2386875
lwjgl	swt
it looks like the swt .app doesn t shut down cleanly and leaves it s menu entries associated with it which prevents the lwjgl windows from opening

2386875
lwjgl	swt
swt doesn t free it s own menu and lwjgl wants to add another

2386875
lwjgl	swt
a button in the swt dialog is supposed to close the dialog and open a lwjgl windows org.lwjgl.opengl.display

2386875
lwjgl	swt
the button sets a static variables in the .app to tell it what to do next after the swt windows is closed .so the lwjgl windows is not being opened from a swt callback directly

2386875
lwjgl	swt
updates 2 in this particular case i solved the problem by using the swt dialog for the windows versioning of the .app and for the mac versioning i wrote a native cocoa dialog which invokes the jvm and runs the lwjgl .app .when needed

2386882
double	int
of course .sometimes even double isn t accurate enough hence we .sometimes have long-double 1 the above example gives 9.000000000000000066 on mac but all floating-point types suffer from round-off errors .so if precision is very important money process you should use int or a fractions class

2386908
child-process	spawn
assume i have an executable called exe which spawn a child-process

2386908
chdir	umask
detach chdir setsid umask

2386908
child-process	spawn
the reason why i need this functionality is that i want to spawn a few child-process with different responsibilities using the same executable

2386908
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 9.10

2386910
yaml	ini
with them you buy yourself the ability to support ini yaml xml apache-style configuration and more

2386910
configuration	environment	environment	building
configuration jfdi building on this by trying to capture some of the magic of catalyst s configuration loader merging of instance-local configuration with app-wide configuration environment variables support and a limited macros facility __path_to foo bar __ comes in handy surprisingly often.

2386952
elementtree	lxml
you now have a difficult-to-debug module that looks like it has lxml s elementtree in it but really has elementtree instead

2386953
postgresql	mysql
i don t really know hoe mysql optimizes queries but from postgresql i do know that you should explain a query on a database approximately the same in size and data as the real database

2386954
unicode-string	utf8-decode
to get the unicode-string utf8-decode length you can use mb_strlen take care about function-overloading from that extension or you can simply count all bytes which do not have the 8th bitset

2386982
command-prompt	cmd
i have tried both running libcurl directly as a process and also running cmd and then writing cmd to the command-prompt

2386982
output	mode
however the output from libcurl itself is not being returned verbose mode is on although i sometimes get what looks like an encoding issue ãˆã å

2387020
pascal	delphi
also anybody who has experience in oberon pascal or delphi will be able to handle modula-2

2387023
filtering	grouping
this should filtering any line with versioning in it and return as content the only grouping capture vx.y.zz..

2387023
double-quotes	single-quotes
could work with single-quotes for the parameter attributes allowing for non-escaped double-quotes inside the parameter value

2387028
selected	button
i mean .when a user click this button file upload control will diaplay and selected file will be upload

2387034
triggers	insert
one of the problems we encountered is that after the sync framework has altered your initial database structure adding shadow tables and triggers nhibernate seems to get upset by throw an toomanyrowsaffectedexception .when you try to insert object into the database

2387054
selected	textbox
the example copies all text inside the richtextbox - it would be more usefull if only the selected part of the textbox was copy-paste to the clipboard

javascript	dom
you get the operation aborted messages in ie .when javascript tries to modify the dom the structure of the html page before ie s rendering engine has finished process it

2387085
distinct-values	contains
.so i suppose this might well be by design - i should make the implementation less generics and .sort on a particular id properties which contains distinct-values rather than .sort the columns dynamically based on what the user click on - as this may well have the side-effect that i ve describe

2387103
firebird	mysql
had a webserver crash yesterday and had to reinstall systemd ubuntu ..99 of the data application restores were just fine as i use mysql and have proper backup however also have 2 firebird databases which were unfortunatelly not backup using gbak and i have only the fdb files available

2387112
value	field
i m creating a form-for this bar class and i need to loops over each of the field in config_keys using the named properties as the labels but the textbox should be for the value of the config_values

2387115
selected	listbox
here s a very simple sample that show a selected string from a listbox in a main windows

2387115
dialog	pop-up
in this example i simply put the chosen list item into a textblock then upon closing the pop-up i just put the dialog result in a textblock on the main windows to show if the user pushed ok or cancel

2387136
jquery	dojo
do any of the major frameworks dojo jquery prototype mootools expose this in a simple cross-browser compatible way

2387147
hide	show
.when i hover over a link it show a black panels i want to be able to hide that panels only .when mouse is out of that black panels area

2387157
put	get
should i even need to put the required cmd in the model file or is there some other way that the gem should get loaded

2387177
value	field
i figured out that i could use the columns methods to dynamically add extra field to my query and use the zend_db_expr to correctly format the specific value for the column

2387186
selected	button
inorder to get at an addin s options page you now have to go to files|options then switching to the add-ins page and look for the add-in options button click it and then selected the relevant addin s tab

2387190
firefox	safari
i get this on safari 4 and firefox 3.6 on mac as well as ie 8 on windows 7

2387231
gitolite	gitosis	gitorious	gitolite	gitorious	gitosis
more suited for collabrative development than gitosis or gitolite but open-source is gitorious

2387248
core-location	mapkit
i m working on an iphone .app sdk 3.1.3 and i have added the core-location and mapkit framework

2387282
virtual-machine	virtualbox
alternatively it might be a lot simpler to building a reference implementation then distribute it as a virtual-machine image i ve recently started playing with virtualbox which is free but there are several others out there - bochs vmware....

2387282
perl	php
although you seem to be confusing lamp which is everything from the os up with xampp which only contains the webserver db perl and php

2387315
publishing	licensing
if i intend to publishing the code i add proper documentation and licensing terms as well as the mentioned encoding directive

2387320
heap-corruption	memory-leaks
for finding memory-leaks and heap-corruption

2387352
any	set
is there any open .source .net-based no win32 native activex com+ etc libs .so i will can easily set up a ftp-server

2387369
static-class	inherited
since you do not have to initializer a static-class you can t inherited from it

2387370
any	set
any javascript division is liable to have floating-point problems- set the accuracy you need

2387394
value	field
it is business-logic because the mapping is often accompanied by additional logic to flesh out the model defining the value of derived field

2387406
decimal	hex
12 in hex is 18 in decimal

2387406
decimal	hex
.when you put in 12 into a hex cin streaming the internal value is 18 decimal

2387407
decimal	hex
it reads 0x12 a hex value and stores it in n which you then printing in decimal

2387414
binary	hex
the hex manipulator only controls how a value is read - it is always stored using the same internal binary representation

2387421
ddms	adb
.so i need to use adb or ddms to pull the database first

2387422
google-chrome	firefox
it only loads the first drop down in google-chrome and doesnt load any in firefox

2387432
ssms	ssis
then copy the configuration file to it s designated locatoin and the ssis packa ge to it s designated location again we use files for this not directly in ssms although i think you can use ssms if it is set up for this.

2387435
value	field
first off if the files are strictly fixed format if they are very big and or if nothing else is done with any of the other field value found in the file the current approach is valid and probably very efficient

2387444
command-line	cmd
many people use a graphical client tortoisesvn ide plugins along with a command-line client useful for those cmd that would just take longer to click through than to types

2387457
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are pretty much just addition and subtraction

2387467
checkbox	textbox
public static void fillchecklist string listtype int recordnum checkbox chkrequired ienumerable textbox

2387469
arguments	default
you can also write your function with 5 arguments and provide an overloaded methods with 4 arguments that call the former and default the last parameter

2387470
keyboard	mouse
but it will also have a separate item that is under cursor movable with mouse keyboard

2387473
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
why should notepad++ have a set of tabs and google-chrome and firefox and internet-explorer yes i have been known to run all 4 along with dev studios docking view various paint programs

2387475
salesforce	force.com
note that the error doesn t happen .when you run the tests from eclipse force.com ide but it does happen .when you deploy to salesforce and then run the tests from within salesforce

2387483
font-size	height
i found out that setting a height value instead of a font-size value solves this problem

2387490
push	pull
c can push the branch to github where a can pull it again

2387498
subtraction	addition
for example addition and subtraction is now o n

2387514
waitpid	fork
just use standards systemd call fork waitpid kill .

2387522
json	xml
i would use the simple query-string approach which you could write a utility to convert the request.query-string collections into a format that works better for you xml json dictionary etc. imho

2387525
copy-constructor	deep-copy
if you need to deep-copy something even if it s stored inside a standards containers you need to write your own copy-constructor and assignment-operator

2387525
protected	public
herb sutter recommends making them either public and virtual most common case or protected and non-virtual depending on what you want to do with them

2387551
jruby	mri
jruby immediately copy-paste the api wayne meissner wrote two c extensions for mri and yarv tinyrb supports it ironruby macruby and maglev will pretty soon

2387551
rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	jruby	mri
.so if you use ffi you won t have to write a single line of c and your libs will automatically work on mri yarv jruby and rubinius and in the future al.so on ironruby macruby and maglev

2387563
noncopyable	containers
unfortunately the noncopyable restrictions makes it impossible to store resources directly as value inside stl containers

2387564
partial-trust	xbap
imagine the following environment an xbap application running in partial-trust mode default behavior

2387564
any	set
what we thought of first was asserting a set of permissions permissionset to nearly any permission before working with the external libs

2387572
32-bit	64bit
install odbc 32-bit on windows 64bit

2387572
32-bit	64bit
fine with 32-bit odbc against 64bit

2387575
ubuntu	debian
the os there is debian i use ubuntu

2387579
selected	checkbox
now i need to selected all these checkbox

2387580
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms	business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
regarding separations of concerns only are there advantages of using asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms for a multi-tier application with an user-interface layer a business-logic-layer and a data-access-layer

2387586
javafx	swing
you can building good looking apps with swing and you can building ugly apps with javafx

2387590
cakephp	symfony
cakephp symfony etc

2387590
python	java	python	c++
i would like to move into learning and pushing django partly to learn python partly to feel a bit cooler all my geeky friend use java python c++

2387614
required	checked
we have a suite of programs that checked for new versioning at startup and then downloading new versioning to run if required

2387640
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade of mysql to versioning 5.1.20 .so i don t think this is likely to happen for me

2387647
double	int
if we try to exchange their exception-handling specifications such that a f throw int and double while b f throw only int the error does not appear

2387652
configuration	environment
for the ld_library_path put this in one of the configuration environment .rb files customize for your environment but development is most likely different from production

2387659
put	get
if i put a spaces at the beginning i get all 7 courses but no highlight

2387674
principles	lsp
having a wider specifications in the derived-class break lsp liskov substitution principles

2387674
double	int
to expand on points 2 a s callers expect that only int comes out but if you use a b which because it s publicly derived from a also means it s usable as an a suddenly double can come out too and that would break a s contract that only int gets throw

2387730
silverlight	wpf
i d have a go at doing this for you but i .when i opened a new silverlight project in blend it didn t recognise richtextbox - i m guessing that i don t have a recent enough versioning of silverlight install since we only use wpf no silverlight

2387735
json	xml
as to performance it depends on the amount of process you have to do to create the query-string over creating xml or json strings

2387748
value	field
if the row read has more field than the fieldnames sequences the remaining data is added as a sequences keyed by the value of restkey

2387748
value	field
if the row read has fewer field than the fieldnames sequences the remaining key take the value of the optional restval parameter

2387762
display	width
if the problem with min-width is that the containers is a block-level elements and expands to page width try using a variant of display inline on that containers .so it doesn t stretch

2387764
eclipse-plugin	ant
hibernate 3 has a toolset called hibernate tools that provides an eclipse-plugin and an ant task that both support reverse-engineering

2387764
annotations	mapping
reverse-engineering the most powerful feature of hibernate tools is a database reverse-engineering tool that can generator domain model classes and hibernate mapping files annotations ejb3 entity beans html documentation or even an entire jboss-seam application in seconds

2387765
backwards-compatibility	legacy
node.js implements all i o libs itself all event-based without backwards-compatibility or legacy requirements

2387765
perl	ruby
otherwise every language or platform has .some event-based or asynchronous i o libs ruby has eventmachine and rev .net has rx the jvm has nio unix systemd have kqueue epoll c has libev and libeio on top of which node.js and rev are built perl has anyevent built on top of libev by the same author and .so on

2387768
streamreader	streamwriter
i am trying with streamreader and streamwriter but with no luck .so far

2387837
cursor	row
by a cursor that remembers ip and count then for each row retrieve all ids for that grouping

2387837
cursor	row
then in the main cursor loops you d output each row as

2387840
pointers	stack
it only stores pointers on stack

2387843
version-control	git
have developers checked into a central version-control systemd like subversion or git

2387869
environment	building
it will grab the code from our version-control systemd we use svn and will building on that .so it is not dependent on developers local environment

2387877
traversal	parent
since css can t traversal backup the tree like xpath can i m doing a bit of munging and checked for the character in the string splitting on that and calling parent manually

2387889
zend-framework	codeigniter
i ve done this with the zend-framework before but this project is using codeigniter .so i need either a standalone .lib or a codeigniter plugins

2387916
histogram	plot
basically i need to take in an arrays of decimal numbers and generator a histogram plot out of those

2387921
compact-framework	.net
i have a c# .net compact-framework 3.5 mobile project in visual-studio 2008

2387931
linux	unix
if you re using a linux unix platform you probably already have gnuplot install

2387933
javascript	dom
you can t see result-of this function at the source code because it appplys dynamicly by javascript to the each dom tag written in arrays

2387933
internet-explorer	firefox
but you can see the changes using some debugger software building in internet-explorer 8 for example or firebug under mozilla firefox

2387945
configuration	installation
if you re looking for a simple line-graph they provide a very simple api that you can call that required no installation or configuration

2387977
debugging	exit
the rea.son i don t return inside of the conditional is .so that there is 1 exit points of the function it helps with debugging

2387988
environment	building
the pro in running server os for development is you have an environment that is almost similar to your deployment environment if you re building software that will run on a server that is

2387988
windows-server	windows
finally there s colors is a bit off on windows-server i have one monitor that it is hooked up to a windows-server 2008 r2 and a windows 7 machine on windows-server 2008 r2 color are bit lighter i do a lot of graphic design .so this was very annoying

2388008
streamreader	writer
the input and output will be a binary datatype .so i ll need to convert it from the default streamreader writer

2388011
double	int
sadly .net generics doesn t support a numerical types contraint .so you will have to implements a different versioning of the following function for decimal int double etc

2388025
authentication	login
if you need the passwort to login in to an external web .app and can t simply store a hash of the passwd there is a special mechanism used for example for the google authentication

2388031
sql-server	mysql
although i am using mysql for years this will be my first project using sql-server

2388032
tostring	equals
i use the above approach sometimes too but it s easier to just overrides equals on the object for which you want to compare semantic equality audit and provide an appropriate tostring overrides that makes it clear what changed

2388046
soap-client	suds
i m a real soap and suds newbie but i heard that suds is the best soap libs to use from here what soap-client libs exist for python and where is the documentation for them

2388047
flac	wma
from the id3v1 v2 ogg flac wma

2388047
delphi	c++	delphi	basic
c++ delphi and visual basic apis

2388057
executable	upx
if you are really serious about doing this you could checked what executable packers like upx do

2388062
haskell	ocaml
note that - like in ocaml or haskell - whitespace can also be used quite comprehensively

2388072
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would say to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events to prevent the extra parameters but for some reason jsbin doesn t think it is a function

2388074
rollback	commit
i have two pl sql stored procedure each handling its own transactional begin commit and rollback in case of error

2388077
buildpath	libs
assuming you did not drop this code into your source tree checked the jars in your libs directory and in the case of eclipse anything you added to your buildpath

2388103
toupper	tolower
i per.sonally haven t evaluated each for performance but tolower and toupper aren t supported in linq-to-sql .so it seems like compare is a good candidate

2388105
any	set
.so once your program is running the first thing it should do is set path and any other required variables ld_library_path to the value that are required for the scripting to run

2388125
cursor	row
all this is relatively simple and we have already created a scripting that solves this by iterator over a cursor and calling a stored procedure for cloning the row in table b

2388131
value	field
.when a child thread finishes put the value it calculated in some field say result and make a methods called getresult

2388139
any	set
for a scripting that might be run in crontab any environment that you depend on should be set explicit

2388147
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 and apparently the latest safari maybe webkit nightly support this through html5

2388151
rollback	commit
imo the calling application should be the one handling the transactional logic don t issue commit or rollback in your pl sql procedure

2388156
decrement	increment
you decrement loopscount in the inner loops and increment it in the outer loopsback and forth back and forth

2388160
value	field
if you are moving from a many-to-one many a to one b relationship into a one to one one a to one b then it seems to me that the simplest route would be to create the field in a to support this then do a simple updates on a to copy the value from b into it

2388170
expression	evaluation
evaluation that expression almost always involves using the eax register it still has to be reload with the return-value

2388174
user-defined-functions	udf
where sc.name like + searchobject + and so.xtype in u p f -- u table p stored procedure f user-defined-functions udf

2388175
average	minimum
the the minimum maximum and average

2388186
response	timeout
the site is having problems and is actively dropping connections refused is different from timeout where no response was received at all

2388192
arrays	loops
after you delete the arrays you go round and start trying to open files again - if any of the open call fail you ll be struck in loops forever

2388209
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if you use a case-sensitive collation you could use something like sqlmethods.like field string to use a like query - which is case-insensitive - but that doesn t translation into linq-to-objects

2388216
any	set
the task is set to fail if there are any failures in conversion

2388239
submitchanges	datacontext
all of our screens have a save button that would then call submitchanges on the datacontext and persistent all of the pending changes in memory

2388241
worksheet	excel
i have a .net winforms .app that automates excel and checked for a worksheet passwd

2388245
digits	zero
this works good but only .when trailing digits are not zero i need zero in my string even if the value is 1234.0

2388245
digits	zero
tried to convert the double to decimal but i loose the decimal digits of there are zero

2388246
cakephp	symfony
i m currently learning symfony for myself and work as a freelance advisor product developer for a site that s built with cakephp

2388248
any	set
right now i set it to true and i don t even get the button added to my gridview .so obviously i can t even get any further to code the actual events

2388254
user-input	output
also the code-golf must include full user-input and output

2388257
infix-operator	associativity
i don t like an infix-operator for this in general because it raises questions about associativity

2388263
aspect-ratio	scale
7 - format aspect-ratio useful to get square plot to not distort scale

2388272
directory	folder
your problem may be related to the fact that iis reload the web service application if the directory or files contains in the main folder changes

2388279
lighting	uniform
you are passing your lighting value via uniform

2388295
rollback	commit
if your first stored procedure always issues either a commit or a rollback then nothing the second stored procedure does can affect that transactional

2388295
savepoints	rollback
if you want the calling application to control the overall transactional but the stored-procedures to handle rollback their own changes in case of an error one way to do this is to defined a savepoints at the beginning of the stored procedure

2388295
rollback	commit	savepoints	commit	savepoints	rollback
then the exception-handling block of the stored procedure can rollback to the savepoints rather than the beginning of the transactional commit in this case should not be include in the stored-procedures

2388308
jprofiler	yourkit
i ve used jprofiler and yourkit on linux

2388321
where-clause	sql
it appears as if the context does not know about the previous value as the sql statement is using the changed entities value in the where-clause

2388323
value	field
i ve been trying something like this but i can t get the value of the tags.tag field to be insert into the like statement

2388336
put	get
in other words the payment-gateway should probably work like paypal in the respect that you put in the credit-card information once and you get back a token key which you can safely store in the site s database since this token can only be used to transfer money from the associated card to the account for which the token key was originally created

2388337
arrays	map
i see that events is an arrays and thus it s invoking its map methods

2388422
constructor	object
you can change how memory is allocated for stl containers with the combinations of allocation templates types and the allocation object passed to the constructor

2388423
python	java
what is the nicest way to read the output via system.out.println of a java .app which is called from python with

2388433
parsing	comma
thus this never-consumed eof pseudo-character is repeatedly parsing as either not a comma or not an end-of-line.

2388434
pixels	line
assuming the centreline was a line 300 pixels down from the top of the screens i used

2388444
payment	billing
an example of this would be to use the authorize.net customer information manager cim api to store customer billing information including their credit-card information and then have a crontab that periodically polls the database and .when a user meets the criterion for a payment calculate the proper amount and then use the cim api to process their credit-card

2388448
value	field
for instances if the value in the field reads 12 345 and the user taps the 6 key then the value should change to 123 456

2388457
theorem-proving	theory
i use all the topics you listed -- language theory asymptotic order analysis decidability complexity-theory theorem-proving systemd and .so on

2388457
theorem	proof
i don t personally use proof systemd much though it is helpful to think about problems as a special case of a theorem prover

2388463
response	timeout
looking at the documentation for timeout i m guessing i m not sure that this is because while apache is waiting for a response from tomcat there is no traffic flowing between apache and the browser or whatever http client - and .so apache closes down the connection to the browser

2388463
response	timeout
i found that if i left the timeout setting at its default 300 seconds then if the proxy request to tomcat took longer than 300 seconds to get a response the browser would display a 502 proxy error page

2388489
subclassing	superclass
.so should i have a superclass that contains all the tests and an abstract setup methods then have a subclassing for each data store

2388533
linux	osx
i ve been using ruby-on-rails with windows and linux still to use it with mac osx and have had exactly the same sort of response time

2388558
32-bit	64bit	realloc	malloc
note do not remove without at least prototyping malloc realloc as doing .so will not be safe on 64bit platform 64bit void will be converted to 32-bit int

2388565
gethashcode	equals
i am currently implements a specifications framework in f# and i want to hide the equals gethashcode etc

2388569
boolean	int
if you want to convert int to boolean you ll have to write code to do that as i have here

2388574
buddypress	bbpress
therefore bbpress and buddypress doesn t quite hit the mark

2388574
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter does not have an auth libs however kohana does

2388578
javascript	dom
i m deciding now whether to purchase a book on javascript dom or learn something useful like cooking with hemp oil

2388589
click	mouse
first of all the only way you re going to get 30 mouse click per second is if you have some other code simulating mouse click

2388589
selected	button
for a person 10 click a second would be pretty fast -- and at that they wouldn t have any chance to look at what they d selected -- that s just click the button as fast as possible

2388590
http	ssl
if you look at the bottom of the wsdl it is specifying the default location as which is an http url but the wsdl is ssl

2388590
http-get	get
if you do an http-get on that url you get the error messages you received

2388597
attributes	properties
using the unique attributes i need to work around the ant immutable properties behavior and work around the ant pattern that typically uses 2 targets to handle uptodate process decisions and need to work around the javascript handling of backslashes in string literals

2388599
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari but does not work in google-chrome on a mac or a pc

2388599
google-chrome	safari
why would google-chrome have a different experience over safari for this

2388607
where-clause	sql
as i m struggling to learn linq iâ ve managed to generator a sql statement with and 0 1 as part of the where-clause

2388609
worksheet	excel
what i m trying to do is combine 12 worksheet excel 2007

2388626
defined	declare
where should i declare and defined the regex

2388634
environment	execution
dynamically change the execution environment

2388640
contains	set
then look further up to the end of the set of visualstategroups you ll see a visualstate called focus delete the storyboard it contains and you are done

2388641
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
you will probably need to do the items binding in code rather than in xaml because without the hierarchicaldatatemplate the xaml has no way of understanding nested relationships

2388643
instances	destroy
it works fine .so far registering handler but .when it comes to unregistering them .something that will take place .when a game object is destroy for instances i m having a bit of trouble regarding templates and casting

2388643
implements	abstract
and on the templates class eventhandler implements the abstract methods equals like this

2388683
continuous-integration	build-process
once you ll have automated your build-process you could go one step further and run it continuously this is called continuous-integration and allows to get frequent ideally immediate feedback about changes to avoid big bang integration problems

2388687
binary	octal
for more about hexadecimal octal and binary numbers in general see scalar value constructor under perldoc perldata

2388690
actionscript	mxml
javascript actionscript html5 mxml

2388696
32-bit	64bit
additional extensions or 32-bit versus 64bit binaries pointers

2388697
checkbox	textarea
.so far i ve added textarea input and checkbox but i m not sure how to upload an image

2388711
codeigniter	cakephp
as for php frameworks zend has its own but there are also codeigniter and cakephp

2388724
hide	show
you want to look at the state of a checkbox checked or not and hide or show a second div based on the status of that value

2388780
object-reference	instances
i am probably missing something obvious but i am getting a object-reference not set to an instances of an object null error in my linq-to-xml query

javascript	dom
knowing how to manipulate the dom has always been important for interactive web apps but now inorder to program a canvas to interact with the clipboard to manipulate an application offline to store retrieve data from local-storage and to continue building ajax-style interactivity you ll need javascript even more

2388781
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
better animation pseudo-class and pseudo-element support in css lessens the amount of styling you ll need to write in javascript

2388788

i am trying to implements an updates statement using a prepare statement in a php scripting but it appears that it is not updating the recording in the database and i am not sure why and .so would appreciate if you can shared .some insights

2388792
subnet	wan	packets	subnet	wan	vpn
if you are crossing different subnet then yes you should consider the firewall as maybe in the future a user would want to access the systemd remotely a la working from home via vpn virtual private network - that would have the security aspects cut out as packets are encrypted over the wan ...keep touching base with the it personnel who look after and maintain the firewall inorder to minimize headaches later on which could be costly

2388814
children	nodes
descendants gives all elementss at any level below the current nodes whereas elements only looks at direct children of the current nodes

dictionary	map	key-value	key
why doesn t dictionary automatically add the key-value pair if the key doesn t exist like stl s map

2388854
version-control	git
ideally i d want to version-control settings files but to be able to tell git not to ever push these files to a remote-server github

my implementation uses a uitableview with custom header for the add photo and edit named equivalent and a custom footer using the uisegmentedcontrol hack for a big button for the delete equivalent

2388896
administration	account
however it had those permissions through grouping membership the local administration grouping had permissions and my account is a member of local admins

2388912
duplicates	elements
however for what you want to accomplish sorting is a good first step but you ll then have to go through the arrays after the sort and look for duplicates by memcmp ing each elements to the next

2388937
gethashcode	equals
in f# you can disallow equals gethashcode and remove them from intellisense by annotating the types with the noequality and nocomparison attributes as show below

2388945
32-bit	64bit
package both 32-bit and 64bit versioning for each of 5.6 5.8 and 5.10

2388954
deployment	install
deployment verification tells you that the application was install and configure properly and is safe to use

2388964
carbon	cocoa
you can mix c++ and objective-c code .so you could use cocoa instead of carbon

2388981
perl	php
i can t say that i have experience doing this in php but in perl and oracle it would throw an error

2388992
any	set
you can set the choices attributes to any iterable

and .when ready merge the maven specific stuff and apply the scripting

2389025
put	get
what do i need to do to get the bound methods to execute put its results into my value dictionary

2389054
any	set
well inorder for that function to even be of any use you would need to create a new class and set it to a variables such as this

2389054
compatibility	deprecated
although that form of a constructor is only supported for backward compatibility deprecated you re really supposed to use __construct now it should still run and set all your variables which can be retrieved in the following way

2389057
selected	button
2 second user-controls ucchanneltypes contains two radio button one to selected tv and other to selected radio channel types

2389058

contains	any
if any of them contains handle object you need to recurse down the field of that struct and convert any other handle object to struct to count their field

2389082
textchanged	textbox	contains	any
if you go down the route of validation use the textchanged event of the textbox to checked whether the .text contains any non-a-z characters

2389088
web-config	app-config
you can al.so rename the web-config to app-config .so that it will compile into a non-web project

2389096
put	get
or otherwise put you want to get the value of column1

2389105
subprocess	paramiko
i would recommend scrapping the subprocess approach and using the paramiko package for sftp access

2389107
textarea	textbox
just textbox textarea

2389121
contains	set
if you are process simply involves concatenation of attributes and strings you can do that in the block were you specify your attributes be specifying a second set of attributes with a default setting that contains the concatenation step

2389121
attributes	properties
however if you need to do something that you can t plug into an attributes default you will need to put it in a properties

2389137
spaces	output
however this splits the file s content by spaces not by quotes .so the output could be .something like ploink need or fix

2389144
associations	model
i am trying to figure out how to create activerecord model with associations that can yield the same results as this sql query

2389147
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
see the java sdk s use of nullpointerexception illegalargumentexception etc. which are runtimeexception because they represent a violation of contract

2389151
gethashcode	equals
you must overrides the equals object and gethashcode methods on each class

2389153
buffering	streaming
unless i m misunderstanding you this is the normals read from one streaming write to another situation where you declare a buffering of some size and just keep reading from the input and writing to the output until there s nothing left to read from the input

2389194
value	field
i m using protobuf-net r278 in c# and i just noticed that if i have a class with an int field the field isn t deserialized properly if it s value is set to 0

2389213
windows-server	windows
i am developing on windows 7 with its iis but deploying to a windows-server 2003 environment with .net 3.5 sp1 install

2389223

instead of rolling your own string-formatting code you should be using an nsnumberformatter for numbers or an nsdateformatter for dates time

2389238
cairo	gtk
if you report is mostly text i d rendering to the cairo context with pango yet part of the gtk stack

2389243
json	xml
that s not json that s a json string wrapped in xml

2389243
json	xml
yo need to make your webmethods return json instead of xml

2389267
value	field
note that your query differ with each fieldnumber value as you are not only changing the where you also change the pseudo- pivot projected field

2389285
debugging	trace
how about using a debugging or trace methods to output the console info

2389309
pure-virtual	base-class
either the base-class shouldn t be used as a base-class or else it should have at least one pure-virtual function and hence not be sliceable or passable by value

2389309
derived-class	base-class
but the answer might be yes ok this shouldn t really be how things are structured but given that they are structured that way i need to convert from the derived-class to the base-class and that by definition is a splice

2389309
implements	abstract
the rea.son it s code-smell is that we should consider a rewriting active.soldier and b changing .soldier .so that it can be accessed using functions instead of member access .so that we can abstract that set of functions as an interface that other types can implements independently .so that takepri.soners doesn t have to convert to .soldier

2389309
copy-constructor	constructor
the only difference is that 1 call a s copy-constructor that the compiler provides even though the code doesn t whereas 2 call a s int constructor

2389310
ienumerator	ienumerable
ilist implementss ienumerable but it does not implements ienumerator

2389326
codeigniter	symfony
some of them like cake symfony and zf don t know about codeigniter even offer make-like tools to create controllers model and view scripting through code-generation speeding up development time even more

2389339
sorted	lookup
neither the underlying lookup dictionary nor the underlying list in this guy is sorted nor are they exposed enough such that you d be able to replace them

2389341
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox google-chrome it goes weel and submit the form after file selection but i can t do this on ie

2389352
any	set
the concept is that you scheduling events in advance on a calendar keep tracking of the time those events occur in a list and updates the state of the systemd upon arrival at any giving event with a set of rules

2389390
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
the normals way is to throw an illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception or any other that suits your needs

2389404
contains	set
if your pdf document does not contains a standards character set it has defined it s own it s impossible to know what characters are which glyphs symbols and thus are you unable to convert to a textual representation

2389405
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
note i suggest using an argumentexception over an invalidoperationexception in this context

2389420
nvidia	ati
this would be the best way to start especially if you have an ati card and run it on a friend s nvidia card or vice versa

2389434
value	field
you re kind of abusing database-design by including a list of value in a single field

2389453
triggers	insert
that table has an insert triggers that

2389489
triggers	insert
identity gives you the last identity value insert - no matter where in which table it was insert think triggers into audit tables

2389489
triggers	insert
scoping_identity gives you the last identity insert in the scoping of your statement on the table s that your own actual statement referenced not those that might have been touch by a triggers

2389499
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
my cause for concern is that many implementation and some entire languages like perl python and ruby have a global lock object that manages access to shared-objects

2389499
updating	updates
if the pthreads implementation forces the updates of the mutex through the caching both threads could end up updating at the same time both thinking they hold the mutex

2389516
execution	exit
what i mean by that is that the block will exit after a particular timeout even if the execution is not complete

2389551
google-chrome	mobile-safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	mobile-safari	safari
the scripting functions perfectly in the several browsers tested firefox safari mobile-safari fennec ie google-chrome midori etc.

2389553
constructor	object	initializer	setter
a good design rules is to make sure that all constructor initializer object to valid states and that all properties setter and methods then enforces the valid state

2389554
security	owasp
here are a few resources you might be interested in phpsec owasp and php security

2389566
basichttpbinding	was
typically with basichttpbinding and pretty much no options you get very close to what asmx was doing in the old days

2389569
32-bit	64bit
i had been installing the generics instant client not aware our esx servers sit on amd processor not intel and that worked fine internally the centos install was 32-bit since our internal esxi servers aren t 64bit

2389600
difference	factors
.so that s your scaling factors - every points of difference on your slider is 475 99 pointss of difference on the zoom

2389627
arrays	map
might want to take a look at arrays-map which creates a map backed by an arrays and keyed by the index instead of using id

2389648
directory	folder
just selected building from the context menu right-click your project nodes and the jar file will be created inside a dist directory in project folder

2389664
value	field
go back to the designer and change the field to allow value to be null

2389700
put	get
the more data you put to the skeleton the more outdated or meaningless or mistaken data you may get there

2389702
double-quotes	single-quotes
what looks non-standard to me based on the definition is the lack of double-quotes around the key and single-quotes instead of double-quotes wrapping the string value

2389710
associations	model
you add a user_id field to your persons model and link them by associations

2389730
touch	drag
i ve been looking at various tutorials and they say that you should be able to drag the touch up inside event dot to the calendarview.xib s file s owner icons

2389743
textbox	button
trying to either updates the server with the quantity entered each time a textbox is changed possibly ontextchanged event or loops though each of the rows column by column and gather all the items that have a quantity and process those items and their quantities all at once via button onclientclick

2389757
response	timeout
however that has resulted in the same timeout error for ports 8080 which occurs .when client.execute response is called

2389760
xsd	xml
i want to use either a dtd or an xsd to describe my xml document

2389781

2389782
linux	unix
or if a wildly lateral thinker on a unix linux systemd

2389817
scriptmanager	updatepanel
no you can use it without an updatepanel but you still need a scriptmanager

2389819
mousedown	mouseup
however i don t know how to compare the elements triggers on mousedown mouseup after they ve been wrapped in jquery

2389853
swing	swt
i have only swing experience but swt will not be a problem for me

2389860
revision	updates
example i updates a file it is now at revision 659 previous versioning of this file was 600

2389860
rollback	commit
i tried making a copy of my current versioning rollback the regular versioning to 600 then tried to commit it back but it tells me there are no changes to commit

2389864
temporary	copy
i usually copy the file i want to keep to a temporary location do the rollback then copy the preserve file back in.

2389865
constructor	object
the location of the assembly is configure properly i think because i ve added logging code and i can see that the constructor of the connection object is being called

2389865
constructor	object
in fact i ve added logging code to every methods of every class in the assembly and as far as i can tell the failure occurs right after the connection object s constructor is called

2389881
ready	live
my feature checkout already contains a lot of code that i can t afford to lose but is far from being ready to go live

2389905
value	field
.when the list_changehandler function is called depending on the value of student_state i want a form to display different field

2389912
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern	chain-of-responsibility	observer-pattern
you can use a publish-subscribe mechanism aka observer-pattern or the chain-of-responsibility patten to decouple model or parts thereof from the different parts of the view

2389912
puts	gets
or as jbrains puts it stop subclassing or the kitten gets it

2389915
multibyte	strlen
because substring and strlen are not safe for multibyte encoding

2389919
any	set
is there any way on a gnu linux systemd to tell whether or not my code is currently execution in a signals handler context apart from having every signals handler set a flag while process

2389920
linked-list	nodes
.so to get the total size of the linked-list you traversal the list and get the count of nodes

2389920
linked-list	nodes
this will give you the size of the actual linked-list but becareful as the linked-list nodes has pointers elements which in and of themselves can allocate memory as well

2389921
sql-server	oracle
overlap is entirely dependent upon which versioning of oracle and sql-server you are comparing

2389921
sql-server	oracle
with syntax has been supported by oracle since 9i - sql-server support started with 2005

2389921
sql-server	oracle
ansi-92 support oracle 9i+ vs sql-server 2005+

2389921
sql-server	oracle
regex support oracle 10g+ vs sql-server 2005+ requiring clr enabling clr function created

2389921
sql-server	oracle	unpivot	pivot
pivot unpivot sql-server 2005+ vs oracle 11g+

2389921
sql-server	oracle
coalesce oracle 9i+ vs sql-server 2000+

2389923
revision	updates
you want a reverse merge not an updates to an old revision

2389927
sql-server	oracle
pl sql - is sql for oracle sql-server

2389927
sql-server	oracle
it depends on the versioning of sql-server tsql or oracle pl sql for what iso ansi versioning they are using

2389929
bazaar	git
this is a good read that applies to git hg bazaar etc

2389930
malloc	free
actually if your native c include regular call to malloc and free any kind of gargage collected language like vb.net is going to literally run circles around it

2389930
processor	cpu
then you can run a solver per processor 2 per ht cpu or network computers

2389936
contains	elements
because the data_struct types contains 4 pointers three for pointers to-char and one for the next elements in the list

2389942
value	field
in the first sample i use the ternary-operator to make it clear that the procedure is the same and that the size field gets a different value depending on the i o directions

2389960
32-bit	64bit
i m looking for a very simple way of determining if the versioning of windows the customer is using is 32-bit or 64bit

2389990

2390028
build-system	cmake
has native iphone support via it s cmake build-system

2390031
protected	public
no public means a kind of protected while the keyword protected is prohibited weird huh

2390032
versioning	upgrade
.when they open those files generator by php modify them with excel and save those changes excel ask to upgrade the file-format because it was saved to versioning 5.0 95

2390045
sql-server	ms-access
of course if you did use access 2010 then youâ ll be able to design those report inside ms-access as opposed to having to use the sql-server report-designer

2390046
digits	short
should work as long as the short date string include the date as digits .so it might fail for say arabic

2390046
digits	short
dd short day use only one digits .when possible

2390055
multiplication	division
50 points on the slider then correspond to division or multiplication by four .so you can set

2390055
multiplying	exponent
this maps 1 100 to 0 100 and then if you want multiplying positive value of the exponent by log 5 log 4 .so that your scale ends at 500

2390062
key-value	key
compared to any key-value store the key features for zodb would be automatic integration of attributes changes with real acid transactional and clean arbitrary references to other persistent object

2390070

2390079
windows-xp	windows
i m trying to find a concrete yes for some assumptions i have about developing a swing .app to be run on a windows tablet device i believe it ll be running windows-xp

2390079
click	mouse
we have a demo we are writing and we re leveraging previous experience with swing to write the user-interface and i just want to make sure that touch-events in windows are treated like mouse click is this true

2390080
malloc	free
as was mentioned i would not trust the memory usage reported by the task manager as there are other factors beyond your control that impact it how malloc free are implements etc

2390080
malloc	free
one way you can test for memory-leaks is by writing your own wrapper functions around the existing malloc and free functions similar to

2390094
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i develop using snow leopard and the fonts appears fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

2390108
union-all	union
you obviously don t need to de-dupe you re using union-all .so that seems like it would be an obvious .solution to avoiding whatever problem is happening with your union ed recordset

2390125
webforms	asp.net
to do this you can loops through the dropdownlistfor items and add a title attributes to each listitem if you are using asp.net webforms

2390146
communication	messages
microsoft messages queuing msmq technology enables applications running at different time to communication across heterogeneous networks and systemd that may be temporary offline

2390151
private-members	constructor
the thing to remember about helpers is that they can be treated like normals classes use a constructor with arguments and have private-members

2390154
temporary	copy
either make a copy of the data before the temporary gets destroy or make a reference to the temporary

2390155
.when	ready
the form may not be ready to be bound to .when you re calling .so you need to wrap it to execute and rig up the handler .when the document is ready

2390156
onitemselectedlistener	spinner
have you tried waiting until you have populate the spinner to register the onitemselectedlistener

2390163

2390206
linked-list	queue	linked-list	nodes
i was aiming at having each of the queue being a simple linked-list but how can i effectively create several queue one for each nodes

2390217
stored-procedures	ado.net
2 i have a few methods that work with database i transfer from ado.net stored-procedures

2390227
linked-list	queue
basically you need to create one struct for the queue which is a simple linked-list

2390229
codeigniter	kohana
some frameworks codeigniter and a fork kohana have lightweight designs they do not load a lot of code by default

2390242
networkx	igraph
igraph has built-in support for this algorithm as does networkx i believe and is really fast

2390265
updating	updates
hence .when updating the site you may want to updates the copyright year

2390267
any	set
if it returns a set flag though you could be pessimistic and skip async-unsafe call if any signals are pending

2390294
required	checked
you re probably better off parsing the url with and then checked if all of your required bits are inorder

2390318
any	set
i have an nssegmentedcontrol with the textures rounded styles and with the selection mode set to any

2390319
shallow-copy	deep-copy
take care to know if you want a shallow-copy or deep-copy

export	report
.when i export the crystal report to a pdf there are instances .when the text is cut off

2390387
shell-exec	phpinfo
i ve also looked at all shell-exec and eval that could generator phpinfo somehow but it doesn t show anything

2390408
cvs	git
than you can do all your git stuff in project.git and .when you want to import into cvs you go to sync project and do a git-pull to replay the changes in your sync dir perhaps you need to do a full dir checkout in cvs

2390408
cvs	git
import the cvs change set in git there is a git-cvsimport which should help you with that

2390410
constructor	object
if you create an instances of an spsite object by passing an url into its constructor the sharepoint-api will create a valid object out of that

2390418
any	set
is there any way to set the maximum size of the spinner .so after choosing an elements it shortens the choice with an ellipsis ... or .something

2390423
variables	boolean
you could do the same thing with just one boolean variables

2390452
arrays	loops
if you are using it as a loops control variables but aren t using the int directly which i guess you can t be as you can t declare an arrays larger than the largest index representable right

2390453
getter	setter
one possibility is to hide the variables as a properties and use a singleton in the setter getter functions but i don t know if there is a simple way

2390456
httpd.conf	.htaccess
checked your httpd.conf and .htaccess if the output is different

2390469
getter	setter
create a class that has the field you required along with the relevant getter and setter

value	field
then you can set the field to hold whatever you need and add these object to your map as the value

2390471
google-chrome	safari
the only thing i ve had problem with is that google-chrome safari won t accept tags in the data

2390478

for instances yahoo and google both have yahoo and google object that act like namespaces in that they contains all of their public and private variables functions and object within a single access points

2390527
pixels	line
a simple rectangle or square is easy but drawing a diagonal line would required a whole lot of single pixels divs and a circle even worse

2390527
svg	vml
other vector-graphics alternatives are the currently hated sigh flash ie s vml directly coded to and svg if a browser supports it

2390532
firefox	opera
and the text-align-right is being ignore both in firefox and opera

2390543
protected	public
i tried public private protected and internal

2390544
credentials	account
i m thinking i m connecting with a dsn but it s not using the same credentials as my windows account from my web browser

2390546
getter	setter
you should add class-level getter setter to encapsulate access to the static global variables

2390548
multiplication	division
it turns out that i still have some old 68000 assembler code for long multiplication and long division

2390557
bug-tracking	workitem
is there any tfs customer relationship web interface available like codeplex which enable customers to follow project progress with bug-tracking workitem discussions documentations release upload etc

2390587
stderr	stdout
but at the same time also giving back the stdout and stderr

2390591
base-class	inherited
in f# you typically use implementation inherited that is inheriting from a base-class much less frequently than in c# .so you shouldn t need protected as often

2390592
versioning	upgrade
java se 6 containss jax-ws 2.1 se 6 upgrade 3 and older versioning contains jax-ws 2.0

2390593
switching	screens
i m wondering if there is an easier way to switching between screens

2390601
mstest	nunit
a similar feature exists for mstest implements by the same person who did it for nunit but does not ship with mstest

2390626
void	main
below c code demonstrates how to defined a void void function to be called at program libs load-time before main execute

2390626
constructor	object
for msvc this places a pointers to the function in the user initializer section .crt xcu basically the same thing the compiler does for the constructor call for static c++ object

2390631
google-chrome	safari
for some reason if i go directly to the blog address google-chrome and safari fail to display all of my background images.

2390633
rhino-mocks	moq
jon erickson s answer is mostly correct rhino-mocks and moq can t intercept non-virtual call nor can they intercept static-methods or properties

2390635
webserver	security
application pages are stored on the webserver s filesystems also known as the 12 hive and run in a more priviledged security context

2390639
associations	model
you don t need explicit save to save the has_many associations of an existing model instances

2390660
push	pull
if you want to be able to push to pull from each other while offsite you re going to need .some kind of vpn .so your laptops can talk to each other

2390672
any	set
an indexer is a properties that takes argumentss and it can take any arguments of the appropriate types there s no guarantee that there will be a finite set of value

2390672
any	set
some classes may provide a way to work out the valid input to the indexer or indexer getter here of course the indexer set can take any tkey but key at least gets you the valid input to the getter which is all you caer about in this case etc. but this will be class-specific

2390676
radio-button	input-field	radio-button	selected	radio-button	checkbox	selected	checkbox	input-field	selected	input-field	checkbox
how would you best get all the input-field text radio-button checkbox selected etc semi-automatically out of dodgy formatted html document

2390682
reflection	runtime
the only instances where generics types information is retained at runtime is with field.getgenericstypes if interrogating a class s members via reflection

2390699
type-safety	generics
generics are process only in the compiler and are used to provide additional type-safety

2390703
sql-server	oracle	sql-server	teradata	teradata	oracle
rb 3.0 connect to a variety of data providers including sql-server 2000 2005 and 2008 via the sql native client as well as oracle odbc oledb adomd analysis service teradata sap bi essbase xml etc.

2390710
positioning	slider
one nice to have feature is to be able to show labels above the slider positioning indicating what volume the user has selected

2390717
foundation	cocoa
any cocoa foundation framework i can use to figure that out

2390733
decimal	hex
i was doing some reading about this error and it seems that the magic numbers expected is 0xcafebabe in hex which is 3405691582 in decimal not 1008813135

2390743
function-declaration	variable-assignment
those are functions the first one is a function-declaration the second is a variable-assignment with a function expression

2390765
value	field
properties are interpreter as field with side-effects but as field you expect to be able to assign a value and then later retrieve that value

2390779
windows	ms-dos	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
this is more proper on windows and causes there to be no ambiguity as to whether the 32-bit 64bit windows cmd.exe or the 16-bit ms-dos compatibility command.com should be used loaded

2390787
contains	any
a static-class can only contains static-members it is just a containsers for methods that do not logically belong to an instances of any standards class

2390787
static-class	inherited
the key difference is that you can inherited from an abstract-class but you cannot inherited from a static-class

2390787
static-classes	inherited	abstract	sealed
technically speaking the .net runtime doesn t have any notion of static-classes .so the c# compiler complies them as classes that are both abstract and sealed meaning that you cannot inherited from them

2390787
static-classes	abstract-class
.so static-classes are abstract-class that are al.so sealed although this is not the usual way to look at the problem if you are c# programmer and contains only static-members which is enforced by the c# compiler

2390791
any	set
however neither the above value of 2 1 1 nor any other set of value that i ve tried besides 1 1 1 produce a legible image

2390791
any	set
and notice that in the i j loops they re not controlling any kind of pixels skipping if hsampfactor 0 is set to two it s just grabbing two blocks instead of one

2390800
abstract-base-class	abstract-methods
one way to model a user or principal in such a context would be to collect what is common across all those mechanisms into an abstract-base-class and leave gaps abstract-methods where the actual implementation come into play

2390813
directory	folder
then copy the files from the folder and move it to the c batch-file directory

2390817
dependency-injection	singleton
i also would like to points out that singleton are testing nightmare and that according to the big guys you should use google s dependency-injection framework

2390850
contains	set
you want to find words contains only a given set of characters

2390873
static-class	inherited
a static-class cannot be the base of a class inherited hierarchy

2390873
abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	inherited	static-class	inherited
an abstract-class is not suitable for singleton functionality because even though it may contains static-methods and field as a static-class does it cannot forbid inherited .so the singleton use may be defeated by subclassing

2390894
flickr	etsy
the first feed is from a wordpress blog the second from an etsy store and the third from a flickr feed

2390900
attributes	properties
do i have to put the data-members attributes on every single properties

2390932
text-editor	editor
you may be able to spot the error in the output if you go through it in a text-editor line-by-line or you could try using an xml editor and see if it finds issues

2390943
modem	wifi
you can tell whether the mac is using wifi whether it is using a modem and whether it is using hard ethernet which could be cable dsl or something else

2390953
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
ie8 along with firefox google-chrome and safari work exactly as expected

2390957
expression-blend	designer
you may find that the expression-blend designer handles this situation better

2390965
constructor	private
remember you need to declare a private constructor to ensure the singleton properties

2390968
margins	padding
i remember having a problem with the form tag in ie7 showing padding and or margins

2390972
arguments	default
just create a function that creates and returns an empty modela and set the default named arguments on thing to that function

2390982
default	reset
you should first include a reset it neutralizes the default styling of html elements

2390994
django-haystack	xapian
tried django and django-haystack plus xapian-django-haystack the backend glue code to tie django-haystack to xapian because it was advertised on quite some blogs as working

2391000
selected	textbox
i currently have this code but it only show in the textbox the last file that has been selected

2391008
attributes	properties
note that if you need to do this for a numbers of different classes that might be represented in this manner then you can write one jsonconverter implementation and have it scan for an attributes on the properties

2391008
attributes	properties
if the properties has the attributes and exposes another object with properties it would expect to read write the dot-notation

2391032
directory	folder
i have this snippet and there are 3 images and 3 folder in the directory

2391032
wamp	php
notice undefined index extension in d data website wamp www stephssite php manage.php on line 119

2391036
contains	set
implements the widget with jquery-ui-draggable which contains a option to set containment which in your case could be a div with padding

2391052
entity-framework	nhibernate
especially if you are using something like entity-framework nhibernate or linq-to-sql - those libs are your dal

2391053
abstract	sealed	implements	sealed	implements	abstract
the compiler implements it by slick use of clr attributes for a class it declare it abstract and sealed

2391056
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as a webforms developer i got going on asp.net-mvc in a couple days and i will not go back

2391070
boolean	int
a boolean data types simply maps to a 1-bit tiny int

2391074
web-config	app-config
in short you can see a lot of assembly qualified types named in the app-config or web-config files because they use the same format

2391084
magento	cart
it seems that magento required a redirect inorder to complete the add to cart process

2391106
any	set
if a warning messages is not listed in the registry before the error filtering is set any call to warn will not result in the messages being added to the registry

2391107
post-increment	pre-increment
but if you change the post-increment to pre-increment it works

2391114
entity-framework	nhibernate
i recommend for you nhibernate or linq to sql.both are interesting and powerful.ado.net entity-framework is also good

2391119
attributes	properties
the attributess you ve written allow you to interrogate the properties that have those attributess in the class but you still need to use reflection to discover which properties of the attributes class are set

2391125
export	report	.when	ready
invert the design - instead of wrapping a web service around the business service and using it for ad-hoc report create a web service that encapsulates the data you need to receive from the export on a regular basis and have your business tier send messages to it .when new data is ready

2391125
push	pull
if you think that your business service are likely to change fairly frequently then it might work better have it push data outward to a warehouse types abstraction rather than having a mining process to pull it

2391138
dependency-injection	singleton
i also would like to points out that singleton are testing nightmare and that according to the big guys you should use google s dependency-injection framework

2391140
build-system	cmake
has native iphone support via it s cmake build-system

2391157
macvim	vim
note that macvim is gui .app and isnt really useful in the way that vim is

2391169
put	get
.so were did you get the weird notion that python-oauth2 doesn t support put

2391171
python	php
or even further if the webserver can run both php and python scriptinging can a php scripting get the output of a python scripting

2391183
implements	extends
.so i believe the short answer is no. you can implements your own scoping to do this by extends the spring classes quite easily though

2391187
updating	updates
updating the reference updates the .cs or vb whatever you re using

2391190
any	set
i can set a flag in a and have thread b checked that flag and exit as soon as it gets control of the semaphore but i don t know of any technique to allow thread a to yield the semaphore to thread b and get it back .when thread b exit without the risk of thread c seizing control

2391191
instances	private
from what i understand a singleton is basically .when you have a private member that represents the object you want to have a single instances for

2391191
constructor	object
then in the constructor you initializer the member object

2391192
duplicates	contains	contains	set
also note that a set cannot contains duplicates unlike an arrays

2391200
environment	execution
if your execution environment uses multiple classloader then you get one singleton per instances of your class

2391205
puts	gets
this essentially puts thread a in charge of .when thread c gets to execute

2391206
delphi	c++
same in object oriented language like c++ java delphi

2391206
xsd	xml
learn in depth http xml xsd wsdl

2391208
sequences	unique
in case you wonder sequences are database specific object oracle that can be used to generator unique int

2391212
javascript	dom
they offer integration with dom and javascript xml-like scene description and even programmable shader

2391213
google-chrome	firefox
this javascript code does not work in ie8 but works in firefox and google-chrome

2391217
duplicates	contains
arrays can contains duplicates .so it doesn t matter

2391240
constructor	object
the syntax a is not a constructor call it creates a temporary object of types a and call the constructor in the process

2391240
copy-constructor	temporary
then during the construction of a the copy-constructor generator automatically by the compiler is called with the temporary as an arguments

2391272
shell	bash
running date explicit from the bash shell on the dates

2391288
listboxitem	textbox
what you have won t work because silverlight wrap each item -- each instances of the datatemplate -- in a listboxitem and the grid.column and grid.row attached-properties need to be applied to that listboxitem not to the textbox that becomes the content of that listboxitem

2391288
panels	grid
there are at least two major uglinesses with this code first you still need to explicit specify itemspanel in xaml even though the control works only with grid panels

2391306
inlining	inline
inline is the standards keyword which was originally intended to hint at inlining

2391314
file-descriptor	pipe
if .so it will reuse the existing file-descriptor instead of reopening the pipe or file

2391330
defined	declare
inorder to defined a function in a header file and get away with it you have to either give it internal linkage declare it static and end up with separate function in each translation unit or explicit declare it inline

2391330
inlining	inline	defined	declare
modern compilers will normally consider virtually any function for inlining by applying heuristics regardless of where it is defined and whether it is explicit declare inline or not

2391333
increment	average
but i can go further add counters that measure time occured increment a counter of types averagetimer32 and an averagebase one and the profiling will give me the average duration of the operation

2391352
oracle	mysql
mysql s ahead of most of the pack just for allowing the keyword - mssql db2 and oracle use bit and some true false constants to fake it

2391356
nsinvocationoperation	nsoperationqueue
if you don t know how to do this read on nsoperationqueue and nsinvocationoperation

2391379
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
for example collate nocase does case-insensitive comparison and collate binary does a case-sensitive comparison

2391430
observers	destroy
.so the underlying problem was that all of the vigil s slots were being destroy and that data was caching .so .when i called vigil.slots from the observers it was using the caching destroy slots data

2391435
entity-framework	nhibernate
i ve never used entity-framework nhibernate or linq-to-sql personally but any should work

2391439
linguaplone	plone
according to one of its faq s plone running the linguaplone add-on can do this if i understand your question correctly

2391479
contains	any	contains	elements
you should not use ab.solute positioning on any of the elements .so that they are contains within the same #x div

2391482
constructor	private	copy-constructor	constructor
the constructor you declare private in class a is a copy-constructor

2391493
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net always injecst the database connection-string in the web-config .when you are using entity-framework linq-to-sql etc dataset etc

2391495
getter	setter
your getter and setter functions are bound up in a properties

2391511
virtual-machine	virtualbox
how can i start a virtual-machine from virtualbox as headless using pyvb modules

2391520
contains	elements
since the plugins is tied to the actual selected elements not the option elementss inside you should be able to write a function that just alert out all option details of the contains options of the parent selected

2391526
bundler	gem
bundler doesn t seem to pick up on the gem requirement .so you are missing the rack-openid gem

2391544
ruby-on-rails	rspec
in addition to the ruby-on-rails bundle there s probably a bundle for your unit test framework shoulda rspec and there s also one for cucumber if you lean that way

2391548
subtract	add
if speed is extremely important to you then just add one to every character value send it and subtract one again

2391559
contains	elements
elements that contains at least 1

2391566
conditional	operators
if all the conditional logically belong together then put them in one if-statement i put my boolean operators at the start of a line to make it easier to comment out single conditional during testing a hang over from big sql where clauses

2391572
stdin	pipe
this .post in the textmate manual has good information on getting started such as how to get input pipe from the text to stdin

2391589
hide	show
my application has a tray icons which .when double-clicked hide or show the application windows

2391590
directory	folder
if you want your grouping structure in xcode to mirror your directory structure in the filesystems which is also the folder structure in the finder you have to take the following step .when adding files that you want to go into grouping subdirectory

2391590
directory	folder
create the folder in the finder or the directory from the command-line

2391625
duplicates	contains
.so totally in resultset i have 162 recording which contains duplicates for b

2391630
multithreading	wait
the traditional way of writing multithreading code is a bit like a micromanagment at work - the boss hands out all work and everyone else is expected to wait around expectantly for it to be given to them

2391638
httpserver	webserver
the webserver not the application-server like your soappy server in python but the actual httpserver it runs on top on apache should provide the compression and have in the response a header content-encoding gzip to confirm that if that doesn t work properly you ll have to subclassing the transport class and insert compression there yourself -- i have no soappy installation at hand to checked

2391638
required	checked
in the url above look at the line and consider checked the headers to confirm that the content encoding is gzip as required and decompression as needed

2391638
compression	streaming
to deal with gzip compression and decompression of course you can use the zlib module of python standard-library not the gzip module which adds to zlib the header metadata process to make and read .gz files -- you re not dealing with .gz files but with streaming compressed with the gzip algorithm and that s zlib s job

2391656
registration	login
if you want to protect a url against visits from users who aren t registered with your service why not use the http-authentication mechanisms and or cookies handled out and process at application level in correspondence with registration and login

2391660
latitude-longitude	location
now what i want to do here is .when user drag or traversal through mapview i want to find coordinate latitude-longitude of the new centering location after map has been dragged

2391662
any	set
to exclude at first building any unit-test class .when you have a large set of sources and do not want to be presented with test classes during autocomplete or do not want them considered during source searches

2391669
keyboard	mouse
i m thinking of making a simple productivity-polling .app that every short interval polls the active windows and intercepts and passes along mouse and keyboard presses to measure productivity

2391679
virtual-functions	base-class
from what i ve read in the book and online virtual-functions are functions in the base-class that you can overrides in derived classes

2391692
textbox	button
on the press of submit button the xml will be written then all textbox

2391719
django-haystack	whoosh
it is easy to start with django-haystack and whoosh backend

2391723
derived-class	base-class
let s say you have a base-class base and a derived-class specialized which both implements void foo

2391724
derived-class	base-class
if the base-class is base and a derived-class is der you can have a pointers which actually points to an instances of der

2391729
didreceivememorywarning	viewdidload
solution is to store the contents of all textfield and views in didreceivememorywarning in a dictionary and storing the image in a instances variables and resetting them in viewdidload if they are present

2391737
selected	checkbox
assuming the named of the checkbox is foo to get the selected radio item you can use

2391737
arrays	map
then a map part of arrays class can be applied to those elements to get just the needed value s

2391740
comet	chat
comet chat assumes that there is a php session variables - but i dont have this with ruby-on-rails

2391793
variables	boolean
i tend to store each boolean result into a variables whose named makes sense as to what the value conveys and return their and ed value

2391794
versioning	upgrade
older versioning of leiningen used to compile everything by default which is actually a good reason to upgrade

2391802

2391864
hash	md5
the md5 hash is like the mailing address of the resource that remains constants

2391864
json	xml
the representation could be the movie s details in html xml json etc. or maybe the video of the movie itself depending on the capabilities of the client

2391874
value	field
in typical applications you need to transmit the field value back and forth due to the statelessness of the web

2391907
unique	words
in other words you use sub-selects to get the ids from the relevant tables based on a unique set of properties above example assumes movie namedd are unique in reality you will need a more specific query such as to handle the different films with the same named the omega man for example

2391933
thickbox	jquery
jquery user-interface recommended by those behind thickbox

2391939
memcmp	strcmp
if you specify the structures and its length in the memcmp it will compare and returns the results in int as like strcmp

2391947
scala	java
in general compared to java scala is doing its own thing .when dealing with xml

2391952
hide	next
.so in the first dialog box if the user click next it has to hide the first dialog box and display the second dialog

2391956
space-complexity	time-complexity
time-complexity o mn + n 2 space-complexity o m + n

2391963
synchronous	.when
now .when you want to do something synchronous you set the busyindicator.isbusy properties to true in sl4 you set the activity.isactive to true

2391983
void	main
in your static void main call

2392031
specifications	w3c
w3c database specifications says

2392034
adplus	dump
if you can get a minidump of the crash application look into the adplus tool which is part of debugging tools to get a dump on demand or on event then you can load that into windbg and use the sos extensions cmd

2392057
firefox	safari
output of this scripting in firefox and safari .so i ve concluded that this is not the problem with the browser but my code

2392066
postgresql	mysql
dump data from mysql then load it into postgresql

2392084
profiling	debugging
you can t find out the numbers of instances of system.string created for example - at least not without hooking into the debugging profiling api

2392088
textbox	button
the child windows contains textbox with a button

2392092
decrement	increment
if .so add a counter to the class that is increment in the constructor and decrement in dispose

2392103
contains	elements
if the data contains 2 elements use a struct or a std-pair

2392124
json	xml
i ve been thinking for a while if there s a way to get cross-domain ajax using xml not json to work

2392126
python	php	zend-debugger	xdebug
for profiling the applications themselves you d need a profiling for their respective languages xdebug or zend-debugger in php don t know what s there for python

2392128
dependency-injection	singleton
two very common requirements leading to the use of singleton are dependency-injection c.q

2392128
spring	guice
for dependency-injection spring guice or pico come to mind

2392131
configuration	installation
using the firefox plugins sqlitemanager you can work with the db on every computer without any installation configuration trouble and thus easily manage your data-import export filtering

2392139
getter	setter
the synthesize provides you with a setter and getter for the object you re synthesizing

2392142
cairo	sdl	ogre3d	sdl
yes you can rendering anything with opengl but it depend on your knowledge about 3d programming you are new to opengl maybe you want to try using sdl or 3d engines like ogre3d if you want to rendering it in 2d but with gpu acceleration you might want to rendering it using cairo api using opengl rendering back-end as a rendering to textures

2392151
myfaces	mojarra
after scouting around my own suggestion is to desist from using myfaces in this situation install the right mojarra runtime to support the project you re doing ensure you have all the jars install correctly which i didn t double checked your facelets configuration and read the manual

2392167
web-services	security
once you have worked the basic out checkout security performance restful web-services don t get nervous about terminologies they are mostly fancy terms for most common-sense stuff

2392170
xquery	xproc
xprocxq is was an implementation of xproc in xquery and is the only significant xquery open source project i know of

2392176

2392178
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
the purpose of my program is to add subtract multiplying and divide in postfix

2392185
reasoning	jena
if you use rdf then all of the reasoning engines jena is my favourite and triple stores out there can help you

2392202
while-loop	for-loop
use debugging logs in a for-loop or a while-loop sparingly

2392203
web-applications	web-services
then you can start considering how to do servlets web-applications and web-applications providing web-services

2392209
javascript	dom
it is possible for scripting to be nonblocking if they are added by javascript code via the dom for instances or if the async attributes is present in the latest versioning of firefox

2392211
gearman	resque
two solutions that i m inclined towards are resque and gearman

2392211
ruby	php	gearman	worker
another advantage of gearman is that while your client code might be in ruby the worker code could be in let s say php

2392213
version-control	cvs
oracle s free sql developer tool has integration with cvs and subversion for version-control of pl sql code

2392231
javascript	dom
libs such as jquery will help a lot with that as they will only let the javascript action happen once the dom is available hence no javascript errors .when javascript is loaded at the bottom of the html

2392232
notification-area	system-tray
how do you create a windows that popup from system-tray notification-area vertically upwards and display a messages

2392254
rollback	commit
make the unit of work expose a release methods which will take care of rollback release commit all pending work possibly distinguishing if it was due to an abend

2392267
decrement	increment
a db.eval call could be execute to increment decrement the vote count directly in the document .when a vote is added though it blocks .so wouldn t be very performant or a mapreduce call could be made regularly do offset that work

2392267
job-queue	queue
things like notifications could be pushed to another collections acting as a job-queue with a numbers of worker listening for new items in the queue think badge notifications new answers since user s last access time etc

2392287
any	set
this can be set to any address -valid or invalid-

2392305
windows-server	windows
if you are running on windows 7 or windows-server 2008 r2 you should investigate column compresion

2392318
shallow-copy	deep-copy
i do not want to create a shallow-copy of each nodes but a deep-copy of each nodes

2392335
haskell	lisp	haskell	c++	haskell	lua	c++	lua	lisp	lua
but you can use lua lisp c++ objective-c java using something like gcj not a jvm d haskell or anything else that can compile to arm code or a static llvm backend

2392343
factors	matrix
you never get matrix of factors or dataframe

2392344
google-chrome	safari
is there a nice way to tell safari google-chrome and others to stop grabbing people s elbows

2392371
heroku	nginx
heroku use nginx 0.6.32 see

2392376
instances	self
you could also create a magic methods that would dynamically throw back the self variables based on what you ask the instances for - a methods or a variables

2392381
base-class	inherited
what is possible with reflection.emit is to generator a dynamic class at runtime that inherited from a base-class or implements an interface

2392405
python	java	python	perl
.net perl java and the jgsoft regex engine will python won t for example

2392438
contains	elements
as you can see the returned nodelist contains only the a elements with href contains foo which i understand is what you are looking for

2392438
contains	elements
it contans the entire elements because the xpath translation to fetch all a elementss with href attributes contains foo

2392442
put	get
it seems the easiest way is to set up a viewflipper put each of my screens in that set the animation settings and then use this to get nice transitions

2392445
contains	any
if the row does not contains any cell

2392452
scriptmanager	updatepanel
in normals webpage i have used scriptmanager updatepanel modelpopupextender

2392474
function-call	inline
a function-call is inline .when the compiler feels like it and it is best to conceptually separate it entirely from the first meaning of inline

2392492
splitter	panels
how do i make a split panels splitter visible to the user rather than being invisible with only a cursor change on mouse over

2392515
g++	gcc
the following code works with visual-studio 2008 but not with gcc g++ 4.3.4 20090804

2392545
python	java
i ported the python libs into java

2392552
abstract-factory	factory-pattern
the objective depends on the types of factory-pattern abstract-factory provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent object without specifying their concrete classes. from design-patterns

2392555
fgets	puts
notice that fgets only puts a newline in your buffering if the original line had one and the last line of a file might not

2392567
textbox	button
if there re 5 required textbox is-empty then .when click the submit button id button1 the num is 5.after triggers the 5 textbox finding 5 errors and the code run well

2392573
versioning	upgrade
you should either live with the 2.0 versioning og upgrade to 3.5 and install it on the server hosting the .app

2392586
constructor	object
rather than having a class create it s dependent object using a constructor you supply it with a factory that knows how to create the object and it uses the factory to create the dependent object

2392589
abstract-factory	factory-method
factory-method pattern basically deals with the problem of creating object product without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. while abstract-factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a grouping of individual factory that have a common theme.

2392598
execution	jobs
i can tell you that i would potentially have a 100 of these jobs execution concurrently and each job might operate on 5 tables with anywhere between 200-1000 insert on each of these tables

2392602
any	set
im looking for any information about a built-in algorithm in opengl-es to convert a 3d polygons in a triangle set

2392606
keydown	keyup
.when the user types text into a textbox using the ime the keydown and keyup events are fired

2392606
keydown	keyup
.so for example if the user types 5 time ã then validation i will get 5 keydown keyup events with each time textbox.text returning the empty string and at the end i will get a keydown keyup for the enter key and the textbox.text will directly become ã ã ã ã ã

2392622
http	ssl
now my goal is to get this same model working over ssl http not http

2392638
jndi	jms
i am writing a standalone java client to access my jms ressources connectionfactory and destination via jndi

2392639
children	nodes	any	set
it seems that if .when a treenodes is added to a treeview and it doesn t have any children assign to it the isexpanded properties of that nodes is set to false

2392645
schema	rdbms
my application does not fit into the general purpose rdbms schema category i do not want a ginormous ddl scripting -- therefore i would need #include semantics and i will probably have different variants of the scriptinging therefore i would need #ifdef semantics

2392652
arrays	loops
anyway i have an arrays of strings 275 i need to loops through them and create strings of all the possible pairs in java

2392673
show	next
it show the report ok .when i am loading the page but .when click on next page or entering a page numbers it just loads and display the first page all over again

2392689
arrays	loops
i said to the interviewer that the only way would be to parsing the arrays two time two for loops

2392690
lookup	any
as a side note lookup any php function by doing the following

2392704
python	java
i ve just read an article that supposedly introduced me to a new concept up to now i was sure that python package i.e directory with an __init__.py file behave exactly the same as java package that is - little namespaces to help arrange the code minus java s package scoping

2392705
colorbox	jquery
i am using jquery colorbox and jquery datepicker

2392705
colorbox	jquery
my problem is datepicker doesn t work in my pop-up windows using jquery colorbox

2392710
value	field
a bidbond value may be supplied if and only if the recording s types field is set to tender

2392748
selected	button
if you application is ui-driven perhaps there a button or dropdownlistfor where the user can selected which strategy to use but even if this is not the case some outside caller must map a piece of runtime data to an instances of the strategy

2392771
constructor	object
one way unity can create object for you automatically is by simply declaring the object you need in your constructor

2392781
arrays	loops
however .when i put them in a loops to describe the statindex to an arrays the folder are rearrange as follow in the arrays

2392788
buffering	streaming
assuming that you want 0 1 2 3 to end up as 0 2 and 1 3 .when demuxing to two streaming you basically can t do it without buffering

2392803
any	set
if not .when i receive a python str that has any possible character set in it how do i know how to decode it

2392811
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
it s written in c# and fully supports code-folding with syntax-highlighting in several languages

2392817
value	field
while addslashes will not affect the null value field it will not change a blank to a null value

2392817
value	field
this will remove any blanks or spaces from the empty field .so that it will in fact return a null value

2392837
value	field
but .when i use the labels field the variables named in the labels is display not the actual value

2392843
versioning	upgrade
this lets you use visual-studio 2010 for your ide for now and should the team upgrade later to one of the full versioninging of visual-studio 2010 the ide for your language will cleanly integrated into the full versioning

2392859
imperative-programming	imperative
these are not generally available in imperative-programming but that doesn t mean imperative is worse

2392861
queue	fifo
the printer takes and printing each document in the order the docs are put in the queue ie fifo

2392879
virtual-functions	abstract-class
this is typically a blessed use-case for abstract-class and virtual-functions

2392887
bazaar	git
git is something i ve consistently thought was too difficult to invest effort in .when using it on osx windows especially considering that hg and bazaar are comparable in capabilities

2392904
jndi	jms
ok i found a workaround which is to not use jndi but to use vendor-specific jms api instead as describe on

2392916
environment	building
that said you must draw your own conclusions about your long-term reliance on it and your interest in building on a non-native toolchain both in terms of what you can get out of the environment and the support channels you ll need to use not apple .when stuff doesn t work

2392932
32-bit	64bit
this is reproducible on ubuntu with g++ as well as on 64bit windows 7 .when compiling for 32-bit with vs2008

2392963
selected	checkbox
.when the detach database dialog appears selected the checkbox that says drop connections

2392977
json	xml
i need to store recording in a key-value-store and i have considered xml json or yaml and pretty much decided on yaml

2393000
textbox	button	textchanged	textbox
how about using the textchanged event and then checked if the textbox is-empty or has something in it and enabling or disabling the button accordingly

2393009
order	add
i m guessing i need to use some mix of round score grouping by score and then order by date desc -- but i can not figure out how to add that in successfully

2393012
value	field
you can put the order in an outer case and then for selected the field you can use the form of the case where you compare one value to several value

2393037
subclassing	nsobject
you can also use a declaration like which means any object of types nsobject or a subclassing that implements the handler protocols

2393038
short	zero
the short answer to your last question is yes - denormalization very close to zero numbers required special handling and can be much slower

2393058
value	field
you can try to call calendar.getminimum for each types of field year month etc. and then set those minimum value on corresponding field typess

2393065
datagrid	listbox
on the other hand if you are trying to create a datagrid then consider transpose or grouping the columns in each row in the model then you can use the datagrid instead of a listbox

2393069
jsonp	ajax
at the end of your url reason for this is that jquery automaticly uses jsonp to bypass ajax cross-domain-policy .when using getjson

2393083
value	field
your where-clause basically means compare the value of the mentioned field if they have a value â otherwise false

2393095
similarity	distance
a very simple yet effective measure for such similarity or rather the inverse is the edit distance of two strings which can be computed using dynamic-programming which takes time o nm in general where n and m are the lengths of the strings

2393105
hide	show
the plugins looks for elements with that class inorder to show or hide the error messages and also .when count how many invalid elements there are

2393113
attributes	properties
i want to create a custom properties attributes for classes

2393113
attributes	properties
i can create a class derived from attributes and mark the properties with the attributes but where to go from here

2393113
attributes	properties
i would like to generalize the behavior of the properties in the attributes but i don t know how to go from here.

2393120
dictionary	for-loop
i have a for-loop which references a dictionary and printing out the value associated with the key

2393128
radio-button	button
cons does not resolve problem of what to do with button especially radio-button behavior

2393128
environment	building
does anyone have experience with building uis for environment in which there is significant latency between action and response

2393129
pyside	pyqt	lgpl	gpl
pyqt and or the very similar nokia-sponsored pyside with a more relaxed license lgpl instead of gpl and the same underlying toolkit qt do offer the advantage of similarity with nokia s smartphones gui toolkit your fourth points -- nokia purchased trolltech the makers of qt exactly because qt was the fundamental gui toolkit for their mobile offerings

2393129
wxpython	pyqt
to my tastes it seems that wxpython s tutorial the new one in wiki form is what i m points to and recommending is really good and pyqt s not bad at all

2393129
pyside	pyqt
pyside s docs don t include a good tutorial that i know of i believe pyside s intention is that you first learn pyqt with the reasonable available materials then apply these few difference to be programming in pyside instead of pyqt

2393129
pyside	pyqt
if you can afford a book pyqt has a good one al.so applies to pyside as above -- this excellent and free one is unfortunately very old .so i don t think it helps

2393129
pyside	pyqt
personally i recommend pyqt pyside overall power a+ ease to get started with the above tutorial and book a- nokia-phone programmer similarity a

2393141
attributes	properties
it is almost always the wrong choice .when you try to use an attributes where a virtual properties is actually needed

2393141
attributes	properties
retrieving attributes value is very expensive many order of magnitude more expensive than retrieving a properties value

2393155
subclassing	superclass
i also propose it since i think it makes much more sense to grouping superclass together and make sure superclass are defined before subclassing -- otherwise your module won t even be importable

2393161
rabbitmq	activemq
.when you use a message-queue like rabbitmq beanstalk activemq ibm-mq series tuxedo you expect different and more fault tolerant results

2393170
temporary	copy
it will first construct a temporary foo and then copy the foo into the elements

2393177
spaces	output
show how to do it -- the output .when running for demonstration purposes as the main scripting five a s ten b s etc with spaces in-between is

2393186
show	next
a button has an status-icon next to it show it s status

2393186
.when	ready
green means ready .when the user click the button the icons changes to orange and that indicates busy

2393214
build-system	build-tools
the xcode build-system is just a lightweight face on top of standards unix build-tools

2393227
temporary	copy
you have to write a loops to copy the bytes to a temporary bytearrayoutputstreaming until the end of the streaming is reached

2393229
shell	bash
set a bash alias in that shell session assuming python2.4 is in your path of course

2393248
attributes	properties
you have to know the target class methods properties etc first and then query which attributes decorator it

2393248
attributes	properties
going back to your other question if you want to know .when a properties decorated with your attributess is set or retrieved you d have to implements inotifypropertieschanged on all of your related classes write code to search all your classes for properties marked with that attributes upon assembly load and then building some interactivity that hooked up the propertieschanged events to whatever code you need to fire

2393264
instances	self
where self is the instances of client we re authentication

2393288
click	mouse
yes touches are treated just like mouse click

2393288
screens	tablet
in the end our users ended up using the tablet just like a regular laptop with the keyboard not the touch screens

2393305
compatibility	legacy
this supports mixing legacy codes that keep a 4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for sse compatibility

2393319
contains	any
btw the webpage you pointed to does not contains any kind of results if you ment routes you should be fine with something like this

2393324
getter	setter
that s fairly rare btw lots of control properties getter and setter generator a windowss messages to ask the native windows control for the properties value

2393327
contains	elements
however you are setting it with an elements object rather than a string contains html

2393358
mbunit	nunit
for web tests i use selenium and then for testing the backend i will use nunit mbunit

2393366
windows-xp	windows
i m running on a windows 2000 pro sp4 box off domain and trying to impersonate a local user on a windows-xp box on domain

2393366
windows-services	impersonation
i am using impersonation to remotely start and stop windows-services as well as access network-shares for some automated integration-testing

2393366
windows-xp	windows	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp
everything worked beautifully windows-xp on domain to windows-xp on domain windows-xp on domain to windows-server 2003 off domain and even windows-xp on domain to windows 2000 off domain

2393366
windows-xp	windows
the one issue was running on windows 2000 pro sp4 off the domain and trying to impersonate a local user on a windows-xp box running on the domain

2393366
windows-xp	windows
if i look at the computer management - systemd tools - shared folder - sessions on my remote windows-xp box i can see about 10 sessions open to the windows 2000 box

2393366
windows-server	windows-xp
i m guessing windows-xp windows-server 2003 are reusing open sessions since i don t seem to be having any issues with them

2393370
children	nodes
if you re sticking with domdocument append a new nodes is as simple as getting a reference to an existing nodes creating child nodess and then append new nodess to those children

2393382
logout	login
i place the login and logout actions in a users controllers

2393383
shell	bash
.when i use putty to log on to a bash shell i want it like real term android-emulator in linux

2393386
dictionary	arrays
i m struggling with trying to sort an arrays of dictionary

2393387
contains	set
equals also checked that one set contains all value in the other set

2393404
administration	account
if it does work with windows 7 you ll have to make sure you run the install as administration and remember that being logged in to the administration account isn t enough to ensure that happens anymore

2393406
authentication	login
i think it s because admin-realm admin is automatically authentication and .when i try to access a restrict page it checked the authentication user and since it s admin and it has authentication to the page the the page is accessible and does not prompt to login

2393406
authentication	login
i don t understand how glassfish authentication the user employee without the user submission the login credentials

2393411
javascript	dom
a few things to consider .when using javascript to manipulate the dom on the front end

2393417
key-value	key
.when you insert an key-value pair into an hashtable gethashcode is called on the key

2393417
put	get
put it together and what do you get

2393417
key-value	key
but .when you add a key-value combinations it has to be able to generator a hash of the key

2393425
teamcity	msbuild
currently we use msbuild to flatten the structure and then teamcity to archive it

2393441
actionscript	mxml
if it makes a difference my buttonbar is not defined in mxml but is initializer in actionscript and an arraylist is assign to the dataprovider properties of my buttonbar instances

2393444
csv	zip
edit i am not using a file handler but rather a csv reader csv.reader open file ... and zip doesn t seem to work with it.

2393459
user-permissions	user-roles
this would probably be best accomplished through creating a role admin user-roles then defining that roles permissions admin user-permissions

2393470
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
right now .when i do ctrl a on my fairly lame webpage the contents of textbox and of listbox select-boxes is not selected and hence cannot be easily copy-paste

2393490
value	field
from your code i assume that it would make sense to set the capturedfrom field of the new instances in the clone methods to the same value as the capturedfrom field of the source instances

2393495
access-specifier	base-class	derived-class	base-class
the way protected access-specifier works it allows the derived-class b to access the contents of an object of base-class a only .when that object of class a is a subobject of class b

2393495
access-specifier	base-class
.when applied to constructor the protected access-specifier has a very specific effect a protected constructor can only be used to initializer base-class subobjects

2393495
abstract-class	pure-virtual
in other words protected constructor are another way to implements the concept of abstract-class in c++ along with pure-virtual methods

2393523
continuous-integration	teamcity	continuous-integration	build-server	build-server	teamcity
possibly not an agile tool as such depends on your definition but the free teamcity continuous-integration and build-server is the kind of software that you don t believe you could live without once you ve used it

2393527
python	c++
is there a libs for python that will allow me to parsing c++ code

2393530
pyside	pyqt
i use pyqt pyside should be equivalent but with more relaxed license terms and i find it pleasing and useful -- i also like the fact that with no extra effort on my part it gives me cross-platform apps

2393537
contains	any
second any arguments that contains spaces or begins or ends-with spaces

2393555
put	get
i think its search option has one choice where it says get product tagged with gives you a box to put in your idea of what a tag could be which show you a dropdown of tags it finds matching - same as stackoverflow

2393557
any	set
or in the iso 8859-1 code set or any of the iso 8859-x code sets

2393564
double	int	primitive	int
valid types are primitive int double byte char etc. and of course object such as string or calendar or whatever class you might be using

2393564
primitive	int
java does automatically cast down or up some primitive value such as int to long where applicable but generally in java you re going to use actual object and those are only downcasting if applicable

2393575
python	c++
in the past i ve used for such purposes gccxml a c++ parsing that emits easily-parseable xml -- i hacked up my own python interfaces to it but now there s a pygccxml which should package that up nicely for you

2393578
facebook-page	facebook
any ideas on how i would include a facebook connect button on our facebook-page would awesome

2393583
click	mouse
hmmm.... ui-automation required no code change to the windows forms application but it can be sort of low-level because you need to program each mouse click or cut paste

2393583
perl	php	vbscript	perl
office-automation allows any com-capable program c# vbscript powershell perl php etc. to drive office applications

2393610
vbscript	basic
there s the wmi code creator tool from microsoft that can generator c# visual basic .net and vbscript code for you to run any wmi query and enumerate the results

2393619
derived-class	inherited
1 constructor don t get inherited and that why in derived-class they can t be overrides

2393629
positioning	fluid
the regular faux columns would be positioning to cover the fixed width column and being very wide would provide background to the fluid column until the absolutely positioning div contains the opposite end of the repeat background kicks in

2393637
attributes	properties
remember that the attributess of an elements like the href above are available in javascript as properties once you have a reference to the elements .so you should be able to change whatever attributes of the elements you need to

2393640
shutdown	restart
you get this with sybase .when the systemd is restart after an improper shutdown

2393649
implements	final
i am required to implements the ntru public key cyptosystem as part of my final year university project

2393654
put	get
it seems like what you need to do is get rid of all the positioning stuff and just set margins on it to put it in the middle of the page or whatever you re trying to do

2393667
duplicates	sorted
tested for sorted input ascending and descending random input input having duplicates works fine

2393681
filtering	sorting
.when we re doing sorting filtering it append to url additional query-keys

2393689
platform	gpl
brunet is a free software gpl licensed libs for p2p networking written in c# and developed using mono but it also runs on microsoftâ s .net platform

2393692
financial	banking
banking financial applications

2393709
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
as a preface to this i m a django python person not ruby ruby-on-rails but from what i can tell the configuration would look like this

2393730
value	field
currently i am using a single table to store these value as types varchar with an extra field to denote the datatypes that it should be

2393730
value	field
.when i display the value i use that datatype field to format it

2393745
dictionary	arrays
recent is another mutable arrays which has sorted dictionary value

2393753
triggers	insert
now here s how to definitively make your triggers safe for identity to return the correct value even if your sp or another triggers insert to an identity-bearing table after the main insert

2393761
contains	set
anyhow the input is .some graphing and what i want to do is partition the nodes into two sets .so that neither set contains a triangle

2393768
gentoo	ubuntu
gentoo has a program eselect which is for just this kind of thing listing versioning of programs and setting the default ubuntu may have something analogous

2393786
.when	ready
if the map takes a while to load you might consider having a loading placeholder to indidcate to users that the map is loading and then hide this .when the map is ready

2393793
maven-plugin	m2e
i had problems with using m2e it did not appear to be install at all but i develop a project using iam - maven-plugin for eclipse supported by eclipse foundation or hosted or something like that

2393813
cakephp	symfony
cakephp symfony cakephp is very easy to pick up and is a good choice if it fits all the requirements

2393814
any	set
this is not possible for any set with 5 tightly interconnected nodes and i can prove it with a simple thought experiment

2393824
switching	screens
i understand how to switching views from say the home screens

2393826
command-line	cmd
you can set up vimenter vimleave auto cmd to do the right thing .when you have specified files on the command-line as .when git invokes vim

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
thus at runtime you ll note that you never actually have an instances of nsstring or nsmutablestring but only instancess of subclassing which actually aren t really subclassing.

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
and those subclassing -- the implementation class used at runtime -- overrides almost all of the methods of nsstring and nsmutablestring to provide highly optimized implementation of the specific operations

2393843
fadeout	fadein
i m trying to use the following code to make an image fadeout and only .when it s fade out change its source and then make it fadein again

2393868
hide	show
the only thing i found that worked to refresh the positioning of the nav bar was to hide it and show it again like this

2393869
value	field
you could then expose month day and year field as nullable value to reflect which portions of the date are known

2393872
cursor	row
now i use a cursor to loops every row then doing like

2393876
if-statement	for-loop
rewrite the for-loop to checked for already-uncompressed files to be a single if-statement

2393888
put	get
i m trying to updates a random-access binary file using the std iostream interface with separate get put positioning managed via seekg seekp

2393888
put	get
everything works fine with stringstreaming but .when i create a file descriptor-based streaming using boost.iostreaming specifically boost-iostreamings streaming boost-iostreamings file_descriptor the get put positioning are no longer independent

2393888
stringstream	fstream
i gather from web searches that stringstream seems to be independent but that fstream may not be

2393898
any	set
is there any way for me to set the boot classpath now for this java runtime environment

2393946
arrays	loops
declare an arrays result with two bytes then you loops through the source arrays

2393970
progress-bar	progress
i created an audio-player using java applet but i m stuck at trying to create a progress-bar no need for seek or anything fancy just a progress-bar display the progress of the audio file being played

2393971
bundler	gem
bundler is a gem that manages your gem dependencies using a manifest called gemfile at the root of your .app

2393971
rubygems	bundler	bundler	gem
it required rubygems 1.3.6 .so do gem updates --system and gem install bundler then create the gemfile

2393975
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell	selection	cell	selection	highlight
.when either of the related items is selected before going to the detail view i would like the momentary cell selection highlight to show both or in some cases 3 cell highlight to alert the user of the relationshp

2393978
32-bit	64bit
the c source codes that i am trying to ports into 64bit runs without any warning in the 32-bit environment

2393978
ubuntu	linux
.when i compile in 64bit linux environment with the compile gcc ubuntu 4.4.1-4ubuntu9 4.4.1 it show the following warning mostly

2393985
any	set
this way you can make sure any non-nullable properties are set before trying to save changes and avoid having to rely on exception-handling

2393989
mstest	nunit
jim implements a versioning of assert.throws for mstest at the same time as he did the original implementation for nunit nunit has include in subsequent release mstest has not its still possible to use though

2393989
32-bit	64bit	mstest	nunit
nunit can run tests in 32 and 64bit mstest only runs them in 32-bit iirc

2393989
mstest	nunit
correct there is a lot of misconception that mstest is the same as nunit but mstest is a generalized framework

2393991
boolean	int
evalueates to boolean but evaluates to int as assignments always evaluate to the assign value

2393992
variables	boolean
you still get into problems with .when b and c are boolean variables admittedly - a typo there can cause an issue

2393992
if-statement	loops
edit responding to your edit - assignments of all kinds can be used in if-statement - and while loops etc .so long as the overall conditional expression is boolean

2394002
32-bit	64bit
given that you re on 64bit i expect that you ll need to building your .app specifically as 32-bit and not anycpu

2394005
mongodb	mysql
the ms sql and mysql servers were tuned to perfect settings while the mongodb was just set up with default

2394006
spawn	exit
how should i go about recursively spawn an application and then .when the user exit the jframe spawn

2394012
positioning	slider
however the user can also updates the thumb positioning by either click on a positioning in the slider tracking or by dragging the thumb

2394012
keyboard	mouse
value due to mouse or keyboard

2394014
solaris	linux
moving the file or removing it wholesale with rm will not cause a crash because the os solaris in this case but i assume this is true on linux and other nix as well is smart enough to not delete the inode associated with the file while any process has it open

2394031
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your rubygems versioning this is fixed as of rubygems 1.3.6

2394035
ddms	adb
in general use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to look at the java stack-trace associated with the force close dialog to see what the problem is

2394035
android-emulator	ddms
also with the android-emulator you will need to submit a fix via ddms after registering for location updates or something before getlastknownlocation will return a non- null value

2394039
mongodb	mysql
mysql nor mongodb is doing that .so they can be faster

2394069
msbuild-task	msbuild
to debugging further please set your msbuild logging level to versbosity diagnostic and see what headers import msbuild-task definitions its pulling in

2394078
32-bit	64bit
also you said the code runs without warning on 32-bit but compilation for 64bit gives you warnings

2394086
contains	set
i would like to produce a binary zip distribution of my project that would contains an uberjar and a set of scripting

2394087
while-loop	cursor
however if you have a real reason to use a cursor you can use the break statement to break out of a while-loop

2394090
oracle	mysql
we want to be able to use ms-sql oracle mysql with minimum changes and we ve decided to implements a business-logic plus data-layer exposed via wcf service to get the required flexibility

2394093
getter	setter
you can use a tween to advance the play head add a getter and setter that will change the play head

2394106
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseup
i m working on a web .app where i support dragging on the page by simply watching for mousedown mousemove mouseup events

2394106
mousedown	mouseup
that is mousedown then mouse-leaves-windows then mouseup then mouse-returns to windows looks like it s still dragging to my .app

2394115
fast-enumeration	for-in-loop
nsenumerator was created before fast-enumeration for-in-loop was available

2394121
arguments	default
however in c language in k r c and in the modern one as well if the function is declare without a prototype as show above the parameters passed in each function-call are subjected to .so called default arguments promotions

2394121
arguments	default
under default arguments promotions any integral types smaller than int or unsigned int is always converted to int or unsigned int

2394121
arguments	default
btw float is converted to double by default arguments promotions

2394121
double	int
all these functions will be declare with parameters of types int or double instead

2394124
pixels	line
instead of 2 cell if for the related cell i were to double the height of those cell draw a horizontal line half way between to make the 2 subcell of 44 pixels in height looking just like 2 cell and place the data in subviews .so the result looks exactly the same as 2 cell but it would actually be 1 cell

2394124
highlight	cell	selection	cell	selection	highlight
selection of one of my subcells would then highlight 2 subcells which is the entire cell - same effect but 1 cell

2394132
bazaar	git
git and mercurial are distribute rcss like bazaar that have tools for hooks including different approaches to branch-specific hooks and global hooks

2394135
mersenne-twister	generator
apparently the mersenne-twister a commonly used random numbers generator fails the dieharder tests by being too random

2394141
perl	php	perl	c++	python	php	python	c++	python	perl
i started off with html and css then went on to php which i got quite good at and then to python perl and c++

2394141
ruby-on-rails	django	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	django
should i use pure php mysql or use a framework like django ruby-on-rails or cakephp

2394151
zend-framework	symfony
i really like zend-framework and often use doctrine as orm it s the default orm of symfony but can be used very easily with zf

2394158
contains	any
is there any way in eclipse to format a code that contains divs in the way netbeans do it

2394168
boost	stl
you can use lexecal_cast from boost then c itoa and of course stringstream from stl

2394174
postgresql	mysql
as database backend you can use mysql if the structure is simple but for more complex databases i d use postgresql as the mysql performance seems to drop fast with increasing complexity subjective opinion

2394192
bmp	png
i m having a lot of difficulty creating and writing bmp or png images in java

2394192
file-format	corrupt
with any other file-format including png the resulting file is completely corrupt

2394192
bmp	png
java says png bmp and others are supported on my systemd according to the filetypessupported methods

2394192
bmp	png
here is my code for if i were to write a png with a lot snipped out and the bmp writing

2394197
getter	setter
for example calling setproperties or getproperties on the object would be slower than using an int -- especially if that properties is bound to a getter or setter methods

2394199
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli can directly access and create managed and unmanaged types and copy between them

2394200
32-bit	64bit
int and unsigned int are still 32-bit value on 64bit machines but uintptr_t becomes a 64bit types

2394200
32-bit	64bit
this means that uintptr_t is 32-bit wide on a 32-bit machine but it becomes 64bit wide on a 64bit machine

2394200
32-bit	64bit
in your code this means that with your typedef change on 64bit machines is a 64bit pointers to a 64bit variables but is a 64bit pointers to a 32-bit variables

2394208
doskey	alias
it then execute cmd v k at the end .so that i will be able to enter the doskey alias and launchd all of my unix-style cmd

2394227
linux	bsd
note the ape server can only be run on linux bsd or mac os x

2394249
google-chrome	opera
using the code below both google-chrome and opera latest versioning supporting border-radius on mac show a small blue area outside the rounded corners which seems to a part of the defined background-image

2394278
environment	execution
you can write your own rake-task which depends on environment and pass rails_env development .when execution it

2394281
implements	extends
this can happen .when class a depends on object of class interface d which will be returned by b from factory-method which will be object of class interface c which extends implements d

2394298
google-chrome	firefox
ok this works in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

2394308
contains	elements
in the first case 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1 are considered the same - in the latter they are considered distinct though they contains the same elements

2394313
multiplication	polynomials
that multiplication technique is simply the karatsuba multiplication applied on polynomials which makes it even easier because there is no carry in polynomials

2394322
populate	row
if it can t do the filesort trick it will just behave as if you did an insert on every row and populate the index blocks with each row s data in turn

2394323
any	set
does anyone have any clue what the proper way to set an nslevelindicator s value from code is

2394328
instrumentation	trace
selected the objectalloc instrumentation in your trace document and sort the list of classes by current count or by current total size

2394336
document-ready	ready	document-ready	.when	.when	ready
you can defined document-ready inside a function and it ll fire .when called if it s already ready like this

2394366
jquery	.post
2 it would be nice if i could via jquery .post the request to both of my servers referencing them by their ports numbers

2394370
canvas	scale
i have a canvas for showing the document inside of a scrollviewer and i have zoom in zoom out button that control the x and y scale properties of the scaletransform for the canvas.rendertransform properties

2394372
any	set
to bypass any ignore rules set

2394376
contains	set
you have a large list l contains instances of reference-type s for set

2394379
32-bit	64bit
with 32-bit code this is true with 64bit code it is not - pointers are a 64bit types

2394379
32-bit	64bit
this is probably the most common 32-bit to 64bit porting issue

2394381
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
running the code it draw properly the plus and minus sing as windows-xp would draw it however in windows-vista and windows 7 the glyph for open and closed nodes are small triangles

2394390
foundation	cocoa
apple has open sourced a large chunks of core foundation as cf-lite and it s toll-free bridged with cocoa on os x you can use many cf classes interchangeably with their cocoa counterparts

2394391
put	get
okay .so i have a website where the user can put a search query into a form that uses get to send the data

2394429
selected	button
note that you can t bind to the selected properties via the designer due to initialization order problems in initializecomponent the binding is performed before the radio button are initializer .so their tag is null in the first assignment

2394453
display	width
i am unable to get the span elements to properly inherited the width while maintaining the anchor inline display

2394463
arrays	loops
.when reading 2-byte wordss from an unaligned char arrays for instances it s best to do the odd byte read first .so that later words reads are all at even addresses up until the end of loops

2394465
contains	any
instances need not contains any real

2394472
beautifulsoup	lxml
for a table that s simply logically broken though it may look ok .when rendering the browser and therefore selenium may be just as helpless as lxml or beautifulsoup

2394473
checkbox	button
like checkbox radio button div

2394478
directory	folder
you could also put folder monitor software on the severs that keep certain directory in sync

2394483
google-chrome	firefox
ubuntu 9.10 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5.0.307.11

2394483
google-chrome	firefox
windows-xp firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0.249.89 ie 8

2394494
common-lisp	lisp
i m trying to use parenscript in gnu common-lisp to compile a lisp file into a javascript one

2394504
x11	gdk
the sigsegv was happening because i was confusing the handles of the unmanaged gdk object with the handles of their x11 counterparts

2394530
value	field
however with further inspector into the field variables it show that the internal value of field is client.workphone and offset 7 count 9 hash 0

2394530
spring	grails
i m wondering of grails or maybe even spring is not using this string correctly

2394561
parsing	comma
however asp.net does not parsing the comma case correctly - it does not count comma as a separator but considers it just part of the value

2394561
concatenation	comma
from http perspective this is completely valid and in such case the effective value of the header should be concatenation of the value of all its instances separated by comma

2394580
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
is it possible to use nhibernate xml mapping files instead of fluent-nhibernate in s#arp-architecture framework

2394581
istream	std
shape get std istream shape.h 31

2394581
ostream	std
shape put std ostream const

2394600
session-cookies	cookies
2 you haven t told your browser to treat all cookies as session-cookies

2394610
windows-xp	windows
winxp log on as a batch-file job documentation says in windows 2000 server windows 2000 professional and windows-xp professional the task scheduling automatically grant this right as necessary

2394612
put	get
off the top of my head and without trying it you should be able to put the resources in with the source files which will get netbeans to put them into the jar file

2394614
.when	ready
the page will be rendering for some time before the ready event is fired - it fires .when the whole page is read parsing and the whole dom is construct

2394618
sql-server	mysql	hsqldb	mysql
the production and test databases are sql-server 2005 dev s use mysql and unit tests run against an hsqldb in-memory database

2394629
ruby	php
i have used capistrano for ruby and cruisecontrol.net for java but i have never used anything for php

2394634
dictionary	arrays
the result-of the parsing is not an arrays it s a dictionary whose key are completed_in max_id etc

2394634
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
if you meant to loops on the arrays of result dictionary then ask the dictionary that the json parsing returned to you for the object for the key results

2394634
dictionary	arrays
that object will be the arrays of dictionary

2394649
getter	setter
you must implements the properties getter and setter by hand.

2394672
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but not on firefox nor ie

2394723
parentheses	keyword
where s the new keyword the comma and why is there a pair of parentheses

2394724
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have written a asp.net page no webforms no asp.net-mvc which accept a xml .post and it generator a long text file based on a set of simple but not too simple rules

2394761
command-prompt	cmd
i tried both cmd in the command-prompt they both work fine but the latter one fails .when i try it with the runtime.exec

2394772
codesniffer	phpdoc
no idea if it s any help but if codesniffer can points out the functions methods then a decent php ide i offer phped can easily inspect and scaffolding the phpdoc comments for each function

2394788
put	get
the first is that if you put those int back together you ll get

2394807
animation	rotation	diagonal	z-axis
i ve managed to create an animation that flips the piece around its orthogonal axis but .when i try to flip it around a diagonal axis by changing the rotation around the z-axis the actual image also gets rotated not surprisingly

2394808
contains	elements
the bottom of the arrays contains somewhat randomized elements but the permutation you get of them is not uniformly distribute

2394833
self-extracting	dotnetzip
dotnetzip creates a dynamic assembly .when saving a self-extracting archive

2394833
value	field
in xmlserializer the basic idea is to enumerate through a types s public field and properties and then emit an xml document that contains the value from those field and props

2394851
contains	set
also your itemsetmap object should contains set object rather than pointers - there is absolutely no reason to store pointers in them

2394862
default	reset
yes the service is complex and takes time to complete but the same operation works perfectly for hours and during the next run and the next run all default reset but once in a while i get a the thread was aborted messages and i can t figure it out

2394864
groovy	java
i would take apart a simple grails .app .war and see if it required anything special .xml to run if not that you just have to package java and groovy binary files in a single .war

2394874
jquery	.post
i think it should work but i m still new to jquery .so i ll .post the possibility checked it and then amend if necessary

2394890
google-chrome	firefox
eta 3 current tests indicate a speed savings using offsetwidth rather than getcalculatedstyle currentstyle of 2ms 1.8 in google-chrome and 24ms 4.3 in firefox which isn t the 10 i wanted for a solid bounty win

2394902
hmisc	spss
as usual i got some spss file that i ve import into r with spss.get function from hmisc package

2394933
exception-handling	try-catch
you catch exception-handling with a try-catch block

2394940
authentication	login
the server application has user object that i want to use for authentication with the asp.net login controls etc

2394949
32-bit	64bit
a void pointers is still a void pointers in both 32-bit and 64bit though the 32-bit versioning occupies half the spaces of the 64bit versioning

2394949
32-bit	64bit
generally you can deal with many of the 32-bit to 64bit issues by ensuring that you don t do types punning between int and pointers

2394949
inlining	inline
there isn t much you can do about that except not request inlining of functions that cannot be inline

2394956
for-loop	arrays
i have code in java that should make multiple object within a for-loop then add each object into an arrays

2394956
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	arrays	loops
however the code just copies the same which is the last in the for-loop object into each index i in the arrays once loops ends

2394965
postback	ajax
you could also do this with traditional postback it doesn t have to be ajax

2394969
short	zero
you are starting from the second elements in your arrays since the first one is zero and ending one early because the and the -1 each make you stop one short of .length for a total of 2 short and since the arrays is zero based you only want to stop one short

2394995
hide	show
this might be an artifact of the hide show animation since you use a duration

2394995
slidedown	slideup
if you try a different animation like slideup slidedown it works fine

2394996
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and this html5 vedio can be show on firefox and google-chrome but not safari

2395009
contains	elements
about your problem i am not sure how all the generator object would be the same except if your filelist arrays contains the same elements in all positioning

2395026
contains	elements
if you get a nullpointerexception in loops it is most likely because either filelist is null or it contains a null elements

2395033
logout	login
each user can login do some operations and logout

2395068
updating	updates
-allow updating of field changed .when users edit them user may updates 60 recording a minute

2395092
any	set
using this you can set any ip or mac-address

2395107
click	mouse
this has been bothering me lately- .when i use some code like below to increase selection every mouse click

2395129
digits	base
this is why the above approach works it sets the least-significant digits of the numbers in base n to 0

2395129
digits	base
another way of zeroing the lsd is to subtract the remainder to set the least significant base n digits to 0 as jeras does in his comment

2395139
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	solaris	netbsd	solaris	linux	solaris	freebsd	netbsd	linux
.when you talk about kernel for unix-y operating systemd like linux solaris mac os x netbsd freebsd etc

2395149
environment	building
all as far as i can tell of the building settings are documented in the xcode building setting reference although some of these are more useful as output environment to a shell scripting phase than as input actual settings

2395151
any	set
if your queries are always against the set field and not the custom field then any database would do assuming you keep the custom field in blob format xml for example

2395157
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
i want to know what are the advantages of python over php ruby

2395159
freebsd	bsd	unix	bsd
src unix you can confirm this by reading lions commentary on unix or the bsd 4.4-lite which is similar to bsd .net 2 which is available in tarball or via cvs from freebsd

2395186
postgresql	mysql
2008 postgresql since versioning 8.2 mysql and h2

2395191
double-quotes	spaces
remove the double-quotes around and see what happens .when the directory whose contents you are listing contains filenames with spaces in them

2395194
required	checked
you probably want to checked the webserver s php-ini configuration against your local php-ini to see if there is any modules not loaded on the webserver which may be required in your php application

2395200
arrays	loops
outside loops the input can be used by accessing the addresses arrays

2395201
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework apps will run on the .net desktop framework

2395216
malloc	free
i can t just iterate over every key-value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395216
malloc	strdup
in points one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395220
subproject	libs
if you want to continue to maintain them as fully encapsulated subproject i would suggest getting them to building individually and combining them as libs rather than combining the source

2395222
command-line	cmd
the command-line utility can be run as sqlite3 on the mac and this gives you an interactive session where you can run sql cmd

2395225
jquery	.post
alternatively you could technically use another editor and .post the data back to sharepoint using spapi or jquery + sharepoint web-services

2395237
hashtable	set
to implements a hashtable we need a set of buckets

2395250
webserver	upload
there has got to be someway to upload sql-server to a webserver without a lot of drama

2395253
derived-class	base-class
i have an edit page that has the base-class as the data-class and it would show different editor form depending on which derived-class the model is

2395253
derived-class	base-class
the model here only holds value for the base-class and cannot be cast back to the derived-class

2395257
decimal	octal
each succeeding i reads and converts one int using the normals c-style conventions that if the numbers starts with 0x it ll be converted as hexadecimal otherwise if there s a leading 0 it ll be converted as octal and otherwise it ll be converted as decimal

2395263
malloc	free
i can t just iterate over every key-value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395263
malloc	strdup
in points one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395269
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the underlying problem is that you are using a new objectoutputstream to write to an existing objectinputstream that you have already used a prior objectoutputstream to write to

2395279
parentheses	operators
edit i thought of this for an infix expression of four operators without parentheses since a comment on the original question said that parentheses were added for the sake of an example for clarity

2395283
subclassing	inherited
prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contains a complex properties with all the common field

2395285
arrays	loops
you can of course printing it all in a foreach loops if you ve the checkbox labels and initial value in an assocative arrays

2395297
required	checked
in form a s onclosing event checked to see if the required info has been filled out and cancel the event if not

2395301
widget	button
you probably want a graphics view to do it right but if you don t care about performance you might be able to get by with just setting the pos on a bunch of button to move them around on a widget without a layout

2395307
typename	auto
since c++11 you can use auto to avoid specifying a very long complicated typename of the iterator as seen before or even more complex

2395322
selected	button
in internet service manager right click on default website selected properties in home-directory press the configuration button

2395331
font-size	height
you can use whatever you want to get the height but font-size makes the most sense

2395351
any	set
in any case set last_value to the current value and loops

2395355
libjpeg	libpng
i m trying to compile a project that uses both libjpeg and libpng

2395355
libpng	zlib
i know that libpng needs zlib .so i compiled all the three independently and put them libjpeg.a libpng.a and libz.a on a folder called linrel32

2395357
directory	folder
just put it in the working directory or system32 folder

2395371
libpng	zlib
.so it pull the code from libpng and since it makes call to zlib now there are references to the zlib functions

2395372
scheme	lisp
i stumbled upon this question while searching for circular lists lisp scheme

2395372
contains	elements
next go to the last elements the 3 in this case and replace the cdr which currently contains nil with a pointers to itself

2395380
order	add
in general order isn t important as long as you add all the components to the panelsls and the panelsls is added to the content panels before you make the frame visible

2395381
order	add
the order of constructing and adding items isn t important except that .when you add children you should add them in the order you want them in the panels

2395395
tokenize	parsing
secondly it s a non-trivial form to parsing and would required a lexer or using the php tokenize which is much more work than it s worth

2395403

2395423
decrement	increment
in c operation associativity is as such for increment decrement and assignment

2395425
directory	folder
if that s not an option you can use a virtual directory on each machine that points to one folder on one of the machines but then you lose redundancy

2395428
scheme	lisp
i note that scheme and lisp i guess support circular lists and i have used circular lists in c++ to simplify the insert and deletion of elements but what are they good for

2395432
scheme	lisp
for example a double linked-list data structure is circular in the scheme lisp points of view if you try to printing the cons-structure out you get backreferences cycles

2395432
scheme	lisp
.so it s not really about having data-structures that look like ring any data structure where you have .some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective

2395432
scheme	lisp
that s the killer feature of double linked lists which are circular in the scheme lisp context

2395433
contains	elements
assuming jdata contains the json data the following will replace document elements

2395435
directory	folder
.when deploying the .app you need to copy the qt libs it links against to the .application folder on windows or you need to copy them to the .app directory and launchd it via a wr.apper scripting which adds that directory to ld_library_path on linux.

2395443
contains	any
for question 3 django allows you the ability to specify a user .profile model that can contains any extra information you want

2395445
operator-precedence	associativity
operator-precedence and associativity does not tell you what happens-before and what happens after

2395445
operator-precedence	associativity
operator-precedence associativity has nothing to do with it

2395445
operator-precedence	associativity	operator-precedence	operands	associativity	operands
operator-precedence associativity simply tells you which operands belong to which operators

2395445
operator-precedence	associativity
operator-precedence associativity is this case simply tells you that the latter interpretation is correct and the former is incorrect ++ applies to b and not to the result-of

2395445
operator-precedence	associativity
operator-precedence associativity once again has noting to do with what happens first and what happens next

2395465
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a write only file in c on linux ubuntu

the line employer should appear only .when person is employed controlled by boolean variables person.isemployed

2395622
turbogears	django
webcore and turbogears utilize standards wsgi middleware layer and provide helpful accessor for shared features while django takes the â œbatteries includedâ approach

2395630
temporary	rvalue
the problem is that a+a returns a so-called rvalue basically a fancy term for a temporary

2395658

lately i ve been diving into network-programming and i m having some difficulty constructing a packets with a variables data properties

2395724
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2395741
udp	tcp
basically if you need guaranteed inorder delivery of your data than you are going to re-implement tcp on top of udp

2395741
udp	tcp
if the only reason you use udp is latency then you can probably use tcp and disable the nagle algorithm

2395741
udp	tcp
i would recommend steven s unix network-programming which has a section on advanced udp and .when it s appropriate to use udp instead of tcp

2395760
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
the copy-constructor creates a shallow-copy of the nodes

2395770
callback	methods
neither my calling code see above or my callback methods have the opportunity to see the exception-handling

2395781

display	width
on a page i have display 100 images which have the width

2395940
schema	rdbms
if your rdbms datamodel or schema is very different from your excel spreadsheet however then some translation would of course have to take place via scripting or xslt

2395956

2395959
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i don t know enough about the internal row-versioninging mechanisms of mysql or indeed if there is one but other databases oracle postgresql and more recently sql-server have invested a lot of effort into allowing writer to not block readers in .so far as readers have access to the versioning of the rows that existed immediately before the updates write process started

2395965
duplicates	contains
map cannot contains duplicates key

2395965
order	add
you would use an arraylist .when you want to keep things in sorted order the order they are added or indeed the positioning within the list that you specify .when you add the object

key-value	key
there are however other classes in the java-api that can provide this linkedhashmap which as well as using a hashtable to store the key-value pairs al.so maintains a list linked-list of the key in the order they were added .so you can always access the items again in the order they were added if needed

2395975
directory	folder
you can add in your current java project a linked folder points to that new directory

2395975

2396060
json	xml
i think we have benefits on using all benefits of json format vs xml

2396060
json	xml
json is well suited to data-interchange than xml

2396060
json	xml
json is much simpler than xml

i have arrays of 3 elements and i want to shift its elements to the right and replace the shifted index cell with shifted string and this should loops until all the cell has shifted string

2396666
contains	elements
but since all elements contains the same thing in the end why don t you just assign them directly without all the shifting

2396669
arrays	loops
the outer loopss iterates n 3 time and inner loops starts at the end of the arrays and copies n-1 th elements to nth positioning

2396670
contains	elements
if you strictly need to store items by index you ll have to use a simple list and create your own add methods that checked contains on each elements before adding it to the underlying list

linux	osx
linux osx you have to export variables with export cmd or by using a .profile file in user directory

2396819
linux	osx
one note on osx and maybe linux too you have to split paths in path variables with double colon instead that semicolon

2396821
access-control	authentication
some more details on this aspects would be good because if your access-control is flawed then the quality of your authentication doesn t matter too much

use firebug add-on in firefox google-chrome to see load-time for resources

2396945
value	field
if the way you determine whether or not an entity has a .profile is a deterministic function and doesn t required any access to another table you could write a stored function and defined a computed persistent field which would store that value for you and not have to re-compute it over and over again

as others have said flyweight is one way of making object smaller if they contains duplicates data which can be shared

2397275
duplicates	contains
if your millions of object don t contains duplicates data forget about it

2397275
virtual-functions	member-functions	member-functions	inline
if your design is simplified by having 27 virtual member-functions each of which is called once a month but ensuring that the 2 functions that are called millions of time a second can be inline by the caller then there s no need to avoid virtual-functions

2397280
attributes	properties
however as i m learning this new tool it would be helpful to know if there is a way to tag a properties with an attributes to suppress the code-generation

oodbms	rdbms
then came jdo which is a datastore agnostic standards for object persistent can be used with rdbms oodbms xml excel ldap

2397337
oodbms	rdbms
but while there are several open-source implementation and while jdo has been adopted by small independent vendors mostly oodbms vendors hoping that jdo users would later switching from their rdbms datastore to an oodbms - but this obviously never happened it failed at being adopted by big java ee player and users because of weaving which was a pain at development time and scaring some customers of a weird query api of being actually too abstract

show	next
if i use the dropdownlistfor to display 50 recording then 50 show up but still no paging icons to get me to the next 50

2397866
sql-server	mysql
in sql-server you do not need to specify a value for identity columns i m guessing this is what the null in mysql is doing

2397878
hide	show
here is an alternative methods using jquery which would also slideup down on show hide

2397878
hide	show
and finally here is the javascript to setup the close button and functions to show and hide the messages bar

2397902
http	ssl
i could run the repository through plain http but would like ssl for outside communication

2397957
click	mouse
in your mouse click handler you can go through the list and checked for each of the circles whether the mouse is within the circle

2397964
background-image	transparency
if you want it to still behave like an image layout-wise you could get your hands dirty with inline-block and a matrix of browser incompatibilities or you could simply use a transparency image with a background-image on that

2397990
cassini	iis
the location for what you are looking for is in the solution file of your solution open the sln send to notepad you will see what i mean you can hardcode the ports if you are using the built-in webserver cassini or you can ports it all to your local iis which is what i do

2398001
put	get
the only work around is to put the caching code inside the load of each object and to loops all properties from the caching object to get the value and to set it back to the real object

2398002
hash	md5
if you can have a third db field like the one above do a varchar 32 that is unique that is an md5 hash of the first two

2398010

windows-xp	windows
windows-xp and windows 2000 anyone can consume real time events

2398042
hide	show
i create a menu and i show and hide submenu on jquery via hover event like following code

2398042
hide	show
is any way submenu show or hide after some milisecond mouse stay over them

2398064
arrays	loops
basically you are emptying the arrays before trying to iterate over it with foreach -- .so foreach will not loops at all as you are giving it an empty arrays

2398074
fragment-shader	vertex-shader
the varying qualifier is equivalent to the input of a fragment-shader or the output of a vertex-shader

2398079
contains	elements
if height and width both have computed value of auto and the elements has an intrinsics ratio but no intrinsics height or width and the contains block s width does not itself depend on the replace elements s width then the used value of width is calculated from the constraint equation used for block-level non-replace elementss in normals flow

2398092
jquery	.post
is caching a default properties of jquery ajax .post request

2398096
processor	cpu
.when you call a opengl function it will either calculate on the cpu or on the gpu graphics card s processor

2398176
ironpython	ironruby
languages such as ironpython and ironruby used an additional layer on top the clr to allow all the wonderful dynamic features

2398182
user-input	output
i cleaned it up a bit and this is the smallest i can make it and still have user-input and a nice readable output

2398183
realloc	malloc
on program start it begins as null and i then malloc realloc as i need to add remove these structures and i was just gonna use my pointsers to points at the first structure and move through it like an arrays

2398183
realloc	malloc
.when i malloc realloc i always make the size of the arrays area in memory one larger than it needs to be

2398183
arrays	loops
what i was hoping i could do was loops through my arrays area of memory and say if its not null then do something with it

2398186
lookup	any
this lookup whether or not the named is a types has no influence on the meaning of the named in later phases it won t yet bind the named to any declaration

2398188
hide	show
start debugging and windows move show hide inorder to be in the same positioning as the last debugging session

2398192
groovy	java	ruby	php
i have been a developer for 10 years and used languages like javascript java groovy ruby c php objective-c etc

2398195
c++	lua
this one implements oop for lua and can map classes and data types from lua back to c++

2398215
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	tree
personally i would handle this issue if i understand it correctly by either allocation a second arrays of pointers to the structures or by just keeping tracking of how many i have or most likely by using a collections such as a linked-list or tree that is something with more graceful expansion operations than realloc

2398216
filesystems	fat
using fat for example but most other filesystems have at least some degree of similarity you could go in and directly manipulate the fat

2398216
filesystems	fat
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

2398221
getter	setter
unfortunately there is no way to shorten what you have automatically implements properties must have empty getter and setter blocks to be syntactically correct

2398237
contains	any
this function parsing a url and returns an associativity arrays contains any of the various components of the url that are present

2398246
any	set
however it cannot perform any process in either the get or set accessor by definition really

2398254
primitive	int
that s a general pattern for comparing object rather than using like you do for primitive like int or floats

2398257
subclassing	inherited
.so each subclassing will be run a individual with it-setup methods and al.so all inherited test-methodss

2398260
getter	setter
the getter references itself as andrew points out but the setter is also wrong

2398272
32-bit	16-bit
you should use long .when you need at least a 32-bit int because int is only guaranteed to be at least 16-bit

2398273
getter	setter
a properties cannot hold any data it is just a pair of a getter methods and a setter methods there are also properties which only have getter or setter

2398273
return-value	arguments	getter	setter
the getter methods is basically a methods which takes no argumentss and returns a value of the properties s types the setter on the other hand is a methods with no return-value and an arguments of the properties s types called value

2398273
value	field	implements	extends
please be al.so aware that the c# compiler will create a backing field automatically .so basically both ways are the same but you gain more flexibility with the first because with automatically implements properties you cannot add more complex behavior than just simple setting and retrieving of value at least in the class where you declare it making it virtual opens possibilites to extends properties logic in subclasses..

2398274
value	field
remember that properties are really methods - they compiler will convert them to t get_property and set_property t value call - there is no storage unless using automatic proprieties but what happens there is the compiler creates a backing field automatically

2398281
show	next
instead of storing errors in arrays then show a list of errors in some of my forms i would like to show them next to the input-field

2398286
json	xml
you building a useful .app for flex and air use cairngorm adobe s supported flex .application framework but people seem to enjoy using others like mate and swiz connect to a backend with xml json and amf and building useful cms-like interfaces all using design-patterns

2398304
multiplication	division
also the code that is setting x1 y1 etc are you casting to floats before doing division multiplication etc

2398323
httpwebrequest	webrequest
at a guess without knowing the specific error messages or path you could try casting the webrequest to a httpwebrequest and then setting the webproxy

2398339
contains	any	contains	elements
i m only interested in elements that contains a text nodes or any descendant elements with text nodess

2398354
selection	cell
how do i add a multiple selection list to an excel spredsheet in each cell of one column

2398363
oracle	mysql
in oracle i would probably play with grouping having rownum 10 but i do not think mysql supports that

2398365
implements	extends
you could either implements an interface or extends something like a plane class

2398374
difference	zero
you ll notice a difference with the output in that previously your zero file would have been image0.off with the others image0.x.off whereas now it s image0.0.off

2398427
double	int
assume the numbers being represented is larger than the systemd can handle as an actual numbers an int or a double etc

2398427
binary	hex
i m open to a solution for any base n which satisfies the above criterion binary hex ...

2398430

use beautifulsoup as a tree builder for html5lib

2398447
ubuntu	linux
i ve downloading latest linux source package from the ubuntu repository and found the mentioned source files with minor directory and file named changes

2398453
callback	methods
unfortunately view object does not have any callback methods as the activity .when going from background and active mode

2398453
put	get
anyway if you insist on such an approach i guess the closest you get is to put the init code into the constructor and the destruct code into an overrides of finalize

2398453
.when	ready
though the finalize methods is runned by the systemd .when the object is not referred to anymore making it ready to be garbage collected

2398467
ftp	ssh
anyway if you look at the protocols it s ftp tunneled through ssh

2398467
ftps	ftp
if you are only using the pi as a middleware within the company or you don t have any ftp service which is accessible from outside it s a good chance to switching to ftps

2398474
boolean	int
it should only output json native types e.g strings int boolean and lists

2398475
fadein	show
note that you need to use fadein 0 instead of show because show isn t something that goes on the fx queue and delay will therefore have no effect.

2398493
attributes	properties
your issue may be occurring because you re releasing a view thats retained by a properties with the retain attributes

2398496
children	nodes
also if you want xpath to selected a nodes from withing the current context among the children of the current nodes you should use the . context selectedor

2398505
configuration	environment
if it doesn t activate the logs on production .so you can see where the error is exactly you can do this on the configuration environment production.rb file

2398506
exp	pow
the same is true for exp and double pow i don t see anyone complaining. this is incorrect

2398506
exp	pow
let s leave aside exp because that s beside the points though it would actually make my case stronger and focus on double pow double x double y

2398508
contains	any
what i m trying to do is to convert a string into a link if any words contains the percentage character

2398528
mobile-safari	safari
i ve tried document.myform.mytextarea.focus which works in regular safari but it does not seem to work in mobile-safari

2398541
floating	margins
the margins is working just fine but it s not between the floating elementss and tbe button it s between the floating elements s parent elements and the button

2398541
floating	overlap	floating	margins	overlap	margins
the parent elements doesn t have any non-floating elementss .so it s height is zero and the floating elementss overlap the margins

2398570
implements	abstract
my first idea would be to declare parsesomething in an abstract-base-class with the methods that are different for each class declare as abstract and implements in the subclassing

2398612
treeview	gridview
the gridview wont pick up elements for columns it works off attributes instead and wierdly the treeview control works off elements not attributes

2398660
children	nodes
a child recording can have a parent recording selected from a nodes reference field this is optional -- i can have parent-less children as well

2398660
assign	add
what i need to be able to do is add a filtering to this view to effectively say only show the child nodes that are assign to the parent being display on this page.

2398671
contains	any	contains	elements
the idea is that .when you re mousing over any elements that can contains text it should highlighting with a lighting gray background to indicate the boundaries of that elements

2398680
selected	cell
.when a cell is selected your table view delegation will get sent a messages

2398682
defined	declare
it s complaining that a member function already defined or declare

2398702
pixels	line
then from that scan a half semicircle and get the coordinates of every pixels of the image that the orange line passes

2398766
javascript	dom
i only want to get the value of fullname maybe with some javascript regex or some jquery dom parsing i know i can do it easily with php but i want it using javascript or jquery

2398772
required	checked
if you required a login on your form and also actually checked on that then the above will of course only be successfully execute if the unaware user has recently logged in your website but not logged out yet or the session is not expired yet

2398791
double	int
can someone explain why the casting from double float to int works correctly in the first case and does not work .when done in printf

2398797
instances	self
.when add is invoked on an instances object the instances object is passed as the self arguments to the methods

2398797
instances	self
having the self arguments differentiates class methods from instances methods

2398799
selected	cell
in the code below random cell were selected to display images

2398834
value	field
field properties with differing value are marked as dirty

2398852
double	int
if you pass it a double value and specify an int format specifier like d printf will take that double value and blindly reinterpret it an an int

2398866
telnet	ssh
you would probably make sure you can connect from the server to gmail server using ssh and trying with telnet first if that test is ok try with php

2398877
arguments	undefined
however in handleoverlay assuming that the first arguments is the nodes the second arguments is undefined prior to the on methods and then null after instead of contains the object passed to it

2398877
mouseover	mouseout
te undefined prior to the mouseover and null after the mouseout

2398889
value	field
i need to detection .when some of the field of certain model have changed in the admin to later send notifications depending on which field changed and previous current value of those field

2398889
value	field
i tried using a modelform and overrides the save methods but the form s self.cleaned_data and seld.instance already have the new value of the field

2398918
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
in most realities malloc and memset or calloc which effectively does the same will suit your needs

2398925
.net	wcf
if you need to go wcf try your best to hold out for the versioning that ships with .net 4 of the framework it seems to have been revamped

2398943
payment	billing
an example of this would be to use the authorize.net customer information manager cim api to store customer billing information including their credit-card information and then have a crontab that periodically polls the database and .when a user meets the criterion for a payment calculate the proper amount and then use the cim api to process their credit-card

2398949
getter	setter
isn t a properties just a getter and a setter

2398953
managed-code	c++-cli
c++-cli catches managed exception-handling types in both native and managed-code clr forces the eha compiler option

2398953
managed-code	c++-cli
you can t run managed-code in kernel-mode regardless of what compiler you use c++-cli changes nothing in this area

2398958
pyqt	gtk
i ve found tutorials for c and qt and for python and gtk but nothing for this combo of pyqt and gstreamer

2398958
overlay	widget
what i need is to get the overlay working .so it s display within a widget on my gui

2398965
input-field	fieldset	input-field	checkbox
in a very simple test i placed a fieldset and dropped a checkbox and a text input-field onto it

2398976

synchronous	.when
if the cmd are sent synchronous no new one is sent out until the last one is known to be received then the user may need a means to a force out the next cmd without waiting for a reply from the previous in case the reply was lost and b cancel a queue cmd in case conditional change between .when a cmd was created and sent

2398989
tracking	robot
a lack of conflict resolution complicates your user-interface because the users may have to tracking all cmd sent to understand why the robot is behaving like it is

2398989
positioning	slider
there are two standards gui controls radio button and slider that accomplish such positioning coding

2398989
positioning	slider
users can re-send a commanded value at any time by re-clicking on the appropriate slider positioning or radio-button

2398989
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button	value	field
i would favor field controls like textbox checkbox and dropdown menus rather than cmd button .so that the cmded value is clearly show

2398989
textbox	button
continuous numeric attributes may include spinner button with the textbox if it doesnâ t end up clogging the queue with incremental cmd

probably the simplest option if you are going from windows - unix is the ant scp task which will use the same underlying types of connection putty uses -- ssh

2399098
factors	primes
all you need to do is find one factors of pnumber greater than 1 and less than pnumber to prove it s not primes -- no points in searching further

2399098
factors	primes
actually even if you get to the square root of pnumber without finding one it s primes since if it has a factors greater than that it should have a factors less than that

2399103

2399524
python	java	python	c++
if you want to become programmer and earn money you need to at least pick up c++ java or c# after python

2399526
linux	unix
c is the language of many operating systemd including unix linux and windows

2399526
python	java	python	php	python	c++
initially you should master c language and gain a little practical knowledge of python as well.once you are comfortable with c then it will be quite easier for you to program in c++ c# java and php

2399527
pascal	basic
yet many of them including in this older generator first learned one or several other languages typically ones with a higher level of abstraction basic lisp pascal to named a few before learning c

2399534
pointers	stack
if only a 4-byte return address and 4-byte frame pointers need to be pushed 8 additional bytes are needed to keep stack aligned to a 16-byte boundary

2399545
attributes	properties
the issue may be that setting the attributes is not automatically interpreter by your browser as changing the dom properties

2399545
attributes	properties
this is a bit confusing but on browsers like firefox etc html attributess and dom properties are stored separately most are named the same but there are exception-handling - such as the class attributes being represented by the classname properties

2399545
attributes	properties
changing properties affects the behavior of the elements while attributes do not always have the same effect - on some browsers they are only parsing during initial rendering

2399549
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
create qgraphicsview object to your widget and added a qgraphicsscene to view

32-bit	64bit
i am trying to building a 64bit binary from c++ code using 32-bit g++ compiler

2399593
32-bit	64bit
is it ok to building 64bit binaries using 32-bit g++ compiler on aix 5.2

2399593
32-bit	64bit
will this 64bit libstdc++ work with 32-bit g++ compiler

2399593
g++	gcc
following are the versioning of gcc g++ i am using

2399593
g++	gcc
since gcc and g++ are configure built with --disable-aix64 there are no 64bit std libs available ex libstdc++

2399593
g++	gcc
how can i building 64bit libstdc++ which should work with gcc g++ 4.1.1

2399593
g++	gcc
do i need to rebuild gcc and g++ without the --disable-aix64 flag

2399596
click	mouse
on mouse click you don t draw

2399602
put	get
i would agree that it s probably an issue with trying to get the id of the elements since the elements s id changes at runtime .when you put it inside a user-controls

2399606
highlight	cell
leaving a table cell highlight after a return from a detail view has been condemned by apple and will be jarring to users unless you have a really good reason for it

2399628
constructor	object
the constructor should put the object into a usable state even if that state is a flag meaning it hasn t yet been initializer -

2399638
32-bit	64bit
as long as the relevant 64bit libs are available on the machine it should not matter whether your g++ is itself a 32-bit or a 64bit binary - it should be able to generator both 32-bit and 64bit object-files and shared-libs and executable etc

2399638
g++	gcc
be aware that gcc or g++ uses a different name-mangling scheme from other compilers quite deliberately - because it does various things such as exception-handling class layout and the like differently from other compilers

2399638
32-bit	64bit
you don t have mismatched 32-bit vs 64bit object-files or libs or whatever

2399642
processor	cpu
in either situation make sure that your main thread yield processor time to the running threads else your wait loops will consume most all the cpu and starve your worker threads

2399652
constructor	object	default	reset
you can have an init function which the constructor can call inside for keeping the code tidy or for the object to call if you implements a reset but from experiences it is better to delete an object and recreate it rather than try to reset its value to default unless the object is created and destroy many time real-time say particle effects

2399652
constructor	object
otherwise i think constructor are meant to do what they are supposed to do - prepare an object for its initial state of execution important for object creation is resource allocation

2399657
logout	login
how can i change the user named after each login logout action while keeping a long cache-control

2399659
constructor	object
if your constructor are full of real work that usually means the object can only be initializer within a fully initializer running application

2399742
contains	any
there is a string inside which contains any non white spaces characters

2399776
fortran	cython
for example if you have some performance issues with python you can explore writing some parts of your code in c or pyrex cython or fortran etc... and then packaging it up and making it usable in your python code

2399776
python	c++
i think it is a good practice and writing algorithms on paper in python is a lot of time more convenient than writing them in c or c++ not always

2399795
python	java
there are also tools to detection duplicates code clones for many languages including python java pl sql from your list

2399820
invoices	product
the invoicesitems are linked to actual product by a reverse id the fk is on the product not the invoices item to allow different item types different tables but i think i m going to switching that around

2399821
sourcegear-vault	git
i used to use sourcegear-vault but seeing that git is getting alot of attention i might as well familiarize myself with it

2399826

centering	fixed
without a fixed height you cannot centering the div vertically without javascript

2399879
invoices	product
open item account is good for complex billing process for example .when only some of the product are attached to certain invoices

2399879
invoices	product
for example a builder buys a few dozen product but they are to be invoices separately to three different building project

2399879
invoices	product
client gets an invoices created .when buying product

2399879
invoices	product
for each product bought an invoices item is created for that product showing the quantity bought and the amount

2399879
invoices	product
interest charges are raised on the next invoices or a separate invoices as an invoices item this can be a custom product

2399894
rvm	gem
another common cause of this is that haml is install as a gem in one rvm environment but not the one in which the ruby-on-rails .app is being run

2399895
web-config	app-config
app-config or web-config this looks and behaves as a plain text document

you can alleviate this problem a by removing the mouse keyboard and the screens and only access the build-server through rdp or something similar

2399986
contains	elements
it s clear that each line can t contains more elements than an upper bound because they eventually become -1 and don t get stored and each line only depends on the previous one

2399986
haskell	c++
i have a very efficient implementation in c++ but i am really wondering if there is a way to get it done in haskell too

2399994
