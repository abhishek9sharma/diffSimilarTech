what is the difference between memmove and memcpy

1201334
directory	folder
i typically will have a process folder that way i can grant proper permissions just to that directory

key-value	key
in other words .when storing many key-value pairs related to a recording is it better to store each key-value pair in a separate row with with the recording_id as a key or to have one row per recording_id with a column for each key

1201592
javascript	dom
.so .when the javascript is fetched with ajax or .something it can be eval d from there but it would never have to be inject into the dom

1201603

the best way is to wrap try-catch blocks around the methods in the service you can afford to let throw exception-handling

1201611
margins	padding
1 - all browsers have their own base marginss etc for elementss .so it s a good idea to use .some .sort of css-reset which makes every margins padding 0 .so that .when you specify it with your own css every browser interpreter the same amount of margins padding for an elements

1201611
contains	elements	contains	set
it s usually best to let the internal elementss set the height and just let the contains elements flow naturally

1201618
textbox	button
on that page i have a simple textbox a labels and a button

i want to know if is possible to develop a java wrapper to call a specific code written in perl or python

1201630
key-value	key
if you are storing key-value pairs you should have a table with two columns one for the key make this the pk for the table and one for the value probably don t need this indexed at all

1201638
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the following example was tested and works in both firefox and ie and i would assume to work in google-chrome safari and opera as well

1201644
python	java
there s something i used a while back called jython which allows you to execute python code from java

1201645
python	java

1201744
sequences	unique
they want to take a product category camera that of course no one expects to be unique and then make it unique by tacking on a sequences numbers

1201744
sequences	unique
preferably make the sequences numbers unique across category .so it can be the primary key by itself but if necessary you can assign sequences numberss within the category

1201745
equals	getter	getter	setter
2 if your bean is just a value object with nothing much more than getter setter equals hashcode then consider using an aop framework i like spring to wrap the object with advices used to implements properties change events support

1201752
exception-handling	error-handling
the internal error-handling of the framework s asp.net-mvc components can only trap exception-handling not php errors

1201782
any	set
instead i would just set a timer with a low value like 0.1 and that should be sufficient enough to get the control updates without any noticeable delay to the user

1201803
dialog	pop-up
modal dialog to be implements using divs and css see yui have all the benefits of presenting an interface that users recognize from desktop applications and won t run afoul of pop-up blockers

value	field
.so my second option is to make a hierarchy with interfaces and abstract-class meaning that the value will not be stored in field but rather just returned by methods .when needed

1201855
difference	factors
but the difference is likely to be minor and frankly there are .so many factors in database-performance that this .sort of thing is hard to predict

1201877

web-services	api
3 .when i receive the response does the proxy class contains its state or do i have to still create a class to hold the state of the returned data from the api methods call response .when using web-services references

1202095
shared-objects	.so
.so i think your best bet is to use redundancy in your systemd use cookies flash-cookies shared-objects ip addresses perhaps in conjunction with user-agents and userid for people who are logged in

1202105
authentication	login
yes you can login in the background and it will keep your authentication as you copy links

1202116
solaris	linux
looks like it s a solaris server and not a linux

1202121
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of .net you need only modify the msbuildpath properties

1202124
json	xml
yes the general idea of an api is it uses a standards language like xml or json or whatever

1202166
attributes	properties
â properties sets the attributes

1202166
attributes	properties
in short the arguments i was passing into the methods were setting css properties the 4th arg instead of the attributes the 5th arg

1202171
account	userid
however in this case you ll have to get smtp account information from the user userid email-address passwd

1202171
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
if all you want is the body of the textbox and you don t care about the return email-address you can set up a simple mail re-sender web service there s tons of php ruby python code out there for sending email from a scripting

1202176
callback	methods	.when	ready
it is faster in a general way than the other methods of not wasting that time namely using threads because it will callback into your code .when i o is ready and not before

1202182
qabstractitemmodel	qmodelindex
the qmodelindex parent passed is not valid and m qabstractitemmodel is null

1202190
background-image	background-color
however .when there s a background-image pattern instead of a solid background-color this won t work

1202201
order	join
previously i could easily join the freetexttable result to the table it was searching order by the rank but only selected the columns of the original table that was searched

1202202
png	gif
in the thickbox module the main .js file thickbox.js does not account for image urls created in drupal via imageview 2321 preview instead of image.jpg or gif or png

1202202
png	gif
if thickbox.js does not see the file named itself gif jpg png jpeg in the link anchor tag the a href ... tag-it will treat the image like another mime types that is not an image

1202202
shadowbox	lightbox	shadowbox	thickbox	lightbox	thickbox
this causes thickbox to spit out god-awful garbage on top of your page instead of a cool shadowbox lightbox effect

1202230
fixtures	shoulda
i m using shoulda and fixtures

1202238
nsrunloop	nstimer
the nstimer actually just periodically fire events into the enclosing nsrunloop which each thread has or should have

1202238
nsrunloop	nstimer
.so if you have a child or background-process running in a different thread the nstimer will fire against that thread s nsrunloop instead of the application s main nsrunloop

1202251
contains	elements
i read a list of strings from a file and try to get a random 5 elements sample with random-sample but the resultung list only contains characters

1202273
design-time	designer
i have a control that i need to restrict the types of child controls that it can contains during design-time dragging a new control onto an existing control on the form designer

1202277
primitive-types	reference-type
non primitive-types are called java reference-type and they have named starting with capital letter

1202285
vary	etag
i ve tried many of these suggestions including adding an etag lastmodified date removing the vary header using fiddler and dozens of combinations of the cache-control and or pragma headers

1202287
versioning	migrate
what happens .when developer a adds his scripting and tries to migrate to the latest versioning since his scripting versioning based on the time stamp is less than the currently applied versioning now

1202301
any	set
i wondered about this as well and i was never able to find anything about any specific built-in configuration option you could set there may be one but i never found a mention of what it was

1202307
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
in both cases the trick to getting it working in ie opera safari and google-chrome is to replace the on the page

1202315
hash	md5
you can split your caching dir effectively by getting the md5 hash of the filename taking the first 1 2 or 3 characters of it and use it as a directory

1202319
hide	show
.when you add a web reference to the paypal web service visual-studio will create a file in a sub-folder of web references called reference.cs which is the proxy class by default vs 2008 hide it -- you have to show all files to see it

1202344
order	add
of course if two developers are working independently on tables that required no integration with one another as this case show since developer b didn t have to wait for developer a to run his migration developer a can simply add one to the timestamp of developer b s migration and it will be in proper order once again

1202363
hardware	monitor
i m currently developing a monitor application for some in-house hardware using net-snmp

1202366
selected	button
until now the user has to press the button .when it gets lighted selected

1202378
32-bit	64bit
.when a program is compiled in any cpu it means that it is architecture neutral - it can be run in both 64bit process or a 32-bit process

1202378
32-bit	x86
a program must be built with x86 mode if it has unmanaged 32-bit dependencies or if it has managed libs that are buit in x86

1202378
32-bit	64bit
however regardless of these rules if you built-in any cpu you should test thoroughly on both a 64bit platform and a 32-bit platform

1202398
ubuntu	debian
look on one of the debian or ubuntu admin forums -- things like fai et al have long used preseeding for debconf questions

1202399
vb.net	vba	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vba
in vbscript the code looks like this adjust as necessary if you re using vba vb.net or another language

1202400
directory	folder
however i am not being able to browse the files in the test folder it s showing a directory listing denied messages

1202412
uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem
in my testing it seems that using the selectedviewcontroller methods of uitabbarcontroller to set the current view does not updates the selectedindex properties the new view is display but the selected uitabbaritem is not changed

1202439
typedef	struct
you d be better off creating your own class or struct typedef to hold the additional information you want

1202448
hprof	jvm
is there a way to have hprof dump its cpu sample and memory allocation report every minute instead of at the termination of the jvm

1202451
servicecontract	datacontract
you should explicit specify a namespace uri on your servicecontract and datacontract see further below for comment

1202454
webforms	asp.net
eg your back office could use traditional asp.net webforms because you are not concerned with seo and other webby behavior as well as can guarantee what browsers and bandwidth capabilities you will have to deal with

1202461
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net has an api similar to excel and can read and write excel open xml xlsx document as well as excel 97-2003 xls document

1202486
profiling	debugging
the use of java 1.4 is a minor issue here since 1.4 s debugging interface is not great but some profiling still support it

1202514
attributes	properties
i ve decorated the properties with the passwdpropertiestext attributes but whenever i edit the web part it show the actual passwd rather than dots or asterisk

1202519
environment	execution
if you in your bash scripting export some environment variabless than this will be in the environment of process it is execution this since child-process derives all environment variables of process created it

1202521
lookup	any
i highly doubt or rather would really hope that any actual order process is not based off that value and rather from a lookup using the product id

1202531
subset	unique
a unique id of course is any subset of field in the row identifying a unique row

1202539
easymock	junit
that s likely to be my fault as i m quite new to erlang and quite addicted to junit easymock and java interfaces.

1202550
python	c++	python	java
it is written in cross-platform c with binding available for other languages c++ java python

1202565
knapsack-problem	np-complete
this is the knapsack-problem and it s np-complete

1202565
any	set
for any decent-sized problem set it s one of those lifetime-of-the-universe-to-solve problems

1202588
np-complete	subset-sum
this is the subset-sum problem which is np-complete

1202595
json	xml
should i return a json response or xml

1202598
combinations	dice
for each of those eight ways all possible combinations of the other 15 dice work

1202600
php-extension	imagick
another approach not using php would be to use imagick via the command-line and not as a php-extension like other people suggested

1202603
32-bit	x86
assemblies compiled with platform x86 will execute on the 32-bit clr running under wow64

1202603
platform	anycpu
executable compiled with the platform anycpu will execute on the 64bit clr

1202603
platform	anycpu
dlls compiled with the platform anycpu will execute on the same clr as the process into which it is being loaded

1202603
64bit	x86
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process

1202603
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
if x64 versioning of the dlls cannot be obtained the alternative is to run x86 dlls on a 32-bit wow64 process and do interprocess communication ipc back with the 64bit process

1202605
json	xml
if you re going to be using this in client side javascript then definitely don t use xml -- json is probably the way to go

1202612
uialertview	uiwebview
some people have indicated that there are issues with display a uialertview and creating a uiwebview .when the latter is created before the former

1202621
contains	set
in fact visual-studio and other tools like reflector locate xml .doc comments by searching through a set of well-known paths that contains xml .doc comment files

1202651
attributes	properties
the attributes only makes the text show up as asterisk .when viewed in the properties windows of visual-studio or any control thats is a propertiesgrid

1202675
contains	set
_post key or _request key should contains your value if the form action and methods are set properly

1202683
debian	linux
you can checked the source of linux file cmd git git.debian.net git debian file.git

1202708
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
firefox opera and google-chrome use these

1202714
typename	auto
2 can a concept which lists typename be auto

1202721
knapsack-problem	subset-sum
as the above members have said this is the subset-sum problem or knapsack-problem

1202742
contains	elements	contains	any
arrays any python sequences types contains conformable elements

1202747
attributes	properties
unfortunately it s not possible to configure a passwd properties to display as you wish with attributes decorations

1202750
assign	add
if the locale ids are different and you cannot change it on the new server then you can add a line to the session_onstart sub in the global.asa for the application that assign the correct locale id to session.lcid

1202758
cakephp	symfony
i d recommend you take a look at an existing asp.net-mvc framework - i use qcubed there are others - symfony zend cakephp

1202770
put	get
if you need a finite degree of precision ie two decimal places for field that represent money store it as an int anyway but multiplying it by whatever factors of 10 you need to get rid of the decimal .when you put it into the database and divide by the same .when you pull it back out

1202781
pointers	stack
a struct is stored directly on stack as opposed to object references which are pointers to memory the reference itself is in stack but the allocation is in stack

1202781
pointers	stack
a null reference simply means that the pointers in stack hasn t been initializer to a location in the heap

1202787
constructor	object
i suspect that a little refactoring can peel out some strategy object that would simplify this hierarchy and make the super-complex constructor go away

1202806
margins	padding
notice in the body i am setting the height to 100 as well as the padding to 0 and the margins to 0

1202812
inno-setup	nsis
for fast generator use a scripting install like nsis or inno-setup

1202828
freebsd	linux	solaris	openbsd	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
but it depends on what you mean by portable it supports archtectures x86 and powerpc oses linux freebsd openbsd solaris and macosx but .

1202830
typename	auto
2 yes a concept with typename members can be auto

1202851
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested it in ie6 ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

1202856
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
the radiobuttonlist and checkboxlist controls end up throw a nullreferenceexception during rendercontrolinternal obviously not my contribution

1202856
listbox	textbox
all other controls textbox listbox dropdowns custom composite-controls rendering fine

1202856
object-reference	instances
the exception-handling messages is object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1202857
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie firefox google-chrome safari at least don t know about others directly will modify this to be

1202868
division	modulo
the idea is to use division since modulo doesn t always give random results

1202907
http-get	put
instead of having verbs in your payload try to use for example the http-get .post put delete methods

1202909
radio-button	button	radio-button	textbox	textbox	button
i have a form with 5 textbox 1 radio-button grouping 4 radio-buttons and a submit button

1202913
environment	building
environment building the software package into an

1202918
value	field
now how do i get it to after a cell has been edited send an xmlhttprequest to the server with a few base parameters the row s id field the named of the column changed and the new value

1202926
airplane	wifi
for example the airplane mode setting show a uiswitch while the wifi setting has a text value adjacent to the disclosure symbols

1202936
key-value	key
.so once you ve extraction the key-value named you re interested in you can construct your key function

1202944
conditional	operators
technically the bare conditional test doesn t required an implicit-conversion to bool if you have an implementation of the true operators

1202945
compact-framework	.net
i have a stubborn communication issue with an application running on the .net compact-framework 3.5 on windows-mobile smartphones

1202950
exception-handling	try-catch
with a try-catch block surrounding the client code i got a different exception-handling

1202958
animation	rotation

1202966
python	ruby
i know much more about ruby at this points than i do python or lisp but you should know that i was a python person for quite a while before i switched

1202968
python	java
for python they re .py files and for java their .cmd call

1202995
contains	elements
my problem is that i am trying to positioning the pop-up using its actualwidth properties but this value appears fixed at the size of the root elements which contains the triggers and the pop-up .so if the pop-up is narrower it leaves an unsightly gap and if wider it overwrite the triggers

1202997
textbox	button
you might want to checked and see if you databinding on your button postback is not blanking out your textbox

1203007
project-management	scrum
i frequently follow a scrum approach to project-management and with that very little heavy documentation is ever generator

1203016
output	cat
like cat example.txt | less will output the file through a paginator

1203019
tiff	png
if a tiff is anything like a png the streaming does indeed need to be seekable

1203042
unsigned	zero
sure i could just force it to zero in the code if that ever happens but i d rather use a better methods like using a udouble unsigned double which doesn t exist in silverlight or even setting the min max value somewhere in the dependencyproperty

1203047
multiplication	division
here is a routine that does a bcd on a 32-bit numbers and doesn t required division or multiplication

1203062
dependency-injection	singleton
in fact we came up with something close to dependency-injection where a single methods acted as a factory for all our singleton

1203071
arrays	map
then use the parameter hello world in the views map reduce functions to find all the document that contains both hello and world in the tags arrays

1203074
function-calls	main
the code is below my main function-calls the makerequest on different urls

1203090
hide	show
i have it setup to show hide the uiscrollview if the user touches the small images

1203093
contains	set
don t use quirks-mode as you d prefer but set your contains background to be the same color or pattern

1203093
png	gif
.so for example if i have a gray navigation bar i d rendering a 256px by 1px in this case .solid gray png or gif i suppose and set that to be my body background with the repeat-y css parameter set for the body background

1203110
communication	messages
the settings are simply communication to the windows service using a series of wcf messages as the user changes them

1203141
nsmutablearray	nsarray
an nsarray nsmutablearray does store the items in a particular order

1203150
environment	building
i can .post the exact code in question but the fact that it was buildinging correctly stopped buildinging correctly and now refuses to building correctly makes me think this is not a problem with my code but rather some problem in the environment

1203150
environment	building
the release engineering fellow figured out how to get this to built-in his building environment .so it s currently ok

1203163
sqldatasource	gridview
if i bind gridview via datasource attributes to sqldatasource and set selectcommand and updatecommand attributess then everything works perfectly

1203167

it sounds like you re pushing a uitabbarcontroller onto a uinavigationcontroller

1203171
identity-column	sql-server
how do you get the identity-column value after an insert in sql-server compact 3.5

1203176
attributes	properties
without this attributes nhibernate fallback to default properties named id

1203185
any	set	terminate	timeout
is there any way to execute terminate methods on all the threads even if the thread is busy in my case busy means it s waiting for the data where the timeout set is about 30 sec .

1203193
loading	gif
i have a loading image gif that show up .when a user is waiting for a response to an action on a asp.net page

1203193
hide	show
i do have code that show hide the image

1203219
shutdown	exit
memory-leaks on shutdown are nothing to worry about - going to the trouble of freeing memory before returning control to the operating systemd is a waste of time and needlessly slows down application exit

1203219
terminate	timeout
introduce polling selected or equivalent with a timeout or other kind of interrupt so_rcvtimeo so_sndtimeo in what would otherwise be long-running blocking routines monitor the terminate properties

1203247
attributes	properties
there is no difference between the cssclass and class in asp.net other than the cssclass is a properties of the control and class is an attributes specified in the html

1203248
children	nodes	children	tree
i have .some data in a tree and i want to represent them in a graphical way with the root nodes in the middle of the stage his children displaced in a circle around him and .so on for every children around their parent

1203250
webserver	upload
the activex control active audio recording 2.0 claims to support recordinging audio and upload it to an asp.net webserver

1203378
overwrite	copying
you see .when you say passing data to the other program you might be a tricking the other process into copying what you put in front of it b tricking the other program into letting you overwrite its normally private memory or c some other approach

1203380
value	field
the following works i m just wondering if this is the correct approach to finding the latest value for each audit field

1203386
any	set
is there any good way to set the value of a securestring to a constants value before compile-time and have that value be scrambled

1203389
dictionary	map
instead of operations that would change a dictionary maps provide operations which return a new map which is the result-of whatever change was requested

1203389
dictionary	map
that said the immutable aspects of the map may allow you to use it in situations where the dictionary would instead required more complex locking or to write more elegant code with fewer side-effects and thus it remains a useful alternative

1203392
dto	dao
poco plain old clr object normals clr object doesn t use any attributes or required inherited to act as a dao dto

1203392
dto	dao
.so a regular workflow would be to request data from a service which is sent to your .app as a dto you convert it to a bo to manipulate it and send it back as a dto or after converting it to a dao store it in a database

1203403
openoffice.org	uno
regarding the comments about uno openoffice.org.org i think these miss the points as you cannot use uno for working with powerpoints it is for openoffice.org and that was not the origianl requirement of the questioner

1203414
linked-list	nodes
this piece of code should move your documentversionid-matched nodes to the front of the linked-list

1203441
controllers	routes
the route admin routes to the default module controllers action

1203451
python	c++
if i have to be language specific then preferably in c++ but a solution in python will most likely also do

1203460
administration	integrated	administration	account
you should be able to log into it using integrated windows-authentication using an administration types account on the pc and use that to reset passwd on any sql-server types login

1203467
contains	elements
in php i have an arrays contains 20 elements or more

1203470
superclass	inherited
say i have a control that inherited from user-controls hence one of its superclass is dependencyobject

1203473
contains	elements
if you want to recreate the model as it was serialization into the grid you will have to embed correctly named form elements within the grid or maybe outside the grid and within the same form as the one contains the button that is posting back to the action where you want your model recreate

1203475
modifiers	final
from its documentation jdave can t remove final modifiers from classes loaded by the bootstrap classloader

1203504
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	pascal	ada
this means that you can write an application in c++ or python or any other language with qt binding including c# ada pascal perl php and ruby and run your application on windows linux mac or any other supported qt operating systemd

1203504
gnome	kde
i should add that qt applications generally do a pretty good job of looking native on whatever operating systemd you are using without very much effort even between gnome kde on linux

1203506
16-bit	8bit
you could put your existing 8bit sample into the high-order byte of your new 16-bit sample and then use the low order byte to linear interpolation some new 16-bit datapoint between each original 8bit sample

1203506
16-bit	8bit
this would essentially connect a 16-bit straight line between each of your original 8bit samples using several new samples

1203527
twitter	tweets
i remember .when mj passed away twitter went back manually and fixed the topics to points to tweets of his death

1203556
.net	csla
for those who might be interested eventually we went for csla .net for silverlight

1203574
updating	updates
if you would like your business rules to be updates without scheduling a downtime then you probably want to put it in the database otherwise put it in code where you will have to scheduling a down time and notify your users before updating the website code

1203586
jtable	jtree
or just follow this tutorial to use native jtable and jtree together

1203614
binary-tree	tree
i worked on a really fun rules based process systemd where we essentially built a binary-tree of and or operands whose operators would return true or false if the tree returned true we did the action

1203643
json	xml
you should consider using json instead of xml .

1203652
execvp	fork
i am using fork and execvp to spawn a process that must believe it is connect to an interactive terminal for it to function properly

1203664
debian	osx
on two different install a dev laptop running mamp osx and a dev server running debian i see different results in the error logs .when debugging

1203669
value	field
now you ll grab the first 200 characters or any numbers you specify in it s place of all comments - unless some of your input recording have value for the comments field that exceed 4000 characters in which they ll be rejected by loader with the exceeds max length error noted earlier

1203686
office-2010	vsto

1203695
required	checked
can you checked and if required modify he registry to ensure that oracle_home is setup correctly

1203697
decrement	increment
you should consider this as a transactional transactionalal are powerful in sql and only properly just implements in mysql recently even though you may be increment or decrement the transactional methods provides you the ability to return the units of currency to the entities before the failure came

1203702
environment	execution

we happen to control all this through teamcity but we can triggers the nant scripting manually too

1206053
contains	set
i set up a header file called branding.h which contains a bunch of #ifdefs like the following example to change whatever bits need changing

1206058
return-value	arguments
there s potential for odd problems with this in particular since the code does not ensure that all underlying object are given the exact same object as the callee is passing or rather it does not prohibit one of the underlying object from messing with the arguments and for methods that returns a value only the last return-value will be returned

1206058
ref	out
as for out ref arguments i haven t even tested how that works but it probably doesn t

1206075
firefox	safari

1206231
environment	building
note that if you actually do want to call the windows functions to get process id etc you should be using a c++ environment like mingw which allows you to building native windows-applications rather than cygwin which is more aimed at porting pthreads apps to windows

put	get
in most situations git fetch should do what you want which is get anything new from the remote repository and put it in your local copy without merging to your local branches

1206277
factors	primes
my understanding is that many public key cryptography algorithms these days depend on large primes to make up the key and it is the difficulty in factors the product of two primes that makes the encryption hard to break

1206286
constructor	private	instances	private
now i want to force myxmlmodel and every other implementation of model to follow singleton pattern .the usual way is to make myxmlmodels constructor private and provide a static factory-methods to return an instances of mymodel class.but the problem is interface cannot have static methods definitions and a result i cannot enforce a particular factory-methods definition on all implementation of model

1206286
constructor	object
one work around is to allow package access to myxmlmodel s constructor and create a factory class which creates the myxmlmodel object and caching it for further use

1206307
double-quotes	spaces
and finally in ms-access if a column named has a spaces you wrap it in double-quotes my column in sql wrap it in my column

1206312

as you can see the dimension sub structure is different in both items .so i need to find a way to create the strongly typed class .so that it can handle any change to the dimension elements it could for example contains a whole nested sub structure different for each dbprovider

1206316
contains	lookup
letting the caching do a lookup for contains and then again to retrieve the data seems wasteful especially as this would occur every time

mouse click can occur except to

1206400
margins	padding
my first thought -- browser dependent padding or margins

1206415

1206440
sql-server	oracle
i am forced very unwilling since i started out on sql-server to deal with oracle dev every day and since 7 is just a polished vista i feel it is far superior and i ve been using vista since rtm the theory is that it will work fine

1206681
base-class	inherited
since both foochildspecial and foochildtwo inherited from the same base-class and the list is of that base-class types it will work out

i am trying to execute the code below to list the selected item in a checkbox

1206871
populate	row
in terms then of creating a new row in the database i suppose a new instances of the model would be created populate with data and effectively a save methods called

1206873
alt	src
a regular expression could be devised to achieve the same goal but would be limited in such way that it would force the alt attributes to be after the src or the opposite and to overcome this limitation would add more complexity to the regular expression

1206875
json	xml
serve mime-types such as application xml or application json to clients

firefox	safari
i ve been trying to get sifr3 to work for hours now it works fine in safari and firefox but doesn t in ie6 ie7

value	field
basically you need to attach onclientclick event on div p or any other elements used for a grid and then transfer the checked value into hidden elements associated with that field in a grid

1207027
textbox	button
the one exception-handling where i might use hungarian types of notations is for user-interface elements such as windows forms or asp.net-controls for example using button as a prefix for a submit button buttonsubmit txt for a textbox txtfirstname and .so on but it differs from project to project depending on approach and patterns utilized

1207043
scala	java

1207082
g++	gcc
if this is even possible how would i tell the compiler assembler gcc g++ as to align in said way

1207097
google-chrome	firefox
another thing with the scripting is that redirection to path didn t work even in firefox or google-chrome

1207100
optional-parameters	named
c# 4 supports optional-parameters and named arguments.

1207100

the main difference is that the stack-trace of the exception-handling will be altered to show that it originated from the location of the try-catch in the first example

1207196
exception-handling	try-catch
if you re not handling the exception-handling leave the try-catch off

1207206

1207235
configuration	environment
use configuration-files to save the configuration for differnt environment

1207235
contains	lookup	value	field
things i have seen happen include adding new columns removing columns that are critical to your process reaarranging the order of the columns especially bad .when the file itself does not have the column namedd leaving the column title the same but changing the data they contains yes once i got a file where the last named data was in the column labelled first_named and vice versa data with new value that don t have a match to value in your systemd i m think of lookup types things here like medical specialties flat out strange data such as notes in an email field namedd in this format lastnamed - willams jo first_named - hn combine the two field to get the whole named - apparently their data entry people just typesd the named until they ran out of spaces and continue on in the next field no matter where they were in the named

1207236
llvm	gcc	pointers	stack
it doesn t provide anything if your language doesn t support pointers to stack variables and if it does stop writing your own analysis and use llvm or gcc

it is meant add up the total of an order .when i run it in sql developer using order 1 i get this

1207256
reflection	runtime
first it uses reflection - very slow second - there are possibilities of runtime errors in case of wrong definitions of classes

1207267

python	perl
the parrot viewmodel was created initially for python and perl 6

1207293
perl	ruby
on top of that there are many languages that have been cross-platform for a decade or two like smalltalk early versioning of perl ruby etc

why do ref and out parameters not allow types variation

1207302
ref	out
final conclusion neither ref nor out parameters may vary their types

1207304
order	join
if you have multiples of drinks order and multiples of food order the join will cross

1207315
logout	login
you logout page would need to clear this cookies and you login page set it

1207319
managed-code	unmanaged
with versioning 7 visual basic took the step into .net with managed-code and real object orientation leaving the old unmanaged platform behind

1207326
dynamic-typing	immutability
the fundamental choice is either give up on this covariance and accept practitioners puzzlement as c# does here or move to a dynamic-typing approach as the very first oop language smalltalk did or move to immutable single-assignment data like functional languages do under immutability you can support covariance and also avoid other related puzzle such as the fact that you cannot have square subclassing rectangle in a mutable-data world

1207343
order	add
.when you add everything up you count the order twice

1207352
contains	lookup
there d be a prefix for lookup tables which are obviously pretty static in both size and content and a different prefix for the tables that contains variables data

1207367
xsd	xml
inorder to get strong typess you have to create xml schema - an xsd file that will contains definition and types of each xml nodes

1207371
value	field
i would put them into one table and have a types field that has the value of either food or drink

1207373
google-chrome	safari
webkit-based such as safari including on ios android s browser epiphany and midori webkit is a derivative of konqueror s khtml engine but mac os x does not shared the kio architecture .so the implementation are different as well as webkit chromium-based such as google-chrome

1207384
triggers	insert
you could have a triggers internal to the database that on retrieval decrypts the value and replace the returned result and on insert encrypts the value and replace the stored result with the encrypted value

1207384
triggers	insert
you could also do this with a view wrapper - have an insert triggers on the view and have the view automatically decrypt the value

1207384
triggers	insert
to better explain have a view that decrypts the value and an on insert triggers that encrypts the value that is linked to the view

1207401
hide	show
doing this in code-behind makes it easy to dynamically show and hide headers as needed

1207461
contains	elements
you can use a list-comprehension to create a new list contains only the elements you don t want to remove

1207478
binary-search-tree	data-structures
i m writing binary-search-tree templates for two reasons - learning c++ and learning most common algorithms and data-structures

1207517
postorder	inorder	postorder	preorder	preorder	inorder
for tree there are standards for traversal the tree enumerating the nodes preorder traversal inorder traversal and postorder traversal

1207517
children	nodes	children	tree
the concepts are mostly applied to binary tree but you can extends the idea to arbitrary tree by adding more cases effectively handle a nodes then recurse recurse then handle a nodes handle all children then recurse into each...etc

1207519
maven-plugin	cobertura	cobertura	emma
i don t know if this is possible with the emma maven-plugin but this is the default behavior for the cobertura maven-plugin

1207519
maven-plugin	cobertura	cobertura	emma
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checked just that cobertura has a better maven-plugin and emma has a better eclipse-plugin in my opinion

1207527
duplicates	lookup
if you get the wrong ip-address then you have the wrong ip in your hosts-file checked for typos in the ip-address your computer s dns caching is polluted try ipconfig flushdns on a windows machine or something else is overrides the lookup duplicates entries in the hosts-file

1207535
subproject	libs
where i am we have a large core libs that all the much smaller subproject required

1207538
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
it depends on what you want to do with the tree - maybe it would be nice to have for instances breadth-first-search or depth-first-search or both iterator

1207541
windows-vista	windows	firefox	opera
using firefox opera and the ie that is on windows 7 can t remember what it is the page looks exactly as it should but using ie7 on windows-vista there is a gap between my navigation bar and the rest of the page which frankly makes it look stupid and the illusion of tabbed pages is lost

1207541
firefox	opera	margins	padding
i have a reset stylesheet to reset all the elements to have no padding margins etc and firefox opera and the ie on windows 7 produce the page as they should it s only ie7 and i m guessing earlier versioning of ie that don t

1207541
firefox	opera
here are 2 screenshot showing the problem the first from firefox opera ie on windows 7

1207543
aggregate	grouping
you can use a join and an aggregate grouping by instead of a subquery

1207548
32-bit	64bit
our development-environment is all 32-bit but our production sharepoint farms are all 64bit

1207552
font-size	width
the easiest solution would probably be to find a satisfactory character width and probably hardcode this per font-size family and then simply multiplying that with the max length

1207558
contains	elements
using firebug for firefox you can inspect the elements on the page and the right-hand side will show the css affecting that control as well as what file that css is contains within

1207569
order	join
the problem stems from the fact that there is no join between food _ order and dish in the sub selected

1207573
margins	padding
different browsers all have different default margins and padding

1207573
margins	padding
you can set your own margins and padding at the html body level

1207594
any	set
if you have the platform target set to any cpu which is the default then you do not need to recompile

1207620
hash	md5
my plan is to use an md5 hash of the following three attributes of the file

1207623
linux	unix
for learning you might be better off running a native unix linux environment

1207644
.war	jar
if i put it in the .war somewhere what filename can i pass the function in the jar

1207646
baud-rate	parity
what was happening in my case was that i was not setting up the baud-rate read write timeout and data characteristics data bits stop bits parity bits in my program

1207655
linked-list	arrays
if you ask for iterator over an order structure ie an arrays linked-list etc you ll usually get your members returned inorder

1207666
web-services	security
internet information serivces world wide web-services security

1207666
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be install by windows-installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade patch may updates a different versioning of the program

1207684
hash	md5
you may consider using sha-1 or even better sha-256 instead of md5 since md5 hash may not be unique enough it is possible to generator a file with size and md5 hash matching those of other file

1207700
google-chrome	firefox
you ll discover that the page is blank .when it rendering in ie7 firefox google-chrome are fine

1207721
wamp	php
you can either use the wamp or xammp server they install the whole php apache and mysql stack for you in a hassle free way

1207722
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i have a asp.net-mvc controllers class that uses a wcf service wshttpbinding sometimes multiple call within one http-request and want to know how expensive it is to create a client for that service

1207731
dictionary	arrays
i simply need a plain old dictionary of string string or some equivalent hashtable dictionary of string object old-school stringdictionary--hell a 2-d arrays of strings would work for me

1207753
oracle	mysql	database-agnostic	oracle
ideally this should be database-agnostic but is likely to run on either oracle or mysql

1207764
itemscontrol	grid
the way i do this at the moment is by using an itemscontrol where each item is represented as a grid with the columns that i need

1207764
panels	grid	itemscontrol	grid
is there way for the grid panels to be used with itemscontrol .so that there is a single grid to contains all the items

1207771
continuous-integration	teamcity
microsoft team systemd appears to be a great platform for process-oriented systemdd implementation however if you stripes out access for the bas pm and business users and just purely use it within a dev team does it have any more value than just using visual-studio professional sourcesafe a defect tracking tool and a continuous-integration server like cruisecontrol.net or teamcity

1207802
benchmarking	profiling
does anyone have benchmarking on the performance costs of profiling with visualvm

1207807
digits	zero
also the receivetimeout in your client binding is a bit funny - it s missing a zero digits

1207809
value	field
i have a class that contains 3 properties field operators value

1207816
contains	elements	contains	set
you simply need to set the grid.issharedsizescope properties to true on the elements that contains your grid then set the sharedsizegroup on the columndefinitions you want to have the same width

1207821
directory	folder
this will also help avoid versioning issues of putting it in a common .lib directory although you could just put folder in the common .lib directory for different versioning

1207826
visio	dia
since a few people mentioned visio dia is a free alternative

1207826
entity-relationship	diagram
draw entity-relationship diagram uml

1207828
gridview	listview
use a listview with a gridview embedded in the listview.view properties

1207845
revision	svn
the atomicity of operation in clearcase being at the file-level there is no strict equivalent of a svn changeset a revision

1207856
combinations	permutation
there are other criterion to weed out every permutation but they are irrelevant once these combinations are generator they are being stored in a table in mysql

1207858
directory	folder	duplicates	contains
i have a subversion repo with directory that contains the usual source-controlled files but in addition to that contains files that are a dependency for execution but not checked into source control and instead added as svn ignore since they would be kept in duplicates all around the repo if they were checked in into all folder

1207863
.when	ready
they will take whichever project are ready .when they have a release coming and include those

1207872
updating	updates
you can use it in a set or an updates statement but neither of those help .when you re updating different tables

1207890
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
why use visual-studio professional instead of sharpdevelop

1207894
decimal-point	digits
the book c a reference manual states that if no precision is specified then the default precision is 6 6 digits after the decimal-point

1207909
constructor	object
note that the constructor in previous step cannot be used for this since the this object is different

1207921
put	get
you can put your items inside a uniformgrid with columns 1 and make the textbox visibility to collapse .when you get emptry text

1207929
sql-server	oracle
works in both oracle and sql-server i believe is all standards sql from later standardss

1207939
internet-explorer	firefox
this works as expected in firefox but in internet-explorer ie8 i can t access the table cell

1207955
keyboard	mouse
if i handle mouse and keyboard events i like to do it in the browser with jquery

1207955
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms for example

1207956
attr	src
not sure - but a similar problem arises if you are testing the attr src of an image - it might not be what you set it to anymore

1207958
32-bit	16-bit
assuming the 16-bit architecture could address sufficient amounts of memory to hold the runtime either in flash-memory or ram. 32-bit value could still be calculated albeit slower than 16-bit and requiring more operations using libs code

1207967
assign	add
1 add adds the attributes while allows you to access the value directly and assign it

1207991
arguments	default
what happens is updatemodel creates new person object assign their named age properties from the valueprovider and put them in the arguments list which makes the rest of the properties set to their default initial value id 0

1208000
hide	show
i removed the show hide div for simplicity but you can easily add it back

1208008
contains	elements
it logically grouping the elements it contains for future portability and semantics in both html and css - i.e

1208033
value	field
you can loops through that collections and checked if the value is set if it s not then you can return the named of the missing field

1208050
value	field
assuming your field and value are numbers declare something like this

1208050
value	field
if field and value are not numbers or the types depends on the specific rules you can use object instead of decimal and with a little bit of casting you can make it all work

1208052
formatting	printing
you can try using the built-in printing facilities of ie7 - but you are likely to run into formatting and layout problems .when printing something like barcode

1208070
postgresql	mysql
they offer mysql and postgresql databases

1208075
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
the code runs without any exception-handling and i was able to set breakpoints to make sure that the variables contains the correct value before being sent to the web service

1208077
connection-pooling	pool
.so what is optimal numbers of connections should we configure in connection pool min and max numbers we are using weblogic as connection-pooling mechanism

1208086
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
if you wanted to be even fancier you could use reflection.emit with dynamicmethod instances to do it using proper operators rather than the default comparator instances but this would required complex handling for types with overrides operators

1208107
javascript	dom
this could potentially be a viable option - i still think the dom is the better way but this looks far superior to the standards javascript implementation of regex

1208148
callback	methods
all methods are reentrancy thread-safe and guaranteed not to block on event callback therefore event callback shall not be invoked while holding locks

1208148
callback	methods
for example the implementation of a methods on a control would only be allowed to invoke methodss on child controls except by scheduling an asynchronous callback to run later or on another thread

1208148
callback	methods
user-interface object can generally only be manipulated from the user-interface-thread some systemd such as win32 allow there to be multiple user-interface-threads with seperate user-interface object and to communication between threads there is a threadsafe methods to scheduling a callback to be invoked on the user-interface-thread

1208154
php-parse-error	syntax-error
but if those files are corrupt then the whole process halts with blank screens for the user and php-parse-error syntax-error in error-log

1208172
attributes	properties
properties but it became annoying to deal with the fact that attributes is also a predefined class in the .net

1208172
httpcontext	httpmodule
i then load the site object into the httpcontext using an httpmodule

1208220
any	set
is there any way to set freemarker to rendering absolute paths the way any user would expect

1208222
key-value	key
i want to calculate store some statistics information using javascript the equivalent code in c# is below features i need are -- key-value pair string int key-value pair manipulate value by key etc. any ideas how to implements the same function in javascript

1208240
contains	any
is a magic variables contains the error messages of the last eval cmd if any

1208249
malloc	free
note also that you do not need to allocate memory with new you can use malloc and free

1208249
required	checked
the specifications for arrays specifically required that compilers allow for bounds checked to be turned off see the implementation note

1208256
emacs	vim
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide

1208256
emacs	vim
like are vim emacs better suited for more advanced users than for beginners

1208265
subclassing	nsobject
my object a subclassing of nsobject has calayer instances variables

1208272
arrays	loops
you can iterate through an associativity arrays using the for..in loops construct as follows

1208277
fadeout	fadein
i would use jquery exclusively for the fadeout load fadein

1208289
lightbox	jquery
take a look at the jquery lightbox plugins

1208335
emacs	vim
vi vim emacs geany whatever

1208355
simulink	matlab
teaching with matlab and simulink a numbers of other links you may find useful

1208355
fwrite	fread
this would introduce them to various file operations fread fwrite save load etc. and you could even introduce them to working with audio data file-format

1208378
arrays	loops
many older languages like c and c++ don t store the length as part of the arrays .so you d want to store the length before loops starts

1208380
ironpython	ironruby
while it is true that you probably won t find an elegant way to evaluate full c# code on-the-fly without the use of dynamically compiling code which is never pretty you can almost certainly get your rules evaluated in short order using either the dlr ironpython ironruby etc or an expression evaluator libs that parsing and execute a custom syntax

1208380
expression	evaluation
take a look here evaluation expression a runtime in .net c#

1208409
arrays	loops
is recognized as iterator over the arrays .so the bounds checked is avoided .when accessing the arrays in loops instead of with each arrays access

1208411
contains	set
to avoid having to defined persistence.xml files or specifying every entity you can use the annotationsessionfactorybean and a wildcard to include all the types in the package s contains your entities you may instead want to set the packagestoscan properties i ve not tried this and it might take you back to your original problem

1208415
fgetcsv	fputcsv
im trying to figure out how to take the data returned by fgetcsv and format it into a readable editable table and then use fputcsv to save that table

1208421
getter	setter
while you can send a messages to any object id - properties accessor required that the compiler be aware of the types you are dealing with - this is because properties accessor are syntactic-sugar around calling specific getter and setter methods

1208438
contains	elements	contains	set
an easier solution might be to set margin-left auto margin-right auto and text-align centering for the caption text on all child elementss of your contains elements

1208438
contains	elements	contains	set
this means you won t have to explicit set the width of your contains elements but has the drawback that your caption text will have a 100 width which might look wierd

1208442
execute	prepare
i m trying to use prepare statements to set a table named to selected data from but i keep getting an error .when i execute the query

1208452
keyboard	mouse
vmware s default key combo for ungrabbing the keyboard mouse input from the guest os is control + alt

1208471
swing	awt
as you know swing awt gives you several ways to execute a particular action .when a button is click

1208494
32-bit	64bit
those msi s are 32-bit and required a fair bit of modding to make them 64bit compatible

1208500
databound	formview
you need to handle the updates to your formview - the updates in the asp.net databound controls are not automatic

1208571
configuration	installation
i don t know if this is an issue or a configuration mistake i followed the installation procedure but nothing works about static files

1208573
double	int
iâ ve found that only my numbers int decimal double etc gets picked up by clientsidevalidation

1208589
internationalization	localization
edit we need to be able to have internationalization localization for these report

1208601
anonymous-inner-class	anonymous-class
my personal rules of thumb if the anonymous-inner-class is going to be small stick with an anonymous-class

1208647
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl	carbon	cocoa	glut	glu	glut	x11
besides what you listed you ll also hear about win32 and mfc both c++ tk which is common with scripting languages like perl python the hardware languages opengl glu and glut cross platform directx windowss and x windows systemd x11 on linux and mac and cocoa and carbon on mac

1208674
directx	gdi
winforms uses gdi gdi+ technology while wpf an exciting new platform offering a lot of potential utilizes gdi gdi+ and directx some parts at least such as bitmap effects transitions fading

1208674
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a toned down web versioning of wpf

1208679
macros	let
an ambitious libs of this sort could even take function and line parameters via a macros to let you know exactly where you are leaking memory

1208682
export	report
running the reportviewer control in local process mode will allow you to export the report in pdf or excel

1208686
silverlight	wpf
asp.net winforms wpf silverlight

1208691
reflection	runtime
reflection lets you examine at runtime the same information used by the compiler at compile-time

1208691
reflection	runtime
this doesn t mean reflection has no use you may not know what exact question you want to ask until runtime

1208706
tcmalloc	valgrind	memcheck	valgrind
memory checkers like valgrind memcheck and google s tcmalloc the heap checker part keep tracking of this sort of thing

1208715
pointers	stack
in java the variables pointers and primitive live on stack while any created object live in the heap

1208719
put	get
you need to put braces around arrays variables embedded in strings otherwise you get a parsing error

1208728
malloc	free
if you don t mind sleazy violence for the sake of debugging you can #define macros to hook call to malloc and free and pad the first 4 bytes with the size

1208729
click	mouse
i have a link that .when click i would like it to move the positioning of the mouse to the right or anywhere within the viewport for that matter

1208734
mousedown	mouseup
the code activates on events like mouseup mousedown and copy in the startlisteningfortraces function

1208739
combinations	permutation
if you want something different than combinations perhaps other iterator in itertools product or permutation might serve you better

1208758
swing	awt
awt swing or if you only want a static image libpng svg postscript...

1208783
.when	ready
if you do choose to have separate business entities or have a disconnect architecture you will find you have to carefully manage disconnect the linq object from the data context and then reattaching them .when you are ready to save updates

1208808
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
perhaps use insertion-sort bubble-sort or other simpler sorting algorithms .when working with smaller dataset

1208808
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
even other ðž nâ² sorting algorithms such as insertion-sort tend to have better performance than bubble-sort

1208809
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort really shine once your sample size reaches a threshold perhaps 50+

1208813
spaces	output
output - pdf x document -- whatever spaces the document has

1208825
insertion-sort	bubble-sort	insertion-sort	quicksort	bubble-sort	quicksort
you don t have enough value to work with quicksort and you should use less advanced algorithms ex bubble-sort insertion-sort .

1208834
positioning	slider
it all works good if i give my contains a background-color but as soon as i apply a background via url my slider navigation which was originally positioning absolutely to the top right gets bumped down below my sliderr in ie6

1208835
colorbox	thickbox	fancybox	thickbox	fancybox	colorbox
i d say either colorbox or fancybox though thickbox is good too

1208842
debugging	trace
learn .when to use trace debugging and info and make sure that you log everything that your application does

1208874
dictionary	for-loop
in your for-loop you re using originalarray like a dictionary

1208874
nsarray	plist
if the root of your plist is a dictionary you should use nsdictionary not nsarray to read it

1208877
attributes	properties
in case the parsing does support bytes but not in this way you could test it by specifying the id using hex notation or setting the properties using elements notation rather than attributes as in

1208881
gridview	formview
i want to test webpage functionality - will web-controls like gridview formview detailview etc insert and load the data from sql-server 2008 properly

1208884
aggregate	grouping
finally if you want to grouping by the actual aggregate

1208929
lookup	any
the specifications are not very clear but it seems to me that if one of the typess involved is an interface types the compiler doesn t even try to lookup any user-defined implicit-conversion

1208941
checkstyle	cobertura
its dashboard report data generator by many code analysers like findbugs checkstyle or cobertura

1208945
dictionary	arrays	key-value	key
arrays do not have key they don t need any because their elements are addressed by their indic only dictionary consist of key-value pairs

1208946
arrays	loops
nearly every new will be in a loops of some sort reading from a dataset often the dataset is as simple as an arrays --once you start reading from a dataset like that actions can help you a lot

1208948
silverlight	wpf
you are not limited in terms of c# but your will need to learn about wpf to use silverlight

1208963
value	field
what i want to do is to using bitwise operations determine whether i should set some field with an incremental value or not

1208974
value	field
i would like to use reflection to investigate the private field of an object as well as get the value in those field but i am having difficult finding the syntax for it

1208996
perl	c++
if not then perl or any other similar tool language would be a lot easier and i m a c++ developer

1209005
operators	keyword
i need to parsing a boolean search string of keyword and operators into a sql query to be execute from c# code

1209006
value	field
since you want to retrieve both field and value

1209025
triggers	insert
if the solution is insert updates and delete triggers is this considered bad-practice

1209032
delphi	basic
i really like delphi basic

1209039
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
what are some oracle gotchas for someone new to the platform but not new to relational databases mysql ms sql-server postgresql etc. in general

1209066
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
by default null s are sorted last not first like in postgresql but unlike mysql and sql-server

1209066
sql-server	mysql
to sort like in sql-server and mysql use this

1209066
sql-server	mysql
by default tables are heap organized unlike sql-server and mysql with innodb

1209070
http-get	get
if you have access to modify .net http-get you can modify the actual get methods to accept a subdomain arguments making it even cleaner

1209073
contains	any
it s a valid path and the file does just contains a class with functions - there s no output in any way except die if a mysql query fails

1209089
implements	extends
in general you want the class that dispatcher the event to either extends eventdispatcher or implements ieventdispatcher

1209089
implements	extends
basically make a universally-accessible class that extends eventdispatcher or implements ieventdispatcher and listens for and dispatcher events to anything that tells it to

1209093
worksheet	excel
excel will then convert the html table to a worksheet as well as it can

1209097
haskell	lisp	haskell	erlang	erlang	lisp
i don t mind the language - be it erlang haskell lisp or even ruby i found out it supports functional-programming traits

1209114
text-editor	editor
i can look at them through xcode s plist editor and through any plain text-editor .when i just want the xml

1209121
ref	out
part 2 - why no ref or out parameters

1209121
push	pull
part 5 - push vs pull

1209137
associations	model
add the proper associations to the user model

1209142
sql-server	oracle
it seems i ve run into more oracle databases being case-sensitive to schema object and data than in sql-server

1209163
transparency	outline
transparency images create this black outline around them

1209190
decimal-point	digits
all you need is 5 places after the decimal-point to represent latitude and longitude within about one-meter precision and you only need up to three digits before the decimal-point for the degrees

scala	java
scala helps on the first points because it compiles to java bytecode that s really similar to java and therefore usually has the same performance as java

1212088
scala	java
i say usually because scala there are some cases where idiomatic scala causes large amount of boxing to take place where idiomatic java would not this is slated to change in scala 2.8

1212088

1212636
gzip	zip
by not considering your step 3 we make the question of security as clear as possible instead of arguing about how hard it is to guess which format you used zip gzip bzip2 ... we only talk about the odds of breaking the systemd compared to the odds of guessing the key

1212646
websphere	ibm
the named of the custom eclipse for ibm websphere is rational software architect and i think it comes with a struts plugins

1212658

1212736
hide	show
i know they do that way but .sometimes it seems like a show func tion fires at the same time with hide .so the logic fails

1212739
reflection	runtime
to me the interface wrapper approach would be the simplest but i have been told to investigate a reflection based approach which may utilize reflection inorder to discover the properties at runtime which can be exposed to the systemd

1212839
triggers	insert
in the insert triggers of all the various child tables we have code that looks like this

1212839
updating	updates
the key bit in this logic is using a separate selected statement with the for updates clause instead of just updating the column with a single statement

1212839
execute	declare
since mastertable already has declare delete-cascade rules to all the child tables the code above will cause ora-04091 mutating table errors .when it execute in the context of deleteing a mastertable row that has existing children .so these statements are done in the context of an exception-handling block that catches and ignore this error

1212839
any	set
erwin allows you to create user defined properties udp and it has a macros language that can be used to generator virtually any code you need based on your schema .so all we need to do to enable this feature is add the childcount column to the appropriate parent table and set the udp for ref-counted relationship to true

1213536
environment	building
unfortunately .some of our codebase does not have as good a building-system ie required manual setting up of sdks and grabbing various external libs and poking environment variables and it would be difficult to recreate exactly a specific versioning of a building based on the repository we are constantly moving forwarding and not really supporting old code .so the developers workstation are set up close enough that we haven t been burnt yet by having to go back to an old branch before our current release and in that case we do store our release s buildinging for the inevitable fat finger oh no i was on the wrong server doing .some tests or .something equally insidious

1213537
member-functions	base-class
.so from the pov of dynamic polymorphism instances of the same templates are in the same positioning as any two classes - they can only play if you give them a common base-class with .some virtual member-functions

1213968
value	field
will return 1 for the field that start with a and 0 for all other value

1214032
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1214066
cvs	git
with git you can have a single public repository the authoritative versioning of the code managed in any numbers of ways - for example if all of the developers can push to it it gains everything you want about a centralized vcs except with all the added benefits of git and none of the inadequacies of cvs svn

1214076
getter	setter
use setter and getter or maybe a centralized configuration like

1214097
gnupg	gpgme
as other have noted pyme is the canonical solution for this since it s based on gpgme which is part of the gnupg ecosystem

1214205
selected	listbox
i am currently moving selected items to a listbox to show chosen recording

1214210
hide	show
.when you hide a child form and show it again the mdi containers probably considers that it s a new child form and it places accordingly.

i use jsf seam and have used seam s built-in authentication and authentication and find it extremely easy to use

1214267
seam	jsf
seam is just a layer on top of jsf .so technically you would still be running on jsf

1214267
seam	jsf
if for some reason you cannot use seam maybe you can borrow some ideas from how seam handles authentication and authentication in jsf

1214621
web-services	security
either you need to impement some sort of security for instances the connection-string in a application can easily be reverse engineered and web-services can easily be tracked and used for other reasons than the applications original purpose

1214621
web-services	security
.so my question is in a shorter way how do you .solve the security issues .when handling web-services and or direct connection to a sql-server from a windows forms application

1214625
value	field
if the field does not exist the value should be null it has to be show

1214625
identifier	temporary
first i thought it was best to create a temporary table holding the id s and then joining it to the table holding the data but if i m correct this takes at least 1 query per identifier to insert it in the temporary table

1214634
functional-programming	imperative
some of them cooked up a paradigms called functional-programming quite different from imperative and quite powerful too

1214645

blend still works if you want a more visual designer and i believe that the beta building of vs2010 has the design-view built into it

1214723
onmousedown	onmouseup
for a button-like control a typical way to do this is to make a properties for your button something like ispressed which your control sets to true in onmousedown and then back to false in onmouseup

1214734
panning	pan
this allows me to using an animation chage the grid s margins to -1000 on the left side to bring the left column off screens move the middle column to the far right and then pan the right most column on screens think of it like a 2 page panning design.

1214747
powerpc	arm
if your project migrates from say a chip with a powerpc core to a chip with an arm core you can be fairly confident that your c code will not be overly difficult to ports over

1214747
pascal	basic
i have seen development tools available for languages such as c++ pascal basic and others but they are typically niche tools that are not mature enough to match the efficiency of the available c compilers

1214747
assembly	lua	tcl	lua
on these more powerful systemd you will still see c and assembly being used for drivers code if nothing else but other languages such as java lua tcl ruby etc are becoming more and more common

1214747
low-level	hardware
any low-level code that interfaces directly with hardware drivers with still typically use assembly or c since high-level languages don t always have the capability to do this sort of thing

1214747
low-level	hardware
assembly is popular because it allows for low-level hardware access in ways that would otherwise be difficult or impossible

1214753
momentjs	datejs
if you are doing a lot of date work you may want to look into javascript date libs like datejs or momentjs

basically without parameters value-type field are always initializer to default value as a performance optimization since value-type are often used in bigger numbers in arrays etc

1214865
hide	show
then .when you start loading your data hide the table show the activity viewer and labels start the activity viewer animation and start loading your data in a background-thread

1214865
hide	show
once the thread finishes hide the activity viewer and labels and show your table again

1214869
any	set
i have thought up a few hacks set a cookies before the redirect to the login page and then read the cookies and updates the link after the redirectfromloginpage is done for getting around this but was wondering if there was any real way to make formsauthentication.redirectfromloginpage do what i actually want it to do

1214870
hidden-field	checkbox
it does not just rendering a checkbox but a hidden-field as well

1214884

1215022
32-bit	64bit
is it a 64bit 32-bit problem

1215043
reflection	runtime
further to some of the other answers posted here already .when you get to this numbers of assemblies loading a ton of assemblies does incur a performance hit -- definitely during resolution and i would guess though i have no empirical evidence that runtime might suffer in some edges case situations particularly where reflection might come into play -- could be wrong on that points

1215048
getter	setter
the problem is that xmlrpcclient has a setconfig methods that doesnt follow the javabeans specifications the setter and the getter dont use the same class

1215048
getter	setter
does the parameter types of the setter match the return-types of the getter

1215055
typename	typedef
my question is why does the typedef work .when using the bare typename std vector iterator declaration did not work

1215056
contains	any
also because the description is a string it can contains any characters

1215066
put	get
i have actually written some stuff up that if i ever get around to it i might put online about web-crawler construction since building a proper one is much tougher than people will tell you

1215070

i ve had trouble in the past with a properties not being retained causing object release to destroy the object .when it wasn t supposed to .so far as i could tell - the retain attributes was set

1215085
selected	button
remove the selected state from the previously click button .when you click on a new one..

1215092
typename	typedef
the question isn t really about typedef but typename

1215092

an alternative to using a factory could be to make a subclassing of xmlrpcclient that has a matching getter and setter for xmlrpcclientconfig setclientconfig getclientconfig

1215164
tokenize	parsing
lex building the tokenize and yacc stands for yet another compiler compiler and is the actual parsing

1215164
pascal	delphi

1215164
pascal	delphi
paslex was a delphi grammar implementation...tply was the lex yacc tool which generator pascal source from a .l file

1215166
macros	let
this is another instances of generics are not templates -- generics rely on polymorphism defined by types constraints explicit or implicit whereas c++ templates are more like sophisticated macros which let you get by eith duck-typing or static polymorphism

1215174
constructor	object
it s actually potentially very very slightly slower to use an object initializer than to call a constructor and then assign the properties as it has one extra assignment

1215182

shallow-copy	deep-copy
changes to the shallow-copy arrays itself would not appear in the types arrays meaning elements assignment which really is what he showed above despite saying deep-copy

1215236
put	get
the book says that since - and are not commutative operators the order in which the 2 pop functions are evaluated is necessary obviously to get the correct result ...and thus you have to put the result-of the first function in a variables first and then proceed with the arithmetic like such

1215239
put	get
besides drawing it urself on the screens you can maybe have an image of the outline and put 2 image views on top of each other to get the picture with it s outline

1215272
32-bit	64bit
you will be able to get around having to declare both the instances variables and the properties once 32-bit computers are forgotten as the 64bit runtime can synthesize instances-variabless

1215273
content-disposition	content-length
maybe some others like content-disposition content-length .

1215294
strong-typing	types
but due to inherent types incomatibility here and the static compilation of generics we have lost strong-typing

1215305
google-chrome	firefox
works on ie6 ie7 firefox does not have google-chrome to test

1215312
expression	evaluation
to answer your question about why c doesn t defined the order of operation it s simply because the inventors of c decided it would be valuable to give compiler implementors the opportunity to optimize expression evaluation

1215312
expression	evaluation
they also decided that it was more valuable than giving programmers certainty in expression evaluation

1215329
put	get
the book says that since - and are not commutative operators the order in which the 2 pop functions are evaluated is necessary obviously to get the correct result ...and thus you have to put the result-of the first function in a variables first and then proceed with the arithmetic

1215337
communication	messages
with those two being said whether you are communication actual classes and object or just messages a third assembly to handle this would work flawlessly as long as you put in the effort in the architecture and design

if no arguments the methods is used as getter else as setter

1215420
getter	setter
for simple getter setter

1215420
getter	setter
.so i d like to narrow it down to classes object with a couple of explicit getter setter

as far as getting the date from a string one approach you could try is using nsdateformatter which has methods like -datefromstring and -stringfromdate to convert between nsstring and nsdate representations

1215843
default-value	default
the closest you can come is to allow users to specify some sentinel types - like void - meaning use default-value here and use templates metamagic inside your class to typesdef the real default if void was given to you

1215868
put	get
.so if you put option2 then you get a constants value for the first two options

use the development mode fpr debugging it will give you a better log output

1216225
svg	vml
it uses svg vml and also cross browser compatible

1216233
put	get
should the text get integrated in the image or should it only put over the image

1216235
aptana	pydev
pydev also bundle with the aptana distro does not seem to have any bug exactly similar to the one you are describing

1216237
addition	modulo	multiplication	addition	multiplication	modulo
rather it s z 2 with standards addition and multiplication modulo 2

1216257
arguments	default
some arguments may be optional with default value

1216273
configuration	environment
with a viewmodel you can ensure the required environment in a stable tested configuration

1216286
dictionary	arrays
how do i setup a single dictionary or arrays to have all object in one structure

1216287
spring	guice
as far as i know spring and guice does not support this kinds of injection

1216289
csv	xml	export	csv
export tables views database in csv xml sql format

1216290
revision	updates
updates to revision will only updates files of your workingcopy to your choosen revision

1216290
revision	svn
but you cannot continue to work on this revision as svn will complain that your workingcopy is out of date

1216308
treeview	listview
the problem is that the icons of the treeview nodes and listview entries are not properly rendering if the come from an alpha-blended png file

1216310
firefox	opera
i d say it s a rendering bug in firefox as it s fine in opera

1216321
value	field
what you re looking for is something that looks up types information once and then only uses reflection to get the value of properties and field .net 3.5

1216359
instances	self
yes all that will happen is that you won t be able to reference the current instances of your class a unless you set another variables to self before you change it. i wouldn t recommend it though it makes for less readable code

1216359
instances	self
self is only a reference to the current instances within the methods

1216359
instances	self
you can t change your instances by setting self

1216359
instances	self
what func self should do is to change the variables of your instances

1216360
configuration	installation
i can t figure it out from their installation configuration guide

1216361
instances	self
self is effectively a local variables only defined for the duration of the methods call used to pass in the instances of the class which is being operated upon

1216361
instances	self
replacing self will not actually replace references to the original instances of the class held by other object nor will it create a lasting reference to the new instances which was assign to it

1216372
functional-programming	imperative
like the first time you went from imperative to object-oriented working with functional-programming required a rewiring of how you think things out

1216372
haskell	prolog
that said going directly to prolog and haskell is not a bad idea but you might have to first adjust to the different syntax and libs of the languages .when compared to the leap between c# and f#

1216379
put	get	memcached	apc
it would be best to put list of random numbers in memory apc or memcached google stackoverflow search for apc or memcached to get the best performance because disc io is what will make your site slow most of the time

1216379
memcached	apc
for this you should have a box with enough memory 128mb and you can install software apc memcached

1216379
put	get
if you are on a shared-hosting provider but then you won t get best performance then it would be best to put the words in an arrays in the same file because every required statement will fetch the file from disc

1216393
mongodb	couchdb
now i ve heard several named like voldermort mongodb and couchdb

1216400
buffering	streaming
push back is fairly rare but you can always add it to a streaming by wrapping the real inputstreaming in another inputstreaming that holds an internal buffering

1216400
buffering	streaming
if there s nothing in the buffering then the push back streaming reads from the real streaming

1216400
buffering	streaming
streaming is a useful abstraction because it can describe files which are really arrays hence seek is straightforward but also terminal input output which is not seekable unless buffering sockets serial ports etc

1216402
printf	strlen
the functions returns an int it is the case for printf but the validity is implementation dependent for strlen which returns a size_t which can be int or something else

1216402
printf	strlen
the function isn t variadic it is the case for strlen but not printf

1216402
arguments	default
the types of the argumentss is not modified by default arguments promotions char short float are and you must pay attention to cast pointerss to void .when needed .when the expected types is void you have to pay attention to cast null to the correct pointers types

1216406
selected	listbox
how will i load itemsource to this combobox dynamically based on each item selected in the listbox

1216409
dialog	pop-up
ps to set the user to run a step under you need to use the advanced page on the job step properties dialog and selected the user from a pop-up windows

1216412
buffering	streaming
in some cases i think it would be reasonable for a streaming to become seekable later - for instances it might buffering everything it reads until it reaches the end of the underlying data and then allow seeking within it afterwards to let clients reread the data

1216430
haskell	scheme
in addition to things mentioned above there is a different kind of streaming - as defined in functional-programming languages such as scheme or haskell - a possibly infinite datastructure which is generator by some function on-demand

1216433
png	gif
i am creating a scripting that can put a 24-bit transparency png image as a watermark on jpg gif png images

1216436
value	field
stores the value that was saved to x in the data field of the newly allocated nodes

1216439
png	gif
inorder to combine another image your watermark with the gif image whatever image libs you re using i m guessing gd is probably converting the png to an indexed-color format which is stripping out the alpha channel .when it does .so

1216451
dictionary	map
dictionary are specifically designed to map key-value pairs and will give you much better performance for lookup than a list would

1216467
logging	trace
you might want to consider adding a lot of logging to your code and giving the client a copy with all that logging enabled helping you to trace where they re having problems

1216472
boolean	int	arguments	default
in the above example the mymethods int methods can be thought of as a convenience methods for mymethods int boolean as it provides a default arguments for one of its parameters

1216477
malloc	free
remember if you allocate memory using malloc methods you always must to free this memory using free methods

1216492
contains	any
that should make it ignore any url which ends in .asp but contains a

1216508
subroutine	scoping
this is potentially a newbie question but if i open and write .some data to a .socket then exit the subroutine .so the .socket goes out of scoping and then try and read the data from another program at a later time will the data still be there or does it die .when the original declarations go out of scoping

1216525
common-lisp	lisp
embed lisp into your application ecl embeddable common-lisp is an obvious choice

1216539
credentials	security
you can create credentials in sql-server use mgt studio under security

1216539
credentials	account
i make account for various ssis package to run under .so that i can keep the sql-agent service account low privileges and use a proxy credentials with slightly higher privileges not admin though just enough permission to connect to other systemd including the filesystemd

1216550
revision	updates
updates item to revision changes this base revision making base out of date

1216556
signals	sigint
.so the best approach here is using signals in my opinion - namely sigint that is triggers .when you hit ctrl-c

1216564
order	add
i am working on a site for a client who would like to add the date he finished a project .so the project can be listed in that order

1216566
contains	set
if you don t mind the edit button but just want some of the views to be rearrange-able assign an arrays to tabbar.customizableviewcontrollers that contains some but not all of the full set of viewcontrollers

1216600
perl	php
note from editor - depending on the plugins this is most likely not actually using perl but php s implementation of pcre.

1216616
constructor	object
either pass the app-config via a setapp-config methods or the constructor if the object needs the app-config throughout its lifetime

1216653
boolean	int
i m only using a single string and a bunch of int numbers and boolean with some references to more of the same in globally available xml data

1216654
communication	messages
i made sure that the different tiers only communication using a messages protocols that can be translation into pure json object even though i don t actually do that translation step

1216654
communication	messages
in this way if requirements change later i can have my m and c layer run on the serverside communication via those json messages to the v side in the browser

1216654
profiling	debugging
i m able to do full detailed debugging and profiling inside the event dispatcher

1216654
put	get
to put it in more concrete terms i started out with add an object to the screens remove an object from the screens types messages and i m now tending more towards display this list of object and i ll let you figure out the most efficient way to get from the current display to what i now want you to display

1216655
python	java
experience i ve got some experience in java python html javascript

1216658
jquery	dojo
dojo has a steeper learning curve than jquery though

1216660
sql-server	postgresql
note i m basically looking for a postgresql versioning of the following sql-server cmd

1216678
assign	add
safest way may no be prettiest is to use reflection and assign them to appropriated typed variables and execute the add operation

1216701
logout	login
i had session data indicating login logout time

1216728
swing	swt
swing swt etc if you want to run on non-windows platform

1216747
expression	evaluation
as you may know c++ does not specified expression evaluation order

1216749
rollback	commit
it is still subject to commit or rollback

1216755
directory	folder
include directory is subdirectories of the same folder where install scripting is located

1216758
lookup	any
basically you will just have the overhead of having a lookup table for your functions or a vtable just like any sort of inherited with virtual methods would have given

1216777
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
dave dribin has an excellent article about using asynchronous api such as nsurlconnection inside an nsoperation

1216777
synchronous	nsoperation
alternatively as long as you re running in a background-thread you can also simplify the process and just use a synchronous api methods instead in your nsoperation such as initwithcontentsofurl

1216787
member-functions	base-class
adding multiple base-classes with virtual member-functions probably means that in effect you only get the empty base-class optimisation once because in a typical implementation the object will need multiple vtable pointers

1216787
derived-class	base-class
adding an empty base-class doesn t usually add any code to construction or destructor because the empty base constructor and destructor can be inline into the derived-class constructor destructor code

1216801
32-bit	64bit
josip is nearly correct mdac 2.5 is only 32-bit 2.8 has a 64bit flavour

1216801
32-bit	64bit
it will be looking in the 64bit versioning of the systemd hive for the 2.5 types libs reference but won t find it its only in the 32-bit versioning

1216823
joomla	drupal
i m currently looking at wordpress drupal and joomla

1216823
joomla	drupal
.when using and developing wordpress drupal and or joomla

1216828
accumulate	aggregate
the aggregate methods will accumulate the collections in a single instances

1216852
lookup	any
are there any known limitations to the types of field a lookup field can be pointed at

1216872
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	implements	final
you implements page and business-logic in a mix of html and programming code in some language python perl php ... within an html file that is then process by an engine to generator the final html for the user-interface and transactional code for the database

1216872
ruby-on-rails	django	turbogears	django
django and turbogears are the prominent python representatives of this ruby-on-rails probably the biggest named currently

1216879
subclassing	base-class
i don t see how it break liskov substitution which demands that you can use the subclassing in any situation that call for a base-class

1216890
joomla	drupal
and drupal codebase and i d say that joomla

1216907
constructor	object
in the previous code i posted and what i ve seen elsewhere .when the service object is created one of the constructor overrides is used to tell it to use http give it the http url and to manually attach the messages inspector that will do the signing

1216925
python	c++	python	java
it s a cross platform c++ framework with java python binding

1216925
linux	osx
if you re aiming at windows specifically you might want to consider using .net and c# to take advantage of native support on osx objective-c and cocoa or on linux c++ whichever api set your targeted distro uses

1216925
ubuntu	linux	opensuse	ubuntu
linux ubuntu opensuse fedora etc.

1216926
stderr	stdout
the 2 is stderr and 1 is stdout

1216926
stderr	stdout
.when you run a program you ll get the normals output in stdout but any errors or warnings usually go to stderr

1216926
stderr	stdout
if you want to pipe all output to a file for example it s useful to first combine stderr with stdout with

1216935
stderr	stdout
like cma said it puts stderr on stdout

1216937
search-engine	seo
there are numbers of issues a modern search-engine needs to combat for example web spam and blackhat seo scheme

1216943
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
one is my asp.net-mvc .app and the other is for the admin related functions which is asp.net webforms dynamic data

1216943
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my asp.net-mvc .app would be the main site but i would want the webforms to work under an admin folder of the asp.net-mvc site

1216945
stderr	stdout
technically speaking it duplicates or copies stderr onto stdout

1216945
stderr	stdout
will work because it directs both stdout and stderr to the file mydirlist whereas the cmd

1216945
stderr	stdout
directs only stdout and not stderr to file mydirlist because stderr was made a copy of stdout before stdout was redirected to mydirlist

1216945
stderr	stdout
.so read the second one as saying copy stderr onto stdout before it says send stdout to mydirlist

1216945
stderr	stdout
then read the first one as saying send stdout to the file mydirlist before it says duplicates stderr onto that stdout i ve set up

1216947
task-queue	worker
say after each comment is added a task-queue worker is added

1216950
joomla	drupal
i haven t used joomla much and have never really needed to tweak wordpress outside the design but have used drupal quite extensively

1216950
joomla	drupal
you ll need to do more coding as it doesn t have a big feature set out of the box and doesn t have a plugins repository like drupal or joomla but from a coding standpoint it s setup with a pretty well done albeit basic asp.net-mvc implementation that will help your code be more organized and easier to maintain

1216957
getter	setter
avoid getter returning a different value than the one accepted by the setter

1216965
getter	setter
an automatic properties is still exposed as a public getter and setter whereas a public field is just that - a single field

1216965
getter	setter
thus implements an auto properties allows you at some later date to change the internal behavior of either the getter or setter like adding a validation without recompiling or re coding any dependant classes that use it.

1216971
getter	setter
if you later on decide you need to add code to the getter or setter you can do that without having to force every other assembly linked to it to recompile

1216978
linux	osx
komodo edit is free works in linux osx and windows does great job highlight many different formats

1216986
contains	elements
.so for example if you have an elements with value that contains new spaces you should encode it with

1216994
shell-exec	echo
a very useful trick .when debugging shell-exec problems is to place an echo at the beginning of the cmd

1217011
contains	any
an interface is just a class all of whose methods are abstract and which cannot contains any data-members

1217011
implements	extends
extends is achieved by public inherited and implements is also achieved by public inherited

1217016
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse	testdriven.net	xunit.net
i m not sure how testdriven.net supports xunit.net but with nunit you can run a single test a class its tests or all test with a click of the mouse or keyboard shortcut

1217016
mstest	nunit
i did use nunit and still want to give xunit.net a test drive but for work i mostly use mstest what comes with visual-studio

1217021
basic	vb6	xlsx	xls
what s the fastest way to generator excel files regular xls not the xlsx ones in visual basic 6 vb6

1217026
arrays	loops
what you need to do is perhaps declare a empty arrays and get the value2 of the range loops each item in the arrays and run the regex if it finds a match replace the item in the arrays

1217032
linux	unix
generally speaking php scripting on unix linux run as user nobody meaning they need the all privileges .so it s a permissions problem with the directory

1217032
linux	unix
also to delete a file or directory in linux unix you need write privileges on the parent directory

1217038
webserver	security
also keep in mind that giving the webserver the ability to write to a directory posses security problems

1217049
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
the first parameter to realloc must be a pointers that was previously returned by malloc calloc or realloc and not subsequently free d

1217054
linux	unix
in unix linux you compile run your executable via

1217100
solaris	linux
you can double the numbers of ports by changing the range to start at 32768 which is the default on linux and solaris

1217104
versioning	downgrade
you might want to downgrade to the previous versioning of wampserver.

1217125
.war	jar	directory	folder
if you re deploying a .war file you need to extraction it to that directory from within that html folder run jar xvf solr..war or whatever it s called

1217132
http	ssl
the ssl handshake introduces several additional round trips between client and server that aren t needed in plain http

1217132
private-key	rsa
use a 2048 bit rsa private-key

1217132
http	ssl
make sure you re using http keepalive and ssl session resumption

1217132
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
you should also set the secure flag on session-cookiess otherwise any plaintext communication with the server will contains the cookies and allow eavesdroppers to impersonate users sessions

1217132
webserver	security
for best security you should al.so be sure that you ve set up your webserver .so that it passes the ssl server test from qualys ssl labs

1217143
tokenize	parsing
now in many classes of my code i need to get a language specific implementation of some of those components tokenize parsing and many others and i was wondering what s the most elegant way to achieve this

1217145
any	set
how is stack overflow or any other site working to set that description

1217145
put	get
i am about to put a website online and would like to get a good description of my site indexed

1217149
python	c++
then to add say a python interface to a c++ .app is a large amount of work

1217163
uninstaller	nsis
adding requestexecutionlevel user or admin to the nsis scripting should get rid of the vista warning programs that are detected as install will show this warning if no uninstaller entry is added to the registry and the exe does not have a vista manifest

1217168
cakephp	symfony	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
typo3 flow3 imho really the most funky php framework something based on symfony can t find anything but this should be a good start mambo cakephp or maybe something based on codeigniter .

1217177
pointers	stack
your pointers is being copy-paste onto stack and you re assign stack-pointers

1217183
malloc	free
what you are writing is not c++ but c code that uses new instead of malloc and delete instead of free

1217184
linux	bsd	emacs	vim
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platform too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be install separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systemd

1217191
vba	vb6
set a reference on the tools menu in vba project in vb6 to the excel object libs can t remember the exact named but it ll start with microsoft and have excel somewhere in the named

1217263
dfa	nfa
i further assume that you are doing this by the usual methods of first constructing an nfa and converting it by subset construction to dfa since i m not aware of any other way of accomplishing this

1217263
any	set
any kind of enhancement to the algorithm that does something more sophisticated than accepting or rejecting a sequences is likely to operate on a larger set of languages than regular

1217263
updating	updates
using this alternate representation has an advantage that instead of updating m state pointers you only have to updates one

1217263
dfa	nfa
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

1217263
dfa	nfa
if you are sticking to thompson nfa or dfa implementation then there s not really any notion of greedy or non-greedy matching

1217277
webserver	upload
you probably don t have permissions php engine apache webserver to access the directory for temporary upload

1217278
32-bit	16-bit
it was possible to convert 640x480 32-bit images to 15 or 16-bit images with at least 30 pics per second

1217289
autocomplete	autosuggest
none-the-less if autocomplete and autosuggest are what you are looking for with php u will love phpedit or phpdesigner once you create a new project and points to the source folder you are ready to start working

1217311
haskell	c++
and last what is a recommended not .so pricey macbook for programming c++ java ruby haskell etc.

1217321
linux	unix
a mac is unix based and more user friendly than most linux distrib

1217321
ruby	php
i ve been developing in ruby php c++ ada java.

1217321
parallels	vmware	parallels	bootcamp
but then you can get parallels vmware or bootcamp to bypass this

1217351
command-line	cmd
i m using io.popen in ruby to run a series of command-line cmd in a loops

1217373
contains	elements
find the contains 2-d submatrix with the highest sum of brightness value where brightness was measured by the difference between the pixels s brighness value and the overall average brightness of the entire image .so many elements had negative value

1217394
click	mouse
basically my understanding of it is that .when you write an event handler for mouse movements for example you may want to continuously capture these events and perhaps be able to count how many movements or click but basically you want to use that information in more ways than just as an event handler

1217396
background-image	height
edit to replicate 100 height with columns an easy way as mentioned before is to rely on faux columns set a background-image on div.wrapper background url repeat.gif repeat-y

1217426
handler	service
maybe the actions you re trying to do in the handler are what s limited .when running as a service

1217439
directory	folder
did you checkout your subversion repository folder for your project to your local directory first

1217441
tcsh	zsh	tcsh	bash	bash	zsh	subshell	bash	subshell	zsh	subshell	tcsh
only bash tcsh and zsh can be used as subshell

1217449
any	set
i m trying to write an application for android and .when i launchd my new activity i ve set breakpoints and found that it runs through my oncreate without any errors but after that function returns the debugger says there is a nullpointerexception

1217451
constructor	object
other components that subsequently need to create object can declare a constructor parameter of types icontext which autofac will automatically inject

1217452
attributes	properties
if you need to specify attributes for your properties you re back to a named types ie

1217457
any	set
of course you would need to set any fonts styles attributes to get a reasonable value

1217465
optional-arguments	arguments
even .when you ve added functionality you shouldn t need to worry about your existing usage optional-parameters and key words arguments dictionary passed after optional-arguments let us do that for functions and classes can add attributes and methods without disturbing any proper existing usage

1217475
background-color	transparency
i have a transparencykey set and the background-color of the whole form is set to that transparency key .so the background of the form seems invisible

1217487
sql-server	mysql
what is the best simplest way to transfer a sql-server db to mysql

1217491
pointers	stack
in the last example i am careful to copy the content of the string because the pointers returned by lua_tostring is only guaranteed to be valid as long as the value remains on stack

1217500
binaries	install
if for some reason you cannot use the libcurl extension on your server extension not install you can use a class such as snoopy which will still allow you to either use the libcurl binaries or use sockets to retrieve the information

1217504
emacs	kate
i m running kubuntu and i wanted to create simple application in j2me .so i install the wtk2.5.2 sdk thats the latest one supported by linux and started programming the application using a combinations of kate and emacs can t get the code-completion to work

1217534
pagespeed	yslow
though firefox and all its extensions firebug yslow and pagespeed say they receive noncompressed content

1217548
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i m not sure about this but perhaps the itemscontrol is listening for events from ibindinglist or inotifycollectionchanged and not inotifypropertychanged

1217575
defined	declare
the problem is a function that i ve declare in a header and defined in its proper namespace in the source file

1217606
dictionary	map
map - dictionary not even quite sure about this one

1217627
progress-bar	progress
an annoying but perhaps more efficient progress-bar wouldbe the one that increases the maxvalue with every step of the recursion making your progress step tinier as you go

1217641
dictionary	map
you re right about map dictionary

1217641
protected	public
public private protected the default are for instance-variabless only not methods and work like c++ s visibility modifiers you declare them as section headers rather than before each variables

1217648
instance-variables	accessor
instance-variables are usually accessed through properties instead of explicit get set accessor

1217648
ibaction	cocoa
an action button mouse event-listener is roughly equivalent to an ibaction although the way guis are designed in cocoa is quite different from java

1217658
javascript	dom
once you have a variables inside javascript it won t matter much unless you do an eval or set the innerhtml properties of a dom elements with it

1217676
variables	boolean
i suggest introducing lock variables boolean

1217707
user-controls	treeview
i m writing a plugins for a program where i have a custom user-controls with a treeview

1217712
reflection	runtime
otherwise you will just have to use reflection to get the methodsinfo for the mapped methods and checked at runtime that it hasd the correct signature

1217715
boolean	int
can core data store information other than strings boolean int etc

1217722
listbox	textbox
i have a textbox and a listbox and i d like to have the listbox add an item based on textbox .when enter is pressed

1217724
keyboard	hid
enumerate your hid and usb devices and find the keyboard

1217728
keyboard	mouse
the user has begun integration with the user-interface .so significant mouse movement or keyboard activity

1217747
instance-variables	local-variables
couldn t possibly work in all cases without at the very least the iterator block aspects being able to prevent the closure aspects from applying certain transformation for efficiency like promoting local-variables to instance-variables rather than a fully fledged closure class

1217780
order	add
i would like to add an elements to a list that preserve the order of the list

1217790
spring	guice
spring is an extremely useful piece of software and my personal favorite but there are many alternatives such as guice

1217791
value	field
if it s possible for a field to be null you should have a test that makes sure that your code handles null value correctly

1217812
instrumentation	profiling
the way this is measured is by either instrumentation or sampling within a profiling

1217826
create-table	alter-table
i would checked what create-table or alter-table statements you are using and make sure they are all creating a single primary key

1217872
versioning	upgrade
in this case because sql dialects differ you want to run the possibly generator sql against the correct versioning of your rdbms rather than attempting to mock all quirks of your rdbms and .so that any rdbms upgrade that change functionality are caught by your tests

1217896
entity-framework	data-access
for example you might decide to switching from using microsoft linq-to-sql to using the microsoft entity-framework as your data-access technology

1217896
entity-framework	ado.net
after successfully using linq-to-sql i thought it would be nice to try out ado.net entity-framework since i ve been reading a lot about this

1217922
perl	ruby
i m thinking with going with ruby i own a book on it but i ve never had a good reason to learn it too well but i m certainly open to others perl obviously springs to mind

1217926
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer and firefox 3.5 finally showed me an alert messages .when i just added a dot

1217926
hosts-file	hosts
by the way my hosts-file while altered for other hosts has nothing special going on with localhost

1217943
ubuntu	linux
i think that on my ubuntu linux machine the files are stored at usr include

1217946
configuration	environment
something about the configuration or your environment may be limiting maximum frame-rate to your monitor s refresh rate

1217948
include	ssi
obviously this would need to be done in a cgi scripting or web application or possibly with ssi server-side include

1217954
json	xml
binary video audio files or text json xml html

1217990
python	tcl
personally i d recommend tcl since it does regex very well and it s handling of unicode is for all intents and purposes completely transparency -- much better unicode support than python for example

1217990
python	ruby
ruby python bash are all fine too as are many other scripting languages

1217990
tcl	lua
lua is also easy to integrated from what i ve heard though i personally don t see a compelling reason to choose it over tcl from a technical standpoint

1217998
for-loop	arrays
you won t necessarily know how many items you have in the value arrays at the end .so you might want to put the printing into a for-loop rather than assume you have a fifth item

1217998
while-loop	arrays
skip the body arrays and just do what you need to in the while-loop

1218001
airplane	wifi
there is no way to disable phone functionality and at the same time maintain network functionality of any types 3g wifi or bluetooth if you disable the phone operations with airplane mode all of them are disabled

1218025
http	ssl
i ve had problems with the ssl route before and setting the server back to http resolved it assuming this is acceptable to you

1218036
velocity	xwiki
does anyone know the best way to insert some text into an xwiki document preferably using groovy though velocity will work too

1218043
any	set
if for example you have an asp.net repeater object and you databind a list of object to it this notation is used to pre-populate value that could not be set at any points except during the databind lifecycle

1218043
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the other notations and are more standards and you ll see these far more often than the other syntax previously discussed especially if you use something like asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms

1218043
if-statement	loops
the syntax execute arbitrary scripting inline and nothing more but allows you to write entire blocks of .net code such as if-statement while loops for loops etc

1218054
perl	ruby
this syntax is something that has become more than just shell - it s also a handy construct in perl and ruby

1218057
put	get
put another way .when i create a new list in sharepoint do a bunch of templates files allitems.aspx dispform.aspx etc. get written to the filesystems somewhere

1218084
databound	formview
in your scenario you have to modify date in your formview databound event .when you are showing data to user rather setting date-format in bind properties

1218097
drupal	django	joomla	drupal
but if you re looking for some basic suggestions to help you along i would suggest looking at drupal mambo joomla and django

1218108
hash	md5
i m not sure what techniques are commonly used but any information that isn t stored and only compared username and passwd could possibly be hash for example sha1 or md5 on the client

1218116
any	set
in perl if you want to remove occurrences of any pattern of your above set that has less than 9 # d# s you can use the following

1218167
nested	assign
styles to the nested divs without assign it to each one

1218168
subtraction	addition
the above example was silly one but this is how addition and subtraction is done in general

1218174
realloc	malloc
the numbers is to be represented in a buffering arrays able to take on an arbitrary size which means using malloc and realloc as needed

1218181
twitter	tweets
i have read access but i didn t manage to send any tweets in his behalf twitter returns that the call is no authentication

1218185
subtraction	addition
you do that by giving each numbers three int s and using the same rules you should have learned back in primary school for addition subtraction and the other basic operations

1218185
subtraction	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base types and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1218185
32-bit	16-bit
i ve actually written libs to do this sort of stuff using the maximum powers of ten that can be fit into an int .when squared to prevent overflow .when multiplying two int s together such as a 16-bit int being limited to 0 through 99 to generator 9 801 32 768 .when squared or 32-bit int using 0 through 9 999 to generator 99 980 001 2 147 483 648 which greatly eased the algorithms

1218185
subtract	addition	subtraction	addition
3 addition of a positive and negative-number is subtraction and subtract a negative-number is the same as adding the equivalent positive

1218185
subtract	add
you can save quite a bit of code by having the add and subtract methods call each other after adjusting sign

1218185
subtraction	addition
for addition if sign are different use subtraction of the negation

1218185
subtraction	addition
for subtraction if sign are different use addition of the negation

1218185
digits	zero
the way in which this is achieved involves extraction each of the digits of 32 one at a time backwards then using add to calculate a value to be added to the result initially zero

1218185
digits	zero
in the example above we add 475 to zero 2 time the last digits of 32 to get 950 result 0 + 950 950

1218211
debugging	trace
i am confused about debugging trace statements

1218215
debugging	trace
trace statements are present in both debugging and release building

1218215
debugging	trace
you place both debugging and trace statements where you want to output the value of something for the purpose of debuggingging or checked

1218215
debugging	trace
this ms support article might be of interest how to trace and debugging in visual c#

1218228
contains	elements
if your span elementss are contains in other parent elements you can use this selector like this

1218229
data-structures	tree
you might get some ideas on how to implements this from some spatial data-structures like range or kd tree

1218231
any	set
setting the parent list item nodes as positioning relative means that if you set any child nodes within as positioning absolute it will be set relative not to the browser windows but to the parent list item

1218231
display	width
the width was added to have the sub-level list display as a line instead of a column

1218254
value	field
if your dataset contains an autoincrement field or one or more field have default value then this may be the problem

1218254
value	field
after calling .post field change their value in the db but that may not be detected by your dataset

1218259
contains	elements
.so i figured i could put the code there to modify the head elements of the contains page but no dice

1218265
sqrt	exp
.when you get into more complicated functions on some types of real representation of numbers log sqrt exp etc. things get even more complicated

1218273
mta	sta
look at this answer on stackoverflow to understand about sta vs mta single-threaded apartments vs multithreading apartments

1218287
llvm	gcc
if you had only 3 source files and assumed there were only two optimization levels per opportunity those being dont optimize or do optimize with gcc you would have 8 combinations to test with llvm the numbers of experiments is almost an order of magnitude higher

1218299
debugging	trace	error-logging	trace
both debugging and trace are used to output additional messages beyond normals error-logging for your application

1218299
debugging	trace
the main difference between debugging and trace is that trace is present in release building while debugging is not

1218299
debugging	trace
both debugging and trace are conditional compiled

1218299
debugging	trace
debugging by default is compiled into debugging building while trace by default is compiled into release building

1218324
easymock	jmock	rhino-mocks	moq
the second versioning is what i ve usually used in jmock easymock and rhino-mocks - but i don t have any experience with moq .so it may be more idiomatic to use the first form there

1218329
textbox	button
i m working on a directx application and was wondering how i could add a regular windows to the application one which has textbox cmd button and all

1218332
gridsplitter	grid
i presume this means using a grid with a gridsplitter but anything that works will do

1218338
python	perl
it may be a bit odd providing a perl scripting to answer a python question but it works for python just as well as it does for perl

1218342
order	add
.when you use oledb then you have to add the parameters in the same order as they appear in the query since the named that you give them are not used

1218347
strong-typing	types
the only problem with this is the weirdness of treating an instances of a object as a data types given that strong-typing is enforced on typess not the value of a types

1218363
javascript	dom
i haven t tested the following but it should be universally supported among browsers which have dom and javascript support

1218372
winmerge	ignore
if i open both versioning of a file in winmerge there look the same .when the ignore carriage return difference is checked

1218423
execute	declare
you will see the first pass-through the debugger merely declare the code function delegation to execute .when the service responds and the second pass is the actual process of that response starting at the inside of your delegation declaration

1218450
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome seem to be the only ones

1218471
version-control	git
is mercurial or git distribute version-control systemd can give me any more advantage over to subversion in home project

1218479
selected	button
if add elements button has been pressed elements gets class selected

1218479
selected	button
but if an active elements is selected too i want to replace add button with remove button - which removes class selected from active elements

1218483
.when	ready
if setup finds the updatereadymemo event function in the pascalscript it is called automatically .when the ready to install wizard page becomes the active page

1218495
document	editing
firstly this is time-consuming - editing each words document around 150 docs just to make minor changes

1218499
flash-media-server	wowza
there are three flash-video servers that i know of--adobe s own flash-media-server wowza and red 5

1218550
push	pull
if you want his changes you could pull them from his computer to where ever you like rather than allowing him to push them

1218552
csv	xml
personally i would recommend writing the data to a file in some well-known format such as xml or csv and then use a report-writing package to produce the actual report

1218570
tuples	sorted	contains	elements	contains	sorted
in this idiom you create a temporary list which contains tuples of your key s followed by your original data elements then call the normals .sort methods on that list or in more recent versioning of python simply wrap your decoration in a called to the sorted built-in function

1218570
tuples	sorted
that s a list-comprehension doing the undecorate from the sorted list of tuples which is being returned by the inner list-comprehension

1218570
tuples	set
the inner comprehension is creating a set of tuples your desired sorting key the 3rd elements of the list and the dictionary s key corresponding to the sorting key

1218574
javascript	dom
b javascript - you can dynamically generator dom elements on search pages using javascript

1218608
optional-parameters	named
c# 4 has improved this situation a lot though with named argumentss and optional-parameters ref arguments faking and com pia linking

1218641
google-maps	gps
i am trying to view a trip i have made using a gps tracking device onto google-maps as one continuous line however .when i upload the kml file onto google-maps it is arbitrarily broken into about 7 different segments

1218641
contains	elements
i have inspected the kml file and all coordinates are contains within the same single linestring elements

1218656
code-duplication	code-generation
you have to compensate with either code-generation which create code-duplication or do runtime dynamic form which is much more difficult

1218657
cvs	git	version-control	git	version-control	cvs
take a look at part about version-control for single developer in my answer to difference between git and cvs question here on stackoverflow

1218657
cvs	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
some of those issues do still apply also to subversion versus git or other distribute vcs mercurial bazaar or less known monotone darcs even if subversion is improvement over cvs

1218657
any	set
in subversion in any centralized version-control systemd you need to set up central repository unless you did that earlier using svnadmin create well you need to do that only once

1218657
revision	ignore
git stores both repository information about revision and branches etc. and repository metadata your identity list of ignore files which branch is currently checked out in .git directory in top directory of your project

1218657
version-control	git
git stores ignore patterns using in-tree gitignore file which can be put under version-control and distribute

1218657
any	set
however unlike the global-ignores option and in gitignore the patterns found in the svn ignore properties apply only to the directory on which that properties is set and not to any of its subdirectories

1218681
synchronous	.when
i would prefer if the methods was synchronous as asynchronous methodss tend to be a little complex .when integrated into a webpage and there is no need for such complexity as it is not a front-end user function

1218753
install	xubuntu
i m installing subversion on an xubuntu desktop systemd with apache2 install and running fine

1218759
.when	ready
.when you have narrowed down what you actually need you can take a deeper look into the alternatives to see which dbms are production ready for your use case

1218764
derived-class	base-class
if i have one base-class and i derive 10 different concrete derived-classes from it then will each and every concrete derived-class have a different vtable

1218771
virtual-functions	base-class
if the base-class or all of the derived classes have any virtual-functions then yes usually

1218771
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
.so a derived-class can only shared a vtable with a base-class if it doesn t overrides any virtual-functions

1218771
derived-class	base-class	member-functions	base-class	member-functions	derived-class
a derived-class can t shared a vtable with any other derived-class unless they both don t overrides any functions of the same base-class as - even if implements in the same way - the member-functions of one derived-class are a different types from the member-functions of a different derived-class

1218809
compatibility	platform
the eclipse platform and major product try to maintain compatibility as much as possible to encourage innovation see the policy in the wiki

1218841
cvs	git
also if at work they re still using punch cards cvs or subversion then using git at home is a great way to stay current and find out for yourself the impact it can have

1218856
for-loop	arrays
depending on what you are doing you could consider having each statement be a delegation create an arrays of delegation and run a for-loop across the arrays

1218856
arrays	loops
that way loops is just two line one that checked the conditional and .when that execute the delegation at the current arrays positioning

1218859
exception-handling	try-catch
what about having those methods throw a custom exception-handling and put a try-catch for the specific exception-handling within your loops

1218863
shell	bash
is there any special use of c in shell scripting mainly in bash and korn shell

1218902
value	field	getter	setter
you have a private field and then you return the value of that field in the getter and set the value of that field in the setter

1218933
ftp-client	ftplib
i m using python ftplib to write a small ftp-client but some of the functions in the package don t return string output but printing to stdout

1218933
buffering	streaming
i m looking for something like the bufferingedreader in java that can be used to wrap a buffering into a streaming

1218936
execute	prepare
unfortunately the subdirectories target execute once making the prepare target but doesn t execute again for the building target

1218940
file-descriptor	pipe
use pipe and write to the appropriate file-descriptor

1218953
priority-queue	heap
the best way to do this is to maintain a heap sorted priority-queue that you pop off of once it has 100 entries in it

1218962
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i had the uinavigationcontroller and the uitabbarcontroller on the same level

1218976
arrays	loops
.when i have a collections of different measurements in measurements i want to add a value to just one arrays elements in the diff arrays and then loops through it then where the arrays elements got updates checked for corresponding index arrays elements in the measurements arrays en deduct it from there

1218988
selected	textbox
i need to insert the text of a selected textbox into a hidden-field i m not quite sure how to achieve that

1218989
python	tcl	python	lua	tcl	lua
use an extension language such a python tcl or lua

1219060
exponentiation	mod
that is .when you compute mod a p n reduce the result mod n at each step of the exponentiation where p has been expressed in a binary form

1219081
double	int	boolean	double	boolean	int
i ve got object_getinstancevariable to work as here however it seems to only work for floats boolean and int not double

1219101
highlight	cell
.when a cell has the focus it s highlight display doesn t cover the whole td rather only the visual spaces include in the input button

1219105
photoshop	layer
your best bet is to contact the original site s webmaster and see if they can send you the original images hopefully in photoshop or some other format where the original layer are preserve separately

1219157
markup	mathml
that was one of the reasons mathml content markup was created and also why mathml is used in mathematica

1219157
markup	mathml
to accomplish what you are after you ll have to have mathml with comibned presentation and content markup see mathml specifications

1219157
mathml	latex
in my opinion your best bet is to use mathml even if it is verbose and convert to latex .when necessary

1219157
mathml	latex
that said i also like latex syntax best and maybe what we need is a compact syntax for mathml something similar in spirit to relaxng compact syntax

1219160
constructor	object
the place where a string is passed is called a constructor - a special methods that sets up a new object

1219164
groovy	java
using jmockit you could write in java below see here about using it with groovy

1219170
google-chrome	safari
this is actual console output from my scripting .when resizing the browser windows this is google-chrome but the same happens in safari 4

1219188
double	int
now you you know the head returned you a character your list contains int double char and is terminate by null_type

1219197
jmockit	junit
my project jmockit a toolkit for developer testing particularly for unit-testing with mocks contains a good numbers of tests mostly using junit 4

1219208
ssl-certificate	ssl
the problem i am having is that the server request that i use ssl but the server is also configure with a non-standard ssl-certificate

1219223
value	field
i relise that normally for a from to get and append query-string params it needs to have hidden form field .so i could write a utility function that automatically adds a bunch of hidden form field-for any query-string value but i wanted to checked that there s wasn t an easier approach or maybe i m going about it the wrong way

1219252
post-build-event	pre-build-event
.when you specify pre- and post-build events via vs ide vs adds two msbuild properties to the underlying project file pre-build-event and post-build-event

1219253
bazaar	git
aside from details about the many wonderful features of hg git darcs bazaar and friend no sarcasm

1219253
cvs	git
git hg and others are loaded with features and misfeatures that make them different from svn and cvs

1219264
testng	junit
junit 3.8 junit 4.5+ and testng 5.8+ are supported

1219281
zen-cart	magento
i m not sure if zen-cart or magento will do the above - anyone have any experience of the same

1219285
google-chrome	safari
i am testing some jquery in google-chrome safari and i just cant seem to solve this error

1219298
shell	bash
as an added bonus this is portable to windows as well without requiring using a cygwin bash shell or similar

1219303
environment	building
install in each user count the corresponding python versioning with an user-local prefix like building python and add building bin to the path environment variables of the user

1219303
installation	environment
the advantage of this approach is the perfect isolation between the individual python installation and relatively convenient selection of the correct python environment just su to the appropriate user

1219321
authentication	login
all published authentication plugins are ored as long as one of them allow to login everything is ok

1219330
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have an iphone .app that uses an uitabbarcontroller which contains two uinavigationcontroller each of which in turn contains one or more tableviewcontrollers actually customized uiviewcontroller implements uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource

1219341
value	field
the value the user entered for a given field or control

1219341
checkbox	listbox	checkbox	textbox	listbox	textbox
and to apply this to a textbox dropdownlistfor listbox or checkbox you just need to add this attributes

1219341
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
...or this for a radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist

1219346
radio-button	selected
you will need to add some extra logic to your change event handler to detection whether the radio-button was selected or deselected

1219364
.net	csla	.net	wcf	csla	wcf
if i want to use entity-framework or linq-to-sql over the .net i have to put something like wcf in between and that multiplies the work and complexity enormously to the points where i think it is much more verbose than csla

1219388
value	field
you can also implements your own readonly silverlight dependency-properties in a similar manner though it ll required a private field to indicate whether you re setting or reverting the value

1219391
configuration	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if apple upgrade the pre-installed versioning of apache php your machine-specific configuration wouldn t be overrides as it would in the case of using pre-installed apache php

1219399
web-services	api
you are better off reading the files off the network path and then using the object-model api or the web-services to upload it

1219404
debugging	trace
below is the full debugging trace

1219406
put	get
i put this in the init .py file in my project and then call it from anywhere in my package to get a file relative to the package

1219413
required	checked
if the developers are commenting checked ins to your source repository and the classes methods properties are named in such a way that their purpose is immediately obvious what additional documentation are your developers being required to provide

1219417
deep-copy	object
how about making a deep-copy of the object being returned

1219423
constructor	object
in java and other languages with constructor calling the constructor will return a new initializer of the object that is ready to go

1219423
constructor	object
in other words if you have a constructor that takes a single object arguments then that s the only constructor that can

1219423
constructor	object
you cannot create another constructor that also takes a single object arguments

1219452
javadoc	phpdoc	javadoc	doxygen	doxygen	phpdoc
if you have some kind of building-process in-place like continuous-integration you could have that building fail if at least the auto-generation of documentation like javadoc phpdoc doxygen fails or report problems

1219465
dictionary	map
i figured i could preload all the relative cgpoint for the cities based on the imageview map into a dictionary .so i can reference them during a touchesbegan event but i m quickly getting in over my head and possibly going about this the wrong way

1219466
rollback	commit
dedicated for the day committer will commit patches into tree automated testing starts after each commit automatically rollback to working state after patch fail. added plus smaller more frequent and higher quality patches because they want to help the reviewer and get their patch in and in addition let all tests pass

1219478
directory	folder
i then changed the file etc init.d apache2 inorder to enable public_html folder for users corresponding to the directory setting -d userdir

1219483
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome donâ t support these events on links and or form field in all circumstances

1219486
environment	building
ian bicking s virtualenv allows me to have isolated pythons for each application i building and lets me decide whether or not to include the global site-packages in the isolated python environment

1219494
explode	implode
first you probably want to use implode and not explode to construct your variables

1219548
python	java
how is this done in java and python

1219551
firefox	safari
but if i use mac osx either safari or firefox i cannot drag the volume in the flash although i can see the mouse turn into pointers

1219554
similarity	distance
distance understood as similarity between two strings

1219578
textbox	button
bonus points for being able to overrides themes of user-interface elements textbox button scrollbar

1219580
arrays	map
in java for associativity arrays use map

1219596
println	output
just println on the elements object won t work because tostring won t output the xml format and won t go through its child nodes

1219607
member-functions	pure-virtual
but we can make a class abstract by making any of the member-functions as pure-virtual

1219607
abstract-class	pure-virtual
.when we are creating abstract-class is it a good practice to make the destructor also pure-virtual

1219616
firefox	safari
sqlite isn t written in .net but there is a .net adaptor with linq-to-entities support and it is portable to all platform you re likely to consider it s used for instances in firefox safari adobe lightroom apple s aperture and skype

1219659
sql-server	oracle
i have a .net winform click-once-deployed fat client that talks to three databases 2 sql-server databases and a oracle one

1219671
multiplication	addition
if the compiler is not awesome then i d say that the second versioning should be faster if only because i m avoiding the implicit pointers addition that comes with the thunk as well as removing the multiplication for the y and z indic

1219676
any	set
problem now that i ve converted to 3.0 i have to use the tabbar to go back and forth between this tableview and any of the other views two time before it will set the switching value

1219678
implements	abstract
option 2 can be made easier by using another libs that implements mutexes for a large variety of platform and provides you with a unified abstract interface

1219681
versioning	migrate
it seems the best route forwarding is to migrate this project to the latest versioning of java and migrate the j++ .sln solution file to an eclipse project file

1219696
if-statement	loops
an if-statement in the inner loops of your program can add a surprising amount of overhead -- see is if expensive

1219697
radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textarea
where can i find information like how to make input textinput passwd radio-button checkbox and textarea in a software made with java

1219699
persistent	transient
.when we deal with transient object we can use the business key semantics to compare object and have a merge strategy available if you try to persistent two transient object with same business key but different value in the remainder attributes

1219700
jaxp	jdom
not supported in the standards jaxp api i used the jdom libs for this purpose

1219721
contains	elements
an itemscontrol is a types of control that can contains multiple items such as strings object or other elements

1219722
smalltalk	forth
truth in advertising i never learned ruby but the object-class relation has to be the one smalltalk set forth 30 years ago

1219735
constructor	private
you guarantee that it cannot be initializer even internal to the class itself this is why private constructor may not be enough you get the virtual behavior you want for the destructor and you do not have to find and tag another methods that doesn t need virtual dispatcher as virtual

1219736
selected	cell
.when a user selected an items i want to draw an edit control in that cell

1219747
sql-server	oracle
i think if you have configure the oracle server as a linked-server in your sql-server you don t need separate oracle drivers

1219748
required	checked
imageio.write required a renderedimage .so a quick instances checked might be good enough

1219757
configuration	installation
that means that a company that wants to use buildbot on say 10 project needs to maintain 10 different sets of buildbot installation master-slaves configuration open ports website with output etc.

1219782
processor	cpu
generally speaking .when you load a single value and it isn t hot in caching the cpu will pull in a caching line 32 64 or 128 bytes are pretty typical depending on processor

1219792
linux	bsd
if you are using a linux systemd and probably any nix or bsd flavout as well then yes it is possible if the ftp-server is mounted as a filesystemds on your machine like tyler mchenry wrote

1219792
directory	folder
then .when the folder is opened in nautilus you can find the mounted directory in .gvfs and then you should be able to compile it without any trouble at all

1219827
qpainter	qimage	qpainter	qwidget	qwidget	qimage
drawpoint draw a pixels on both a internal qimage and using qpainter on a qwidget thats the drawing area

1219831
postorder	preorder
how can i find the preorder listing of a tree if only the postorder listing is given and vice versa

1219831
children	nodes	children	tree
also in the tree every non-leaf nodes has two children each nodes has either two or zero children.

1219831
postorder	preorder
i think that ought to get rid of the ambiguity of a single preorder or postorder being able to uniquely identify a tree

1219833
pixels	line
you ll need to tracking the last pixels location and either draw a line or add extra points in between the last positioning and the current positioning

1219837
pixels	line
you need to interpolation a line between the pixels for which you get events

1219843
32-bit	64bit
one of my disappointments in moving to a screamin 64bit box was that visual-studio 2008 only runs as 32-bit

1219878
.net	wcf
interesting idea and approach but i don t think there s any way to do this right now in wcf in .net 3.5

1219880
qwebpage	qwebkit
how to follow a link href in qwebkit specifically qwebpage

1219880
click	mouse
i can t do it and i don t want to even if i could by simulating a mouse click as i don t use qwebview thus i don t have the page rendering

1219884
updating	updates
updates every other pixels in the first iterator using only value from their neighbors which you re not updating and then run a second pass where you updates the pixelss you read from before based on the value of the pixelss you updatess before

1219884
local-variables	class-members
another thing that may help is to prefer local-variables over globals or class-members

1219892
textmate	vim
i managed to achieve this in textmate and am now looking to start working with vim

1219897
ubuntu	linux
in any case on my linux systemd ubuntu with a 2.6.28 kernel sigev_callback doesn t seem to be defined anywhere but sigev_thread works as advertised

1219897
linux	unix
some versioning of unix such as qnx include a sigev_signal_thread flag which allows you to invoke handler using a specified existing thread but this doesn t seem to be available on linux nor does it seem to even be a part of the pthreads standards

1219904
abstract-class	subclassing
myclass contains a methods definition public abstract void mymethods but does not specify an implementation - an implementation must be provided by a subclassing usually referred to as a concrete subclassing .so an abstract-class defined an interface perhaps with .some implementation detail

1219904
required	checked
in the collections api it provides type-safety for collections that otherwise that otherwise required boilerplate to checked types and cast appropriately

1219906
binary-search-tree	nodes
caveat this can only be done if this is a binary-search-tree which constrains nodes such that

1219926
children	nodes
this nodes will have exactly two leaf children which precede this nodes in postorder listing

1219926
children	nodes	children	tree
in your tree add that internal nodes and make two preceding nodess in the listing its children

1219926
children	nodes
remove those two children from listing and make that internal nodes a leaf

32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
.so i would like to support up to 64bit architectures right now while al.so supporting existing 32 and 16-bit archs. my current .solution is for new_state s base to just be a uint64_t and manually casting to 16 and 32-bit as needed

1219947
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
no use re-inventing the wheel where the wheel is c++ perl python etc. .when you can just learn a few keyword

1219950
versioning	upgrade	versioning	migrate	upgrade	migrate
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of the client libs migrate to google api 3.0

1219958
subclassing	superclass
it implies that the class can not be initializer i can only be used as a superclass or that a methods must be overrides by a subclassing

1219961
subclassing	superclass
subclassing may want to overrides the properties and have the superclass respect that

1219984
abstract-class	pure-virtual
all you need for an abstract-class is at least one pure-virtual function

1219989
arrays	loops
.so i have stored them in an arrays allarrayss and loops it to compare

1220025
fwrite	fread
this is also why in most of the more reliable c libs that use arrayss you see the size of the arrays passed as a parameter fread fwrite

1220046
hash	md5
how can i get the md5 hash of it

1220063
arrays	loops
what i don t get it how to get around it - i tried creating an arrays outside loops and changing

1220113
e-commerce	product
for example if you have a many-to-many relationship between say product and order in a typical e-commerce application and you need it to be fastest to query the product in a given order then you can store data in a denormalization way to support that and gain some benefit

1220118
contains	any
the y and d verbs take any movement as their subject. thus yw is yank from here the cursor to the end of the current next big words and y a is yank from here to the line contains the mark named a .

1220118
any	set
vi has 26 marks and 26 registers. a mark is set to any cursor location using the m cmd

1220118
contains	any
thus . +21g foo d means delete any line containss the string foo from the current one through the next 21 line while means from here to the end of the file delete any line which don t contains the string bar.

1220118
contains	any
thus you can use a bg foo j to join any line contains the string foo to its subsequent line if it lies between the line between the a and b marks

1220118
perl	awk
usually it s far easier to write such macros using perl awk sed which is in fact like grep a utility inspired by the ed cmd

1220125
data-structures	trie
computing the trie or other data-structures does required parsing all of your code to get a list of all of the symbols in your project

in my case this list contains the locals parameters if in a methods members field and methodss static only unless in an instances methods and no private-members of base types globals types and constants for the language i m working on and keyword

1220226
expression	evaluation
as a first step in evaluation the expression in #1 we selected the item from the context enumerator with the named aa giving us an ideclaration for the next step

1220228
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
i have a list of li tags and i can hide and show no problem through r.js based on user-input but what the data gets saved and then the user comes back the next day how do i make it .so the page comes with the elements still hidden

1220229
common-lisp	lisp
the difficult part is that common-lisp and some other lisp gets rid of the source code

1220240
jquery	.post
i ve include a small example below but checkout this jquery dev grouping .post for a more in-depth example q structure+plugin+authoring#72cf730045d4333a

1220243
directory	folder
what i ve tried .so far is downloading the zipped folder and extraction it to my c++ folder and then setting the ide to search for directory in the fltk folder but that doesn t work - i think it s a bigger problem than just looking for headers

1220249
python	java
i was in basically the same boat as you albeit with less experience and i started with python rather than java and what worked best for me was sitting down and reading kernighan-and-ritchie

1220261
value	field
what you re wanting to do would probably involve javascript acting on the onkey___ events of the textfield in question to validation and if necessarily modify the value of the field

1220264
onkeydown	onkeyup
this seems like an annoying user experience but if you insist then you can use the onkeyup onkeydown onkeypress listener onkeyup is likely sufficient

1220289
textbox	button
i ve a function which is responsible for some validation disabling and enabling of some textbox and a grouping of radio button ..

1220301
value	field
i found that capturing the keypress event or better yet keyup event and re-writing the field value on that was fairly good

1220304
binary-compatibility	compatibility
any examples demonstrating where source compatibility is broken yet binary-compatibility is maintained is welcome

1220310
authentication	login
it might not have been for a login but it was still used for authentication

i did find this methods gitdiff.bat and gitdiff.rb that copies the files out to old new temp directory and then does a folder compare on them

1220337
bitwise-operators	operators
you can do this in several ways - probably the best way to do this is with bitwise-operators and binary shift operators looking up into a dispatcher table to map it into viewable ascii

1220340
python	php	python	java
can i use this protocols with php to make my bots or must it be java or python based

typemock	moq
i have been testing mocking frameworks moq and typemock specifically

1220367
typemock	moq
unfortunately i did not recording actual numbers in my tests regarding moq vs typemock but the performance benefit of moq is signficant in my experience

1220370
export	csv
export it to csv or another easily parse-able text format and then writing a quick scripting to rename things would probably be the fastest methods

1220372
hide	show
.so you re user click .some stuff or submit .something and li items show hide

1220372
contains	set
i would set a cookies which contains a string of the li items that are to be hidden

1220372
ruby	php
i don t know ruby .so the cookies code i edited out is based off php lingo

1220391
contains	elements
you may even create the user-interface elements child canvas and the paths it contains on the worker thread and then get the resulting xaml to return to the main thread

1220395
z-index	overlay
this would push overlay into a new directx layer not to be confused with browser layer ie z-index

1220427
jquery	.post	webforms	asp.net

a binary-tree can be encode using two functions l and r such that for a nodes n l n give the left child of n r n give the right child of n

1220579
binary-tree	nodes
let minbranch l r x be a simple recursive algorithm for taking a binary-tree encode by the l and r functions together with the root nodes x for the binary-tree and returns the shortest branch of the binary-tree

1220602
for-loop	arrays
the problem is the following .when i extraction the nsdictionary key value using nsenumerator - but also tried with a slower for-loop and add the resulting object into the mutablearrays the value of the object inside the arrays get initializer to the same object for all preceeding value

1220602
arrays	loops
by the time i am done with the enumerator and reach the end of loops my arrays looks like this all object are identical

1220605
frame	width	height	frame
a uiscrollview with paging enabled will stop at multiples of its frame width or height

uiscrollview	subviews
then set your subviews s sizes however big you need them to be and set their centering based on multiples of the uiscrollview s width

1220605
uiscrollview	subviews
create a uiview subclassing clipview that will contains the uiscrollview and it s subviews

1220606
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari and google-chrome

1220609
dev-to-production	migrate
while it s not 100 identical for obvious reasons it s been no trouble to migrate apps from dev-to-production

1220615
subclassing	base-class
base-class has a few different subclassing

1220615
contains	any
whenever that list contains instances of any subclassing an exception-handling occurs during after the service is returning to the request channel

1220615
contains	any
if the list does not contains any subclassing it works fine

1220620
value	field
couple this with the out-of-the-box previous function which allows you to access the previous value of a field and you have a solution

1220620
value	field
this compares the previous value of the department field with the current value and if they are different it makes the top border of this detail row to be solid

1220654
radio-button	selected
click the jump to report radio-button and selected the detail report from the dropdownlistfor

button	popup
instead of just drag-and-drop do the drag-and-drop with the right mouse button and .when you release in the context menu that popup choose svn move versioned files here

1221001
click	mouse
the easiest way is to right mouse drag the directory and click svn move versioned files here .when you drop

1221008
scala	java
the problem is that the java collections is not a scala collections

1221019
display	width
i have one table which display data as from dynamic-content i want to make table width 100 .when there is 6 cols

1221030
updating	updates
the big plus for this approach will be in case of order reshufflings there might not be changes on individual object but since order is persistent as an index field inside the order item table rows you will have to issue an updates cmd for each one of the rows updating their index field

1221071
debugging	trace
all the relevant trace macros are in-place to send messages to the debugging windows however i m having difficulties in finding a way to prevent the spam there

1221088

1221190
triggers	insert
it would be insert into via a triggers stored procedure and it would look like this

1221191
folder	dir
note inside your c program files microsoft sdks windows v6.1 bin folder you will find wsdl.exe or just do a dir s inside your c program files

1221292
httpd.conf	hosts
i ve put the above code in my virtual hostss in apache configuration i read in some forums that rewritemap only works if you have access in httpd.conf and virtual hosts

1221308
python	tcl	python	java
some time ago i made java to tcl xotcl and java to python translators to evaluate the translation posibility

1221308
python	java
they convert syntax but do not make relevant constructions translation java file operations to python ones

1221310
profiling	trace
well sql profiling would be my suggestion but you d need to be careful having that running because it does introduce a performance overhead .when you have a trace running

any	set
are there any disassembly which provide a feature set comparable to ida pro

1221354
decrement	increment
i wouln t consider it good styles to increment n without decrement it first in any other case

1221358
postgresql	mysql
you shouldn t copy files from postgresql directory just like in mysql - because chances are you will not be able to use them these files are architecture operating systemd and compile-options dependent

1221369
put	get
if the value is still 0 after the decrement you get the resource otherwise your entity is put into a queue

1221388
value	field
the question is if there is no need to updates the row because the set value is already the same as the field value will those rows counted as the affected row

1221391
configuration	environment	environment	building
additional question imo you should use a building tool which would include running of tests and potentially any configuration tweak for live environment

1221395
installation	building
the module installation contains an embedded versioning of maven for building in the ide however it s highly recommended that you use command-line maven for building

1221420
updating	updates
this effect can be very dramatic doing relatively large amounts of work to give users a correct and often updating status of progress can of course slow down the actual running time of the application screens updates progress display needed calculations etc while still giving the user the feeling it takes less time

1221420
updating	updates
if you have something updating during an operation make sure it updates often like the almost ridiculous showing of filenames and registry key during an install or make sure there s an option to make it do this for users that like this behavior

1221444
children	nodes
but componentgroup should have only collections of root nodes direct children - components collections

1221452
administration	account
or else run the .app scripting in built-in administration account or in a normals admin account with uac off

1221470
.when	ready
the processor is connect to certain ips which triggers interrupts .when they are ready with data

1221475
salt	md5
you could also use numeric indexes instead of the md5 and salt if you dont like the long md5 strings or the uniqid function

1221488
hash	md5	salt	md5
you should always use a salt md5 hash to secure your session

1221496

especially if you use captcha for more than just signup reset-password forms login forms .

1221509
sql-server	oracle
as a lesson now i know if you have some more than one large transactional getting execute on the same database at the same time you ll sure have problems in sql-server i don t know about oracle

1221524
implements	extends
any class extends the abstract-class will have to implements only its abstract-methods and members and will have some default implementsation of the other methods of the abstract-class which you may overrides or not

1221524
abstract	extends	implements	abstract	implements	extends
finally you can implements as many interfaces as you want but only extends one class being it abstract or not

1221538
any	set
i could set column.optionsfilter.immediateupdateautofilter to true after binding the gridview cause i don t defined any column before databinding.

1221556
implements	extends
the key difference is that you can implements multiple interfaces in a class but only extends a single abstract-class

1221559
difference	count
just wondering if any of you guys use count 1 over and if there is a noticeable difference in performance or if this is just a legacy habit that has been brought forwarding from days gone past

1221573
value	field
the count field in object will have the same value for every object with the same application .so it doesn t matter which one you get this data from

1221592

i m trying to updates the value of a field based on a selected box selected option and the quantity of few quantity field it works fine for the first field but it wouldn t work for the rest

1221614
value	field
if you choose a pizza for the first time and add toppings to it the value of the updates price field will increase as expected now if you change your pizza with the same toppings only the first topping will be added to the price and not the other ones

1221618
one-to-many	entity
i m fairly certain this is not possible and the solution is to expose the entity using one-to-many which i have done in the past but because this field is simply a pk i thought there maybe some clever mapping to save me this work

1221629
show	next
in iphone tips .app .when u scroll view from right-to-left thay have show view being comppresed.it gives the effect like .when u will open pages in book.like .when u go go next next page in a note book.how to achive this.including the fonts in page will also get compressed.how to achive this

1221634
attributes	properties
.when using properties that have the retain attributes you have to release the properties in dealloc using or by releasing the backing variables

1221642
queue	fifo
the isrs can be decoupled from tasks by use of a thread-safe fifo queue

1221642
queue	fifo
if task1 is just producing data the same mechanism may be used if you have a queue fifo in which task1 can write data which can be read by task 2 then the tasks are decoupled

1221642
if-statement	for-loop
- brew your own my experience should only be done if it is as simple as a for-loop and a few if-statement

as per the user s preferences .i will provide various options-various databases like sql-server access oracle to the user and he can selected any one from it ans start doing integration with the data of that external database

1221737
sql-server	ms-access	sql-server	oracle	ms-access	oracle
i will always have an sql-server database also in my application to which i want to transfer data from the connect eternal database sql-server ms-access oracle .do i need to have 2 data-access layer

for navigation i find nerdtree ctags ack and possibly some custom scripting written in perl or whatever

1221800
svg	vml
if the text should rotate you could do it with vml svg canvas but in that case you might just be better off with flash

maya	3ds
personally i d say skip all the open source apps go downloading either 3ds max learning edition or maya learning edition take a few years off

1221820
exception-handling	try-catch
another methods is still using try-catch but having a single methods to throw exception-handling etc back to the user

1221820
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
it s not exactly hard to try-catch everything especially with the snippets in visual-studio and sharpdevelop

1221836
children	nodes
object and then create addchild and setparent methods inorder to add children to the nodes or set the nodes s parent

1221838
exception-handling	try-catch
you might want to put a try-catch about you main methods although i consider this to be a serious misuse of exception-handling except you want to append a logger or sth

1221847
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
md5 is considered deprecated - at least for cryptography purposes but i would suggest only using md5 for backwards-compatibility with existing stuff

1221847
hash	md5
you should have a good reason to go with md5 .when we do have other hash algos out there that aren t at least yet broken

1221854
while-loop	for-loop
a better option would be to use a while-loop instead of a for-loop with the checked of the flag in the while conditional

1221859
constructor	private	constructor	object
you can avoid this by requiring client code to always use the companion-object to create a rational object by making the implicit constructor private

1221902
g++	gcc
this code with a compiles fine in g++ but throw up linker errors .when compiled with gcc

1221912
g++	gcc
your code is c++ .so it must be compiled with g++ the c++ compiler not gcc the c compiler

1221920
spring	guice
this is obviously trivial in spring as it is based on named instances to which you attach a scoping but i can t see the equivalent in guice which is about binding types to implementation classes

1221933
salt	md5
md5 _session username . salt

1221933
salt	md5
if md5 _session username . salt

1221933
salt	md5
no one is cracking your damn md5 who cares if it is salt

1221943

i ve been looking at the way resiznig works in cocoa-touch and it looks like without writing any code a uiview cannot be set up to size itself based on the size of it s children

1221988
mbunit	nunit
nunit mbunit

1221989
required	checked
continuous-integration doesn t required tools just the plain overhead without any value of checked stuff in often enough that the building is never broken

1222010

but what i have to do because drawrect gets called automatically is make some instances variables of the view available to contains the numberofsides which the controllers would set

1222103
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
case-sensitive collations distinguish between query and query case-insensitive do not

1222129
updating	updates
your model object would know how to updates what should be in the second field and send a messages back to your controllers that the second column has changed and needs updating

1222130
value	field
but the main thing to know is that this is the standards way to retrieve value from a data reader .when a null field does not represent an exceptional situation in the application domain

1222144
worksheet	excel
the excel sheet templates has some macros and few formula calculated and its not the normals excel worksheet

1222262
value	field
locking is not required because you have a single writer scenario and a boolean field is a simple structure with no risk of corrupting the state while it was possible to get a boolean value that is neither false nor true

1222268
search-engine	seo
it s not hard to understand seo search-engine optimization nowadays - ensuring you have the correct meta-tags and other se info will give you a big helping hand

1222357
button	popup	selected	button
you can drag the versioned folder to the destination folder using the right mouse button and .when your mouse pointers is over the desired drop location let the button go and selected the svn export all items here option from the context menu that popup

1222372
contains	elements
if your source vector contains a lot of elements you should consider resizing destination vector to make it work faster as in goz answer

1222388
contains	any
i have tried contains but that returns me all users on any of the servers which is kind of the opposite to what i m looking for

1222407

edit i m thinking that it may involve scripting a solution especially if i want to handle firefox 3.0 3.5 google-chrome

1222480
value	field
is it possible to change the value of the field period from an overrides methods

1222484
paintcomponent	draw	protected	public
i would refactor the drawing code out of the paintcomponent methods of your implementation of jpanels to a public package protected methods in that panels which can draw to an arbitrary graphics object of any width height presumably that the drawing code is general enough

1222484
transparency	frame
the code basically resize the frame show the user a confirm messages .so the thread can be blocked until the repaint is done could be done by thread-sleep but it s more transparency using a messages

1222599
key-value	key
well if you have entire rows as duplicates in your table you ve at least not got a primary key set up for that table otherwise at least the primary key-value would be different

1222612
filtering	grouping
just make a selected statement grouping by all the field of a table and filtering using a having clause where the count is greater than 1

1222613
beautifulsoup	lxml.html
for post-processing i ve had a lot of success with beautifulsoup but lxml.html is a good choice too

1222618
erlang	scala
i m not familiar with scala but it uses similar principles to erlang s and i feel somewhat comfortable there

1222618

1222656
textbox	button
also .when i press enter in any of the textbox the search button is click how can i associate a textbox to a particular button

1222658
processor	cpu
if you are doing something useful process a lot of data then 100 cpu load just means that the processor is used in the most efficient way

1222687
put	get
the configration runs fine .when i run from a sample hosts page that lives on my apis site but .when i put the same page on a site outside of apis.www.mainsite.org i get a permission-denied error in ie on the first request to the service

1222699
perl	php
the main gain comes from not having to create a new php perl etc

1222713
pixels	line
i am currently using bresenham s algorithm to draw line but they are of course one pixels in thickness

1222723
scala	java
remember that scala can use java classes

1222732
duplicates	elements
duplicates my originallist and waste some memory the list could be quite big - more than 10 000 elements

1222781
google-chrome	safari
this works fine but there is an annoying problem in safari and google-chrome both keep showing page loading animation while any xmlhttprequest is active

1222783
any	set
alternatively set the causesvalidation properties of any button s you don t want to triggers validation .when pressed

1222785
pixels	line
tring to draw a set of parallels line to avoid overdraw to reduce write bandwidth and underdraw missing pixels would be quite complex

1222802
value	field
i m trying to get the field info of an arrays value from within a struct

1222802
value	field
this would return test2 types but i dont want the types of the arrays i want the fieldinfo or field of that structure .so i can set value from within it

1222823
openedge	dsn
odbc systemd dsn created using the progress openedge 10.2a drivers

1222834
assign	add
.so is there an expression i can add to the second query that will assign a numbers descending numbers to the ids

1222865
put	get
put a different way if a thread is wating on a mutex and a condition-variable is it safe to assume that it will be the next one to get the lock if it is signaled rather than some other thread that may be waiting on the lock

1222882
value	field
put the rules onto the control whose value you are changing .so in this case add the rules to the checkbox not the field you wish to clear

1222910
click	mouse
i get an item listener event .when the checkbox gets click and then i kind of assume this event comes from the rendering and toggle the appropriate value since i can t seem to figure out how to determine if the checkbox is presently checked or unchecked selection in this checkbox object seems to be whether the mouse has been click or let go rather than the checkbox state

1222913
invokerequired	begininvoke
but what really needs to be done is access it via the invokerequired and begininvoke technique

1222956
ftp	ssh
do for ftp or ssh accessible directory

1222957
python	c++
for now multiprocess instead of threading remains the way of choice for using multiple cores in cython ironpython and jython are fine too but they don t support python 3 currently nor do they make c++ integration all that easy either

1222959
beautifulsoup	lxml
others have recommended beautifulsoup but it s much better to use lxml

you can replace the bufferedreader and bufferedwriter with objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to accomplish this

1223097
dictionary	arrays
what you can do is either have an arrays of arrayss or a dictionary key it by the section numbers or in case of the arrays they will be inorder of the section numberss now to retreive a switching all you do assuming you know the section and the row numbers

1223099
interpolation	splines
and then .when you re given the x-value you can use some sort of interpolation linear kubic splines you named it to approximate the missing value

1223134
perl	php	perl	c++
if i m talking about executable properly compiled c++ programs not scripting like perl php ... and if we consider the process spwan cost and db new connection cost negligible then this approach fastcgi is just a sort of small gain compared to plain cgi executable

1223134
perl	php
again i m not talking about scripting perl php ... i m talking about compiled cgi

1223140
multiplying	addition	multiplication	multiplying	multiplication	addition
thanks to the distributive properties of multiplication and addition you can sum those two together and multiplying this single sum by all of its continuations

1223148

1223177
perl	awk
rather than using the sed solution i gave you might like either of these in perl and awk

1223180
export	report
many of the key points of cr api canned report export to various formats are just as applicable to report service

1223181
any	set
.when selected returns the wrapper probably goes over read set first invoking read callback then write set then looks if any of the timers have expired and invokes those callback

children	nodes	children	tree
have the model install a treewillexpandlistener on the tree and .when a nodes will expand load it s children at this time

1223260
children	nodes	children	tree
this allows for lazy-loading of the children and you will only need as many tree nodes in memory as visible nodes on the tree

1223260
children	nodes	children	tree
since children are loaded and maybe unloaded by your treewillexpandlistener you can traversal the tree looking for equivalent alias or register each nodes with some sort of key list of nodes map

1224272
value	field
as i understand it the zipentry named is the named part of the named-value pair the data is the value part and - here s the whacky bit - the extra field of zipentry holds a mime types which explains how the data is to be interpreter as a byte arrays as string data or as a url points to the real data

1224282
hash	md5
the first part is just a header but the last part which you will note is the same in the two certificates is an rsa signature of the md5 hash of the colliding messages

rsa with the private-key being discarded is listed as an example

1224688
display	width
.when the button is click to display the text my edit and delete button align on top of eachother as opposed to being side to side .so i need to adjust the width of the gridview in javascript

1224730
default-value	default
this is not to say there are a lot of these as properties set to the access default are usually not set at all the properties is created only .when you change it from the default-value -- this can be seen by cycling through a field s properties collections many of the properties listed for a field in the access table designer are not there in the properties collections because they haven t been set but you might want to limit yourself to jet-specific data types hyperlink field are access-only for instances

1224732
filtering	grouping
from there the filtering objectclass grouping should get you what you need

1224733
any	set
you can use the lua_setglobal function provided by the lua-api to set those value in the global namespace to nil which will effectively prevent any user scripting from being able to access them

1225085
actionlistener	mouselistener
the problem with this methods tho is that .when you need to bind a mouselistener or actionlistener to the textfield you will have a hard time figuring out which cell numbers it corrisponds to

1225085
actionlistener	mouselistener
using this methods you can also implements mouselistener or actionlistener on the extended class too and get whatever information about the field you need without searching through your arrays

1225094
versioning	upgrade
note the versioning has recently been upgrade to 0.7rc1

this is i think a very common mistake for example .when reading user-input from form elements the value properties of form controls is string even if the character sequences that it contains represents a numbers as in your example

1225176
filewriter	writer
you may pass true as second parameter to the constructor of filewriter to instruct the writer to append the data instead of rewriting the file

1225179
attributes	properties
this properties is declare with the copy attributes .so whenever a new value is assign to it another -copy methods is sent to it

1225179
attributes	properties
the documentation for these methods is found under nscopying and nsmutablecopying . however you re never going to get a mutable versioning of something into a properties with the copy attributes since it will send -copy to whatever it is assign

1225179
attributes	properties
your properties should use the retain attributes instead of the copy attributes and the code to initializer it should look something like this

1225209
triggers	insert
updates your progress column using a before updates triggers you ll need one for before insert as well

any time you have a relatively small discrete set of value for a parameter you can automatically initializer separate versioning for them

1225315
multiplication	multiplying
you could also force the interpreter to perform arithmetic .when dealing with numberss in string forms by multiplying the string by 1 since multiplication can t be done on a string it ll convert to a numbers if it can

1225322
configuration	upgrade
another benefit of this approach is that the modified configuration file doesn t get overwrite if you upgrade your software

1225336

zlib is for gzip compression not zip compression see here for details

1227572
click	mouse
to false then everything should work because your event-listener will stick around to handle the mouse click

1227572
click	mouse
of courses this means that if you click on your checker button a second time you ll then have two sets of listener responding to mouse click of button one two and three

1227572
click	mouse
if you change the above line to store your button listener as a part of your class it will be available to respond to the mouse click rather than having been garbage collected

1227581
order	add
regarding order i should add that in 1.8 the items will be iterated in random order well actually in an order defined by fixnum s hash-function while in 1.9 it will be iterated in the order of the literals

1227585
put	get
i would like to now write a xml schema file .xsd to validation this xml file .so that developers can validation their form xml before it is put into the systemd and .so they can get intellisense based on the xml schema while they develop it

1227657
filtering	sorting
for such a query you cannot use a single index both for filtering and sorting

1227657
filtering	sorting
if you expect it to return many recording and limit them you need to use index for sorting and then filtering

1227673
g++	gcc
one easy methods is to building with gcc rather than g++ - this won t link in the default c++ libs but will still compile .cpp files as c++ code

1227693
contains	elements
i am using below code to serialization xml and my object contains arrays types properties but there some additional elements layer in my sample myinnerobject and myobject generator which i want to remove from the generator xml file

someone with better knowledge of data-structures could probably give better advice but personally i d use 2 dictionary for ease of use

1227706
authentication	login
something like making the authentication ticket somehow liked to the browser instances as as it is now someone can steal the cookies and use it in a different computer to access the same account with no need of login or passwd

1227736
string.format	stringbuilder
try to use string.format or â much much better â use stringbuilder class

1227748
triggers	insert
without triggers you could have a lastchgdate column on the table and set it .when you insert updates delete a row

1227752
any	set
well you could keep a column with a lastupdatesdate that is set to the current server date time on any insert or updates

1227783
conditional	parentheses
i put the join conditional in parentheses

1227797
python	lua
if you re not married to python try lua

1227818
put	get
for your example above i d use data.binary and write custom put get ers myself

1227821
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1227872
contains	any
clean.master is simply a master page that doesn t contains any additional html - it takes the view .so that i can con.solidate any partial-classes and rendering it with clean html that can be placed directly

1227892
dictionary	hashmap
a hashmap dictionary of name- value pairs for

1227897
contains	elements
i am using below code to serialization xml and my object contains arrays types properties and i want to add an additional elementss layer myinnerobjectproperties elements layer in my expected results below and i want to make myinnerobjectproperties elements as parent elements for all myinnerobjectproperties elements

1227899
hostname	router
if you re using fully qualified url s with a local hostname it wont work through your router

1227900
updating	updates
since .when you delete a row you are actually updating the isdeleted field and therefore are using an updates action deletes are now timestamped

1227906
expression	brackets
i m having a hard time putting together an expression that will grouping this string into the two groupinging i m looking for named in the quotes and email in the angle brackets

1227923
filtering	sorting
with out specifics it s hard to answer your question but you should look into filtering and sorting

1227936
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
this definitely works on sql-server mysql and postgresql

1227958
web-config	app-config
you will still have to put the connection-string into the app-config or web-config file of each application that required the database

1227960
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which is working fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but is it not working on ie6 and ie7

1227971
google-chrome	firefox
i make it to hide them in ie and firefox but i can t make it happen in google-chrome

1227971
google-chrome	firefox
to hide button in firefox but seems that not work for google-chrome

talking about exception-handling try to put an try-catch block in the line that access your webservice

1227988
internet-explorer	firefox
it works in firefox and internet-explorer

1227998
variables	boolean
i need a good variables named for a boolean value that returns false .when an object is the last in a list

1227998
variables	boolean
this is not good practice though code complete page 269 use positive boolean variables named

1228015
continuum	hudson
we are using continuum for the codeigniter part but it should work just as well in hudson

1228017
web-config	app-config
if you configure nhibernate in code rather than using app-config or web-config you should be able to avoid the problem you describe

1228038
put	get
if you ve never used xaml and you ve got a sort timeline to get this thing done you best be prepare to put in some extra time or be okay with a less than stellar look-and-feel

1228066
project-management	scrum
i have heard of the new scrum or xp types of project-management and yearned to be part of one as s w folks we always like anything new i guess but have not got an opportunity

1228094
order	add
what for example happens to tab order if i add a new row to the grid via ajax

1228106
variables	boolean
i agree with code complete use positive boolean variables named i also believe that rules are made to be broken

1228110
any	set
you then use that key from any thread whenever you want to set or retrieve the value of that tls item for the current thread

1228111
grouping	sorting
one of my need to to be able to control the sorting of the grouping ascending or descending

1228112
required	checked
to answer the most frequently occurring complaint against this question checkbox can have two legitimate states - checked and unchecked this is an i accept the terms and conditions... checkbox which must be checked inorder to complete a registration hence checked the box is required from a business-logic standpoint

1228118
checkbox	button	radio	click
what i want to happen is that .when the user click on the checkbox both radio button are disabled

1228121
callback	methods
.when the async callback returns you would clear the flag and resubmit the form from javascript like i demonstrated above calling the submit methods on the form elements

1228146
mstest	mbunit
i am using mstest instead of mbunit

1228153
google-apps	gmail

1228154
hide	show
do you want to hide show the link

1228154
hide	show
there s also hide and show

1228161
python	ruby
i think i have never seen it in ruby or python code

1228183
code-conventions	code-readability
most shops use code-conventions to ease code-readability .so anyone can easily look at a piece of code and quickly decipher between things such as public and private-members

1228268
perl	awk
you re going to have to use either perl sed or awk to perform the pattern match across line

1228283
constructor	object
the whole points of a constructor is that you should provide all the parameters required to correctly initializer the object into a valid state

1228288
local-variables	class-members
i think that if you need prefixes to distinguish class-members from member function parameters and local-variables either the function is too big or the variables are badly named

1228315
heatmap	plot
how do i plot 5 heatmap as subplot which have the same numbers of columns but different row count

1228320
ready	live	.when	ready
that way .when you re ready to updates the live site you just commit your last changes to the trunk create the new tag and the scripting updatess your live site with svn updates

1228322
value	field
the naive approach assuming table.id is what relates the two value field

1228326
redmine	trac
your best bet would be to use one of the various trac alternatives such as redmine or drproject or if i may pimp myself piano-man

1228375
callback	methods
in the timer s callback methods use the dispatcher to updates the user-interface the invoke methodss may be buggy

1228379
postback	ajax
ideally i would like to submit the form to a server via ajax and then return any errors the action throw and display them on the page but for the same to work via a normals postback .when the client has javascript turned off

1228412
bufferedimage	java-2d
java-2d - how to convert byte to bufferedimage

1228416
selected	button
it still works fine being able to click button and selected things and .so forth but it s an hourglass and not an arrow like normals

1228417
http	ssl
i ve developed a silverlight client that has worked fine on regular http but now that i m trying to get it to work on ssl i m getting the following error

1228427
jquery-append	.when
.when they add a row a tablerow is dynamically insert into the dom using a jquery-append

1228438
png	gif	bmp	png	bmp	gif
however if you re using something like jpeg gif png or bmp you can use the imageio class

1228447
contains	any
having a structure that contains itself isn t possible in any language

1228449
required	checked
also authentication call are made very frequently in an application and you really don t want to hit your database every time a checked is required

1228452
hide	show
how i did this was to very quickly hide and show the parent object in your case it sounds like the parent to your row

1228455
checked-exceptions	runtimeexception
i would not recommend wrapping this behind an iterator interface as the future get methods can throw two possible checked-exceptions executionexception and interruptedexception and you would therefore need to catch and either swallow these or rethrow them as runtimeexception s neither of which is a very nice thing to do

1228456
value	field
if it s not partition correctly it might be something as trivial as one of your field value on row 19 contains a comma thus throw out the import by making that row seem to have more columns

1228456
value	field
if possible use .something like | rather than as the qualifier .so that it s less likely to appear in the field value

1228476
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
in sql-server oracle and postgresql this one will probably more efficient if you have lots of french descriptions

1228486
fxcop	bcl
it s enforced by several tools fxcop and is the dominant styles of many libs including the bcl

1228500
javascript	dom
.when you first load your page and thus load your javascript it will apply only to the current state of the dom the html structure if you like

1228514
expression	evaluation
i think it probably has something to do with expression evaluation i m just not sure what

1228527
show	next
we always try to show server-side errors on top of the form in a distinctive containers client-side - right next to the field in question on submit

1228530
selected	textbox
i ve already done this in a form by first retrieving a list of unique author into a combo box and then allowing the user to selected the author start date and end date and display the count in a textbox

1228537
radio-button	textbox
you d either need to do it via javascript before the form is submitted or better still checked if the radio-button is set to other and then read the textbox value after the form is submitted

1228537
radio-button	textbox
one reason you don t want to really mess around with altering the return-value of the other radio-button is what if i was to types option1 in your textbox

1228538
javascript	dom
this required dynamic updates to the dom which required javascript

1228542
output	mode
documentation for the mode properties indicates that mode infact default to cbc which confusingly is a feedback mode but cannot be set to cfb or ofb cypher feedback output feedback

1228575
arrays	loops
using the follow test code i can alter the value within loops using getinneriterator and offsetset and dump out the modified arrays while i m within loops

1228575
arrays	loops
but .when i leave loops and dump the arrays from the iterator it s back to the original value

1228596
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works on ie7 firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1228619
python	ruby
for me three distinct features allow dynamic-languages like ruby or python to be more terse

1228619
scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala
in fact i very much believe the popularity of ruby affected the popularity of languages like haskell ocaml scala and f# in a positive way in addition to the other dynamic-languages

1228641
web-hosting	hosting
i did some quick searches to see if there are any companies that will just straight-up provide you with a stun hosting solution but if there even were any they were buried in piles of ads for simple web-hosting

1228642
margins	padding
specify a zero padding for the body also opera uses a default padding instead of margins which actually makes more sense

1228657
export	report
have you tried file- export- export report then choose report definition from the drop down and hit export button this will produce a text file listing all the elements in the report which you can load up in your favorite text-editor and search for whatever you want

1228671
arrays	loops
lets focus on loops for i 0 to mainbtns + submainbtns - 1 .i d like to add the button created below to the arrays created above named main arrays of tmain

1228672
innodb	myisam
i am simply trying to convert a table from myisam to innodb

1228704
contains	any
in this case xmlhttprequest.responsetext will contains the body if any returned from the server on the failed request

1228724
reflection	runtime
and if you want to get really fancy you can use java reflection to get at all the enumerated constants at runtime

1228724
put	get
make a thin wrapper to put with your other custom classes to get around quirks with matlab s classloader

1228725
export	report
has anyone run into problems getting crystal xi to embed fonts .when display report via the web served by ras and then export to pdf

1228725
export	report
we have a barcode fonts that we use in a few report and it worked fine via the web viewer and .when export to pdf

1228745
selected	textbox
i m just trying to selected the textbox in the first 5 rows of the table

1228747
scp	ssh
since you can scp you should be ok to ssh

1228752
any	set
i d like to use the error event of an aspx page to catch any unhandled exception-handling that occur in that page and set the text of a labels control to display the error to the user i realize this is likely not a recommended best practice this is a quick and dirty

1228780
.when	ready
second you can set up single central continuous-integration repository to which you push .when you are ready and hooks do codeigniter

1228791
callback	methods
i thought the callback in a weakref would do it but it appears a weakref s callback is called once the object is garbage collected but before the object __del__ methods is called

1228822
callback	methods
you can specify the target control to invoke the pop-up the control or div that contains the pop-up content and you can also dynamically populate the content using an ajax callback to a service methods

1228827
oracle	mysql
we were converting one of our databases from mysql to oracle

1228856
sql-server	oracle
i asked this question in regard to sql-server but what s the answer for an oracle environment 10g

1228878
click	mouse
what i want to do is .when i click in the first cancas i want to copy the contents of the first canvas and zoom in where i click my mouse and show it in the second canvas

1228884
mouseover	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
initially hovering works and the over class is added on mouseenter and removed on mouseout but after doing some hovering over paragraph with class risk the toggle class becomes stuck and mouseover removes it instead of adding the class opposite of expected functionality

1228915
lookup	any
then it serves as the default lookup location for any default styles you wish to apply to your controls

1228917
debugging	exit
.when i hit the stop button while debugging in visual-studio this the process exit but this cleanup code doesn t get called

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
why not have two separate functions for mouseenter and mouseleave

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
have mouseenter add the class and mouseleave remove the class

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think the problem is that if for example the mouseleave event is not fired browser looses focus i think can cause this then the mouseenter function will remove the class instead of adding it

1228929
versioning	upgrade
presumably you have .some table that contains a db schema versioning .so you should make sure to lock that table for the duration of the startup upgrade process

1228954
hide	show
i have this simple jquery function to hide or show a table

1228954
hide	show
the show hide works but the image plus minus is not changing

1228958
registration	login
the simplest registration form is one like stackoverflow uses it doesn t request anything beyond a username and openid login

1228963
tuples	any
consequently altering a string numbers or tuples will not affect any instancess previously passed that variables however altering a dictionary list or instances will do

1228975
queue	fifo
although i agree with nick that the queue s purpose is more for fifo styles process and arsenmkrt s solution will work another option involves using a messageenumerator and piling the messages into your ienumerable

1229004
any	set
that s a great resource to have - although i am not in the program typically connect sites are there to help provide more frequent drops a set of forums for discussing any issues and a way to easily get in contact with the developers and testers on the product

1229010
callback	methods
jquery s each callback methods uses for

1229012
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
.post and get works perfectly in ie 7 and 8 safari google-chrome and firefox

1229019
installation	environment

1229019
linux	unix
in the ohj installation directory there is a bin subdirectories contains windows .cmd files and unix linux shell scripting

1229022
removeclass	addclass
try not to change css value in code but instead use jquery to addclass and removeclass

1229049
configuration	logging
inorder to change what file you re logging to or change anything else in configuration you need to know what underlying logging implementation you are using and the whole points of using julog quite arguable btw unless you re developing a libs is to not have any ties to logging implementation

1229092
selected	button
selected environment variables button

1229100
attributes	properties
you might also consider adding the attributes which will make isvalid available as a properties instead of a methods

1229121
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in general the localization process isn t as smooth in the vs 2008 asp.net-mvc world as it is with traditional webforms

1229130
lan	vpn
proxy if you re connect over a vpn or your company uses a proxy go to tools-internet options-connection tab and click on lan settings.

1229140
fwrite	fclose	fwrite	fopen	fclose	fopen
im wondering if i should use the fopen to create the file with the named being something like echo date then fwrite mysql then fclose

1229143
value	field
value is the value entered in the field being validation

1229144
vb.net	vb6
i have a interesting problem where i work we ve built a home-grown erp system.in vb6 that we are slowly moving over into vb.net

1229153
.net	wcf
i d seriously consider picking up some basic asp.net or just .net wcf skills

1229157
.net	wcf
the .net web service part will be trivial and will only be a modification of the standards hello world service you get .when you create a wcf service project

1229166
callback	methods
for some reason the callback of the fadeout methods gets fired multiple time before the fade out has finished

1229167
versioning	upgrade
move what can be move to separate dll s then it is often possible to upgrade just by coping in a new versioning of the dll

1229171
perl	ruby	perl	tcl	python	ruby	python	tcl	python	perl
mac os x leopard comes with a ton of stuff built-in perl python ruby tcl tk bash

1229171
python	ruby
wxwidgets some quartz integration and even objective-c integration for python and ruby

1229174
arrays	loops
i just loops through the arrays of words and test each letter for caps

1229179
32-bit	64bit
see also why long is 32-bit on lots of 64bit systemd and why we have long-long .

1229190
value	field
is there a way to just have it include alla elements with their value from an entire form field

1229195
postgresql	mysql
but what you propose doesn t work on mysql it seems you have to use now + interval 2 hour and not now + interval 2 hours -- still i don t know about postgresql

1229195
postgresql	mysql
btw i don t have a postgresql server .so i ll test everything with mysql -- should work on postgresql too still.

1229210
python	perl
i m open to using sed grep or any of the other standards tools but not perl or python

1229235
contains	set
you may have some success if you find the nodes you want getelementsbytagnamens and set their qualifiedname qname to a new value contains the prefix you like

1229236
value	field
the value of an specific field and .when it changes the value it should updates the value of another field in another table

1229255
fwrite	fclose
of course you ll need to put the fwrite and fclose call after this

1229256
contains	set
it will only create the div to the height needed to contains the content within it .when height is set to 100

1229309
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve opened up some discussion regarding whether this was going to be fixed for linq-to-sql or the ado.net entity-framework on the msdn forums

1229313
textbox	button
i had a working program windows forms project complete with button labels textbox e.t.c

1229319
target-platform	entry-point	target-platform	rcp
either you have to defined an rcp application from it thus creating your entry-point and use it in a rcp target-platform and then you can use most of the eclipse api

1229336
double	int
but what if your sorting value is a double instead of an int

1229336
double	int
found double required int

1229336
double	int
is there a way to use double for the comparison instead of casting to int

1229360
arrays	loops
another great points of iname iterator is that i never index an arrays with the wrong index and if i copy a loops inside another loops i don t have to refactor one of loopss index variables

1229388
attributes	properties
invalid attributes value myproperties for properties properties

1229389
value	field
as others have posted thread.start will launchd a new thread and control.begininvoke will run code on the ui-thread necessary if you want to change a field s value for example

1229389
backgroundworker	winforms
however i have found that the simplest technique for execution a background task in winforms is to use a backgroundworker

1229393
spring	seam
take a look at the jax-rs seam or spring for bookmarkable getable pages

1229394
removeclass	addclass
.so the best .solution is use addclass .someclass and removeclass .someclass to make things hidden

1229396
any	set
as with any singleton or global state it also introduces a set of problems with multithreading and concurrency

1229409
build-system	autotools
also depending on your target platform you can use autotools for your build-system

1229412
height	frame
the contentsize height seems to be always equals or greater than the height of the scrollview frame but never smaller

1229419
msbuild-task	nant
msbuild-task or msbuild.exe with nant

1229430
constructor	object
unfortunately i think the compiler is optimising out the unused object which are meant to do the useful work in their constructor

1229433
constructor	object
can i turn any arbitrary piece of memory into an object through a constructor call such as and subsequently destroying the object via or is this impossible

1229440
cursor	row
except .when the database-schema logic implementation is grotesquely inefficient say requiring a cursor to do a sproc execution for each row in a result set inorder to pre-process data for a report

1229447
radio-button	selected
i ve been trying to programmatically reproduce the behavior of editing a content-type s field properties in the sharepoint site management screens and selected the required radio-button with no sucess using the wss 3.0 web service s webs.asmx updatecontenttype methods

1229447
value	field
it should also be noted that i followed the recommendation on the previous link to use for updating field but it changes nothing and using methods value other than 1 for adding or other than 3 for deleting also function correctly

1229453
constructor	object
pass the socket into the constructor of each object

1229457
javascript	dom
if you re going to be mucking about in the dom with javascript you need a good tool like firebug to give you visibility

1229459
environment	building
each dev can then run the appropriate cmake scripting to building the correct building environment for their systemd visual-studio 2008 2005 gnu c++ building scripting etc

1229459
environment	building
each dev can use their own building environment

1229459
environment	building
environment ie .when vs 2010 is release some devs can migrate there just by rebuildinging their building folder

1229478
callback	methods
you can use the beginexecutexxx endexecutexxx methods depending whether it returns a result or not of the sqlcommand passing a callback delegation

1229496
populate	row
that now allows me to populate the page with fields-for each row that occurs

1229518
contains	set
i m using javascript to set the value of an input with text that may contains html specific chars such a etc

1229522
keyboard	hid
your delegation should have already made the decision to hide the keyboard or not and the event being broadcasting is merely to let all the other components know that they keyboard hid

1229523
interface-builder	iboutlet
these are bound via interface-builder to iboutlet in the view s controllers

1229524
binaries	install
we had the same codebase used to building binaries fully packaged install actually targetting win32 64 linux and os x and a bunch of other more exotic platform such as efi with everyone working in their ide of choice

1229524
environment	building
one other approach we ve used in acronis is to have the windows building environment have cygwin-based cross-compiling tools in it .so any windows dev could do a building targeting linux with the same g++ versioning and all from his box and see if that fails to verify that his changes will compile in g++

1229526
javascript	dom
but pure javascript as the languages primarily designed to manipulate the dom will not suffice of course .

1229535
value	field
.so the idea here is that the value of your data field would become a j.son object graphing generator by php on the server

1229544
hide	show
now in css you can hide the area .when the javascript class is not available and show the area .when javascript is available

1229564

environment	building
in the past we have had different rules and policies to avoid this but now we just rely on a consistent building environment - don t mix and match

1229621
triggers	insert
instead of a job an insert triggers on your queue should work as well

1229630
abstract-class	derived-class
or a derived-class object will be stored in the same table as the abstract-class from which it is derived from

1229630
entity-framework	ado.net
but now we would probably use ado.net entity-framework linq s big brother or another supported orm

1229641
contains	elements
the stylesheet may contains many elements to be substituted

1229641
duplicates	elements
is there a better way than using one stylesheet to insert the content then having a second stylesheet that removes duplicates elements

1229674
dependency-injection	singleton
the me sounds more for the right time to use dependency-injection as i tend to avoid singleton as much as i can singleton are just another way for accessing globlas and its something to be avoided

1229674
dependency-injection	singleton
singleton vs dependency-injection has been already discussed on .so checked the dependency-injection tag .sorry for not .posting .some links but .so doens t allow me to .post more than one link being a new user

1229693
environment	building
in my last and current company i work in mixed linux- and windows-developer teams who work together using subversion and qt which has a very easy and powerful building-system qmake which hide all the different platform compiler specific building environment - you just have to write one building file for all platform - .so easy

1229729
contains	set
and set include header.html with whatever messages you want or contains a meta-redirect and include readme.html to be blank

1229745

32-bit	64bit
on an x64 systemd however i am getting the value from the wow6432node hklm software wow6432node microsoft asp.net 2.0.50727.0 which gives me the 32-bit framework path c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 but on an x64 systemd i actually want the 64bit path c windows microsoft.net framework64 v2.0.50727

1229760
32-bit	64bit
how can i run the scripting using the 64bit scripting hosts - or - how can i read the 64bit value even if the scripting is run using the 32-bit scripting hosts

according to the docs a display object that has nothing inside it cannot have its width or height set

1229821
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which is working fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but is it not working on ie6 and ie7

1229826
private-members	instances
well you could still mangle state but the points is to by design not do so. i generally design instances methods as public members and do my best to make private-members static

1229839
jndi	jdbc
i use jndi context to create datasource for jdbc drivers in tomcat s context.xml file like this

1229841
arrays	loops
a numeric arrays that may contains a 0 will break this loops

1229849
execute	prepare
al.so database server machines are usually shared re.sources but the statement is likely to be prepare separately for each user .so if you have multiple users hammering the systemd with repeated queries that are discarded the server will be too busy preparing queries to execute any of them fast

1229911
printf	scanf
kernighan and pike in the excellent book the practice of programming show how to use printf to create an appropriate format specifier including the length similar to the examples in the answer by aprogrammer and then use that in the call to scanf

1229925
oracle	mysql
dose linq-to-sql have any support for other datasource like mysql oracle etc

1229932

does anyone know of an optimized way of detection a 37 bit sequences in a chunks of binary-data that is optimal

1230013
32-bit	64bit
not sure about launchd the 64bit scripting hosts versioning but you should be able to access the 64bit registry from the 32-bit scripting hosts using the wmi stdregprov class like this

1230015
versioning	packaging
my jar has the correct named durin packaging but its install in the my local repository it is as if buildnumber is was undefined .when the versioning was set

1230046

1230116
asp.net-mvc	webforms
basically webforms give you less control more overhead and rapid development time while asp.net-mvc gives you more control less overhead and takes more time to develop

1230116
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so if you have a quick intranet types web application you most likely want to use webforms and if you have a full featured public facing website you will most likely want to use asp.net-mvc

1230121
arrays	loops
the rules of thumb is to avoid loops by using vectorized arrays operations instead of iterator one elements at a time

1230132
ienumerator	ienumerable
ienumerable or more properly ienumerator doesn t have moveprev

1230132
enumerator	any
this could be implements by any containers that supports efficient reverse enumerator

1230145
linux	unix
i am coding a simple networking tool in c++ that should be working under unix linux operating systemd

1230163
internet-explorer	safari
this works in safari 2.x i don t know about internet-explorer

1230164
arrays	loops
from left to right i loops through the arrays with two for loopss and building a tree-like structure of each row each elements is a parent of its follower like below

1230171

1230219
derived-class	inherited
i can also inherited from a particular class and then add new methods to the derived-class

1230220

nhibernate	ado.net
or nhibernate or ado.net and expose your data using wcf or web-services or forget mono because of the flexibility loss etc

1230290
32-bit	64bit
i ve had problems with excel on 64bit systemd - you ll have to run the 32-bit dtexec for the job

1230302
spring	guice
the best practice would be to use some kind of dependency-injection containers - for example spring or guice

1230318
background-color	transparency
you have to set the background-color of the uitableview to be transparency set the background-color of the cell s contentview to whatever colour you want the actual cell to be then crucially you have to get the lighting grey colour to appear behind the uitableview

1230343
subclassing	base-class
i gather that you have a base-class and two subclassing that you want to map to two subclassing tables using the table-per-concrete-class mapping strategy

1230343
subclassing	base-class
the two subclassing tables need to declare the same primary key and the primary key need to be mapped in the base-class mapping

1230343
strong-typing	types
strong-typing to me means that variabless are statically typesd the types of each variables is known to and enforced by the compiler and object are strictly typesd the types of each object is known to and enforced by the runtime

1230350
put	get
or put it in a database where you can get at it via sql client

1230366
arguments	default
the default arguments is qt displayrole the display text

1230379
contains	elements
it takes as input both an ienumerable contains elements of types t1 and a function transforming elements of types t1 into elements of types t2

1230379
contains	elements
the output is an ienumerable contains elements of types t2

1230379
contains	elements
this one takes an ienumerable contains elements of types t1 and a predicates on t1 that is a function that produces a boolean result for an input of types t1

1230379
contains	elements
you see that the output is also an ienumerable contains elements of types t1

1230399
scons	cmake
cmake and scons are useful among others

1230399
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
use perl python ruby or something like them for your scripting

1230408
perl	ruby
perl has html tableextract which i think would do the job but i can t find any similar libs for ruby

1230412
enumerator	any
the identity transformation during enumerator effectively creates a compiler-generated iterator - a new types which is not related to _lst in any way

1230413
32-bit	64bit
to complicate matters a bit further we are running this on .net 1.1 32-bit under 64bit windows-server 2003 yes we do have a reason for this unusual configuration with 12 gb of ram

1230413
32-bit	64bit
one answer says that 32-bit apps on 64bit os still have a 2gb per process limit but most any reference i have been able to find says that each 32-bit process has access to 4gb on a 64bit os

1230416
silverlight	wpf
prism is very good for mvvm in wpf and silverlight

1230417
display	width
i used to be a proponent of dynamic width until i started seeing pages which looked great on 14 and 19 screens display on 24 monitor the major issue is with right-align items such as button which become separated from the main content

python	c++
qt properties are introspectable from within qt s c++ classes which raw python properties are not and are used by qt for such things as their qt-designer form editor and qt-creator ide

1230439
python	c++
they allow a lot of the sort of introspection of runtime state that you have in python and miss in c++

1230439
python	c++
if you were going to consider porting anything from pyqt back to c++ qt than you might prefer the qt versioning of a feature over the python one

1230456
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
on my website it seems every updates browser firefox opera safari ie8 ie7 and even ie6 seem to rendering the separating line between my content div and sidemenu div

1230471
command-line	cmd
whatever account running the job will potentially have access to run cmd from the command-line - .so you need to think about how it will be running and what permissions the account will have

1230483
compatibility	deprecated
further some vendors will ship drivers that can create 3.1 and 3.2 contexts using a compatibility .profile which will also enable the deprecated features

1230511
show	next
i d like to add a link at the bottom to older workouts. onclientclick this should show the next 10 workouts in the page immediately below the first 10 with a new link to older below now 20 display in the page -- just like the news streaming on facebook and several other social networks

1230552
callback	methods
have your timer callback methods do the work required for one graphing and set whatever instance-variables are necessary for your the methods to know which graphing it should draw .so that the methods draw each graphing in turn until it runs out of them

1230558

1230601
versioning	migrate
what we want to be able to do is to produce scripting to migrate our data across different schema versioning

1230639
background-image	height
it basically involves applying a background-image to the parent elements of the floated elements which makes you believe that the two elements are the same height

1230648
msbuild	nant
i use msbuild directly skipping nant

1230668
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
it has native support for sql-server mysql oracle postgresql sqlite db2 and others

1230673
background-image	height
it basically involves applying a background-image to the parent elements of the floated elements which makes you believe that the two elements are the same height

1230692
object-reference	instances
.when i browse to the index action though i get object-reference not set to an instances of an object .when trying to use _repo.insert b

1230732
any	set	contains	elements	contains	any	contains	set
you can be more confident of the accuracy of the answer from this algorithm than of that from any single time servers because the intersection of several sets will likely contains fewer elements than any individual set

1230749
google-chrome	firefox
now this seems like how it should work however it doesn t happen in ie7 firefox google-chrome

1230754
32-bit	64bit
if you are running a 32-bit process on a 64bit os your still subject to the process limit of a 32-bit process which is 2gb

1230764
sql-server	mysql
this is untested but would work in sql-server...i imagine it would work in mysql as well actually the function in sql-server is getdate and a quick google-search tells me that it is now in mysql

1230773
getter	setter
second if get and set are to be strictly interpreter as setter and getter then if other semantic associated with setting getting a value side-effects for example will be surprising

1230787
sql-server	mysql
but prior to working with mysql i worked for 5+ years on sql-server

1230787
sql-server	mysql
my theory is that sql-server s optimizer evaluates udf s differently than mysql s

1230787
sql-server	mysql
or maybe the use of udf s on sql-server is more prevalent and the mysql engine s optimizer simply hasn t evolved as far yet

1230797
getter	setter
several languages have different ways of handling getter and setter

1230802
getter	setter
c# getter and setter are first class entities and don t resemble function-calls syntactically though any arbitrary code can run in the context of an accessor

1230818
silverlight	wpf
relative paths to media in silverlight are wacky .so they can work the same wacky way that wpf paths do

1230822
contains	elements
i have a page that contains an iframe elements

1230829
subclassing	metaclass
in the class that s really a legacy old-types class the one made the second time metaclass is classobj which isn t a subclassing of types and properties don t work right assign x.x bypasses the properties and after that getting x.x doesn t see the properties any more either

1230829
subclassing	metaclass
but in the first case the qt case there s a different metaclass and it is a subclassing of types .so it s not really correct to say the class isn t new-style

1230839
value	field
a currency is required if a value exists in a money field

1230839
any	set
is there any way i can set the currency

1230839
synchronous	.when
it needs to be done synchronous because the case is opened immediately .when it s created from an activity

1230844
exception-handling	try-catch
i think that without the unhandled-exception-handling event a try-catch around endget will catch the exception-handling if any

1230858
value	field
more specifically my entity has two string field out of about 10 field that get their value from a the return of a modal view controllers like a text-editor

1230858
value	field
the crash also only happens after these field are edited the first time i put a value in it works fine

1230860
primitive	int
this is a consequence of int being primitive but int is an object

calayer	uiview
within -drawrect for a uiview or -renderincontext for a calayer the following code will draw text and apply a glow around it

1230912
32-bit	64bit
vista 64bit has a 32-bit android-emulator i believe .so you will not need to worry about this

1230915
pointers	stack
.so i can either dump the entire tables onto stack as static-members or i can have static pointers to these tables

1230915
pointers	stack
however my question is if i choose the static pointers to the tables .so as not to abuse stack spaces what is a good methods for appropriately cleaning these up

1230926
getter	setter
this isn t just .so other programmers can read your code but more importantly hundreds of other java frameworks are built to handle object supporting javabeans styles getter setter

1230931
graphviz	doxygen
i have used doxygen with graphviz but it seems to have a problem with large code base especially .when generator collaboration diagram

1230932
silverlight	wpf
i find it helps .when thinking about layout in wpf silverlight to think top down from the root of the control hierarchy instead of bottom up

1231021
alignment	spacing
it s quite pleasant to use and it provides a lot of assistance for mundane tasks like spacing and alignment

1231030
syntax-highlighting	textmate
i have recently begun working with objective-c in textmate and noticed that the syntax-highlighting is rather poor a comment is the exact same color as a variable-declaration

syntax-highlighting	textmate
i ve never done syntax-highlighting changes in textmate and i m having trouble figuring out how to correctly modify it

1231032
linked-list	arrays
by flexibility i mean the ability to chain-iterate through different sequences types together vector arrays linked-list set etc.... and by speed i mean only allocation memory from stack

1231035

1231103
type-safety	generics
off the compiler s generics type-safety

1231108
retaincount	dealloc
assuming your retaincount is then 0 dealloc will be called in 99 of the cases you should never call dealloc yourself

arguments	undefined
i have a program that call a function with undefined arguments like this

1231123
show	next
do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using next to skip the line you don t want to show up in the output

1231125
implements	abstract
the abstract forces descendant classes to implements the methods - the compiler won t allow you to forget

1231130
any	set
note that if you have anything like borders or padding set on any of the divs that will add to the width and height of the elements .so take that into account

1231134
actionscript	haxe
mtasc is building around actionscript 2 whereas haxe is it s own language and very similar to actionscrip

1231134
actionscript	haxe
again based on the request to the server you can even generator actionscript haxe on the server compile it and inject it into a swf created by swfmill to then serve it to the user

1231140
constructor	object
but it returns nothing and calling the constructor of the class twice destroy any state saved inside the c# object that should be available in memory during the life of the excel workbook

1231140
constructor	object
also changing the loadbehaviour in the registry to 3 from 2 loads the add-in the first time correctly firing all extensibility event onconnection ondisconecction and the object class constructor now i need to find a way for the invocation part from vba of the add-in meaning how to connect the add-in instances to a reference in vba and from there call all the methods exposed through the interface of the com object

1231147
16-bit	8bit
ignore dinosaur platform with 8bit or 16-bit architectures

some compile them as 64bit on 64bit machines some compile them as 32-bit

1231152
downgrade	upgrade
i think there is an upgrade downgrade path between mysql and db2 because they are both pretty ansi standards compliant

1231159
any	set
do you only want to take action if certain criterion are met or is there a special case for one value and another set of logic for any other value

1231178
python	c++
i need to load .pem x509 -----begin rsa xxx key----- -----end rsa xxx key----- into a windows cryptoapi context to use with c++ i found examples for python and .net but they use specific functions i can t relate to the plain windows cryptoapi

it should also take an arguments though to change that default behavior

1231284
pointers	stack
what is actually passed to function_name - presumably on stack - are pointers to those string constants

1231289
rad-controls	telerik
the telerik object is given by a set of commercial asp.net web-controls called rad-controls for asp.net ajax

contains	any
as a general rules of thumb your code should not contains any new delete call except in the constructor destructor for the class responsible for managing that allocation

1232409
constructor	object
if an object allocates the memory it needs in the constructor and release it in the destructor and handles copying assignment correctly then you can simply create a local instances of the class on stack whenever you need it and it will not can not leak memory

no but i m sure you could make it happen shouldn t be too tricky either with a treeview or if you would just like the list then you could use a listview

1232960
testng	junit
i ve tried a few approaches but the best i can manage is to create a .profile for the testng dependency .so you can toggle between testng and junit testing there doesn t seem to be a means to run both testng and junit 4 tests

1232960
testng	junit
one other points to note you can launchd your junit tests from testng but i think this only works for junit 3 tests

occasionally i need to distinguish between uninitialized and missing in a lazy-initialization situation but then i typically use a separate boolean variables to indicate the state .so any value including null is valid for the target object itself

1235272
callback	methods
my gut feeling is that after the .applicationwillterminate methods is done it will just stop the whole .app without giving any other run loops the chance to execute let alone do callback

1235273
put	get
you cannot put checkbox in a dropdown unfortunately the closest you could get is something like

1235282

no triggers are dependent upon rows being insert updates or deleted

1236035
triggers	insert
the only way that you could have a triggers fire every few hours is to create a separate table and insert a row every few hours

if i try to change the content of the elements everything works fine in most of the browsers that i ve tried including ie6 surprisingly enough but in ie7 the table cell does not adjust its width to fit the selected elements

1236405
assign	add
if you want to add dynamic entities of course such as monsters pick up items etc you ll need to add animation information to the entity structure and keep a list of the dynamic entities separate from the cell because these will move around the world and thus won t belong to a cell for optimization reasons you might want to assign a temporary entity in each cell though but optimization is something you should bother with after you have the engine game running

i could be wrong but i think there may be inherent problems with using a mouseover or mouseenter event to control a vertical accordion -- unless you really know what the submenus are going to be like

1236458
mouseenter	mouseover
you fire all the mouseover out or mouseenter leave events for #3 #4 #5.

1236563
emacs	vim
i am used to emacs but i am trying out vim to see which one i like better

1236580
any	set
edit perhaps i should have asked a more clear question is there any set of cmd i can issue to latex that will calculate the margins indentation from the verse cmd then apply that margins to the poemtitle .so that the poem title ends up fflush with the left edges of the text without setting poemtitle in its own verse environment

1236586
emacs	vim
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve i ve never used emacs but you can run cmd in vim by typing

required	checked
because of those qualities you can reasonably required developers to run them before checked in and run them regularly in each branch and required that they pass 100 at all time

1236975
multi-select	autocomplete
i don t think the ajaxhelper can produce a multi-select autocomplete box it s not what it s designed to do

1236993
swing	awt
i want to support the native look-and-feel and thus i have to use awt instead of swing

1236993
swing	awt
am i correct in thinking that inorder to support the native look-and-feel we should use awt instead of swing

1237008
checkbox	button
. because i have seen in dojo.js they have their own controls as we create in dojo. button checkbox etc...

1237023
average	minimum
assuming that your words versioning of the duration can handle a little inaccuracy at a bare minimum you should be using the average for those figures taking into account that a year is 365.2425 days which should be close enough for your purposes

1237091
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit versioning is also named opengl32.dll and is located in systemroot syswow64 on 64bit windows

1237091
32-bit	64bit
you can t load 32-bit dlls in a 64bit process .so whatever you read about x64 apps using the 32-bit opengl dll was incorrect

1237099
separation-of-concerns	design-principles
good design-principles such as separation-of-concerns make it easy to make changes to code because changes tend to be more isolated

1237135
version-control	git
i have a new project starting up and i was planning to use git as the version-control mechanism to learn it a bit better

1237135
push	pull
is it possible to set up git as a cgi program .so that one can push as well as pull from it

1237145
messagebox	alert
what i need is an alert messagebox

1237145
messagebox	alert
if it reaches 7 in one minute then i need a messagebox to alert that

1237146
push	pull
you re still each going to have to use local repositories for your changes but .when you want to work with the central repo use the git push and pull cmd

1237151
version-control	git
if your project isn t likely to exceed 100mb of data in version-control is a decent free git hosting option as well while allowing more than 2 users if anyone else ever join the project

1237154
managed-code	unmanaged
edit if the hosting program is managed-code and you need to do a c#- fortran native - c# calling sequences then delegation as unmanaged function-pointers can be used as linked in the comments above

1237164
keyboard	mouse
the change event fires fine .when the current item is selected using the mouse but .when i scroll through the items using the keyboard the event is not fired and my code never execute

1237168
key-value	key
the interface for accessing tc is basically value get key and set key-value

1237183
updating	updates
if you control the mechanism that is updating the cell then you could it call a vba subroutine that you wrote instead have to send the alert and then updates the cell from that routine

1237187
google-maps	openlayers
i have used google-maps a couple of time but what wondering about openlayers

1237187
google-maps	openlayers
why would i use openlayers instead of google-maps

1237200
word-vba	vba
this dll is currently used in a ms word-vba project and it export classes etc to the vba code

1237200
vb.net	vb6
from my readings it is possible to use a vb6 com libs in vb.net or at least it is supposed to be able to. as it should be possible in vb.net and since .net runs on the clr and since ironpython does to logically can t i access this ancient dll from ironpython

1237208
g++	gcc
you can use -static or -s option for static-linking in gcc or g++

1237226
keyboard	mouse
you ll want both onchange and onkeypress to account for both mouse and keyboard integration respectively

1237231
google-maps	openlayers
i can t answer all your questions but one thing i ll put out there is that openlayers and google-maps aren t mutually exclusive

1237231
google-maps	openlayers
openlayers is a javascript libs and you can use it to interact with google-maps

1237231
google-maps	openlayers
checkout this example openlayers using google-maps

1237232
administration	credentials
but in that case the application you write should be running with the credentials of a user with rights to that shared local administration have sufficient rights to do that

1237241
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am moving a project from webforms to a asp.net-mvc .solution and do not want to rebuild the database .so asp.net membership mentioned in windows-live-id-in-asp-net-asp.net-mvc is not a valid .solution

1237242
vba	vb6
you simply go to the add reference dialog selected the com tab selected the libs much like in the vb6 vba references dialog and you re basically done

1237247
sftp	ftp
i have frequently used sftp secure ftp for this kind of problem

1237263
xsd	xml
for general xml types intellisense i think you need to put the xsd in c program files microsoft visual-studio 9.0 xml schema or c program files microsoft visual-studio 8 xml schema

1237266
derived-class	base-class
substitutability - using any derived-class object where a base-class object works - is what i need

1237273
arrays	loops
there are a couple of ways you could solve the 5 photos on a row problem but i think that this is the most expressive grouping the arrays of photos into rows of 5 and use nested .each loops

1237277
google-maps	openlayers
it s not necessarily a question of openlayers or google-maps

1237277
google-maps	openlayers
you can after all use google-maps for your map background in openlayers

1237277
google-maps	openlayers
openlayers can combine maps from different sources google-maps background wms overlay vector data from kml or gml files or wfs etc

1237277
google-maps	openlayers
you can styles openlayers much more thanyou can google-maps

1237277
google-maps	openlayers
if you need high precision in the maps use openlayers with a suitable map server backend rather than google-maps to get a better map-projections google-maps assumes that the earth is a perfect sphere

1237306
freebsd	linux
this is not the case on other x86 platform such as linux win32 freebsd .

1237323
hide	show
you can call is .when the movie is 100 loaded and then again from the last frame of the movie .so you d be getting the flash movie to say show me and then later hide me

1237332
antivirus	mcafee
have a look to see if your antivirus is going crazy i ve have seen this problem a few time with people running mcafee

1237349
variables	boolean
here the boolean variables sessioninvalid will return true if the session is invalidate by any means

1237355
subclassing	superclass
or is the only alternative subclassing uitableview to make a functionality available in its superclass uiscrollview work again

1237358
python	ruby
learning one of python ruby javascript would let you learn about functional-programming - if that s your goal

1237359
floating	margins
the margins on the p now appear to be set from the inside of div rather than merging with them while the span is still floating to the top left of the div

1237360
freebsd	linux	opensolaris	freebsd	opensolaris	linux
today i can easily support linux opensolaris freebsd and even cygwin

1237360
decltype	auto
i probably would never be able to support visual-studio maybe 2010 with c++0x support because i relay on c++0x decltype auto feature or typeof __typeof__ extension that is supported by most compilers i worked with gcc intel sun studio

1237360
autotools	cmake	autotools	bjam	cmake	bjam
i relay heavily on autotools and i can t replace them with cmake bjam or friend because .when it comes to support of internationalization cross copiling package-management they just does not give me a solution

1237360
lighttpd	apache
thus implements one or two standards protocols i open communication with any existing server apache lighttpd nginx cherokee.

1237362
attributes	properties
now you create your buddy metadata class where you can add attributes to properties that are generator by the linq-to-sql designer

1237383
solaris	linux
maybe it s porting your entire systemd from solaris to linux since you ve been writing good platform-independent code you change a few function-calls and it compiles without errors

1237390
getter	setter
fbjs has its own getter and setter

1237391
data-members	constructor
any data-members that is not initializer in the initialization list of the constructor will be automatically initializer with the default-constructor of its types

1237434
account	userid	crypt	md5
if i will store an arrays of information account - fullname address userid passwd in a various servers and i would want to encrypt the passwd using md5 question is everytime i ll add the account into ldap servers since that s what we re using then does that mean that everytime i save passwd i ll have to use crypt function

1237436
constructor	object
incidentally if m_sfilename were an object there would be an additional difference besides the const considerations the initialization list would cause m_sfilename s constructor to be called whereas the assignment would call the assignment-operator

1237437
background-color	height
if for example the height of an elements is zero you will obviously not see it s background-color

1237437
quirks-mode	doctype
first make sure that the page has a proper doctype .so that it doesn t rendering in quirks-mode

1237463
required	checked
for small strings clr solution will work slowly because sql-server required some time to interop with clr environment to do the call and then get the results back while for big strings with lots of replacements c# maybe never checked this

1237480
file-descriptor	pipe
if the input is coming from a pipe then after all the data in the pipe is read the read call will block until the last file-descriptor that can write to the pipe is closed

1237483
salt	md5
an md5 encrypted passwd usually include a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

1237497
variables	boolean
without changing the variables named which is difficult .when using existing apis how should i indicate that an nsnumber holds a boolean value

1237508
variables	boolean
the best way would be to call the variables audiobool or something that signifies a boolean value

1237509
reflection	runtime
you obviously cannot alter the code of this class with the usual means .so i thought it would be possible to replace a methods in there through reflection at runtime

1237524
eclipse-plugin	m2e
i am trying out m2e the eclipse-plugin for maven and have noticed that the resources are now excluded from the buildpath of all my project

1237527
sqrt	sin
.when you use the sin and sqrt kind of functions they will work at double anyways

1237527
double	int
to convert a double to an int value checked this page

1237534
csv	xml	export	csv
or depending on the nature of the applications you your case crm it may be worth ising this same api to building an import export mechanism where users can just just export their data into xml csv and also import their data buildinging a nice interace to map any csv format to your own field is a nice touch and means less technical users can perform non-automated tasks

1237540
widget	button
.when using the dijit.form.numberspinner widget the arrow button don t show up on ie6

1237541
pointers	stack
.so after the return from the first one stack still contains a pointer-to-pointer to and nil and those pointers are even still valid since the autorelease pool hasn t been drained yet

1237541
pointers	stack
.when you call the second one without the nil it replace the pointers on stack but the nil is left unchanged

1237553
widget	button
i also got the ability to easily exchange the implementation of a view widget because all i had to rewrite was the code that notified the presenter of some event - regardless of the underlying widget button links etc

1237553
event-bus	mvp
one definetly needs history for app-navigation a event-bus like gxt-mvc to attach detach screens and mvp to enable easy testing of data-access for widget

1237553
spring-mvc	gwt
.when writing big gwt apps i feel like i have to reinvent something like spring-mvc on the client which really sucks because it takes a lot of time and brain-power to spit out something elegant as spring-mvc

1237561
hide	show
create the page dialog with the main dialog not the tab as their parent and as the user switches between tabs simply show and hide the relevant page dialog

1237566
children	nodes	children	tree
given a nodes this function generator the set of children of that nodes in a tree

1237566
children	nodes
the function can be applied again to those children to generator their children until it eventually generator a nodes with no children a nodes for which gentree returns

1237578
promise	future
note that the pattern you describe is normally describe as a future a background job that promise to return something later on a return on investment if you may

1237578
callback	methods
there s also provisions to be informed of .when the background threads are completed via a callback methods as well as waithandle support to explicit checked and waiting with timeout etc

1237586
oracle	mysql
this doesn t work in for instances mysql and oracle because of multi concurrency issues but it does work in sqlite

1237590
annotations	mapping
i am setting up hibernate annotations user jpa for mapping with spring

1237595
google-chrome	firefox
the next code removes the textarea tags in firefox google-chrome .so the content can be accessed in arr 1

1237609
geocoding	geocode
.app engine doesn t have built-in geocoding or router .so you re left with two options load map data into .app engine and geocode route locally or call out to a web service

1237619
instances	destroy
then the old instances that you copy-paste will be destroy .when it goes out of scoping causing the pointers to be deleted

1237629
gridview	listview
i have got a listview item with a gridview child bound to a list of object

1237642
temporary	copy
unfortunately your destructor doesn t know about the copy .so during the copying there is a good chance that a temporary copy of framedata gets destroy and that will take all your data with it

1237667
linked-list	nodes
that means llist is a types just like int or file or char that is a shorthand for struct nodes your linked-list nodes structure

1237670
typedef	struct
c required that you reference struct with a struct prefix .so it s common to introduce a typedef for less verbose mention

1237672
linux	unix	contains	any
i doubt that a modern unix contains any of ken thompson s original code linux certainly doesn t but he s still known as the creator of unix

1237685
versioning	migrate
we ve already migrate a development versioning of our visual lint product to vs2010 and for the most part the migration was straightforward - or would have been if there weren t .so many bugs in the visual-studio 2010 beta 1 automation model

1237693
json	xml
json has several advantages over xml

1237693
json	xml
to code with it instead of an xml libs you will want a json libs

1237699
configuration	installation
hence installation and configuration is virtually for free ease of installation

1237700
expression	evaluation
this boils down to how the expression tree evaluation is done in excel

1237701
value	field
i will set the field with the floor value 4

1237701
value	field
i will put on top of the field a messages like this field must be an int value

1237705
json	xml
ah the big question json or xml

1237707
textbox	button
how do i actually retrieve data from a website .when i write the url in a textbox and then hit the submit button

1237722
hide	show
the hide and show will run for each elements found hence this might explain why it seems a infinite-loop is occuring

1237723
constructor	object
the object where i want to assign it to has been initializer with the default constructor

1237760
postgresql	mysql
the nemo collaboration building a cosmic neutrino detection underwater had much of the same problems and they used mysql and postgresql without major problems

1237778
subtract	time
my first thought is to int divide the time interval by seconds in a year subtract that from a running total of seconds divide that by seconds in a month subtract that from the running total and .so on

1237795
contains	any
note that the php functions json_encode and json_decode will create proper json for you which means it will use double-quotes and it will not use any kind of assignment true json is limited to an arrays object as the outer-most value and it may not contains assignment or function-calls

1237817
authentication	login
given that it will not be capable of doing login or http authentication for enabling that you can use libcurl or another http client this php one liner can be used as a proxy to load content from other sites

1237819
alpha	rgba
i used them to mask an rgba textures against another transformed alpha textures

1237821
selected	cell
i wana store the index of selected cell of table using nsarray can u help me..

1237836
value	field
consider creating a redundant bigint field to hold the int value of af mycol

1237856
debugging	trace
if this is just for debugging purposes i suggest using the old fscommand trace

1237860
literals	hardcode
the problem with the code above is that the versioning is hardcode in the string literals and someone needs to remember to updates it for every release

1237862
moss	wss
put it in a loops which runs 100 time and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key describe in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to checked that your test code is the source of the problem.

1237891
superclass	inherited
all classes inherited from a superclass

1237916
division	modulo
then you pretty much just have modulo and division operations to split the value down

1237930
instances	private
more importantly it will divide the memory into private and shared .so you can tell how much memory your instances of the program is using without including memory shared between multiple-instancess of the program

1237939
filesystems	symlink
i have a string contains the filesystems path to an existing symlink

1237947
configuration	logging
i prefer log4net where you have different logging levels debugging info warn error different loggers you can put one logger for each important part of the application and you can set different debugging levels for different loggers just by changing the configuration file

1237955
virtualization	virtualbox
for testing it will be much better to use some kind of virtualization like sun microsystems s virtualbox

1237961
textbox	button
suppose you have a button on a form that count to 1000 in a textbox and then clears it

1237981
istream	std
there can be also another problem - you are not referring to std namespace members consequently - sometimes you write istream and sometimes you write std istream you write endl instead of std endl

1237997
textbox	button	click	mouse
.when the button is click the tooltip is show on the button i want to simulate putting mouse pointers on the textbox the toolbox to be show for the textbox

1238002
binary	hex
i have a string that has both binary and string characters and i would like to convert it to binary first then to hex

1238017
testng	junit
to run them together there are few options available but i have chosen using different profiling for junit and testng

1238017
testng	junit
since if we add testng dependency to main project in maven it will skip all junit i have decided to put it in separate .profile

1238027
moss	wss
put it in a loops which runs 100 time and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key describe in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to checked that your test code is the source of the problem

1238033
alignment	layout
alignment affects the layout of struct

1238034
contains	any
you re also helped by the fact that memory allocation are always aligned to the maximum alignment requirement of any types they re big enough to contains

1238050
getter	setter
you can view and modify the reference using a getter and a setter

1238058
cross-compiling	autotools
i suggest to use autotools that has very good cross-compiling support and works natively with a cross-compiling

1238066
loading	png
i have thousands of png files that i am loading using libpng and then creating opengl-es textures out of for use in the application

1238067
callback	methods
you can do it in the callback of the click methods

1238088
uiimage	nsdata
then use nsdata to feed the textures loading function if they are based on uiimage

1238091
registration	login
the index file of the main controllers has the login and registration views

1238094
arrays	map
to get the list that s what haskell s s are arrays are different structures you need to use the map higher-order function like this

1238100
installation	building	installation	upgrade
the basic idea is to develop an automatic upgrade framework that knows how to upgrade from an existing sql schema to the newer sql schema and can building an upgrade path for every existing db installation

1238110
webrequest	webclient
the webclient doesn t have a timeout properties however it is possible to inherited from the webclient to give access to timeout on the internal webrequest used

1238113
multiplication	division
converting between units mathematically merely involves a simple one or two step process of division or multiplication depending on which way you are going between units

1238122
panels	grid
every panels contains one colored grid full of strings

1238146
value	field
you cant do this directly as jon skeet said unless it s virtual you re in a positioning to intercept all instances creations of the class and there are no changes to a backing field that influences the real value of the propget

1238164
contains	set
if you re concerned over this sort of performance the approach is to create indexes which incorporate the field in question for example if your table contains a primary key of foo then field bar parrot and shrubbery and you know that you re going to need to pull back recording regularly using a conditional based on shrubbery that just needs data from this field you should set up a compound index of shrubbery foo

1238165
updating	updates
updating display files updates successfully .after click ok exit and start

1238177
selected	button
i have a selected form with a few option value and i want the page to reload .when someone selecteded another option value without having a submit button that is

1238178
listitem	listbox
i want to color the listbox listitem conditional

1238178
selected	listbox
above code is working fine .when i am using selected but it is not working with asp listbox

1238181
.net	wcf
if you are working .net to .net on the wcf you gain greater functionality of course but if you need the validation and return of errors to be interoperable i have a base response class which contains haserrors and error properties

1238181
getter	setter
- a viewmodel which wrap the service proxy-classes intercepting the setter and getter

1238195
arguments	default
works without the second required false arguments but doesn t have the blank option in the form option list - which i d need to be default

1238218
conditional	operators
operators of the conditional

selected	cell
will selected the first cell in a row

1238248
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
opera safari google-chrome and firefox 3.5 al.so support the nth-child n selector .so you can target specific columns

1238256
push	pull
or if you have a thick client .app you can pull down the recording to the client show the report and - if .approved - push them backup

1238264
value	field
in the pageload event of the client scripting i just set the entenders state based on it s hidden field value

1238265
dictionary	hashmap
each computer in the cluster can add a file to a distribute table dictionary hashmap should be fast enough

1238266
reflection	runtime
i ll try to use framework classes especially the runtime and reflection for such examples

1238271
versioning	upgrade
you ll either need to upgrade django or roll your own selectdatewidget perhaps by copying the versioning from trunk into your own project tree if you can t upgrade django

1238295
any	set
as far as making the filtering quicker i don t know of any other simple mechanism that will help as you ve said you need either ant or maven to run the filtering and they both take some time to set up before building resulting in the slow down

1238296
put	get	textarea	pre
for firefox use a pre behind textarea paste text before cursor into it put a marker html elements after it cursorpos and get the cursor positioning via that marker elements

1238296
textarea	pre
notes | code is ugly sorry for that | pre and textarea fonts must be the same | opacity is utilized for visualization | there is no autocomplete just a cursor following div here as you types inside textarea modify it based on your need

1238308
perl	php	perl	c++	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java	delphi	basic	delphi	c++	pascal	delphi	pascal	basic
i ve programmed since i was very young on several languages mostly pascal delphi c++ sql python .sometimes in other languages such as java php or perl .so i m not a newbie programmer but apart from basic html i ve little experience on the front-end side of web programming css html javascript and ajax because on my former professional project if there was web programming .somebody would do the frontend part

1238339
access-token	login
in which case your application would be a consumer - in short the user would need to login and agree to authorizing your application to have access to the their data on the provider and you would be given an access-token which can be used to gain access to those protected resources

1238341
children	nodes
you can use this list and filtering out the nodes without children to get the leaves

1238348
memcheck	valgrind
how do i do a valgrind memcheck on every instances of process without starting it via valgrind cmd options

1238348
memcheck	valgrind
i have tried --trace-children yes option of valgrind memcheck ...but my application xyz signals another application zzz to start a new instances of xyz process which i want to analyze

1238381
selected	cell
.when the user taps on a cell the option is selected

1238381
highlight	selected
but .when the user comes to the screens again i want to have the already selected option to be highlight selected

1238381
selected	cell
i tried setting cell.selected true and also cell setselected yes animated yes but the cell is losing its selected state

1238381
selected	cell
i can see the cell getting selected and also deselected

1238381
selected	cell
how can i make a particular cell hold its selected state .when the view loads

1238402
any	set
that will just rerun any actual code in the constructor which incidentally you should probably be renaming to __construct anyway without affecting any properties that aren t actually set there

1238409
double-pointer	char-pointer
.when you cast a char-pointer to a double-pointer it uses a reinterpret_cast which applies an implementation-defined mapping

1238424
dialog	pop-up
this could be with a onclientclick handler like tsvanharen posted or with a simple text dialog inside the page instead of a nagging pop-up

1238424
hide	show
i use prototype hence the tag and the show hide for it

1238438
buffering	streaming
even if the streaming implementation is smart enough to buffering you still have at least 500 mb 4 131072000 api call

1238440
contains	any
note that the converse is not a problem one can have a single dbml file contains multiple grouping of entities that are not related to each other by any associations

1238442
annotations	mapping
the annotations drive the mapping .so you don t need the mapping file as well

1238463
delphi	c++
the atl is a templates libs for c++ code and .so it has nothing to do with delphi

1238480
postdata	request
on client side there is xmlhttprequest object that can send request that contains postdata to this pages

produced the horrible sql that took 18 seconds to run on the database whereas joining the entities through a where-clause sort of like pre-ansi sql syntax took less than a second to run and produced the same result

1238583
put	get
probably the most straightforward way to do this in vanilla javascript would be to put the javascript function in the page and use the server tags to get the rendering clientid

1238601
listbox	textbox
using the listbox and items should make it alot easier to work with overall since it will be separating them into defined items instead of just append line to a textbox

1238601
textbox	button	selected	button	selected	textbox	hide	show
if you re using the textbox because later you want to be able to selected all the output to copy and paste it i would have the textbox hidden by default and have a button that says like toggle raw output that will show hide the textfield .so users can get the text easily

those buffering need two threads one to feed the pipe exporter and the other servlet to consume data from the pipe and write it to the response output streaming

1238621
base-class	inherited
the only thing that comes to mind and it s a far from optimal .solution would be to include this functionality into a base-class and declare partials for all of the generator classes .so that they inherited from your base-class

1238623
sql-server	mysql
edit note i think you re seeing the microsoft sql-server compact 3.5 provider in your list and that there is no mysql provider at all that you can selected

1238628
hash	md5
my plan was to use md5 hash as the existing passwd can be easily altered with the mysql function and i was expecting to find an easy solution for the gwt-ext side as well

1238628
hash	md5
but as i found out java-security is not supported by gwt and there doesn t seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the passwd string to a md5 hash on client side

1238658
ostream	std
by specifications using of static_cast restrict by narrowable types eg std ostream to std ofstream

this is fine for distributing new binaries to customers i will ship the new redistributable with the install and it will all work

1238744
jquery-ui-dialog	simplemodal
apart from jquery-ui-dialog you can also try simplemodal by eric martin

1238744

1238808
first-order-logic	quantifiers	np-complete	sat
if you can defined your problem in terms of a boolean formula you could throw a sat solver at it but note that the 3sat problem boolean variable-assignment over three-variable clauses is np-complete and its first-order-logic big brother the quantified boolean formula problem which uses the existential quantifiers as well as the universal quantifiers is pspace-complete

1238849
google-chrome	firefox
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is .so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

1238858

1238896
subclassing	superclass
unfortunately it s usually pretty difficult to implements a nice non-brittle solution since it more often than not requiredd the use of subclassing and intimate knowledge of the superclass internals something which may or may not required monkey patching

1238904
subclassing	base-class
to do this early enough and globally will probably required you to make a metadata subclassing and then set that as the meta_class in your common rose db object base-class

1238934
udp	tcp
this makes it possible for a udp or bsd socket based application to establish a wwan connection by using the cfsocketstream api to establish a connection with a tcp server including http webserver

1239076
web-applications	gwt
i mean i having a hard time believing that you can really create full java dynamic web-applications with a rich gui using just gwt

1239079
logout	login
cakephp also seems to not generator unique cakesession ids on logout and login which might be the cause and the solution could be to force cake to use phpsessid everywhere or it may be just to make sure that swfupload send the correct sessid.

1239080
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
every touch sequences beginning from touchesbegan until a bunch of touchesmoved has an execution delay that looks like this

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari all implements it according to the css 2.1 specifications

1239140
google-chrome	firefox	contains	elements
thus in firefox and google-chrome the text-decoration you re encountering is not on the insert content but rather on the parent anchor elements that contains the insert content

1239140
pseudo-element	anchor
i think your options are going to be using the background-image padding technique suggested in your previous question or possibly wrapping your anchor elements in span elements and applying the pseudo-element to the span elements instead

1239143
updating	updates
zero is text data types .so i cast it to int in the if conditional to updates the recording which is only zero and preventing it in updating recording which are non zero

1239183
expression	evaluation
eval expects the usual variety of data-structures and the evaluation rules of lisp determine that a string evaluates to itself and thus will not be interpreter as a program expression but just string data

1239183
interpreter	runtime
it does not say that at runtime this source code has to be interpreter or that the execution is based on this source code

1239183
interpreter	runtime
if the code is compiled neither the compiler nor an interpreter is needed at runtime

1239184

1239420
fadeout	fadein
i have the following code but the fadein and fadeout is too fast i can barely see it.why is that

1239467

if you have javascript enabled you can just use this code-snippets to clear to clear the cookies for the site the webbrowser is currently on i haven t yet found a way to clear session-cookies other than this

1239493
base-class	inherited
next create classes for each html tag that you care about and inherited from your base-class

jslider	jlabel
i want to configure it .so that .when the jslider s value is being changed by the user that new value is reflected by the jlabel

1239668
32-bit	64bit
in other words making the field non- static would cause a constance reference overhead 32-bit or 64bit for each object

1239673
required	checked
clearly i have a poor understanding of the gac and it s effect on visual-studio s behavior. i would be happy to write my own code to checked for the existence of the required office software for the few features that use them

1239673
global-assembly-cache	gac
the application required that assembly office versioning 11.0.0.0 be install in the global-assembly-cache gac first

1239727
lgpl	gpl
i have talked to lawyers about using the gpl and lgpl for code to be interpreter dynamically linked into non-free software

1239737
jslider	jlabel
if your jlabel is a member field of the class that contains the code you can refer to the jlabel within the jslider s change listener like .so

1239744
configuration	environment
thus the default behavior is minimal impact on debugging and i can source one of 2 additional files full of gdb configuration goop to automatically apply some relatively intrusive additional configurationuration to the environment

1239767
export	report
1. export the report

1239779
web-deployment	web
today i ve started adding web-deployment project for our web application and noticed that the deployment project pick up everything that could be a content file from the web application including the csproj files etc

1239781
macros	vba
now i ve got the timer in some vba code a macros if you will in an

1239788
value	field
coalesce it accepts field and a value to use incase the field are null

1239798
hide	show
what i would like the code to do is exactly what it does now but instead of just show hide i want it to slider down and up revealing more or less content

1239823
asp.net-mvc	webforms
yes nice tdd for asp.net-mvc but you have to realize that you are testing a lot of stuff which are built-in with webforms such as gridview and all those nice drag-drop custom-controls

1239823
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you save big time not have to test those built-in controls .when you are doing webforms while in asp.net-mvc you crank up your own and yes you better write tons of more code to test them

1239825
versioning	upgrade
if you are deploying via clickonce even if you get around the gac issue you note above perhaps by having your it department push out a gac registration of the interop assemblies if this is a corporate environment you will need to handle situations where users have a different versioning of office than the standards -- and heaven help you .when office 13 comes out and users start to upgrade and it break your application

1239825
deployment	install
this will have its own deployment challenges though you may need to updates the registry to handle machines that have the pias install for example which could be very challenging .when using clickonce for deployment and is a lot harder to develop against

1239826
javascript	dom
i have a javascript function that changes the css display block none of a large numbers of dom nodes 5000

1239826

i want to avoid any extra work from the browser until all nodes have had their display set

1239828
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
.when touchesbegan i d start a interval that pull at 60hz until touchesmoved takes action

1239835
modifiers	final
in your example there is no issue but if you are going to have more than one instances of the class or methods where the variables is set and it is set dynamically make sure that there is no static modifiers to the final

1239836
postback	ajax
you could use ajax controls that do callback instead of postback for another possibility besides the javascript return false

1239848

now if you run any query in this current query windows it will run as a transactional and you must manually rollback or commit it before continuing

1239848
rollback	commit
you must remember to rollback or commit your query

1239852
any	set
later that object is loaded into my user-interface where changes can be made including deleting any numbers of children from the child set

1239852
any	set
however .when this modified copy is saved any deleted children remain in the database new children being added to the set works fine

1239905
children	nodes
do the process on the cloned nodes children

1239907
removeclass	addclass
because i m learning my way through jquery and playing with addclass and removeclass and i m creating the parameters for those call dynamically i was sure the problem was in my implementation

1239908
g++	gcc
i am not able compile this with gcc g++ 3.4.4 cygwin

this would be great to be able to create a new branch and have it start the continuous-integration and build-process automatically

1239925
continuous-integration	nant
currently i m using svn nant and cruisecontrol.net but i m open another continuous-integration server or building scripting if the situation demands it

1239936
export	report
i am wanting something more like a query builder and data export tool rather than report

1239939
triggers	insert
it can be extremely useful to know which rows have been insert updates or deleted and the output clause allows to do this very easily - it allows access to the virtual tables called insert and deleted like in triggers

1239939
value	field
if you re insert value into a table which has an int identity primary key field with the output clause you can get the insert new id right away

1239939
updating	updates
and if you re updating it can be extremely useful to know what changed - in this case insert represents the new value after the updates while deleted refers to the old value before the updates

1239945
value	field
is the field in positioning 12 a value that can be converted to int32

1239948
hide	show
use css to show and hide the elementss instead by changing the classname of a parent elements

1239977
required	checked
the language standards does not required that it performs bounds checked although it does not forbid it either

1240017
webserver	security
if you are using an oo architecture it s possible to organize your code files .so that they are outside of the web root which gives you an added layer of security should your webserver stop rendering php properly due to a misconfiguration it happens

1240024
arrays	loops
in my experience the performance impact of strict-aliasing mostly has to do with loop-invariant code motion where types information can be used to prove that in-loop loads can t alias the arrays being iterated over allowing them to be pulled out of loops

python	c++	python	java
this arguments fills the role of the reserved-words this in c++ or java but self is not a reserved-words in python merely a naming conventions

1240239
instances	self
i think that the main reason self is used by conventions rather than being a python keyword is because it s simpler to have all methods functions take argumentss the same way rather than having to put together different arguments forms for functions class methods instances methods etc

floating by definition break a block elements out of the constraints of it s contains elements

1240754
contains	elements
the solution is to add a block level elements at the bottom of the contains div that clears the floated elements

1240754
contains	elements
this causes the contains div to wrap around this new block level elements and thus your floated elementss as well

1240754

hash	md5
because of the pigeonhole principles there is likely more than one value that hash to any given md5 output

1240875
hash	md5
moreover md5 is made to make it difficult to find any such reversed hash however there have been attacks that produce collision - that is produce two value that hash to the same result but you can t control what the resulting md5 value will be

1240875
spaces	output
however if you restrict the search spaces to for example common passwd with length under n you might no longer have the irreversibility properties because the numbers of md5 output is much greater than the numbers of strings in the domain of interest

1240880
hash	md5
cryptography hash md5 etc... are one way and you can t get back to the original messages with only the digest unless you have some other information about the original messages etc

1240882
hash	md5
md5 is considered broken not because you can get back the original content from the hash but because with work you can craft two messages that hash to the same hash

1240882
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash an md5 hash

1240929
hash	md5
i d don t really know what excel-interop can do but in standards c# .net the quickest way to hash a passwd in md5 format is use

1242159
display	height
.when you reset the dropdownheight .so the items will display you can either use a stored value from the original height or set it to .some arbitrarily large value that you know will be larger than you need

1242159
display	height
the combobox will automatically reduce this height .so that it is no larger than necessary to display all the items

1242165
put	get
since you put the initialize_devices one on top it rendering that one with higher priority which is why you always get that

1242171
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is another interesting option based on .net and wpf as it is supported by a wide variety of browsers and provides similar rich user-interface experiences

i think you can map you move set to the arrays - if your pieces only move up-and-left or up-and-right that is akin to my b pieces moving only up or right

1242228
temporary	copy
copy all the required files to a separate temporary directory .so you can modify things without touching the original code

1242243
put	get
instead you could create an attachedproperty previouslyused to put on the togglebutton s and use binding .so they get their value a bit more automagically

1242243
selected	listbox
that would also simplify your ischecked situation by binding it to whether or not that item is selected in the listbox and then the listbox takes care of making sure that only one is selected

1242258
contains	set
it looks like you aren t trying to log someone in but rather checked that the cookies they have set to their machine contains the same string that they passed in on the form

nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have extended both nsstring and nsmutablestring with some convenience-methods using category

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for i have implements the ruby stripes function that removes spaces characters at the endpoint for both but for nsstring it returns a new string and for nsmutablestring it uses the deletecharactersinrange to stripes the existing string and return it like the ruby stripes

webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so any information to help me create better webforms asp.net applications would be greatly appreciated...i ve read the what sucks list about webforms from the asp.net-mvc people for which surely there are .solutions work-arounds to make webforms less sucky .

1242350
attributes	properties
minimize usage of viewstate - using instead of an asp labels we never use the styles properties of server side controls but use the cssclass attributes mainly to keep css in the css files

1242350
postback	ajax
we already keep all our business-logic in a br bl layer and we have a similar dal layer for database access....so aspx code-behind is generally fairly light... validation is al.so in the br bl .so that responding to an ajax request or a postback for the same task required little or no duplication of code

1242355
sql-server	mysql
i have read tagsystems performance tests which is mysql based and it seems 2nf appears to be a good methods for implements this however i was wondering if anyone had experience with doing this with sql-server 2008 and very large dataset

1242358
haskell	pascal	row	col
explanation i m too lazy-evaluation to be as clever as the haskell and k programmers .so i took the straight forwarding route each elements in pascal s triangle can be uniquely identified using a row n and col k where the value of each elements is n

1242622
switching	screens
our users were quick to points out that with the current character based interface they could have over a dozen telnet based terminal sessions going at the same time on their pc screens which enabled them to multitask or task switching with high efficiency

1242643
32-bit	64bit
the biggest headache was finding 64bit versioning of our dependencies and refactoring our build-system to handle both 32-bit and 64bit

1242650
jquery-plugins	jquery
ajax and jquery seem like the answer here and there are existing jquery-plugins that will do most of the heavy lifting for you

1242727
malloc	free
if possible it is better to do malloc free in the same scoping imo it makes the code much more readable - memory allocation in c is already hard enough

1242727
malloc	free
in your case you would first malloc call the function and free after outside the function

1242739
push	pull
.when i ve finished a feature i push it up to the master and then login to the production server and pull it to the working directory there

1242741

1242741
intranet	lan
if you re writing an intranet application on a lan this would probably have a negligible impact but on a slow connection that could make your pages appear unresponsive

1242758
any	set
this is a problem because any existing properties which exist on the object but not necessarily exist on the form such as any child collections or object dates or any non-ui facing field are empty leaving you with a half-populated more or less unusable object which can t be saved to the db because of all the missing-data including probably a stack of id s now set to 0

1242771
for-loop	arrays
this new styles for-loop can be used with arrays as well

1242773
contains	any
creating a object types that may contains any of several attributes the roles and

1242793
value	field
however asp.net-mvc follows a round-trip model meaning that your form should already contains all of the field it needs to produce a complete recording either because you pushed value for all of the field into the view or you are asking for all of the field from the user

1242817
append	input
as you would often do turn the prefix into the pattern by append a to the end and comparing it to your input as the fixed string

sql-server	oracle
with sql-server queries it does this for you but you may need to do it yourself for oracle

1242848
swt	awt
since you re mixing awt swt i assume that the jvm can t find the swt libs .dll for windows .so for linux not sure for mac

1242852
malloc	free
if you are using linux with a recent glib and are using that malloc you can return free d memory to the os

1242865
return-type	arguments
most of the time you can t safely change the return-type or the arguments types of a methods that s inherited

1242865
subclassing	base-class
the rational behind this is that every subclassing must satisfy the interface of its base-class

1242865
nsmutablestring	nsstring
.so while it s not legal to change the return-type of methods from nsstring to void it would be legal to change it from nsstring to nsmutablestring

1242868

1243180
pcre	icu
most regex engines and in particular pcre and icu the ones used by regexkit.framework and regexkitlite respectively evaluate such a regex in an almost left to right manner

1243197
contains	any
if the cookies contains all the information the server needs including a signature for data-integrity then the server does not need to store any information on its side therefore there is no way to invalidate existing cookies

1243200
implements	abstract
i have an abstract bass class dataobjectbase and a derived-class userdataobject. i also have an interface idataobject. the interface of course exposes all of the public methods and properties that my data object must expose and you can probably guess that the abstract base implements the methods and properties common to all data object

1243200
implements	abstract
my question is if the abstract bass class dataobjectbase implements everything specified in the interface idataobject should the interface be declare on the base-class or on the derived classes s

1243200
derived-class	base-class
it seems to me that implements the interface on the base-class makes it less obvious that the derived-class implements the interface but then again required the interface to be specified for each derived-class

1243233
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but the background somehow doesn t show up in ie 6

1243244

i need to authentication users with their login and passwd

1243251
updatepanel	gridview

constructor	private
i would say if you habe already a private constructor

1243411
constructor	private
using a private constructor is sufficient because

1243411
implements	abstract
the abstract keyword suggests the user that users of the class might implements the class what is not the case here

1243412
animation	rotation
if you don t want rotation animation overload -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in your uiviewcontroller and return no

i think jndi is the only way that you can create jms connection factory and destinations queue or topic and these are your means of communication

1246301
python	c++
i have a c++ source file and a python source file

1246301
python	c++
i d like the c++ source file to be able to use the contents of the python source file as a big string literals

1246301
python	c++
even though the python source is going to effectively be compiled into my c++ .app i d like to keep it in a separate file because it s more organized and works better with editor emacs isn t smart enough to recognize that a cstring literals is python code and switching to python-mode while you re inside it

1246304
ostream	std	cout	cin
std cout std cerr std cin which are ostream types

1246549
reference-type	generics
the new keyword by definition restrict your generics parameter to be a reference-type with a public parameterless constructor

1246549

you may want to use a factory-pattern to create your object instead of trying to do it through a generics constructor

1246551
output	mode
the indexer is being run in blob mode and i can confirm both from verbose output from the indexer and from looking in the db that the url s that are missing from search are indeed being indexed

1246552

i am assisting with windows support for a pygtk .app that .appears as a system-tray .applet but am not .so strong on the gtk gooey stuff.

1246552
system-tray	tray
we have it .so .when you left-click the systray icons the windows appears right by your tray icons no matter where your system-tray is--and on linux this works great using the results of gtk.statusicons.get_geometry to calculate the size and positioning

1246563
common-lisp	scheme
common-lisp deftype doesn t have an exact scheme equivalent

1246592

1246680
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in ie firefox google-chrome

1246705
ip-address	proxy
people have already mentioned that proxy and router re-use ip-addresses .so unfortunately many people can be using the same ip-address

1246715
python	java
the nice thing about doing it this way in python at least i don t remember if the functionality would be the same in say visual basic or java is that it lets you know indirectly .when bar was repeated in the string due to the fact that the empty strings between bar s are include in the list of results though the empty string at the beginning is due to there being a bar at the beginning of the string

1246720
aiff	wav

what s the easiest way to do with without having to write a static file or fallback to perl python etc

1246820
ruby	php
there are a lot and i mean a lot of similarities with ruby-on-rails except that of course php isn t quite as pretty or flexible as ruby

1246823
deployment	install
a quick tip is instead of installing manually always install the gem via config.gem and then rake gem install to catch any wierd errors before deployment

1246849
web-config	app-config
doing this has allowed me to develop and test a wcf service however this service runs off an app-config and not web-config

take the part from your app-config and put it in web-config

1246880
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms and asp.net-mvc

1246904

support for older versioning of firefox is a lot trickier since any workaround you created would need to be hidden from safari

1246917
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and ie6 all have

1246925
groovy	java
apache-commons-cli is another java libs that you could use in groovy

there are pros and cons for having the login process on the website done through facebook connect or twitter sign in rather than rolling your own registration process

1246976
appdata	temp
users username appdata local temp

1247023
integrated-security	connection-string
it appears that sql-server using integrated-security sspi in the connection-string is receiving the login of the account logged in to windows and not the account returned my.user.currentprincipal.identity .when stepping through the code in both the winforms app-code and the .dll s app-code

1247024
json	xml
you can access json and xml format data that s delivered either with your application as a text file or downloading from a website -- in either case you make a ajax-style request from your javascript code to read the data into memory then write it back out to a local sqlite

1247032

the validation works in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

1247032
google-chrome	safari
does anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work in google-chrome and safari

1247055
authentication	login
the other thought that comes to mind is if you use one of the above and you can support linking multiple external authentication id s to a single user s id on your side is then if one goes down the user can login using one of the other authenticators

1247070
contains	any
if the selected clause contains any columns without named such as selected .

1247080

you can have a private constructor for derived and a public static create function for initializer

1247141
constructor	private
the easiest way to prohibiting subclassing is by making the constructor private

1247167
contains	elements
is there a way to reference a shared re.source in the templates that all contains elementss can access and which can be changed by a triggers .so i don t have to address each and every elements

1247229
postgresql	mysql
a decent web application ruby-on-rails can handle many types of dbms s including mysql postgresql sqlite

1247231

a lot of ruby-on-rails applications use mysql .so support for that is very strong but there are easy options for postgresql and many other popular rdbms platform

1247244
perl	c++
i have a c++ object that i am converting to perl using perl xs

1247251
lookup	any
of how upon receiving a unicode character or any character code but i m particularly interested in the unicode standards the console in windows good ol cmd.exe using say codepages 65001 and xterm in linux started with say lookup the corresponding glyph and where

if i set on the process s startinfo i get odd behavior if i do any simultaneous image manipulation with the freeimagenet libs on the ui-thread

1247272
export	csv
i have the .net code written to export data to a csv file

1247280

i would checked that you have exactly the same modules loaded as it sounds to me like you have a security module on one webserver that is not on the other the configuration file is telling it to load which is causing the server to fail

1247295
derived-class	subclassing	derived-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited
that doesn t prevent subclassing but it is a strong signals to users that it is not designed for inherited and it means you have to be very careful .when using the derived-class

1247298
vba	vb6
vba is all late-bound it is not precompile into a dll like a vb6 dll or a .net-assembly

1247309
data-structures	tree
there are a variety of data-structures like suffix and prefix tries variants on red-black tree etc which support efficient searching

1247311
switching	router
for the most part what we found out is that the hardware vendors switching router computers and wan vendors were able to support switchinging to ipv6

1247323
protected	public
i realize that this forces you to have a public parameterless constructor on your singleton subclassing but there is no way to avoid that at compile-time without a where t protected new construct

1247323
constructor	private	reflection	runtime
however one can use reflection to invoke the protected private parameterless constructor of the subclassing at runtime to achieve that

1247337
controllers	routes
first checked if the routes are set in your controllers

1247349
authentication	login
since it sounds like your goal is to let the user login with their openid your openid provider on that one auth site could itself use openid to authentication the user

1247357
contains	elements	contains	any
however first would throw an exception-handling if the sequences does not contains any elements

1247357
contains	elements
if exception-handling is not desirable you can call defaultorempty which would return the default-value for that types if the sequences contains no elements

1247380
c++	lua
my advice is to bite the bullet and use lua s c api which also works with c++

1247380
c++	lua
your lua userdata object should contains a pointers to the c++ object of class foo2

1247444
databound	radgrid
once the radgrid is databound i run the following

1247453
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements	contains	set
a set is a collections of value contains no duplicates elements

1247467
contains	elements	contains	set
a set differs from a list in that it only allows one occurrence of the same elements contains within it

1247470
uilabel	uiview
i have a subclassing of uiview that has a uilabel properties as one of its subviews

1247474
contains	elements
probably the most common use for hashset is to see whether they contains a certain elements which is close to an o 1 operation for them assuming a sufficiently strong hash-function as opposed to lists for which checked for inclusion is o n and sortedset for which it is o log n

1247476
average	median
i want to compare median to average for each grouping city

do not fear about merging between revision mercurial has good support with merging and relatively easy compared to svn

1247488
arrays	loops
if you want to loops through the elements of an arrays use a for each..in loops and if you want to see if a variables is compatible with a given types an instances of a given class use the is operators

1247523
c-strings	c++
i m not sure why you would be constrained to using c-strings and still have an environment that runs c++ code but if you really don t want the overhead of conversion than don t convert

1247528
png	gif
i need to upload a picture max size 2mb png jpg gif only then rename it then create a thumbnail of it and save both to the same directory

1247541
javascript	dom
therefore you can change any dom elements from a javascript that you activate from flash

1247542
javascript	dom
your actionscript code can access javascript methods that updates the page s dom

1247558
png	gif
svg works fine but anything else jpeg gif png cause dot to crash

1247563
operators	keyword
the reason for this is that without the templates keyword the compiler assumes that bar is a value and you wish to invoke the less than operators on it

1247573
short	base
i like that alternative #2 lets me call the properties gateway wherever i am because it gets used a lot in both the base and concrete classes and it s a short but clear named

1247579
if-statement	loops
execute the if-statement only once instead of each loops

1247624
common-lisp	scheme
as anton says there is no exact scheme equivalent to common-lisp deftype

1247634
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using ado.net entity-framework for connect db and get data.i wanna do if there is no data in object it will write empty field if its full than it will write to listview coloumn data from the db.i am getting system.nullreferenceexception error

1247641
constructor	object
i have an object constructor

1247657
radio-button	selected
this way there can only be one selected via the browsers internal radio-button mechanism and will contains an index to which will be the leader s named

1247666
short	zero
if you re any good at binary even with a short numbers it s pretty straight forwarding to see 0x3c as 4 ones followed by 2 zero whereas even that short a numbers in binary would be 0b111100 which might make your eyes hurt before you were certain of the numbers of ones

1247666
binary	octal	binary	hex	octal	hex
i think the issue may be that language designers are always balls-deep in hex octal binary whatever and just think this way

1247685
display	height	display	width
if i know the height and width of an image that i m going to display with an image tag should i include the height and width attributes or just put the information in css

1247695
variables	boolean
i think yes is being treated as an empty variables .so .when evaluated in a boolean context has the same result as false

1247731
png	gif
problem is i get errors .when i try to upload a png or gif image

1247731
png	gif
what can i do to adjust this easy if possible .so that it can either work with png s and gif s or convert them before trying to work with them

1247735
google-chrome	firefox
it s likely that visual-studio and ie shared the same implementation .so that s why you re experiencing the error in just those two programs and not in firefox or google-chrome

1247744
system-requirements	platform
i don t know what dropbox uses for all its supported platform but it looks like its linux client uses at least gtk dropbox linux system-requirements

1247755
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is there a templating pattern or framework that i can apply in either webforms or asp.net-mvc that is suited for sites like these that have similar content and structure and run from the same codebase

1247756
.war	jar
i ve put the jar file under .war web-inf .lib and added to my classpath in eclipse and added to my html file

1247794
postgresql	mysql
the web application itself will be written with django .so i have a few choices of database including mysql and postgresql

1247794
innodb	myisam
if mysql is an appropriate tool for the job i would also like to know if it makes sense to use innodb or myisam

1247794
innodb	myisam
i understand the basic difference between the two but some sources say to use myisam for speed but innodb if you want a real database while others say all modern uses of mysql should use innodb

1247796
markup	xhtml
all markup is xhtml of course with css etc

1247801
innodb	myisam
innodb supports better locking semantics .so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data-integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1247803
factory-pattern	singleton	abstract-factory	singleton	abstract-factory	factory-pattern
for example i know that understanding abstract-factory factory-pattern singleton pattern etc is absolutely essential

1247804
controllers	routes
url-routing is an easy way to differentiate which site was being served and your which site am i parameters would be automatically handed down to every controllers and subsequently every view if you structured your routes correctly

1247804
controllers	routes
if you need different controllers logic for each site the upcoming release of asp.net-mvc has the concept of areas which would allow you to implements different sites in the same application that all had their own controllers model and view directory - but were differentiated by their routes

1247813
rollback	commit
distinguishing failure-exit from success-exit is quite useful some of the time -- i have no real world experience with d but python with statement also allows that and i find it very useful for example to either commit or rollback a db transactional that was opened in the protected part of the body

1247813
python	c++	python	java
- to friend and colleagues who are gurus in c++ and java i found they immediately understood and saw the interest in having such a feature python does have finally too but that s no help in distinguishing success from failure just like in other languages or c++ s raii destructor of auto variables in the block equivalent

1247822
project-structure	package
in the facetss section of the project-structure set the option package generator files into web facets to the web facets used by your project and it will find it

1247866
realloc	malloc
the c solution is to use malloc instead of new -- this makes realloc available

1247867
realloc	malloc
you can do this using the function realloc though that may only work for memory allocated with malloc rather than new

1247871
c++	lua
along the line of the suggestion to use lua s native c api but since you re in c++ try out luabind

1247883
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standards edition building 1.5.0_03-b07

1247895
value	field
the user could also enter a string into a field that expects a numbers value

1247903
.net-remoting	asmx
without wcf you have to get familiar with a framework specific for a particular communication technology such as asp.net asmx web service .net-remoting msmq etc and usually those frameworks impose on your service implementation and creep in such as using webmethods attributes or having to derive from marshallbyrefobject object etc and you just can not take your service implementation and easily expose it over another communication stack

1247903
.net	wcf
also wcf is the framework microsoft recommends to develop connect system.in .net

1247903
.net-remoting	asmx
the other technologies asp.net asmx ws-security and .net-remoting will most likely still be available going forwarding but may not be supported and developed further

1247908
union-all	having
once you do research it you ll learn that the concomitant problem is having to query all shards and union-all them typically -- or sometimes aggregate them back in different ways .when you don t know where part or all of the answer s may be

1247937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i can t feel that how asp.net-mvc is better than webforms

1247937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am only concerned about unit tests but unit tests are not enough being a reason to turn me to asp.net-mvc from webforms

1247937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
maybe i can say asp.net-mvc is not bad but webforms is already enough

1247947
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
after i upgrade to the iphone 3.0 sdk i noticed that the gradient highlight .when i selected a cell no longer works

1247956
constructor	object
if i have an object constructor like

1247959
dictionary	arrays
if you want strong-typing then i d say you need a custom containers which wrap up a vector of servers and a dictionary or associativity arrays of ip strings that indexes into the vector

1247962
alpha	rgba
you can set per-pixels alpha simply enough say you have a function which takes a 3-tuple for rgb color value and returns some desired 4tuple of rgba color+alpha you could alter the surface per pixels

1247997
constructor	object
it is not possible to loops through all the object you have created unless you kept tracking of them somewhere like in the constructor

1248001
windows-mobile	symbian
do you know any such platform that will work for windows-mobile or symbian

1248039
value	field
this field s value would have a list of all synonym

1248041
fogbugz	trac
the open source tool trac has a fogbugz integration and for the scrum part you can use agilo for scrum which is based on trac and supports scrum comprehensively

1248046
environment	building
i like to building up all my seed data into my dev environment and keep it backed up in my repository .when i go live i can load it with a rake-task

1248048
linux	osx
i can use timed wait on linux and kill orphaned semaphores but osx being usual idiotic self doesn t have timed operations .so i m kinda screwed.

1248063
click	mouse
it seems like jquery grid bug google map if i click the map the litle hand will stay closed and drag the map in the way i move the mouse no mather if i m not clickk anymore

1248069
symfony	drupal
although this might seem a bit unusual at forst there are a numbers of php programs which operate in this way drupal or symfony and it works very well

1248077
triggers	insert
you could use a bit of inline-code .when you insert the new items to triggers a custom event

1248079
delphi	c++
using sql or code delphi c++

1248098
onchange	onkeyup
however .when i use the firebug i do not see any onkeyup or onchange

1248098
onchange	onkeyup
and notice that they input tags have no onkeyup or onchange properties

1248100
compatibility	platform	keydown	keyup
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

1248100
keydown	keyup
i just changed keyup keydown to keypress .so all went well

1248106
arrays	loops
if you want all your images to be downloading at once rather than .when a cell rolls on-screen write a methods which loops through your arrays properties and insantiates internetimage object there

1248116
any	set
the css specifications dictates that if a parent elements is hidden all children will be hidden also even if they are set to display block or any other valid display value or are absolutely positioning

1248122
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of mysql

1248136
input-field	onblur
facebook most likely has some external or internal javascript code that subscribes to the onkeyup onkeypress and onblur events of its input-field

1248136
jquery	dojo
a few examples are jquery yui prototype and dojo and there are more that i can t think of at the moment

1248148
msbuild	nant
just driving statically-compiled pre-factored units of functionality as is the case with nant and msbuild

1248148
msbuild	nant
you don t end up with the same stasis in automation artifacts as easily and as quickly with rake and it s a lot easier to scripting in rake than nant or msbuild

1248148
msbuild	nant
to keep your automation sensible and maintained you should be wary of obstructions that static build-tools like nant and msbuild impose

1248148
environment	execution	environment	building
there s nothing wrong and likely everything right with going to the command-line and execution the building task that sets up the environment before running tests either from the ide or from the command-line or from an interactive console like the c# repl from the mono project or from irb

1248148
access-control	authentication
i also use the test_support code to automate control over the entire environment - replacing service with fakes turning off subsystems to simulate failures and failovers activating or deactivating authentication and access-control for functional-testing that isn t concerned with these facets etc

1248149
png	gif
edit does need to include jpg png and gif file types

1248158
controllers	routes
i know you can have restful routes and rendering to different formats in controllers actions but i m looking for a more all-around solution including but not limited to the following

1248169
constructor	object
in the first code-snippets something is a simple object and not a constructor

1248176
constructor	object
in your second example you defined a constructor function which can be used with the new-operator to create object instances

1248183
selected	button
the add child button works fine but i can t reliably use delete selected children

1248206
google-chrome	firefox
the good thing about selenium is that you can drive firefox google-chrome and ie rather than being restrict to ie which was the case with watin the last time i looked at it

1248206
environment	building
in a previous life we had nant msbuilding scripting to fully manage the environment installing java selenium etc however this does take a lot of time .so as a pre req we assume each building agent has these install

1248212
textbox	button
.when the edit button is click i want a editable textbox to appear where the regular text was and then commit a change via ajax

1248212
textbox	button
besides the placement issue i wondered if i should fetch the appropriate edit box textbox for regular text calendar for dates etc. via ajax .when the edit button is click or would it be better to just send it off with the page and keep it hidden until needed

1248214
contains	set
now you just run the mysql query but set it to look for anything that contains the above value substring search using locate

1248256
png	gif
and it supports jpeg png gif gd .

1248265
getter	setter
edit let me just clarify writing getter setter is syntactic-sugar over the use of a getfoo setfoo foo styles properties

1248279
value	field
what i would like to do is compare an int value against what s in the id value field

1248291
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
you can set any value to your output variables but after execution stored procedure it will contains exactly what stored procedure return no matter what value was in the output variables

1248293
nsmenuitem	nsmenu
you can do this via the nsmenu and nsmenuitem classes

1248294
put	get
see - how are you supposed to get a value out if you do not put a variables in first

1248323
ruby-on-rails	django
in ruby-on-rails the closest i ve seen to django signals are observers

1248324
sql-server	oracle
.so yes - even though it s called output parameter it s really more of an input output parameter and those in inout out like in oracle do not exist in sql-server in t-sql

1248352
value	field
.so the value from the last row is still hanging in the textbox and thus click updates actually updatess the value from the field from the last row into the new row

1248362
value	field
on top of that you can add the details of each data field and what the allowed value are

1248381
jquery-ui-sortable	sortable
as for the sortable you could use jquery-ui-sortable

1248396
.net	wcf
wcf is really the new standards and new generator of web service - and even more generally communication - protocols and libs for the .net world

1248396
.net	wcf
with the wcf-rest starter kit and in the upcoming .net 4.0 release cycle wcf will also extends its reach into the rest styles web communication if that s ever going to be a requirement of yours

1248415
double-quotes	spaces
oftentimes in the configure scripting of qt on unix it s enclosed in double-quotes to allow the cmd to contains spaces

1248451
jsonp	ajax
all my ajax request are jsonp and .when the above code is triggers there is another ajax connection long-polling request last about 10 senconds already established in the mean time

1248519
python	perl
an example in python or perl would be preferred

1248529
json	xml
i have to find all initializations captial letter words such as sap json or xml in my plain text files

1248529
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
ruby python perl - the language doesn t matter

1248530
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
yep i have just tested documentall document.getelementsbytagname on safari explorer6 opera and firefox and seems to work for all them

1248531
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
simply stated you can t deploy an application in a non-compiled language python perl php ruby... in a source-safe way - all existing tricks are extremely easy to circumvent

1248566
children	nodes	children	tree
an alternative to threading is to structure the tree .so that the next elements in every concat nodes is a child of the previous nodes and repeat nodess children points back to the repeat nodes.

1248566
children	nodes	children	tree	any	set
then write a routine or set of routines using pattern-matching or virtual methods if nodess in the tree are implements using polymorphism in an object-oriented language that for any given nodes types produces the correct output and recurses into the next nodes or children in the appropriate way

1248566
children	nodes	children	tree
as you can observe children of a repeat nodes mustn t recurse into the succes.sor of the repeat nodes .so that needs to be taken into account .when threading the tree

1248566
haskell	scheme
a language that supports generator c# s iterator syntax or coroutines continuations scheme s call cc or lazy-evaluation haskell can permit iterator over the first few elements of the list without having to evaluate the entire list

1248640
sql-server	mysql
is there any major benefit of using sql-server versus mysql these are my choices in this case for this schema

1248648
contains	set
note the result set returned by mysqli_stmt_result_metadata contains only metadata

1248648
contains	any
it does not contains any row results

1248651
contains	elements
i ve got an nsarraycontroller that contains a few elements

1248652
.when	ready
having said that there are different ways of adding a scripting dynamically a way of doing this is by append a nodes to the document s body .when the dom is ready and then removing it if it takes to long to load

1248668
triggers	insert
i would suggest if you have power over the schema as opposed to the population process insert new columns called ownersfirstname and ownerslastname along with an updates insert triggers which extraction the relevant information from ownersname and populats the new columns appropriately

1248671
value	field
the best would be not to store several value in the same field but put the named components in three separate field

1248671
value	field
.when you store more than one value in a field it s almost always some problems accessing the data

1248683
perl	php
xampp give you an out-of-the-box installation with php mysql perl and apache .so you can focus on learning html and php

1248687
perl	php	configuration	installation
i d suggest xampp which is php mysql apache and perl packed together with very easy installation and almost no configuration needed

1248692
value	field
your join is based on the same field being equals to two different value .so it cannot ever be satisfied

1248710
contains	any
ps looks like the code for viewportlayout doesn t contains any code for that

1248751
selected	button
click the revision button it says head and from the dialogue selected the revision in question

1248780
access-control	authentication
checkout apache s page on authentication authentication and access-control -- one methods would be using basic or digest-authentication

1248799
any	set
.some styles are inherited .so if you for example apply a font-size to the body elements that would be inherited by any elementss that doesn t already have a specific font-size set

1248810
nsarray	plist
another plist contains 78 strings is loaded into an nsarray

1248812
python	perl
i have this perl snippet from a scripting that i am translating into python

1248854
sql-server	oracle
because that s absolutely not true at least on oracle and sql-server that is

1248854
order	join
because it s a view the join to order gets optimized away

1248856
firefox	safari
it comes as a java command-line tool and allows you to remote-control both firefox ie and safari

1248856
mechanize	hpricot
although it is officially a browser based web-testing tool it can be very useful for crawling and scraping ajax-based web-applications and for all sort of automated tasks otherwise difficult to accomplish with non graphical http clients such as libcurl hpricot and mechanize

1248880
temporary	copy
copy the part you want to blur to a new temporary gd image no need to write it to disk just assign it to a new temp variables

1248891
contains	any
before your for-loop but this generator multiple empty recordinging and is problematic if any recording contains a #42

1248891
perl	awk
the obvious solution is to use perl or awk and use rs to split your recording since those tools provide better mechanisms for splitting recording

1248897
multiplication	division
in theory this is faster precomputing the constants to do multiplication instead of division

1248908
webforms	asp.net
is there anything that asp.net webforms was doing that was magic

1248909
contains	elements
your wrapper elements .accstripe contains two children .ui-accordion-header and .ui-accordion each of which have backgrounds

1248912
constructor	object
i mean to say i want the constructor to automatically resolve the types object of the creator class

1248913
tapestry	wicket
a good example of component based framework tapestry and wicket

1248914
constructor	object
note the convenience constructor stringwithformat returns an autoreleased object which is then retained by the retain properties text of the temp uilabel

1248924
pivot-table	crosstab
you re looking for what s called a crosstab query or pivot-table

1248927
constructor	object
if you want to reliably determine what s creating an object you ll need to express it explicit in the constructor

1248932
variables	boolean
to summarise isset will return boolean true if the variables exists

1248954
any	set
ideally it would be set by default if i don t specify any username

1248954
sequences	unique
i d like to have the username column set to anonymous123 where 123 is a unique numbers taken from a sequences the value of the id column for that instances would be ok

1248960
python	ruby	python	java
pay x amount of money and develop a site within y amount of time using .net java python ruby ect

1248980
background-image	width	background-image	height	display	height	display	width
apply the background-image width height and display block to the span

1248998
web-hosting	hosting
i suggest you to lookup web-hosting in your own language and country which makes it easier to contact the hosting company in case of problems

1249000
continuous-integration	teamcity
the problem comes .when my teamcity continuous-integration building runs

1249000
external	root
i ve tried defining the external as a separate svn root in teamcity but that doesn t work .so i don t think it is the .solution

1249003
python	perl
assume each bin is implements as a dynamic arrays a list in perl or python terms

1249009
json	xml
an external web service is sending json or xml towards my .app

1249041
microsoft-ui-automation	white
i am now planning to look into microsoft-ui-automation that comes with .net 3.0 and the white framework

1249045
ruby-on-rails	django
basically there is nothing approaching the frameworks that .net java or php have nor is there anything web-specific like ruby-on-rails or django

1249054
drupal	django
acording to the tech team at the onion which has migrate from drupal to django django trunk is extremely stable

1249061
value	field
or does updates named mean that the field of named has been set by updates statement regardless if the value is changed

1249081
revision	svn
instead of having teamcity poll the svn repo for new revision

1249083
hide	show
for expediency i d love to be able to do this server-side .so i can just show hide an asp panels accordingly

1249086
gethashcode	tostring
if i have a struct but i don t explicit overrides any of the methods that derived from object such as tostring gethashcode etc then if i declare a local instances of my struct class and call tostring on it would my struct get boxed i.e would the clr convert it implicit to an object on the heap and then call tostring

1249095
gethashcode	tostring
no it s not boxed .when you call tostring or gethashcode if it s implements by your struct why should it

1249114
arrays	loops
i think i ll need a sort of loops in a arrays but i really don t know how to do this

1249130
ref	out
each one of the include statements just points to a php file that pull a short query and echo out a link with an anchor ref to open an inline thickbox with a form .when the user click on the link text like

1249134
aggregate	grouping
if you grouping by some field you can show those field and aggregate others

1249141
triggers	insert
the impacted rows are available within the triggers in the insert and deleted tables

1249142
controllers	routes
i am going to assume that you are using standards restful routes and as a result your form button_to call are posting to you controllers and therefore execution your create action

1249147
callback	methods
you can also do it in the callback to your .ajax or .post or whatever methods

1249152
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
.when a struct types overrides a virtual-method inherited from system.object such as equals gethashcode or tostring invocation of the virtual-method through an instances of the struct types does not cause boxing to occur

1249152
type-parameter	boxing
similarly boxing never implicit occurs .when accessing a member on a constrained type-parameter

1249219
button	popup
even if it s just a form with one button and even though i can take a good guess at what your search popup form will look like i would make no mistakes if i knew exactly what it s supposed to look like

1249228
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in opera safari google-chrome and firefox this works fine the html background show through and the flash mouse over events are still received

1249241
selected	button	highlight	selected
and .when you selected or focus on the button change the image as highlight background-image

1249252
markup	xhtml
do you have an xhtml or html strict or transitional doctype as the first thing in your markup

1249258
python	perl
besides the ability to run external process via subprocess whether wrapped up as gregg suggests or not don t forget that python itself may be able to execute some of your elementary cmd without breaking a sweat and .when feasible that will be significantly faster than delegation execution to a child-process indeed one early motivation for perl s success was that it could do a lot of things within one process while sh was fork away like mad

1249282
put	get
i get only get put and delete request are allowed. why

1249284
perl	tcl
tcl tk started as a side project to demonstrate that api compatibility with perl tk was possible

1249284
perl	tcl
that s great if you know tcl as there are very few surprises introduced by the bridge to perl but if you don t it s awkward to translation from an unfamiliar language

1249295
margins	padding
make sure you reset all your css .so that margins and padding is at 0 before you apply any styles

1249297
order	add
i seriously doubt you ll ever need anything better for the harmonic series - after all even after 2 45 iterator crazy many you d still only be dealing with a numbers that are at least 1 2 45 large and a sum that s on the order of 45 2 6 for an order of magnitude difference of 51 powers-of-two - even still representable in a double-precision variables if you add in the wrong order

1250795
python	c++	python	java
c++ is as slow as python and 6 time slower than java

1250795
python	c++	python	java
.so for double c++ is actually half the speed of python and 20 time slower than the java .solution

1250800
python	java
lexical_cast is more general than the specific code you re using in java and python

1250803

1251032
internationalization	translation
how do you guys handle translation internationalization of your asp.net applications

1251041

1251042
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
which isn t to say that a yet-to-be-designed language can t handle scripting-language features in a relatively static way but it would be difficult for it to become popular relative to the entrenched python php perl ruby javascript set

1251043
double	int
you could specialize lexical_cast for int and double types

1251315
pixels	line
if you re looking at an arrays of pixelss in either 0 1 2 3 or even n dimension it s easy to tell if a certain pixels falls on a square or rectangular grid line within it by using an indicator function like .so i ll use imperative pseudocode to make what i m talking about clear but i m really only interested in the constraints and the conditional in the indicator functions for the more general types of grid

1251316

arrays	map
much like how the singleton class has a static variables to hold the single instances the multiton is often implements with a static arrays or map of instancess depending on how you want to access the instancess - arrayss only allow for numerical access but by using a map you could provide string key to your instancess making them named

1251488
hash	md5
after obtaining the md5 hash from the md5.computehash call you can use jeff atwood s ascii85 encoder

ruby-on-rails	django
blackly magicallish indeed but then that s the downside of frameworks which do such use of fancy metaclass stuff purely for the semantic sugar c you re in clover as long as you want to do exactly what the framework supports but to get out of that support even a little bit may required countervailing wizardry which goes some way towards explaining why often i d rather use a lightweight transparency setup such as werkzeug rather than a framework that ladles magic upon me like ruby-on-rails or django do my mastery of deep black magic does not mean i m happy to have to use it in plain production code.

1252450
mouseover	mouseout
here is a working example it just uses a click to change it once but i ll leave the mouseover mouseout to you - you may want to speed up the animation

1252466
associations	model
this is great if you have a belongs_to associations on the model and you want to use a select-menu to set this

1252496
text-editor	editor
think to yourself what did i always want in a text-editor but never found in the editor that i have used

1252512
widget	button
question .so i m wondering if there s a way to prevent the widget from closing .when click a date and instead force users to click the done button that show up .when enabling the showbuttonpanel true option or click outside of the widget

1252514
frame	width
and the components should always fill the entire width of the jscrollpane whatever the size of the frame

1252518
webrequest	webclient
in response to the comments you said you are using webclient - that is considerably more substantial than using webrequest

1252519
gwt-rpc	gwt
i only know how to do this using google gwt where i had set up gwt-rpc between browser and server

1252525
arrays	loops
then loops through your arrays with addbuttonwithtitle and finally add the cancel button and set its index

1252550
testng	junit
note that i am only interested in developer tests written with junit or testng

1252563
fadeout	fadein
the fadeout and the fadein function have a complete handler you need to use for example

1252567
fadeout	fadein
fadein and fadeout cause asynchronous animation .so javascript continue execution further statements while those effects occur

1252567
fadeout	fadein
.so it starts to fadeout the elements and barely after its started you change the content and then call a fadein which i imagine it gets added to an effect chaining

1252582
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
bastien lã onard s answer has a more idiomatic function to do the conversion using bitwise-and instead of modulo 2 bit-shifting instead of division and the ternary-operator instead of if else

1252585
malloc	free
for this particular case i wouldn t bother with malloc since you free in the same function

1252585
stderr	stdout
error messages should probably go to stderr rather than stdout

1252605
put	get
put another way as soon as the page knows whether it s been called via get or .post it will know the correct super-global to retrieve the id from

1252643
rad-controls	telerik
additionally telerik rad-controls are used

1252643
asp.net-mvc	webforms
lots of tests for business-objects but the user-interface webforms is not testable atm at all no mvp asp.net-mvc applied etc

1252660
.when	ready
a common problem if you don t do this on the load or ready event an event that as far as i know you only get .when using external javascript libs is that you will try insert a value into an elements that doesn t yet exist because the browser hasn t had the time to load the entire html contents of the page

1252669
any	set
reading the iphone api docs i don t see any mention of what should happen .when the timeout occurs just that you can set the timeout value

1252686
python	c++
i know you tagged as c++ however pygame python is a great libs for creating 2d games which also supports an opengl context

1252686
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	ruby	python	c++	python	perl
clutter is a new opengl based gui libs with binding for perl python c# c++ vala and ruby

1252689
value	field
you would replace your value field mycontactperson.id with dbnull.value to always pass the null value

1252702
ubuntu	debian
if you don t find anything i d suggest using your distribution s tools to obtain the source that corresponds to the binary that you have install on your systemd apt-get source libgtk-2.0 on debian or ubuntu

1252719
.net	wcf
we have an existing .net 3.5 wcf service with which preserveobjectreferences is set to true on the server side

1252724
transparency	outline
i tried changing the text color to transparency but the outline of the text is still visible through the image

1252731
udp	mtu
udp s maximum transmission unit mtu size is 64kb

1252738
cos	sin
if t 90 degrees then cos 90 0 and sin 90 1

1252742
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
you could get the 64bit drivers install or run the package use the 32-bit versioning of dtexec located in c program files x86 microsoft sql-server 100 dts binn

1252756
udp	mtu
although the ip layer may allow udp packetss of up to 64k in size i think you will find that the maximum in the wild udp packets size will be limited to the smallest mtu of the devices in between your source and destination

1252756
udp	mtu	icmp	mtu	icmp	udp
if you are determined to use udp you will have to implements path mtu discovery in your protocols and prey that the router firewalls don t block the fragmentation needed icmp packets

1252756
icmp	mtu
but like i said i ve seen cases in the past where fragmentation needed icmp packets are blocked or discarded and i had to manually tweak my own mtu

1252762
hotmail	gmail
i tested gmail outlook 2000 2007 yahoo old new hotmail thunderbird successfully

1252772
progress-bar	progress
since you can t estimate the percent progress it doesn t really make sense to use a progress-bar

1252773
decrement	increment
.when assign something not nil increment the counter the counter could live in the metatable as well and .when assign nil decrement the counter

1252781
positioning	slider
i have a custom uitableviewcell that contains a uislider control and a uilabel which show the current text value for the slider positioning

1252784
swt	awt
it looks like this can be done by mixing awt and swt

1252784
swt	awt
the eclipse project has a sample snippet that embed ms-word into an awt swt mixed .app

1252805
hidden-field	checkbox
if you are they should be ouputting a hidden-field with the existing value of the checkbox in the html with an underscore.js _ in front of it

1252805
value	field
you should be able to appropriate this hidden-field for your purposes you can checked for the value of the hidden-field and compare it to the actual checkedbox field value

1252823
constructor	object
.so i don t think it has anything to do with being in the constructor of an object or anything like that

1252864
authentication	impersonation
tried fstream can t authentication tried filewebrequest revert to fstream .when file is used and impersonation support.microsoft.com kb 306158#4 which says impersonation failed on my vista

1252878
put	get
however you can put which don t get copy-paste maybe in words

1252887
perforce	git
the downside is the price - from what i hear p4 is rather pricey i m not involved in purchasing .so i don t know the specifics and i don t think we re getting anything out of perforce that couldn t be found in an open-.source .solution again i look at git

1252896
puppet	nagios
for tracking our systemd configuration-files dns puppet nagios that sort of thing we use subversion

1252907
authentication	login
assuming that you know a login for that computer i p invoke a wnetconnection to the ipc object to authentication with the machine do my work then do another p invoke to remove the connection to the ipc

1252915
haskell	scala
i am trying to learn scala now with a little bit of experience in haskell

1252915
haskell	scala
one thing that stood out as odd to me is that all function parameters in scala must be annotations with a types - something that haskell does not required

1252915
double	int	type-conversion	double	type-conversion	int
but this only works for double well int work too because of the implicit type-conversion

1252930
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
lookup a concept called domain-driven-design - the biggest thing there is using what s called a repository-pattern such as your userdb class as an adaptor to the database as well as a factory

1252957
deployment	install
for the install i m using the web setup-project under the setup and deployment project types in visual-studio 2008

1252966
any	set
i haven t used it yet as we haven t got it set up properly but my understanding is that teamcity allows running a building and tests if they are any run on the server with your changes before committing and optional the server will commit your changes if the building is succesful

1252969
web-services	api
dfs is the new age api for documentum built on the web-services concept

1252973
web-services	api
they provide quite a nice set of api capabilities as well include web-services which can be used in .net

1252979
braintree	paypal
i m trying to decide between paypal payflow for a transactional process service or a service like braintree

1252980
dictionary	map
as each object comes out shove it in a dictionary or map with the userid as the key

1252980
arrays	map
pass 2 walk the set or arrays of object that need to be fixed up and fix em up replacing the userid with object from the map you built-in pass #1

1252986
keydown	keyup
instead of only looking at keydown events any solution which is going to be caring about multiple key at once is going to have to be looking at both keydown and keyup events and keeping tracking of the state of the key in question

1252987
revision	updates
the normals day-to-day updates commit cycle will work fine as will change-tracking and comparison of revision

1253013
haskell	scala
i think the reason scala required the types annotations on the parameters of a newly defined function comes from the fact that scala uses a more local types-inference analysis than that used in haskell

1253013
double	int
because of implicit types conversions like float to richfloat you can even use your sort function on lists of int or float or double

1253020
haskell	scala
haskell uses hindley-milner type-inference algorithm whereas scala inorder to support object oriented side of things had to forgo using it for now

1253031
shopping-cart	paypal
personally i tend to cringe a little .when i go to buy something and see a paypal button in-place of an in-house shopping-cart

1253039
calayer	uiview
in my answer here i describe a way to apply a glow effect to any text or vector elements draw within a uiview or calayer

1253059
iprincipal	iidentity
our identity model relies on the iidentity and iprincipal classes not the windowsidentity windowsprincipal .so using an alternative identity implementation is fine

1253071
strncpy	strcpy
strcpy - you should use strncpy instead to explicit defined the numbers of bytes to copy and avoid a buffering overflow

1253080
strtol	strchr
a better alternative here is to use an input function like fgets or fgetc to read chunks of input then scan it with sscanf or parsing it with string handling functions like strchr and strtol

1253080
printf	strcat	strcpy	gets
strcpy strcat and printf suffer from a similar problem to gets - they don t allow you to specify the size of the destination buffering

1253080
printf	strcat
it s still possible at least in theory to use them safely - but you are much better off using strcat and printf instead you could use strncpy but see above

1253093
required	checked
i ve been able to work around this by not creating the button until i want it show but that required checked to see if it already exists rather than just using it

1253105
show	next
.when unplugging the microphone that does show activity the next one in my case the mic-in line on my motherboard show up with 0 activity it s not connect .so that makes sense

1253112
firefox	gecko
nothing off the top of my head which uses gecko firefox s rendering engine

1253117
value	field
using your webanalytics data about use actions you could they use that to default the combo boxes field etc to the value the client would have had even change the css on button etc to mark them as being pushed

1253120
udp	tcp
you mention datagram in your question which implies that you are using connectionless udp sockets not tcp

1253121
python	php
i m familar with c# php python etc .so language is not a priority

1253125
lgpl	gpl
ffmpeg is free software and is licensed under the lgpl or gpl depending on your choice of configuration options. from the homepage

1253129
worksheet	excel
excel worksheet named followed by a and wrapped in brackets

1253132
printf	scanf
i ve been wondering how scanf printf actually works in the hardware and os levels

1253142
printf	scanf
.so what scanf printf are doing are just adding bytes or consuming bytes from either streaming

1253144
printf	scanf
scanf and printf are functions in libc the c-standard-library and they call the read and write operating systemd syscalls respectively talking to the file descriptors stdin and stdout respectively fscanf and printf allow you to specify the file streaming you want to read write from

1253144
printf	scanf
the format-string conversion part of scanf and printf does not occur in kernel-mode but just in ordinary user mode inside libc the general rules of thumb with syscalls is you switching to kernel-mode as infrequently as possible both to avoid the performance overhead of context switchinging and for security you need to be very careful about anything that happens in kernel-mode

1253153
put	get
i work on c# windows ...vs05 ......i want to put spaces on enum string ....i do it below code have this.....my problem is after selected a value from the combo how can i get the index numbers of this value .....and if i gone to edit mode then i need to show the value what is user already selecteded .....how to get enum selecteded value on basis of index numbers

1253162
triggers	insert
the basic architecture is that our company uses perforce for source control and we have a subscription service that receives messages from a triggers webservice call than gets called on every p4 commit and insert a recording into a sql database

1253179
contains	elements
bounding-box the background-image is positioning and repeated in the smallest rectangle that contains all of the inline boxes for the elements

1253188
strncpy	strcpy
most people agree that strcpy is dangerous but strncpy is only rarely a useful replacement

1253202
difference	zero
profont is a great alternative to monaco slashed zero more distinct punctuation marks can tell the difference between i l and 1.

1253205
any	set
the package is set as a runtime package it does not have any package required other than the vcl ones

1253214
value	field
within the same value of the first field you can lookup the second field very quickly

1253242
show	next
is it possible to make a dropdown types menu navigation without using javascript and to show an image next to each items

1253248
keyboard	mouse
but to handle all the events keyboard and mouse you have to use javascript

1253262
scala	java
if you come from java i d suggest scala if you come from .net i d suggest f#

1253269
json	xml
the dashboard will just display charts and tables which can be fed by json xml etc

1253269
authentication	login
a user can login via the flex frontend however flex uses my ruby-on-rails application to perform the authentication

1253271
show	next
you can show an image next to each menu item either by using an tag in the x html or using a background-image in the css

1253277
protected	public
there is no reason to specify public private protected since it will always be public as interfaces cannot have non-public members

1253286
printf	scanf
on my os i am working with scanf and printf are based on functions getch ant putch

1253289
json	xml
the difficulty seems to be .when submission different types of data to the server in .post i have no way to tell the server what the data is json xml form encode binary

1253294
display	width
in the html page a dropdownlistfor need to display in the part of some fixed width

1253310
httpserver	yaws
if this is the case i recommend that you start with yaws a fast httpserver written in the functional concurrent-programming language erlang

1253321
contains	elements
the title elements will show a tooltip contains the whole text .when the user hovers his her mouse over the dropdown option

1253322
value	field
ie i want to create .some generics code .so that i just only pass table field named and their value for these field and then it display the table with passed field

1253342
licensing	gpl
if you think that the totalcross bods have somehow broken the gpl i m presuming here that superwaba was based on waba and may be subject to gpl licensing itself - that may or may not be the case another avenue may be to contact them and just ask them what they think about that

1253350
32-bit	16-bit
this final complex value is then multiplied by 2 30 both real and imaginary parts are converted to int and then the bottom 16-bit of each are used to provide the 32-bit 4 bytes of the local key

1253360
cos	sin
q1 cos yaw 2 cos pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
- sin yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
q2 cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
+ sin yaw 2 cos pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
q3 sin yaw 2 cos pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
- cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253366
seam	jsf
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253366
seam	jsf
see this article for details speed up your data-driven jsf seam application by two order of magnitude - part 1

1253366
seam	jsf
since seam 3 is imminent and supposed to make use of 2 new specifications jsf 2 and webbeans that leaves questions on what happens to project on seam 2 and how long it will take for things to get stable

1253376
python	c++	python	java
.so i am looking for an online judge engine that could support python c++ java # could be a plus .so that the guy who paste the question could provide a simple test then others could answer it with the onlinejudge to verify it works or not

1253402
hide	show
bonus there is a faster way of doing this show hide thing

1253402
hide	show
this article showed me the lighting show hide performance

1253411
webforms	asp.net
i ve built a asp.net webforms site for a customer and lately the customer has been experiencing a lot of not implements error messages while using the site

1253461
authentication	impersonation
i m using windows-authentication and asp.net impersonation for authentication of ssrs

1253470
linux	unix
a typical unix linux systemd

1253471
value	field
my properties of types bool from a bit field on sql db always return false even though the value on the database is true

1253488
deployment	install
you cannot start application sample deployment application from location it is already install from location

1253499
latitude-longitude	location
how to calculate the bounding-box for a given latitude-longitude location

1253502
variables	boolean
i suggest doing this in a arrays of n boolean variables where you flip bits to get 2 n possible input then testing your operators with the generator input arrays and printing the result

1253502
arrays	loops
one simple way of generator the arrays is to create a loops in which you increment a variables from 0 to 2 n - 1 and then converting the numbers to binary

1253526
versioning	upgrade
from a corporate perspective sometimes its a big decision to upgrade to a later versioning of ie - the use of an internal bespoke web client being one reason

1253545
wgs84	gps
this doesn t fully correct for the earth s polar flattening - for that you d probably want a more complicated formula using the wgs84 reference ellipsoid the model used for gps

1253566
hide	show
then show hide populate the controls there

1253608
memory-management	memory-leaks
take a look at these links inorder to learn more about windbg memory-leaks and memory-management in general

1253610
short	zero
in short how can i execute a+b such that any loss-of-precision due to truncation is away from zero rather than toward zero

1253621
python	php
if it s not well-formed you can always use a tool like python beautifulsoup or php s domdocument loadhtml to load the html and output well-formed xhtml for your conversion

1253621
ruby	php
there are also tools like fpdf php and prawn ruby which was used for the very pretty dopplr report but imho they re much more fiddly to use - more like using absolute positioning in css than allowing things to flow by themselves

1253670
floor	ceil
why do all rounding functions ceil floor return a floating numbers and not an int

1253719
gzip	zip
gzip is short for gnu zip

1253732
arrays	map
it s arguably faster to store the overlay and offset in separate arrays from the tile but having each area on the map self-contained like this is easier to understand

1253735
asp.net-mvc	webforms
and with respect to posting back i knew that asp.net-mvc don t do postback like webforms instead it call controllers .so is this means that each view .a.sox file don t have a related .cs file or the .cs file is shared with many .aspx files

1253742
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional associations with the many valued end the set or bag marked as inverse true

1253742
arrays	map	set	bag
please note that nhibernate does not support bidirectional one-to-many associations with an indexed collections list map or arrays as the many end you have to use a set or bag mapping

1253742
set	bag
otherwise you might have to map your collections as a bag or set instead of a list

1253747
hide	show
in each of them is a picture where i have an onmouseover onmouseout event on it which show a messages in a div and hide the messages

1253747
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is after a user move quickly from left to right over a lot of images all mouseover and mouseout events of the images are execute which looks stupid.

1253749
linux	unix
after that if on unix linux - you may use gzip

1253750
sorted	lookup
if your asked to use this phone book to lookup listings with the firstname of chris your out of luck the phone book is not sorted that way

1253766
mouseover	mouseout
we ve had the exact same problem what we ve done is on the mouseover event is to set a variables _mouseon to true set to false on mouseout then set a onetime event over that fires in say 500 ms

1253770
firefox	opera
it doesn t work only in firefox opera and ie8 are ok

1253774
selected	cell
you will need to selected the 5000 cell on sheet2 and enter the formula and then press ctrl-enter to insert it as an arrays formula

1253777
rad-controls	telerik
otherwise try a third party offering such as telerik s rad-controls for winforms

1253794
put	get
to be restful you have to follow rules like get for read put for create etc.

1253799
selected	cell
still in sheet 2 selected cell a2 to a99 or however many columns you expect to enter

1253812
environment	restart
it is possible to propagate in already opened application the value environment variabless of windows of a variables of windows after its creation or its modification without having to restart the applications which turn

1253813
serialization	marshalling
the marshalling module can be used to serialization code object which can then be reassembled into a function

1253819
average	median
find median or average value of all distance

1253831
sql-server	mysql
.when you do not want to have the numbers of votes in the output you can do this as well in sql-server it is possible .so i believe it should be possible in mysql as well but i haven t tested it since i have no mysql here

1253832
nunit	moq
for a long time we had only .net 2.0 assemblies and applications but still created .net 3.5 sp1 class-library project for testing with nunit and moq

1253836
websphere	ibm
if they are different things what are the product in ibm s websphere stack that can do these two different jobs

1253843
environment	building
the vcvarsall.bat that does setup de building environment let you choose between x86 | ia64 | amd64 | x86_amd64 | x86_ia64

1253843
32-bit	64bit
first option is obvious for 32-bit but the question is what would be the optimal option between the other 4 if you want to building for 64bit and you want to run on all 64bit machines

1253845
python	ruby
it would be really handy for it to work in more than one language python javascript or ruby

1253845
emacs	vim	textmate	macvim	textmate	emacs	textmate	vim	macvim	vim	macvim	emacs
other than using macvim s own find as you types tool or a command-line editor like vim or emacs i use textmate as my main editor what are my options here

1253848
fwrite	fclose	fwrite	fopen	fclose	fopen
to read write gzip files programatically one could try the zlib libs which enables read write to gzip files using a similar interfaces to fopen fwrite fclose

1253857
version-control	git
about tracking configuration-files with version-control systemd that is not what vcs are for but for example for git there are many tools built on top of git to manage configuration-files isisetup etckeeper and other that can be found on webpage

1253863
document-ready	.when
document-ready fires .when the dom is fully loaded .so you would be correct

1253873
credentials	security
it represents the authentication credentials for the current security context in which the application is running

1253883
lcov	gcov
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux project i highly recommend gcov and lcov

1253885
hide	show
since now you won t be able to rely on event-model and will have to manually code lots of javascript to interconnect controls enable disable repopulate show hide etc.

1253886
cakephp	joomla
i have a joomla instances and a cakephp instances in my site

1253890
contains	set
i need the result set to contains the latest 20 or 30 entries

1253895
serialization	marshalling
edit the marshalling solution looks also pretty smart didn t know you can serialization something other thatn built-in

1253897
system.reflection	.net
the .net already exposes some reflection tools to developers as stated by user weiqure and i would recommend that you sample the system.reflection namespace to get started with reflection too

1253898
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc and webforms can live side-by-side in the same .app .so could new pages sections simply be developed using asp.net-mvc if that s the route you want

1253905
python	c++
i am considering programming the network related features of my application in python instead of the c++ api

1253910
javascript-events	onkeyup
to generalize the question javascript-events are handled by associating an event types onclientclick onkeyup onfocuse etc with a function or multiple functions

1253913
textbox	button
.when the user click a button you handle this .post request in a controllers action set some sort of flag in your viewmodel to now show a textbox then return the same view which in its turn will look at the flag and generator a textbox if required

1253918
credentials	ntlm
in short ntlm doesn t alllow more than one hop with it s credentials token

1253922
rollback	commit
it holds persistent recording of the transactional and manages the communication for the two-phase commit rollback process with the resource managers

1253922
rollback	commit
in tp-speak a transactional manager is something that issues commit rollback request to resource managers

1253922
rollback	commit
a transactional manager or tp monitor is the subsystem that the application uses to control the transactional commit rollback process

1253922
rollback	commit
it hosts the middle tier of an application and provides apis for getting transactional ids and voting to commit rollback the transactional

rollback	commit
where only one process is involved in the vote this is equivalent to advising the commit rollback

1253922
rollback	commit
because of the dissociation from the database connection commit and rollback must be controlled out of band from the middle-tier through another protocols

1253922
rollback	commit
the commit rollback request to the resource manager do not have to come from the same server as the one hosting the application

1253922
rollback	commit
a transactional manager can use a separate transactional coordinator to manage the commit rollback process

1253922
rollback	commit
in other cases the transactional manager can issue the commit rollback instructions to the resource manager database directly using a protocols such as xa

1253923
value	field
datetime field apparently will not get sent to the eventreceiver afterproperties if it is null as thus my code will not pick it up as a null value

1254105
gridview	listview
i have a control templates in xaml that contains a listview with a gridview

imho one of the best ways to do this is to provide ie6 users a complete but downgrade versioning of your site

1254117
value	field
will selected all field from tablex where somevariables x and the weekdifference variables value is greater than or equals to the recurrencetemp variables value

1254126
innodb	myisam
on a site i work on we recently switched to innodb from myisam and we found that some simple selected queries which had both where and order by clauses were using the index for the order by clause resulting in a table scan to find the few desired rows but heck they didn t need to be sorted .when it finally found them all

1254204
launchd	daemons
you can run your server as a service windows o daemons linux and .when you want the gui you have to launchd and operate with it

any	set
also skip any set of triple patterns

1254312
any	set
solution e.g any set of one pattern

appdelegate is just a nsobject subclassing implements uiapplicationdelegate protocols

1254376
solaris	linux	solaris	unix	linux	unix
if you are using any linux unix solaris os it is available unless you have explicit not install

1254404
hide	next
you will have to edit the plugins as this will hide the radio and replace them with the stars which i assume is just rendering the elements next to each other ignoring your original td structure

1254422
updating	updates
2 use updates to do the manipulation - you may be able to do this just updating existing columns or you may need to have added a few extra ones in the right format .when you create the temporary table

1254435
gethashcode	equals
if it hasn t you might be using different object instances that represent the same actual cluster and you perhaps haven t provided a suitable equals implementation you should also updates gethashcode at the same time

1254439
windows-vista	windows-xp
it won t be same in windows-xp and windows-vista

1254465
macros	vba
if you wish to copy both the value and the formatting then you ll probably want to knock up a vba macros

1254482
vb.net	vba
this is traditionally done using vba but you can also use .net c# og vb.net by using vsto visual-studio tools for office

1254482
vb.net	vba
personally i find c# vb.net much better languages than vba

1254509
ghostscript	pdftk
another way is to break the document into pages using ghostscript or even pdftk convert each page to pcl insert the cmd and concatenation the pages together

1254510
basic	vba
building up an arrays seems like the natural fit but vba arrayss are borderline useless since basic methods like append required you to redim the whole arrays

1254538
joomla	drupal
if you re looking for an enterprise-class cms i would not look at php templating cms s joomla drupal etc but look at a java cms jsr-170 or plone

1254543
aix	rpm
aix 4 5 6 use the rpm v3.0 - 1998 circa iirc redhat 6.2

1254543
aix	rpm
or as a good alternative to building yourself rpm 5 - which other on aix

1254570
hide	show
is there any way to use databinding to show or hide a paragraph within a flowdocument

1254572
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i would like to make a link from a webpage to a file on a local filesystems and make it work in all browsers or at least in internet-explorer firefox and google-chrome

1254572
google-chrome	firefox
but not in firefox and google-chrome

1254588
updating	updates
rather than the user downloading the entire .app including features he does not need and re-downloading and manually updating it whenever there is an updates the user only downloading and starts a small bootstrap executable which in turn downloading and install those parts of the .application that the user needs

1254597
selected	listbox
you have to use javascript to selected all the listbox options then all of them will be send to your controllers

1254614
execute	prepare
make a prepare befor loops and in loops just give the value and execute

1254617
32-bit	64bit
aix 5.3 introduced the ldr_preload for 32-bit programs and ldr_preload64 for 64bit programs variables

1254626
required	checked
i ask because it seems really inefficient that the javascript is just doing a constants checked which required a the server to do work every 1.5 seconds and b my browser to do work every 1.5 seconds just .so that on my end i can say oh boy i got an im

1254627
python	ruby	postgresql	mysql
i m rather interested in the actual algorithm not ready solutions although i d be ok with taking a look at something implements in ruby or python or relying on mysql or postgresql

it s not the same to .post to an url than to get it delete it or put it

1254633
itemscontrol	textblock
is there an equivalent of itemscontrol for text content inside a textblock or flowdocument

1254650
32-bit	64bit
i remember hearing that for performance a development machine should be 32-bit while servers should be 64bit

1254650
32-bit	64bit
why would 32-bit be faster than the 64bit for a development box and vice versa for servers

1254655
execute	prepare
the idea behind prepare statements is that you call db- prepare once and execute can be called multiple time on the same statement object

1254655
arrays	loops
the db function checked to see if the second parameter to the function after query is an arrays and if .so it loops through running query against the value in the arrays

1254661
32-bit	64bit
in a funny way file operations are quicker on my laptop 5400rpm drive running 64bit 2008 server than on a office pc with a 7200rpm drive running 32-bit xp

1254666
wamp	php
if that works too your wamp server is working and you should be able to execute php files

1254667
32-bit	64bit
however if you are using your main os to hosts viewmodels then you can probably benefit from a ton of memory for your various virtuals - and then you can choose 32-bit and 64bit viewmodels to suit your needs it is harder to have a 64bit guest viewmodel in a 32-bit hosts

1254675
global-assembly-cache	gac
try checked for versioning of the dll in the global-assembly-cache gac

1254683
python	java
pylucene - gcj-compiled versioning of java lucene integrated with python

1254690
wamp	php
assuming that you have actual php files rather than their output and all the resources that they need you will have to put them into the source folder that wamp is configure to display and then you will be able to view them by going to in your web browser

1254692
32-bit	64bit
the only reason i can think of to choose 32-bit os is that you know that what you develop will work on 32-bit and 64bit machines

1254709
webforms	asp.net
here is a link to add optiongroup - dropdownlistfor control with optgroup s for asp.net webforms

1254711
32-bit	64bit
it is true that your development-environment on a 64bit os is running in an emulated 32-bit environment and that creates a slight overhead

1254711
32-bit	64bit
this makes the 64bit os slightly faster than a 32-bit os

1254711
32-bit	64bit
what really matters is that 64bit os es are very stable have access to much more physical memory and can run both 64bit and 32-bit applications and virtual machines without sacrificing performance

1254726
bash	zsh
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

1254726
bash	zsh
both zsh and bash use the same less at usr bin less

1254731
review-board	svn
revisioning would be done in our svn repository and we could thus re-use our existing review-board installation which is a nice bonus

1254740
cucumber	webrat
i am using the selenium-client gem with webrat and cucumber to test a ruby-on-rails project

1254746
silverlight	wpf
though now i have looked it up that is silverlight rather than wpf

1254793
derived-class	base-class
use dynamic_cast .when casting from a base-class types to a derived-class types

1254793
required	checked
as arkaitz said since dynamic_cast performs the extra checked it required rtti information and thus has a greater runtime overhead whereas static_cast is performed at compile-time

1254796
menuitem	button
but what if someone hopefully a designer wants to change the button to a menuitem

1254796
service-locator	inject
your viewmodel can use a service-locator to grab dependent service .so your unit tests can inject dummy service

1254800
value	field
the code runs fine but my issue is this - during the call to my sub itemadded i want to change the value of a field belonging to the current list item in this case an aspx page

1254800
value	field
the idea is that i can configure the title field to be another value which my event receiver configure and by the time the user sees the page in edit mode the new title will have been saved for the page

1254800
value	field
plus .when viewing the page the title field value has not changed

1254802
python	php
the php and the python code are both install on the same hosts php is execute by mod_php5 and python through mod_wsgi usually

1254802
python	php
now i wonder what s the best way to call this php ad management code from within my python code in a most efficient manner the ad management code has to be called multiple time for each page

1254802
python	php
write soap interface in php for the ad management code and write a soap-client in python which then call the appropriate functions

1254810
value	field
if you want each thread that uses the class a to have its own separate value of needstobethreadsafe then you just need to decorator that field with the threadstatic attributes

1254822
subtract	add
solution would be to either create your dates in cocoa with the reference date of 1970 or to add subtract the offset in cocoa or php

1254827
duplicates	lookup
as i said before one of these is the category description field sorry this is not a lookup in certain places this recording automatically duplicates itself on output because in the database this comes from it has to have this sub category for one particular types

1254839
variables	boolean
use a boolean variables to tracking if a user has edited data

1254847
grouping	sorting
i have list of object i need to sort the list based on object s property1 and i need to sort again the resultant list with object s property2 without loosing the grouping done in first sorting ...

1254850
environment	building
i would question any perceived issues with shipping pdb-files as actually being a valid concern but assuming there is a valid reason you can do this but it required more effort on you part to create the appropriate software building environment

1254861
set	bag
each document is reduced to a sparse-matrix vector of pairs and you can throw a naivebayes or some other classifier at the set of vectors that represents your set of document or compute similarity scores between each bag and every other bag this is called k-nearest-neighbour classification

1254870
seam	jsf
if you re going to be using ejb and jsf already seam is killer

1254870
seam	jsf	richfaces	icefaces
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the lifecycle states that seam provides conversation etc.

1254870
wicket	seam
if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration

1254910
zend-debugger	xdebug
xdebug or zend-debugger

1254913
.when	ready
do we have any approach to load the scripting for rounded corners first in ready function and rest of the events dynamically .when i mouse over on the main div

1254915
buffering	streaming
in_avail returns the lower-bound of how much is available to read in the streaming read buffering not the size of the file

1254917
updating	updates
also an updates button will be there for updating

1254920
parentheses	operators
the expression strings are parsing into tree and respect the basic operators mathematical logical and relational as well as precedence through the use of parentheses

1254927
jquery-plugins	jquery
ensure jquery is first or before any jquery-plugins

1254951
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the other thing to note about the onbeforeunload event is that at this time opera does not support it safari firefox and internet-explorer do though

1254953
restart	reload
sometimes i need to reload service configuration from the gui and restart the service

1254958
selected	button
a list of subjects and a button to delete selected subject from list

1254978
updating	updates
since the sqlite file just reflects what is in the mysql-python you can avoid the headache of updating the .app s file by just replacing it with an updates versioning

1254980
put	get	order	join	aggregate	grouping
you can specify the order of the items within the aggregate put order by in the derived table you can grouping and join .so you get more than one result row you can change delimiters and .so on

1254987
value	field
another is that the value of of the properties may be a derived value not a single field like totalvalue amount quantity

1254989
shell	bash
my default shell is bash .so take this with a grain of salt

1254994
python	php
technically this is a language-agnostic asp jsp php ruby-on-rails python etc. question but i intend to implements in php in an asp.net-mvc setup

1255015
contains	any
for example the following code is not valid because base doesn t contains any virtual function

1255029
value	field
i have a few selected options boxes on one page i m trying to get the value and text of the selecteded options and insert them into hidden field if i selected the first one only first time after page reload it doesn t work but if i selected the first one and second one after page reload it works

1255043
solaris	aix
here s the patch applied to esql c 3.50 on solaris - you ll need to adapt it to aix

1255043
32-bit	64bit
i have 9 32-bit scripting and 8 64bit scripting created by a set of 12 different patch files all for solaris i m afraid

1255045
profiling	debugging
well you can see the entire query in sql profiling admittedly that is after it s been sent to the database but it gives you an easy way to copy-paste the statement .so you can debugging with that inside management studio

1255061
any	set
there doesn t seem to be any guarantee .when those value are set .so the workaround i used is to hook into the sizechanged -event of the control whose value i want

1255066
value	field
in the sproc i tend to use a string of isnull statements for this to use the param or the field value if the param is null

1255071
32-bit	64bit
one is 32-bit and the other is 64bit

1255071
32-bit	64bit
it sounds from the error that you are trying to load a 64bit dll into a 32-bit process

1255081
external	embed
now we are being asked by customers --- who typically allow their own users on via intranet+windows login --- how they can embed our .app into their own website and allow their own external internet customers to access it

1255086
catransition	caanimation
i had a problem where i had a series of overlapping catransition caanimation sequences all of which i needed to perform custom operations .when the animation stopped but i only wanted one delegation handler for animationdidstop

1255086
catransition	caanimation
however i had a problem there didn t appear to be a way to uniquely identify each catransition caanimation in the animationdidstop delegation

1255086
catransition	caanimation
.when you start your animation use the setvalue methods on the catransition caanimation to set your identifier and value to use .when animationdidstop fires

1255086
catransition	caanimation
are there better techniques for caanimation catransition identification in the animationdidstop delegation

1255089
put	get
if you do get stuck by accident know that local admins on the application tier machine are tfs super-admins who can bypass all security checked and put things back inorder

1255091
dictionary	map
the versioning with the synchronized dictionary doesn t work properly as you are not protecting the map dictionary inside a lock before using it

1255091
dictionary	map
you have to protect the map dictionary inside a lock .so that only one thread at a time can access it

1255092
communication	messages
.so you need .some pretty fancy inter-server communication .sometimes just duplicating messages to both servers

1255094
http	ssl
java client certificates over http ssl

1255104
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you shouldn t necessarily use asp.net-mvc over webforms just as you shouldn t use webforms over asp.net-mvc - they are both tools and are more or less appropriate in different situations

1255104
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there are .some things that asp.net-mvc does better and .some things that webforms do better but if you don t know both technologies you can t choose the best one for the current project you are doing .so please don t do yourself a disservice - go and learn asp.net-mvc

1255129
freebsd	linux
freebsd might be a certain way today but maybe in the next release it will copy a feature from linux that would erase the need for you to building your program two different ways

1255129
freebsd	linux
say that on freebsd these are the a and b features and on linux they re the x and y features

1255129
solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos	sunos	bsd
it could be that feature a comes from the original bsds and is in solaris because it has bsd roots from sunos in the 80 s and solaris also has feature y from it s systemd v based redesign in the early 90 s

1255129
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
by testing for these features your program could run on solaris too because it has the features your program needs just not in the same combinations as on freebsd and linux

1255131
webforms	asp.net
the page is an standards asp.net webforms page with a modal pop-up created by simplemodal 1.2.2

1255157
constructor	private
and why in the constructor of a class can t i modify a private char buffering like this

1255163
python	perl
i suggest using python or perl

1255166
credentials	account
the users will need to enter their credentials twice but they will use the same account would this be good enough for them

1255171
cherrypy	django
i can t speak for django but in cherrypy you can have one function per http verb with a single configuration entry

1255178
twisted	pyro
i ve nothing against twisted and pyro but the sort of simple messages you re going to be sending don t required anything like that and might be overcomplicated by using some sort of framework

1255275
winscp	putty
winscp to interact with the development server with norton commander like interface as well as the good putty integration

1255276
assign	add
its easy enuff to add a column but how do u set up the auto-increment feature to automatically assign a key to each row

1255277
click	mouse
there are some scripting that could disable mouse click or crtl + c and other simple ways to copy content

1255290
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
int sizes 8bit 16-bit 32-bit

1255291
void	main
public static void main

1255291
mousedown	mouseup
now this mouseupdownfilter will fire an mouseup mousedown event .when they occur on a watched control for example your textbox

1255291
assign	add
to use this filtering you add some watched controls and assign to the events it might fire in your form s load event

1255298
32-bit	64bit
i believe this is 2 gb for both 32-bit and 64bit oses at the moment although i could be incorrect on that

1255299
http	ssl
http connect is often only allowed for ssl tls portss typically only ports 443 .so this cannot be used as a sneaky way to get an unfettered tcp connection to the outside world

1255326
selected	textbox
it looks like you should set it in the report itself - by click the textbox in the properties you should selected canshrink to false

1255333
shell	bash
i m guessing the is different in the emacs bash shell

1255334
sql-server	mysql
handles mysql oledb and sql-server dialects

1255334
sql-server	mysql
i need to query jet mysql and sql-server tables

1255353
innodb	myisam
for mysql the data is stored in variables .lib mysql or something similar path and depending on the database format you are using with myisam the database information will be stored in a directory of its same named in .frm .myi and .myd files and with innodb the database information will be stored in the ibdata1 and ib_logfiles

1255355
conditional	operators
it may happen that sql-server places converstion before you join conditional operators

1255357
dependency-injection	inject
edit the only possible area i could see for improvement would to be change the fact every call is a new query and perhaps change your code to use a dependency-injection framework that will inject the correct provider and .when the object is called that it will initiated a database transactional for the query

1255364
click	mouse
the only question i really have is how can i programmatically click without using some kind of click event say if i want to click the start orb and my mouse is at that exact location i d like a sub or something that will click on it

1255366
binary	hex
i d like to append the int to the string but in human-readable form hex notation rather than in binary gibberish

1255390
code-coverage	gcov	code-coverage	lcov	lcov	gcov
code-coverage - gcov lcov .

1255396
sql-server	oracle
oracle cannot return resultsets from a stored procedure as sql-server does

1255398
innodb	myisam
the precise structure of these depends on the storage engine used typically myisam or innodb for mysql

1255403
command-line	cmd
you can execute arbitrary cmd with plexus using command-line

1255403
stderr	stdout	environment	execution
it handles escaping of the arguments environment specific execution and allows you to attach consumers to stdout and stderr leaving you to focus on the handling

1255408
click	mouse
you will need to p invoke mouse_event in user32.dll inorder to simulate the mouse click

1255423
implements	extends
either make trackthread implements runnable and not extends thread anymore or just write

1255429
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have done some prototyping using webforms and have written some quite good functionality mainly as poc during the prototyping but i can t see that being useable as-is under the asp.net-mvc framework

1255429
asp.net-mvc	webforms
thus my question is this how many people write asp.net-mvc webforms hybrid apps and what are the pitfalls for doing .so

1255429
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would like to write the .app under asp.net-mvc as there are many common screens that are used in different workflows .so the asp.net-mvc architecture seems ideal but there are al.so quite a few screens that i can quickly develop using .some of the webforms tools the gridview and .so it would be advantageous for me to be able to do .so

1255461
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve just gone through an .app that has a webforms asp.net-mvc hybrid layout and functionally it works just fine

1255461
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there are a few issues to watch out for such as having webforms in folder that are also used for routes which can cause asp.net-mvc router to fail in odd ways but otherwise there are no problems i ve encountered in mixing webforms and asp.net-mvc

1255603
http-get	put
from my limited knowledge of rest it is utilizing http-get .post put delete verbs to perform crud-like operations on remote resources denoted by urls which lends it into a more chatty and remote-method like styles aka rpc styles

1255606
datagridview	databound
i have a non databound datagridview no datasource etc

1255630
duplicates	lookup
checked the lookup table to see if type320 is found there in duplicates

1255649
imap	nntp
i use the term network service to refer to things such as nntp imap pop3.

1255654

tcp-ip	udp
that s what a binding is a level of abstraction built on a basic protocols typically udp ip or tcp-ip

1255770
windows-vista	windows
for example lets say i wanted to setup a project for creating windows-vista and windows 7 gadgets

1255772

the issue is that g append the hold spaces .so you need to use x first to swap the pattern and hold spaces append the hold spaces which was the pattern spaces output your line and then restore the holdspaces

1255774
prawnto	prawn
is anyone using prawn prawnto with jruby on ruby-on-rails

1255774
prawnto	prawn
i just install prawn and prawnto and started playing with the pdf-generation capabilities

1255775
arguments	default
i have a few questions about the default arguments promotions .when calling a function in c

1255775
double	int
if the expression that denotes the called function has a types that does not include a prototypes the int promotions are performed on each arguments and argumentss that have types float are promoted to double

1255775
arguments	default
these are called the default arguments promotions

1255775
arguments	undefined
if the numbers of arguments does not equals the numbers of parameters the behavior is undefined

1255775
arguments	undefined
or the types of the arguments after promotion are not compatible with the types of the parameters the behavior is undefined

1255775
arguments	undefined
if the function is defined with a types that does not include a prototypes and the typess of the arguments after promotion are not compatible with those of the parameters after promotion the behavior is undefined except for the following cases

1255775
arguments	default
the default arguments promotions are performed on trailing argumentss

1255775
double	int	unsigned	short	arguments	default
the default arguments promotions are char and short to int unsigned int and float to double

1255775
arguments	default
the optional-argumentss to variadic-functions like printf are subject to the default arguments promotions

1255775
arguments	default
.when do default arguments promotions occur

1255794
contains	any
in any case the way associations ruless are used to generator recommendations is that given some history itemset we can checked each rules s antecedant to see if is contains in the history

1255800
scientific-notation	rounding-error	scientific-notation	numeric	rounding-error	numeric
general numeric sort compares the numbers as floats this allows scientific-notation eg 1.234e10 but is slower and subject to rounding-error 1.2345678 could come after 1.2345679 numeric sort is just a regular alphabetic sort that knows 10 comes after 9

1255800
digits	zero
and zero or more digits

1255810
any	set
also relying on autoeventwireup being set to true means that you are introducing overhead into the parsing of your page code as asp.net will have to create any delegation for you at execution-time

1255816
prawnto	prawn
i have built several ruby-on-rails apps that put pdf-generation front and centering and i can definitely attest that prawn prawnto is the way to go

1255818
arguments	default
parameters to functions without prototype and variadic parameters are subject to default arguments promotions

1255828

can t you just change your deployment platform from windows-mobile 5.0 to windows-ce 5.0

1256062
void	main
it works on my machine does not trump behavior specified by the language standards just because void main or x x++ is giving you the results you expect for a specific platform and compiler doesn t mean it s okay to use

1256064
put	get
you get the touches as a from the touchesbegan methods you ll need to loops through all the touches and put them into context of your .app .so that you can identify them later

1256103
python	ruby
frankly in my domain python offers a lot morethan ruby especially if you integrated it with pyqt

1256111
python	ruby
also most of the other technologies python ruby asp.net don t handle well on cgi or required persistent process

1256122
arguments	default
for those of you who are wondering why things are this way in the dark ages before 1988 there was no such thing as a function-prototypes in classic k r c and the default arguments promotions were instituted because a there were essentially free as it costs no more to put a byte in a register than to put a words in a register and b to cut down on potential errors in parameter-passing

1256122
arguments	default
as to .when default promotions kick in default arguments promotions are used exactly .when the expected types of the arguments is unknown which is to say .when there s no prototypes or .when the arguments is variadic

1256130
any	set
for any custom dialog form in a winform application i can set its size and positioning before i display it with

1256130
any	set	savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i am wondering if there are any hooks to set the positioning for the standards .net openfiledialog and savefiledialog which do not have a startpositioning properties

1256148
parentheses	macros
wrap all macros parameters in parentheses

1256172
any	set
converting the character set and collation of the table after insert data will convert the columns but of course any data already insert will have already lost whatever characters the original character set couldn t represent

1256172
any	set
the later only changes the default character set for the table and will not change any columns even if they were set to the default at creation

1256178
python	php
all of the user-interface and integration is implements in php and all of the business-logic database work classes and back end stuff is written in python

1256179
reflection	runtime
it is possible to bind a generics at runtime based on string named but this required reflection

1256196
sql-server	oracle
will work with sql-server 2005+ or oracle 9i+

1256203
environment	building
you need to pay attention to your instructions for putting together a building environment from scratch and keep it updates

1256223
access-control	authentication
i need some help with creating a simple webrole that uses federated authorzation authentication with liveid and the access-control service

1256239
http-get	put
although there are similarities between crud operations and the http-get put .post delete there are subtle difference that are very significant to the architecture of your application

1256242
mediawiki	dokuwiki
either mediawiki and one of it s pdf output plugins this one by pediapress or dokuwiki and dokutexit though that seemed to have trouble with document made from several wiki pages .when i tried it a few weeks ago

1256252
explode	implode
if you really want to use explode and implode you could do something like this

1256264

1.- put a flash transparency movie over the real player plugin- not working the player break the z-index and the video goes to the top

1256264
player	movie
2.- put an iframe transparency over the real player plugin- not working it puts on top but .when i make the iframe transparency the movie goes agains to the top

1256292
hash	md5
all hash in general and including md5 do not have performance dependent upon the content

1256300
arrays	loops
observe that by taking loops index modulo the numbers of elements in an arrays you can get every permutation

1256305
instances	self
you disambiguiate between the instances methods named and a local variables using self it is allowed to have both with the same named in the same scoping

1256308
firefox	safari
no you can t in firefox safari etc

1256317
authentication	login
i m using outputcaching in my page that has a user-controls but i don t want to caching this specific user-controls because it s related to a user login if i access the page i see the page as if i were authentication with another user

1256348
stderr	stdout
after having parsing your cmd which include redirected stdout stderr the shell fork opens creates the files if they don t exists

1256360
sqlcmd	ssms
enabling the sqlcmd mode from the ssms menu solved the error

1256376
sqlcmd	ssms
if you are execution this from ssms you should try enabling the sqlcmd mode from the menu before execution the scripting

1256377
order	join
for your case the simplest way would be to do a sequences of your split join cmd in the order of longest to shortest replacement

1256393
json	xml
all you have to document is the data types that will be used xml formats json etc.

1256400
value	field
the second variant we bind to the original object but we store the original value in our editing dialog either in local field or in a temporary data-object

1256409
ruby-on-rails	django
that said if you are creating a decent-size web application i highly recommend trying out a popular framework such as ruby-on-rails or django

1256429
attributes	properties
this code however produces an invalidoperationexception-handling with the messages must have non-null value for properties . if you remove the conditional that uses the binding attributes the exception-handling is not throw

1256429
attributes	properties
in the msdn documentation it states that you must have either the properties or binding attributes set

1256432
zpl	epl
also your printer may use epl instead of zpl but zebra s guide for that is equally good

1256446
fancybox	blockui
the issue is with the jquery blockui plugins not fancybox

1256447
instances	private	implements	abstract
and even if it isn t abstract it doesn t usually make sense to manipulate class designed to be base classes as value they usually should be noncopiable copy-constructor and assignment-operator declare private and not implements is the standards trick inheriting from a suitable class whose lone purpose is to make its descendant non copiable -- boost noncopyable for instances -- has become fashionanle

1256473
hide	show
what this does is simply hide the form .so that if you show it again its already loaded into memory

1256479
csv	xml
i like to think of the primary distinction in this case as xml is tree based while csv is table-based

1256479
csv	xml
that is you can nest and re-nest and omit and generally make a complex tree in xml whereas you can only make simple 2d tables in csv

1256511
numeric	zero
for example special things happen for int value 0 - optimisation to store numeric types and a zero value

1256556
response	timeout
for the load-balancing to work the application-server needs to honor the ttl from dns response and to resolve the domain named again .when caching timeout

wikipedia runs on mediawiki software which uses php and mysql although by now mediawiki might support other sql databases such as postgresql - you ll have to checked the docs

1256581
directory	folder
this al.so has the side-effect of ensuring that all dependent assemblies are copy-paste to the debugging bin or release bin folder during the building .so they are in the correct directory .when the application is run after it has been compiled

1256585
attributes	properties
easiest way to fix it is to make myannotation a properties with a retain attributes then take out the autorelease and instead of myannotation use self.myannotation

1256597

ruby	php
since learning php and mysql and javascript i ve thought why not try my hand at some of these other bests like asp.net or ruby

1256684
lighttpd	apache
you could either put them in with your media files site_media php or if you prefer to use something more lightweight for your media server like lighttpd you can set up another portion of the site that goes through apache with php enabled

1256688
python	php
while i m mainly working with django python now it s hard to beat the rapid development deployment of php

1256702
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it s looking like firefox and opera tested on mac as well don t like the cross domainness of this but safari is fine with it

1256713
any	set
otherwise i wouldn t put any stock in it unless someone comes up with a much more deterministic set of results

1256756
pixels	line
you may want to store the location of the previous drag and just retrace the previous line to erase it instead of painting 5000 x 5000 25 million pixels

1256757
contains	elements
i keep getting the error sequences contains more than one elements

1257306
textmate	emacs
i second docgnome s suggestion of django mode and yasnippet but the real kicker that will make you never want to go back to textmate is to integrated pyflakes into your development-environment at which points emacs will provide you on-the-fly notification of errors in your python code

1257306
textmate	emacs
as far as theming like textmate theming can be a bit annoying emacs

1257509
keyboard	mouse
this is an actual real world problem btw that has been observed on headless servers which naturally have rather small entropy pool because they lack entropy sources such as mouse and keyboard input running linux where applications incorrectly use the dev random kernel cprng for all sorts of random numbers whereas the correct behavior would be to read a small seed value from dev urandom and use that to seed their own prng

1257524
directory	folder
just just tossed all the folder in one directory

order	add
i think nopcommerce has order as gift feature with a little bit of tweak writing a bit of code you can add the other features

1258920
order	add
in the confirm order page you ll have to add some of your logic to save the order as repeat order

1258968

1259002
sql-server	oracle
the thing is that you need a valid named for your parameter named in sql-server named in oracle and a valid placeholder in your sql query named in sql-server named in oracle

1259002
sql-server	oracle
you should be able to create your placeholder by using this string as a format string taking the previous parameter named as input implying that the format string is for sql-server and for oracle

1259002
sql-server	oracle
this has been tested with sql-server access sqlite and oracle but note that quite unsurprisingly this will not work as is with odp .net ...

1259113
windows-server	windows-xp
you need to have windows-server 2003 resource kit install works on windows-xp to use nlsinfo

1259135
json	xml
my current idea is to simply parsing the path_info with a regex then dispatcher the request to the appropriate subroutine which will then spit out the json xml or even xhtml for the requested resource

1259142
queue	fifo
2.the definition of a queue is a fifo and by definition a fifo is not iterable

i don t talk about selected the text but highlight parts of it with a background-color or a colored underline

1259183
uiresponder	uiview
note that any uiviewcontroller or uiview is a subclassing of uiresponder .

1259194
selected	textbox
what you can do is to selected a portion of the text to make it stand out but that is obviously a very temporary solution note that the hideselectedion properties must be set to false for this to show .when the textbox does not have focus

1259216
selected	checkbox
i have three roles which can be selected through checkbox

1259223
scala	java
.so how do i use java s collections.shuffle on a scala arrays

.so the trace layer al.so send all trace to a debugging server process al.so .when ever a process send or receives a messages this info is sent to the debugging server with a unique id for the messages

1259276
any	set	value	field
create an set field where you can defined any roles the user have in just one value this will still required altering the table if you want to add a new role but at least it won t add another field to the table

1259297
value	field
i thought to make use of session variables for storing my form id in it while saving the form and to read its value while saving the field in the attributes table

1259299
hide	show
windows 7 allows users to hide show icons in the notification-area aka systray

1259307
ref	out
in c# you cannot specify any modifiers like out or ref other than this for the first parameter of an extension methods - you can for the others

1259307
ref	out
hence marking the parameter as out or ref doesnt make sense as you can t specify the modifiers .when you call it like you d do for normals methods

1259314
webforms	asp.net
.so basically all or most of the stuff that the asp.net webforms validation controls do

1259330
linux	unix
it ll store preferences in hidden-files on unix linux and use the registry in windows-based systemd although that s implementation-dependent

1259333
javascript	dom
then pass it in the dictionary you use as an arguments to rendering_to_response or whatever you re using to rendering your view and in your templates stick into a hidden-field which you can then pull out of the dom to pass to your javascript graphing function

1259345
contains	elements
for the above to work correctly a s elements types has to be a subclassing of scala.anyref equivalent to java.lang.object because arrayss.aslist uses the arrays passed in as the backing store for the result java.util.list and java.util.list can contains only object references not primitive value

1259371
value	field
.so the numbers inside .somethingelse and .somethingmore could be replace to a new value but any bracketed value to the right side of the term field would not be touch

1259380
selected	checkbox
is better than -- .val will work on selected checkbox as well - where attr value won t be reliable

1259410
put	get
if you put this into a selectnodes statement on your dom document then you will get a nodelist back which you can interrogate for the information you required

1259413
any	set
and also is there any way to set it that it only looks for files that begin with a certain prefix ie img

1259448
dictionary	arrays
as the dictionary was built up in an associativity arrays with the elements storing the frequency and the key being the words themselves the output was not in any particular order

1259499
32-bit	64bit
thus a 32-bit primitive types read is atomicity on a 32-bit cpu whereas a 64bit types read is not

1259503
variables	boolean
i think you only need to mark the boolean variables as volatile

1259506
domain-object	repository
the mapping file would map domain-object to repository and then inside the registry methods it could then use unity to resolve the instances of that specific repository for example and have them as singleton instancess

1259510
minimum	max
i have a table with the attributes parameter_id value and time and i want to have each parameter_id with its min value and the time .when the value is minimum and its max value and the time .when the value is maximum could you please tell me the query

.when	ready
why not keep the tables separate and use a join .when you are ready to get the complete data

1259527
ubuntu	linux	32-bit	64bit
.so in theory you could but i would make a lot of tests with a copy of the database files first to be 99 sure specially if you re on a 64bit systemd and the xp and linux versioning are different for example xp 32-bit and ubuntu 64bit.

http	ssl
server side caching of response should be ok as it is happening on a different layer than the ssl tls that http uses to encrypt

1259652
constructor	object
i personally like to create immutable object those you can only setup once by passing all the value into constructor

1259658
malloc	free
it depends normally if you are using a linux box the underlying malloc will start allocation stuff in the heap and it will grow however if you free some big inner chunks it won t be able to free anything till the top part of the heap is free as the onyl thing it can do is grow or reduce the heap

ninject	moq
however it s worth mentioning that ninject 2 has an extension for it that provides integration with moq --

1259902
tabcontrol	linklabel
i may be wrong about this but i think that if you change the linklabel s backcolor properties in code in your form s load event as opposed to just setting it in the designer to match the color of your tabcontrol it will work the way you want it to

1259935
classname	inherited
in the interest of consistency i always use super even if for single inherited it does not really matter apart from the small advantage of not having to know the parent classname

1260512
sorted	lookup
a sorted list show of course good lookup performance - o log n - but it show horribly updates performance insert and removals are slower by more than the factors 10 compared to tree

1260512
sorted	lookup
a balanced binary-tree also has o log n lookup performance however it is much faster to updates also around o log n while a sorted list is more like o n for updatess o log n to find the positioning for insert or the elements to delete but then up to n elementss must be move within the list and this is o n

1260512
sorted	lookup
their lookup is good but their updates performance is bad as within each nodes of a b-tree you have a sorted list again

1260512
binary-tree	tree
not too surprising after all avl tree are more strictly balanced than rb-tree .so they are closer to the optimal binary-tree in most cases

i am using entity-framework + automapper to convert the entityobjects to poco

1260620
joomla	drupal
if you are looking for a content-management-system cms then you should look at drupal and or joomla

then you just need to do the right trig calculations to work out the great-circle distance google that between a pair of latitude-longitude points and then order the results by distance

1260811
where-clause	sql
if your local database can be sql based which sqllite3 is then that all adds up to a sql query which adds a bunch of trig calculations to calculate a distance column and maybe also a similar where-clause to limit the search within a radius or bounding-box

1260811
order	add
having calculated the distance column in your query then it is easy to order by distance and add any other criterion you like

1260819

silverlight will be connecting to my server using wcf service hosted in asp compatibility mode to the same asp.net-mvc website

1261007
multiplication	addition
i m thinking a bit about the ease of implementation too addition of 2 bigints is more complicated then multiplication by 2 but i m more concerned about the performance rather then the size of code or ease of implementation

1261022
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
its not too bad in firefox google-chrome safari but it s very bad in ie7

we are beginning the process of moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc for all of our new applications

1261068
double	int
other than that use more precision double or int math

1261106
png	gif
is there a way to readonly a few bytes out of a blob types field in a database for this question it doesn t matter the db branding and determine if the binary content is an image assume it is one of jpg gif png

1261106
png	gif
i don t understand image file structures formats well enough to know if there is some sort of standards header in the first few bytes that i could read in to tell if it is a jpg gif or png

1261116
put	get
the only way i have found to do this is to put the attempt to read the file in a loops and exit loopss .when i don t get an exception-handling

1261122
32-bit	64bit
let s assume the numbers are stored in a binary representation and your arithmetic happens in chunks of some size 32-bit or 64bit

1261122
multiplication	multiplying
if multiplying by two by left-shifting that s one left-shift operation for the multiplication and one right-shift operation + and with 1 to obtain the carry

1261137
markup	xhtml
but if there is string xhtml adheration requirement then you would probably need to close all your markup tags including

1261143
contains	elements
the html dtd does not prohibit you from using an empty a elements may contains pcdata including the empty string but it doesn t make much sense to have an empty paragraph

1261157
margins	padding
use to indicate a line break inside a paragraph a newline without the paragraph block margins or padding

1261166

1261240
openfire	ejabberd
ejabberd would be a good server as it supports bosh i don t know about openfire or tigase but i d say they do

1261243
value	field
since the value is fixed at compile-time there is no possible inconsistency as there would be with variables or readonly field that can be initializer to different value for different instances at runtime

1261244
export	report
.so i ask the .so community how they are using the above tools or if they know of any other easy to use tools for measuring ie7 javascript memory-leaks that i can use in preparing report for management from which you can export raw-data

1261246
contains	elements
settings.xml file contains elements

1261255
distance	altitude
if you had a linear model traveling 50 of the distance between the points also means you went upwards through 50 of the altitude then you can probably pretend that the entire thing was a right-triangle

1261255
distance	altitude
you act as though the world is flat for purposes of determining how the altitude shift affects the distance

1261255
distance	altitude
the distance along the ground is the base the altitude change is the height of the triangle and the hypotenuse is your estimated true travel distance from points to points

1261255
distance	altitude
if you want to refine that further then you can note that the model above is perfectly good for infinitesimal distance which means that you can iterate across individual delta of the distance calculus-style each time using the current altitude to compute the ground distance and then using the same trigonometric ratio to compute the altitudinal-change contribution to the distance traveled

1261259
selected	button
.when i selected one of the radio button myfunction doesn t get called

1261260
apache-poi	itext
apache-poi and other software such as aspose.words will let you read the structure of a .doc and itext will let you create a pdf but there s bound to be a million little foibles and edge-cases in both that means any implementation of a converter is sure to be non-trivial

1261263
document-ready	.when
i m trying to use document-ready in ie 8 and i keep getting an error that the object does not support this properties .when i load the page

1261263

1261264
python	c++
either c++ code or python code is ok but i would prefer an example using the python binding

1261268
webserver	security
using a real webserver is a much better way to test a website - things like the browser s javascript security policies are significantly different between local files and files read via a webserver

1261275
required	checked
mac os x comes with one out of the box which required nothing more than checked a box in systemd preferences. setting up such a server for development would let you view the site at and might resolve this relative links problem

1261276
put	get
i tried to put this in the main page but i get an error because #tabs does not exist on the page .when it is first loaded

1261277
radio	click
ie has a problem with the change event on radio button try using click instead

1261286

the problem is that in edit mode the links in the html are not clickable hovering over them does not show the hand mouse cursor and click them just insert the cursor at that spot rather than navigating to that link

1261294
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
ideally what i d like is for users to be able to highlight selected one or more cell in the spreadsheet they wish to give a colour to then with one click on the colour key cell be able to copy its interior colour to the cell they selecteded originally

1261294
selected	cell
user selected cell a17 d17 and wants to set the interior colour of those cell the same as the interior colour of cell a2 just by click on cell a2

1261306
vb.net	vba
using excel 2007 is it possible to change the transparency of charts grid line using vba or vb.net

1261309
internationalization	localization
perhaps still follow the general internationalization localization guidelines and create a separate dir for each support language such as en.lproj and it.lproj and the then named your dbs as en_data.db and it_data.db or whatever naming conventions you prefer and place them in their respective directory

1261313
addslashes	nl2br
as all of the details are currently unescaped and i would rather not go through the process of using nl2br and back again i m thinking of two queries one using prepare statements for the _post variables and then another using addslashes and regular statements for the file

1261339
reflection	runtime
php s runtime reflection is not exactly known for speed

1261346
double	int
then to realize this generics class for a specific types you would write examples here for int double and string

1261355
derived-class	base-class
in general covariance allows you to express more information in the derived-class interface than is true in the base-class interface

1261355
derived-class	base-class
the behavior of a derived-class is more specific than that of a base-class and covariance expresses one aspects of the difference

1261355
derived-class	base-class
it s useful .when you have related hierarchies of gubbins in situations where some clients will want to use a base-class interface but other clients will use the derived-class interface

1261364
required	checked
save a dated copy of the raw external feed .so you can remember in future why the workaround was required separate off and comment the code line that implements the workaround .so it s easy to get at and change if and .when the external organization corrects its feed or break it in a different way and checked it again from time to time

1261366
value	field
it will be returning a copy of the value .so even if you could change the field it wouldn t do what you want

1261366
value	field
make your field readonly and add a constructor to let you pass in the value

1261397
value	field
the distinct methods provided by linq doesn t seem to behave the way i would expect and append .distinct .count to the end of a linq query grouping by the field i want a distinct count of an int id column seems to return a non-distinct count of those value

1261414
order	add
you would have to add an order by clause to your query to ensure any sort of order

1261435
contains	any
these contains arbitrary dates and can represent nearly any points in time as the range of expression is typically very large

1261440

1261451
put	get
can i skip the synchronized block on the take call having only a synchronized block on the put loops and get the desired effect

1261452
attributes	properties
and the fact that they points out that you have to use one of the two properties but do not say anything about leaving out the attributes altogether suggests to me that the attributes or programmatic call is required to use app-config in the way you want

1261461
fadeout	fadein
i am attempting to cycle through arrays of words with a jquery fadein fadeout

1261481
message-queue	messaging
if your requirements allow for asynchronous messaging you might want to consider using system.messaging in conjunction with message-queue as a third option

1261491
bazaar	git
mercurial and bazaar don t support this and git s support is limited

1261495
contains	elements
if the box only contains floating elements either add this just before the end

1261526
duplicates	contains
well the best way would be to filtering the data not to contains duplicates

1261533
frame	width	height	frame
note the imagestructure variables is a trivial structure that stores the total width height numbers of frame and a list of images representing each frame

1261550

1261598
delphi	c++	pascal	delphi
i am doing a project converting some pascal delphi code to c++ and would like to write a function that is roughly equivalent to the pascal setlength methods

1261636
toolchain	gnu
for gnu toolchain you can use th stripes cmd to remove symbols from object-files

1261640
pyflakes	pylint
i don t use pyflakes or pylint but i imagine you could easily adjust this to work with other checkers

1261641
order	add
hey this sounds like a good place to add a shameless plug for my book a sane approach to database-design where i discuss design considerations and the order in which you should make design decisions.

1261643
haskell	python
you can try using ctrl-break but that s not working to break out of a dll in haskell and i m doubting it will work in python either

1261647
constructor	private	hide	show	instances	private
hide form constructor make it private then add static factory-method that would initializer new instances of the form and show it straight away

1261655
calloc	malloc
note that the arrays must have been allocated with malloc or calloc

1261675
required	checked
this required the same types of checked in the application .so either way would be fine to me

1261676
instances	destroy
called .when the instances is about to be destroy

1261676
derived-class	base-class
if a base-class has a __del__ methods the derived-class s __del__ methods if any must explicit call it to ensure proper deletion of the base-class part of the instances

1261678
binary-compatibility	compatibility
sun never guarantees source compatibility between release only binary-compatibility

1261690

1261718
png	gif
convert jpg png gif whatever into an rgb byte arrays which is independent of encoding

1261720
exception-handling	try-catch
option 2 the app-wide try-catch isn t really for safety it s just because you think you can do something more useful with the exception-handling like printing something out and exit cleanly than just let the c++ runtime call terminate

1261724
duplicates	lookup
because if we re talking arbitrary strings for place named here then trying to find duplicates and have lookup for them is probably a lot of work for very little gain

1261726
any	set
just wondering if there is any way to checked if the value of a selected box drop-down matches the original value at the time of page load .when the value was set using

1261744
hash	md5
the easiest thing to do is to do a hash like md5 of the image data ignoring all other metadata

1261809
default-value	default
this way if you don t supply opt or deliberately set it to default it will get assign some kind of dynamic default-value

1261817
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i only have experience doing this with the asp.net-mvc with webforms i imagein it would be a lot more difficult because of the lack of an httpcontextbase class

1261827
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
learning how to use the google-chrome debugger tools or similar tools in firefox safari opera etc. will also be invaluable

1261855
contains	any
any sufficiently complicated c or fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of common-lisp

1261856
linked-list	arrays
the only advantage of a linked-list over an arrays or arrayslist would be if there are insert and deletions at arbitrary places

1261859
updating	updates
i m aware that membershipprovider.getuser has an option to updates lastactivitytime and i ve already tried insert my little updating routine in there but it doesn t seem to get called at all

1261906
signals	sigint
receive a sigint signals

1261911
configuration	logging
it s very flexible and there is a user-interface tool that you can use in case you don t want to mess around with managing logging from the configuration file

1261917
shell	bash
i needed this for cmd files that take unfriendly file or directory named and pass them to cygwin bash shell scripting which do the heavy lifting but i couldn t afford to have the embedded single-quotes or spaces lost in the transitions

1261924
any	set
this is necessary because there isn t a default autorelease pool set up for any threads except the main one

1261927
buffering	streaming
something like this should work using a data streaming to read from the buffering

1261945
.when	ready
.when we have a new project we branch the trunk develop over the branch git-rebase from trunk if any other branch was merged into the trunk and .when we are done ready to test we deploy the branch

put	get
in strictest terms the url must represent a resource and proper http verb get put .post delete must be used

1262049
json	xml
the request could be in an xml or json

1262054
uploadify	.post
i have an asp.net-mvc view that uses jquery.uploadify to .post files to one of my controllerss for use in my application and one of the side-effects i noticed with uploadify is that .when the flash file uploadify uses to submit files to the server .post to my controllers it gets its own sid from asp.net

1262054
contains	any
.so given this issue after i upload files with my view the current user s session does not contains any of the files that were just posted

1262067
web-services	api
but my sense tells me that inorder to be effective a check-in policy should be enforced on the server itself for example to support checking-in changes from the command-line or using the raw web-services api

1262102
contains	any
my question is if a .aspx page does not contains any server-side code or runat server attributes does anything .net related get started

1262109
put	get
well newer versioning of .net put layer on top of older layer .so all the older knowledge you get is definitely practicable however not all of it is practical

1262143
hosts-file	hosts
.so i edited the hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts and added this entry

1262147
http	ssl
the do not save encrypted pages to disk comes into play .when dealing with ssl http connections

1262147
http	ssl
just like a webserver can send done information about how to caching a file one can basically set internet-explorer up to not save files to the caching during an ssl http connection regardless if the webserver advises you can

1262153
radio-button	selected
has anyone had any success attaching a rich togglecontrol component to a radio-button component h selectedoneradio or alternatively any of its children selected items in this case s enumitem

1262158
perl	ruby
interpreted-language do well with code-generation you should think about perl or ruby

1262170
lwjgl	jogl
you could use plain java with an opengl binding like jogl lwjgl but you re going to have trouble with media playback

1262196
declarative	imperative
the trick is that because you re working with declarative code rather than more-familiar imperative the temptation is to try to think of it as if everything happens at once

1262196
order	join
often time the order you list tables is dictated to you you start from tablea and you need to list tableb first inorder to have access to columns required to join in tablec

1262196
order	join
.so going back to our three-table join we want to list the tables in the order that will keep the working set smaller for longer

1262223
attributes	properties
these classes are decorated with the datacontract attributes and each of their properties is decorated with the data-members attributes

1262232

windows-server	windows
our code also runs on windows and before we knew any better we import several databases on to a windows-server

1262262
administration	account
i have a wcf service written in c# being hosted on a remote machine running as the local administration account

1262262

i m using the operationbehavior impersonation impersonationoption.required meta tag on the methods that required impersonation and i have the credentials types and security modes set correctly

1262265
textbox	button
for a panels with one textbox and one button which is its default button the defaultbutton event fires only once as editing textbox details again and pressing enter event doesn t fire

1262265
textbox	button
there isn t an event as such .net insert some html that will associate the textbox with the button .when enter is pressed it is not related to the click s of a button

1262283
python	php
i mostly resort on intuition but this is more or less what i did until now i have a web application in python or php and i am hosting it on a live webserver

1262283
temporary	copy
copy the code from the offline server to a temporary directory on the live webserver then swap the old codebase with the new one eg

1262289
administration	account
you need to either be running as the same user account as the web ser or have administration privlege.

1262304
upgrade	staging
you do your local changes then svn-checkout to the staging server and run your upgrade scripting there as well

1262304
versioning	upgrade
if you have made changes then restore to a backup you just run your upgrade scripting and it goes through and updates the db to the current versioning

1262323
navigation-properties	linq-to-entities
if you want to load the user with linq-to-entities and also look at its role navigation properties you have to explicit include the role entity in your linq query - ef does not load those navigation-properties automatically for you

1262330
python	php
the railsless-deploy seems particularly useful for using capistrano to manage deploying php and python apps

1262343
networkstream	sslstream
wrap your socket in a networkstream to use it with an sslstream

1262351
slimdx	xna
if you don t want to be stuck at directx 9.0c support i suggest you take a look at slimdx which is a similar concept to xna but maps to both directx 9 and 10

1262378
derived-class	base-class
still not pretty but might appeal to you a little more than putting derived-class named in the base-class

1262384
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
it is written in c to make it easily cross platform but you can code c++ or use the binding for python java or ruby if you are looking for something different

1262388
attributes	properties
now .when you know which option elements is selected you can find out if this elements has the selected selected attributes as in the source code it doesn t change - this is not the same as .selected properties of a dom nodes which is true for the currently selected option elements and changes .when the selection is changed

1262396
json	xml
json is similar to other data formats like xml - if you need to transmit more data you just send more data

1262396
any	set
any limitation would be set by the server parsing the request

1262404
configuration	environment
i have some application behavior that is different depending on the hardware configuration or if a particular environment variables is set for testing purposes

1262413
json	xml
i actually proposed this at the opening session of the xml 2007 conference for json and xml

1262413
json	xml
of course each has its peculiarities and you need to decide how you want to handle things like null value which xml doesn t have and namespaces which json doesn t have

1262413
json	xml
you can find the definitions for the start of an xml file here and of a json file here

1262453
directory	folder
checked the documentation on the resource_autoloader its purpose is to load resources that reside in the model directory or elsewhere - i.e outside the libs folder

1262463
instances	private
until now i believed that something like this creates a private instances variables

1262469
subclassing	nsobject
however unless you subclassing something from cocoa other than nsobject you can be fairly confident that you won t run into problems

1262472
.net	wcf
as for alternatives i don t see anything that would run on .net besides web-services but because wcf gives you all this and much more i would rather consider it as an older way than real an alternative

1262484
getter	setter
this class is just getter and setter plus an empty methods

1262523
cross-compiling	toolchain
i ve had good luck using buildingroot to building toolchain and libs for cross-compiling linux

1262526
scalar	lvalue
.when you put the scalar variables named inside parentheses perl treats that whole lvalue as a list .so it assign the first value in the list to that variables

1262550
for-loop	arrays
now note al.so that a for-loop alias each elements of an arrays .so

1262599
umask	chmod
you could also have fun with umask but i ve always prefered calling chmod .when it s necessary and only .when it s necessary i prefer not giving too much permissions -- more secure this way -- and umask may have some problems with some servers if i remember correctly

1262779
getter	setter
just one thing you want to watch for limit its use only to variable-structure object or use it only for syntactical shortcuts to getter and setter

1262779
getter	setter
it makes sense to keep getter and setter in your class to seperate business-logic in multiple methods but there is nothing wrong in using it as a shortcut

1262779
getter	setter
that way you can continue using your getter and setter to validation and set your data and still use the syntactic shortcuts as such

1263055
input-field	textarea
there are also some other little details that matter for the users - sometimes what you d thought would be the main input-field for them in reality is not - and they have an empty textarea eating up half of the screens while they have to enter the really important data into a small textfield somewhere in the corner

if you are just using it to set it you shouldn t run into any problems

1263535
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
then with php j.son_decode it will fail if it find ã .so for firefox opera safari and google-chrome i ve to call utf8_encode before j.son_decode

1263539
strong-typing	types
i myself have had to explain the variables keyword from time to time and how it is really just a placeholder for a types and that it still insures strong-typing

1263613
versioning	upgrade
also there may be a new better versioning of the membership-provider one day that you won t be able to upgrade because you have customized the membership schema

1263613

there are no tcl examples in python official distribution

1263728
wxpython	pyqt	pyinstaller	pyqt	pyinstaller	wxpython
pyqt if you can stand the gpl license or pay for the commercial one and wxpython are imho currently superior offerings for cross-platform guser-interface .apps though you ll have to work to bundle them with py2exe or pyinstaller if you want to distribute a stand-alone .app and other package are excellent if you don t care about cross-platform distribution or have specialized needs pyuser-interface -- while now a general-purpose user-interface toolkit -- for simple user-interfaces for games if you re using pygame or pyopengl anyway

now .when i click it as the first toggle it just show instantly without the animation .when i click the the second toggle it nicely slider up

1263800
beautifulsoup	mechanize
i was wondering if there was anything similar like mechanize or beautifulsoup for php

1263818

1264165
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
if you work in a systemd that cannot crash then you will may use c or c++ and just don t use new or malloc but use arrays .so that you won t have any memory-leaks which can be a likely rea.son a long running process may run out-of-memory and crash

1264168
32-bit	64bit

on 64bit microsoft compiler int has sizeof 4 bytes it means that int is 32-bit variables

1264346
selection	cell
nb you ll need to test if the current selection is one of your colour cell before firing .interior.colorindex but i ll leave that to you

1264358
dictionary	arrays
you could use an arrays dictionary like .so

1264385
32-bit	64bit
since that code is and ing the 64bit variables j with the 32-bit result-of a bit-shift the result will be expanded to 64bit by the compiler

1264385
32-bit	64bit
this is safe in 32-bit but you should actually look at the types of j to decide on the operators being 32 or 64bit

1264414
void	main
i ve come up with 2 .approaches although only the first .approach will actually work both required your static void main methods for your .app to initializer the logging systemd

on the server the necessary validation is done and a response send back in xml json directly the messages encode as html

1264486
web-config	app-config
the getter is looking for the value in web-config or app-config with the key waitmessage and then returning a default-value

1264505
default-value	default
i ve tried to specify that the default should be view by adding the default-value attributes but it hasn t had the affect that i intended

1264513
any	set
is there any way to exit the program immediately at the time of vb code working with database like creating recording set creating temporary tables

1264544
attributes	properties
how about setting the properties value explicit rather than using the default-value attributes

1264551
deployment	install
deployment of applications is a very tough part of software development especially in .net because how can we know for example whether the potential user already has the .net install on their systemd or not

windows-xp	windows
by the way that location is in windows-xp it may be different in other versioning of windows

1264552
factors	digits
internally it is an 8-byte int which is scale by a factors of 10 000 giving you 4 digits after the decimal separator

1264572
freebsd	gentoo
maybe the answer will be disappointing but the relatively high numbers of source downloading could mean that the application is packaged in a port-based distribution like gentoo freebsd or macports where every package is downloading and compiled on a local machine during installation

implements	extends
i personally prefer to implements runnable because i don t change the behavior of thread that would be extends it but only use the thread-functionality

1264639
dependency-injection	inject
things like dependency-injection come in handy too because you may want to inject mock classes for your tests

1264643
value	field
for example you may want to updates one field conditional on the value of another - in this case as long as you synchronized explicit during the field access all will be ok

1264651
arrays	loops
my instinct tells me to loops through this- data in before-save and unset whatever key with and arrays value with value of 0 or null for key quantity is there a better way

1264673
arrays	loops
i think you re right i would probably loops through the arrays and checked the value of quantity

1264675
internationalization	localization
i ve already read about internationalization and localization in wikipedia

1264686
linked-list	hashmap
if your hashcode methods returns a constants value all your key will hash to the same bucket in the hashmap effectively reducing your hashmap to be a linked-list with access time o n instead of approximating o 1

1264733
show	next
there should be button like next and previous click on next button will traversal to next html file whereas previous button will show the previous html file

1264734
ado	jet
but i have my doubts .when it comes to jet ado

1264734
ado	jet
jet and or ado use read caching and lazy-evaluation writes which can lead to unsynchronized connections

1264734
ado	jet
should i go with the best practice of closing each connection and re-sync every new connection or should i just go with a global connection object because of the jet ado quirks

1264737
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you need to read each byte from your inputstream and write it to a bytearrayoutputstream

1264745
constructor	object
will too run your code in mythread as the thread constructor only needs an object implements the runnable interface and the run methods

1264747
attributes	properties
ixmldomelements - has enumerator properties attributes - .so you can iterate all attr of elements

1264749

stderr	stdout
exception-handling output is going to stderr but your printing statement is going to stdout

1264837
base-class	inherited
if you for .some rea.son are restrict to use the event model and want to have control over the assignment of event handler one approach might be to inherited the original class creating an event in that class with the same named and signature as in the base-class using the new keyword .so that the original event is hidden and keep tracking of how event handler are attached and detached

1264838
subset	unique
you should add a column user_sorting and ensure that user_sorting value are unique versus for subset accordingly

1264855
contains	any
one additional issue is that other_item_type and other_item_id can also be empty - and the rest of the columns in that row need to be returned in the selected - but in the empty case none of the additional columns across the other tables should contains any value

a lot of asp.net-mvc is the same as webforms - they both sit on asp.net as guyincognito has already said most of it is the same

1264945
asp.net-mvc	webforms
all of this is best-practice in webforms anyway it s just easier to attempt this types of hack in asp.net-mvc now

1264948
multicast	packets	ethernet	packets
if my understanding of link-scope multicast is correct the packets only has to go out the local ethernet ports en0 in this case which is up and working on that machine

1264951
linked-list	nodes
the linked-list example mentioned earlier in comments is incorrectly written though it skips odd nodes and because of that only iterates the half amount of the same data

1265043
any	set
note that .when the cpu is active it s obviously not going to go into any kind of sleep-mode and the kernel will set up an interrupt for scheduling purposes

1265054
firefox	opera
devexpress usually cares about consistency between user environment â for example their web-controls look the same in ie firefox and opera

1265164
32-bit	64bit
why i wanna do it in custom action i called some methods of managed dll 64bit and wrote some registries to software myapp the matter is setup.exe 32-bit loads the dll which eventually writes to software wow6432node myapp

1265168
directory	folder
that directory was added to the bundle as is via folder references feature

1265179
asp.net-mvc	webforms
using ajax in asp.net-mvc is no different from using it in webforms

i prefer the asp.net-mvc approach over webforms because it s cleaner and easier to maintain later this is just my viewpoint

1265192
malloc	free
it feels like using malloc without free

1265196
typedef	struct
there s no need to typedef a struct in c++ as unlike to c in c++ struct namedd live in the same named spaces as other namedd

1265203
google-chrome	firefox
however i could work it out with google-chrome and firefox

1265204

hide	show
this discussion is going to be alive as long as the ide you work with is not flexible enough to show or hide the exact information you need

1265276
hide	show
in the past we used the css attributes display to show and hide dom elements

1265284
order	add
as stated previously you can t technically add stuff in the middle of a table and it s probably just luck how they are sorted in your output if you re not using a order by clause

1265308
handler	service
the service handler callback

1265320
triggers	insert
triggers has only tree options on insert updates delete this means triggers will ge fired on every updates cmd no mater what column is updatess

jdom	xom
i ve checked the source code for jdom and xom and they all printing attributes on the same line and provide no specific hooks for overrides that

1265353
protected	public	jdom	xom
both xom and jdom do have specific classes for serializing xml xmloutputter and serialization respectively and both classes have protected or public methods for handling the serialization of attributess .so you could if you wanted to subclassing those classes and overrides the appropriate methods to control your attributes formatting as you want it

1265354
logout	login
connect login query logout disconnect

1265354
logout	login
i want to be able to send several events cmd to this machine like connect login query producta query productb logout login query productc logout disconnect at once and have it process them

1265389
malloc	free
with the heap i could try and overload every malloc free and new delete across all project and tracking it that way but that is quite daunting with an application this size

1265425
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	installation	upgrade
i ve made an extjs frontend for a company dashboard and using a django backend managing the url dispatching the orm and the data retrieval communication with the frontend with json web-services and users love it because it s almost as interactive as a local application use something modern like firefox 3.5 google-chrome safari 4 or explorer 8 for better javascript performance but easy to manage for programmers and administration no installation no local backup no upgrade problems etc.

1265427
progress-bar	progress
the progress-bar widget will be the only indication that execution is happening inside it but problem is as you run the code the progress-bar freezes because it has to finish first the execution of the seperate exe and after it s done activity on the progress can be updates

the mojo is a copy of the properties plugins s readpropertiesmojo with an additional filepath properties to allow you to defined the relative-path to the external properties-file in the classpath it makes the files properties optional and adds the readpropertiesfiles and getlocation methods to locate the files and merge any filepath into the files arrays before continuing

1265466
firefox	opera
dragonfly in opera firebug in firefox ietester has it s own thing but i never use it

1265499
rollback	commit
.when you start working with the database the drivers issues a begin and after any commit or rollback another begin is issued

1265511
jax-ws	cxf
spring-ws is just a lighting spring-friendly wrapper around an underlying soap implementation and should work on top of sun jax-ws or cxf although i d recommend using sun s implementation

contains	set
i exported that as a jar file called logging.jar to another project s root the other project also set up as an aspectj project contains the main class

1265523
one-to-many	entity
i have an entity grouping and another entity as members.one particular grouping may have a numbers of members but a particular member belongs to one particular grouping only.in short i have a one-to-many relationship between grouping and member.how should i go about adding the relationship in my datamodel class

1265536
temporary	copy
you ve to make temporary copy of column drop the original one make new one with proper settings copy content of temporary column to the new column drop temporary one - pretty straightforward isn t it

1265537
entity-relationship-model	datamodel
for your datamodel entity-relationship-model you will want a foreign key in the member table points to the grouping table

1265569
pointers	stack
i understand that a reference-types object consists of a pointers on stack which points to a location on the heap which contains a sync block index a types handle and the object s field

the building tool helps setup the test environment

1265630
versioning	upgrade
upgrade updates - updates on a newer versioning should be done automatically for example schema and data upgrade

1265640
web-applications	webserver
for example early cgi-based web-applications would have the webserver create a separate process to handle each request

1265640
web-applications	scalability
web-applications that use threads to handle individual request such as those based on java servlets are much more scalability - even back then servlet apps running on comparatively slow jvms were easily outperforming traditional cgi apps written in c because the process creation overhead outweighted the speed advantages of c

1265643
margins	padding
the properties margins and padding are the correct approach

1265651

1265699
callback	methods
in the simplest terms a callback is a code that you pass into another methods

1265699
callback	methods
.when the methods on class b has done its stuff it can callback into class a

1265699
callback	methods
nowadays you don t actually need to put the callback code in its own methods you ve got anonymous-methodss and lambda you can use

1265700

1265738
sms-gateway	kannel
using an sms-gateway such as nordic messagingâ s emg probably overkill though or kannel seems to be down currently

1265746
arrays	loops
as ipx ares says declare your arrays outside loops

1265761
network-interface	ethernet
in the event handler you can checked whether the network-interface involved is an ethernet ports

1265808
version-control	cvs
this is in part dependent on the ability of version-control systemd to cope with virtual file systemdâ design elements in notes databases all reside as discrete components within an nsf file notes database rather than simple flat files on disk which obviously work well with subversion cvs et al

1265809
arrays	loops
especially if your arrays is long you may be better off writing a loops or else using list moreutils as mentioned above

1265820
push	pull
that way instead of getting clearcase to pull the code you can get hudson to push the code onto the building-server and building it all remotely using the master slave technique

1265829
value	field
however it is possible - in this case - to exploit the fact that the order is a positive int field and annotations each category with the min value of the order field of the relation_target field and use this new annotations field for order

1265839
digital-signature	signing
if you must keep that data in a xml textfile you could consider digitally signing it by your application every time it is modified and checked the digital-signature .when you read the file

1265848

zeroing out one of an unknown numbers of pointsers copies might help a bit but usually this is a pointsers that is either about to go out of scoping or set to points to a new object in any case

1265880
queue	fifo
lists and dictionary are containers that don t support a queue model that is they re neither lifo nor fifo

1265884
queue	fifo
dictionary and lists aren t queue and also fifo and lifo doesn t apply to c# lists and dictionary

1265892
c-strings	c++
if you are using c++ you should use std string rather than plain old c-strings

1265892
strncpy	strcpy
i am not a proponent of thinking of strncpy as a safer replacement for strcpy because it really isn t

1265921
queue	fifo
in c# if you want a lifo stack use system.collections.generic.stack and if you want a fifo queue use system.collections.generic.queue

1265926
firefox	opera
this line of code work prefectally to get the hosts string in both firefox and opera

1265926
firefox	opera
i was wondering if anyone had the same problem and managed to solve it or if someone has any idea why i always get null in ie but not .when using firefox and opera

1265926
javascript	dom
what i am doing in my case is write the object and embed tags into a div created using javascript and this div is append to the end of the body using the dom methods

any	set
each user would have a set of personal object plus any shared-object that they need

1266002
compile-time	dead-code
the java approach of eliminating dead-code paths at compile-time is just not as obvious .when reading the code

1266003
udp	tcp
udp was only used instead of tcp as it was simpler to configure on an embedded systemd

1266028
pointers	stack
the only way to automatically chaining dispose call to members is through stack semantics if the members are normals managed pointers just like c# you ll have to chaining the call manually

1266029
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i getting this weird issue in safari google-chrome works in firefox and ie

1266031
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m struggling to figure out the correct way to do something in asp.net-mvc which wouldn t be difficult in webforms and i m hoping someone will be able to points me in the right directions

1266039
contains	set
if you have your heart set on jquery you can either go the webmethods route which keeps all of the functionality within a single page or even create new .aspx pages which jquery will call to perform certain actions if you have a sidebar contains contact this can be move to a new ajax contact.aspx page and you can then edit it via jquery call

1266067
perl	php
however what you could do is learn ajax - if you don t know it yet - and create a scripting php asp perl ssi etc. that count the files in the directory and printing the numbers - i recommend perl -

1266100
filtering	sorting
this makes sorting filtering these items a pain in the ass behind

it turns out that the problem was down to using solution folder and not having all the project on the same directory level

1266132
callback	methods
2 as a callback to one of jquery s ajax methods

1266139
put	get
i already put the log4jconfiglocation in web.xml but i still get the following warning

1266148
build-process	nant
however these browser object should all be created in-process meaning they will be cleaned up .when the codeigniter build-process completes especodeigniterally if the codeigniter build-process spawn a separate process such as nant to actually run the unit-tests

1266151
required	checked
requiredment 2 is a more local constraint that doesn t required checked the entire graphing

1266151
required	checked
insert edges within a cluster then only required checked within the cluster sub-dag

1266155
strncpy	strcpy
you must either use strcpy or strncpy

1266171
response	timeout
even if the service were sending back a long response such that the outgoing transmission windows closed and timeout waiting to be able to send bytes all of this would be occurring after the web methods had returned back to asp.net

1266183
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
it must work on windows while being able to use it with solaris freebsd linux macosx would of course be nice

1266193
double	int
i ve seen a case someone has been using strings in-place of native datatypes such as int or double for every class member that gave an out-of-memory .when storing a relatively small amount of data object in memory

1266205
assign	add
if you need to know is exist there before assign isset is useful use unset but these simply add a step to unset

1266207
contains	any
given that fact i would expect that any medium or large scale application would contains at least a few patterns or variations on patterns describe by the gang of four

1266226
contains	elements
plugins management contains plugins elements in much the same way except that rather than configuring plugins information for this particular project building it is intended to configure project buildinging that inherited from this one

1266232
lgpl	gpl
and because the original author of the libs chose gpl instead of lgpl it can be assumed that they wanted the apps using their libs also be under gpl

1266238
triggers	insert
you call dbms_alert.raise with a labels of your choosing .when you want clients to be notified of a change for exammple in the insert updates delete triggers for a table which you need caching dependency

1266238
rollback	commit
in other words if transactional a raises alert foo transactional b will block .when it raises foo until a rollback or commit .so it s generally not a good idea to use alert in transactionalal that could take a long time unless blocking other users is part of the design

1266254
any	set
if .so fetch that instead of the actual data and then set up a url which is able to serve any thumbnail based on the id by fetching it from the database and just serving it with an appropriate content-type

1266257
push	pull
the syncing part can be a simple push pull styles http-request it s the logistics of how to properly keep them in sync that raises concerns

1266257
json	xml
updates the server with the changes the iphone sent and updates the iphone with any changes that request send back using json or xml

1266264
order	add
the order is changed if you first remove a key and then add it again

1266266
textbox	button
i have a textbox that contains a string that must be binded only .when the user press the button

1266266
textbox	button
if i set the mode to oneway with propertieschanged i have nothing raised by the properties binded .when i press key in the textbox and once i click the button i have a nullreferenceexception in the be object

1266278
put	get
.so i need to get the info from line 1 1 e put 1 into a variables and then e into another

1266310
json	xml
for example iphones would communication with this service using json xml soap whatever and you only have to maintain one database

1266330
directory	folder
i am trying to copy whole directory tree from server s shared folder to my local machine i found best way to copy the entire contents of a directory in c# .post and decide to use that but as i guess directoryinfo doesn t support network-shares how can i change this code to work with network-shares as a source

1266341
keyboard	mouse
keep in mind that for this solution to work the machine should receive input from the user keyboard mouse

1266342
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
any source code viewers with syntax-highlighting and code-folding

1266375
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
all process is done by the browser and it should work in ie6+ firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1266436
hide	show
in viewmode i need to hide the datepicker icons and only show the date

1266446
repository	entity
then each entity has a static repository properties

1266450
static-classes	static-class
since you cannot initializer a static-class static-classes cannot implements interfaces

1266452
overlay	widget
the best solution besides using a sdl overlay was to updates directly the image buffering of the widget then ask for a redraw

1266453
triggers	insert
anyway as far as creating a report table would it be better to just add a triggers onto the aspnet_membership table and .when a new recording is insert we insert-into our report table or is having two sprocs run upon initial registration fine too

1266464
contains	elements
then i would still have the elements table contains the value in one column and a flag less than as a separate column

1266465
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
it works on windows-xp and on windows-vista .so i guess the problem is windows 7

1266484
gethashcode	equals
it s way too easy to fall into a trap where you overrides equals and gethashcode on an object and break code where the types was formerly used as a key in a dictionary

1266499
gethashcode	equals
you can overrides gethashcode and should do .so if you overrides equalss .so that object which are equals al.so return the same hashcode

1266512
gethashcode	equals
the default implementation of gethashcode equals basically deals with identity

1266514
dialog	pop-up
everything works well but .when facebook is supposed to show a pop-up dialog for example fb.connect.showfeeddialog or fb.connect.streampublish the pop-up show inside the iframe

1266514
logout	login
note the facebook login and logout popup do show well

1266516
authentication	login
.when submit button has been click authentication will be handled by code-behind of custom login form panels

1266528
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i mean you can do it but a webforms control doesn t follow the asp.net-mvc paradigms -- that is the control contains both view and controllers logic

1266531
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the calendar is supposed to have a few events listed - it works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari - but not in ie...what is the issue

1266539
callback	methods
the logic can be more complex to code then because you have to set up callback methods to continue the process after each database call has finished

1266553
webforms	asp.net
and asp.net webforms viewstate.

1266570
python	c++
i have fairly large c++ libs with several sub-libraries that support it and i need to turn the whole thing into a python extension

1266598
perl	php	perl	c++
not just with perl but with c and all the other curlies-and-semicolons languages going back to c and newer c-influenced ones like c++ c# objective-c javascript java php etc

1266607
sftp	ssh
i have been told that i need to do the same thing only now it is a directory on a remote machine with ssh sftp access

1266607
sftp	ssh
the real question here is are there ways of doing opendir readdir or something similar through ssh sftp

1266609
retaincount	dealloc
this constants string class may overrides n.sobject s methods like retain release and dealloc .so that they do nothing and al.so overrides retaincount .so that it always returns the same numbers uint_max or .so

1266609
dictionary	arrays
it must have the overall general behavior of a cocoa object .when using cocoa .so that it can be added to arrays used as key to a dictionary etc except in regards to its memory-management since it was allocated differently

1266621
python	c++
extends python with c++

1266621
distutils	scons
in terms of how to drive the building you may want to look at a more advanced built tool that distutils if you want to stick with python i would highly recommend waf as a framework others will tell you scons is the way to go but believe me it s slow as hell i ve been there and back already

1266630
contains	set
second if you have hash tags that contains characters beyond a-z then just add them in between the second set of brackets

1266641
.when	ready
you can then merge revision from development to test .when they are ready to be tested

1266652
object-reference	instances
it throw an object-reference not set to an instances of an object. exception-handling at system.web.security.membership.getcurrentusername at system.web.security.membership.getuser

1266655
put	get
to get to the root put a in front of the file named

1266663
web-services	webserver
for a small scale web .app i think that using web-services is often quite a good idea you can use it to easily decouple the webserver from the data tier

1266663
synchronous	.when
.when you must use http as the transport and xmlserializer of your data and you need lots of different bits of data synchronous and often

1266677
contains	elements
the arrays passed contains one filtering per elements

1266683
rollback	commit
begin commit rollback transactional outside each manager dao class

1266683
rollback	commit
for the servlet in the tutorial this can be done by making a filtering that starts the transactional invokes the rest of the filteringchain and then commit rollback the transactional

1266695
default	reset
you can open visual-studio with a special reset settings file which overrides the default settings

1266697
firefox	opera
ie firefox opera correct content into div excellent

1266697
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome correct content but the entire page is refreshed with the results

1266710
data-annotations	xval
i would suggest using a validation framework such as xval for asp.net-mvc 1 or the built-in support for data-annotations for asp.net-mvc 2

1266711
selected	button
sorry for this question but is it possible to make radio button instead of selected list from this piece of code

1266721
constructor	object
.when an instances methods returns a value that was initializer with a convenience constructor do i need to retain that object and then autorelease in the return .so that .when the convenience constructor s autorelease occurs it doesn t remove the object

1266729
value	field
further more hashcode will never change as value of internal field properties will change

1266773
constructor	object
in general .when creating object using objective-c if you are calling a convenience constructor not calling alloc and init the return-value is always autoreleased .so stringwithstring returns an autoreleased object the you can just return

1266784
any	set
yes additional protocols can be plugged-in but what is the standards baseline set of protocols supported in the class framework assuming i haven t registered any others

1266790
difference	datediff
datediff will get the difference between two dates

1266791
void	main
both main1 and main2 have public static void main entry points

1266807
children	nodes
if you are lucky you can just checked the numbers of children on your nodes and decide if you want to warp the single elements in an arraycollection or if you can use the automatic coercion to work for multiple elementss

1266840
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
there are package modules libs available for python 1 perl php .net etc that will let you read an excel file cell by cell

1266851
pixels	line
snapstodevicepixels is just a properties controlling how a control is display and that edges and straight line preferrably lie on complete pixels than in between

1266851
double	int
as a general rules of thumb everything in wpf is measured in double value .so either live with it you checked would likely be the same anyway or continue rounding to int if you like .so -

1266854
versioning	upgrade
that meant everyone had to upgrade .when a new versioning came out and helped keep problems from arising if out of date versioninging were used

1266855
enterprise	legacy
i have a maintenance application that has to turn enterprise data from various databases tables into flat files each in a specific format for consumption by a legacy application

1266860
required	checked
the second isn t a valid link it required javascript inorder to work something the link checker probably isn t checked it is doing essentially static analysis i guess

1266863
sql-server	mysql
mysql .net provider exposes a methods to escape string value is there any such function in sql-server .net provider

1266880
any	set
i m not sure if it makes a difference but .when i ran configure.exe i didn t set any command-line parameters

1266897
.when	ready
and .when this value changes i want to use it within another function down below outside of the ready function say

1266902
contains	elements
my ideal though is to provide a custom implementation that lets me control how databinding walks the collections and can inspect the concrete types of each elements to determine if it contains a collections or if it s a terminus in the tree

1266910
javascript	dom
you are probably execution the javascript before the dom nodes are available

1266921
ready	live
assuming i only need to live with the environment for about 3 months would it be reasonable to start this project in vs 2010 beta 1 or is it not ready for daily development

1266929
selected	button	click	mouse
.when i try to move my mouse inside the div to click the button or selected the dropdownlistfor the div move away.this happens after i added

1266930
.when	ready
it s just an ordinary javascript function that happens to come with jquery and that jquery happens to call .when the document is ready

1266931
rmdir	mkdir
full_audit success mkdir rename unlink rmdir write open close

1266941
constructor	object
the inner constructor will construct a temporary local object which gets deleted once the outer constructor returns

1266950
click	mouse
i really like using my mouse for click tabs in normals mode scrolling in normals mode etc

1266950

the problem with this is that .when i try to selected using the mouse vim intercepts the mouse click and doesn t allow me to selected at all

1266977
maven-bundle-plugin	apache-felix
i m using the maven-bundle-plugin from apache-felix

1266995
latex	tex
imho organizing your programs from simple scripting to documented package is for programming in r like switching from words to tex latex for writing

1266996
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
you cannot pass a pointers that was not obtained from a malloc calloc or realloc to free except null

1266998
parsing	comma
if you are not using a new enough versioning of visual-studio and or sql-server to have access to table value parameters you can instead pass in one comma separated list as string parameter and then parsing the the parameter into a table

1267010
where-clause	sql
additionally any transformation of columns defined in the where-clause are not sargable and force sql to perform table or index scans

1267021
linechart	datapoint
i have a flex3 linechart component using an circleitemrenderer and the datapoint are being cut off because they are too close to the edges

1267023
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
you cannot pass a pointers you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free

1267027
llvm	gcc
look at the comments on the top of source files in gcc or llvm

1267029
logging	trace
i d try with asp.net trace for quick logging

1267032
interface-builder	iboutlet
the views are all properties of the view controllers linked via the interface-builder iboutlet

1267033
firefox	safari
it all works on ie and safari but not on firefox 3.5 3.0 works perfectly though

1267033
hide	show
the web-app tiparlo which i was working on before had a similar problem in fact any manipulation done on an applet via jquery is faulty but solved that problem by wrapping a div around and controlling hide and show the div instead of the applet

1267040
malloc	free
adding to the more formal answers i d compare the mechanics of this to one taking a book in the libs malloc then tearing off a few dozen pages together with the cover advance the pointers and then attempting to return it free

1267040
malloc	free
you might find a librarian malloc free libs implementation that takes such a book back but in a lot of case i d expect you would pay a fine for negligent handling

1267040
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the spaces has been

1267040
realloc	free
deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

1267040
malloc	free
in my experience a double free or the free of the pointers that was not returned via malloc will result in a memory-corruption and or crash depending on your malloc implementation

1267071
authentication	login
my goal is that the users won t have to login - that fact that they are logged into our network and the fact that the site is not on an external ip is enough authentication

1267072
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave change submit

1267084
python	c++	python	java
most of the good work is being done in java c++ or python these days

1267092
radio-button	selected
the togglebuttonbar is a lot easier to use than a radio-button and it s functionally the same component set the selectedindex -- only one can be selected at a time

1267100
key-value	key
.so i need to generator a key that starts from the highest primary key-value already in the column

1267108
selection	cell
.when you tap on a cell i clear the selection like .so

1267123
void	main
static void main string arguments

1267151
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can still add connection strings to your web-config in a block and access them as you would have done in a webforms project after all asp.net-mvc is based on webforms

1267163
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
updates 2 updatess the code to work with firefox 3.5 opera 9 safari 4 ie6-8 and probably more and earlier versioning but that is not tested

1267181
udp	tcp
to find out what the dns named of a machine is you first need its ip-address which you have if you received a request from the machine over tcp or udp since that will include the requester s ip-address

1267181
reverse-dns	dns
you can then perform a reverse-dns lookup to determine the dns named

1267185
internet-explorer	google-chrome

works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera

1267230
selected	checkbox
since i wanted checkbox i used arrays types selected multiple checkbox to convert it into checkbox

1267241
declarative	imperative
there is clear advantage from maintenance points of view to have most of the code in declarative format html+css and as little as possible in imperative javascript

1267266
contains	elements
as i understand it configuration- 0 whilst being an elements of an arrays is an elements contains a hash that i believe i should be able to invoke the key function against

1267269
configuration	logging
if you do logging with log4net or even with diagnostics.trace redirecting logs output is just a matter of configuration but not redesign of the whole systemd

1267273
administration	account
even though the user account is the same with the elevated versioning having a token with membership in the administration grouping and addition privileges the tokens are created independently and thus have different luid s and appear to the kernel to be from different user login

1267275
hide	show
i have a processing... div overlay that i show with .show prior to making ajax call and hide on completion

1267275
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m running into is that if i want to show the div and then make several ajax call prior to hiding the div again it seems to queue the events in internet-explorer 7 and google-chrome 2.0.172.39 but i get the expected result in firefox 3.0.13

1267305
display	height
after about 20 digits it gets cut off and i d like to wrap the text or increase the height of the field .so that any amount of characters can be display

1267327

1267332
web-config	app-config
for app-config or web-config respectively

1267334
click	mouse
i can move the mouse around and that remains responsive but nothing i click on does anything

in css means direct child of only nodes that are direct children are selected

1267430
javadoc	doxygen
only source files building scripting and documentation that is not automatically generator - the output of tools such as javadoc and doxygen should be checked into a repository

1267443
versioning	upgrade
.when you upgrade to versioning 2.0 you deploy an additional class called toolagentimplmenetation2_0 and updates the mytoolagent class to load and use it

1267443
versioning	upgrade
you do waste some memory here but you achieve the versioning upgrade

1267453
configuration	logging
i m using log4net logging in my dll class-library - i m wondering where people would recommend i put the log4net-configurationuration - in the app-configuration or in a separate .log4net configuration file

1267464
packaging	building
i m building a .net dll class-library which depends on other libs such as log4net.dll - where should i put these dlls .when packaging up my dll

1267481

1267534
insert-into	declare
i split out the inner sql statement and used the declare foo table syntax to create a temporary table which i filled with the insert-into

1267537
instances	private
it s created even if innerclass isn t static but it isn t created if innerclass isn t private or no instances of innerclass is ever created

1267547
pointers	stack
my current thought is placing a pointers to the thread information structure at an aligned address such as for a 1mb stack

1267547
linked-list	arrays	data-structures	linked-list
the immediate problem i see is it would required special handling if i ever wanted stack to exceed 1mb .so i came up with another option store all thread data-structures in a linked-list or arrays and include the start end stack range for the thread as part of the structure

1267548
asterisk	ivr
after migrating my client s ivr s over from sipx to asterisk utilizing phpagi i must say that i haven t encountered any other architecture that anywhere near as simple and capable

1267548
asterisk	ivr
but i must say using phpagi for the ivr and the asterisk cli for debugging has worked perfectly and allowed me to develop ivr s far faster than any other company out there

1267562
authentication	login
use execute as owner on the triggers create a certificate sign the triggers drop the private-key .so that noone else can use it to ever sign anything again export the certificate public key only import the certificate in master create a login derived from the certificate grant authentication to this login inorder to extends the database execute as imper.sonation then grant view server state to this login

1267567
dependency-injection	service-locator
does the service-locator libs work in real life or are you skill forced to use lots of different dependency-injection frameworks in the same project

1267568
selected	textbox
.so what i need to develop is javascript that .when any of the drop downs in any of the custom-controls have a selected drop down index changed event to find all the value in all the boxes of all the controls of types customcontrol on the page and simply put that text in the textbox

1267580
version-control	cvs

arrays	map
i m display some icons annotations on a map in my .app by loading them into an nsmutablearrays and then adding the arrays

1267602
oracle	mysql
for anything over that. sure perhaps microsoft oracle ibm might keep the length definition for historical reasons but what about dbms like mysql which has multiple storage backends- why does every one implements definable character column lengths

1267607
jquery	.post
see this jquery ajax .post methods

1267620
spring	grails
grails is completely integrated with spring .so this makes for a good option for exploiting spring aop features

1267620
spring	grails
maybe there is a purely groovy way of doing aop but i d go with grails and spring

1267630
decimal-point	zero
decimal will handle 0 through + -79 228 162 514 264 337 593 543 950 335 with no decimal-point scale of zero

1267638
gradient	clipping
what the code does is it flips the drawing context vertically the iphone inverts the normals quartz coordinate systemd on for the y axis sets the text drawing mode to intersect the draw text with the clipping path clips the area to draw to the text and then draw a gradient

1267643
endpoint	uri
you need to expose an endpoint using the webhttpbinding and have your contract correctly specify the right uri templates in the webget attributes

vbscript	vb6
to handle this problem i wrote a vb6 vbscript encryption routine which i converted to .net

1267659
salt	md5
both of which were considerably enhanced with multiple features such as the md5 is a salt versioning and the rc4 contains a crc checked and an option for double encrypting using multiple passkeys

1267659
put	get
if you get them from the registry and try to put them on another systemd they re no good.

1267663
security	owasp
the owasp top ten is a good start for developing a security checklist

not only increment or decrement but

1267750
export	report
export this report as a text file right-click in report export... save-as types text files

1267769
cucumber	webrat
i have a cucumber feature with two scenarios that each rely on webrat to resolve the step .when i go to the list of articles the article model is not an activerecord model and shouldn t rely on sql for access

1267801
subclassing	base-class
if you opt to subclassing you might have access to base-class methods if they exist which perform different aspects of the rendering .so you don t have to implements the entire rendering logic yourself

1267802
updating	updates
i ve done this because updating the counter_cache doesn t updates the updatesd_at time of the messages and i d like it to for the cache_key

1267804
debugging	trace
edit debugging trace of the execute call

1267817
any	set
i set up a styles for all my links but the problem is that any anchor that has an image obviously will have the same styles

1267824
contains	elements
no there is no css selector which will capture elementss which contains only an elements

1267829
sunos	unix
.when i run it in windows perl correctly identifies it as 5 arguments whereas .when i ran it on the sunos unix machine it identified 8 splitting the arg with spaces into separate arguments

1267830
credentials	ntlm
however .when i set iis to use windows-authentication on sv-res i get back a 401 error .when using ntlm in the credentials caching object

1267852
webrick	thin
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

1267864
sitecore	umbraco
i m just getting up to speed on umbraco after using sitecore and sitefinity on a few project

1267876
shell	bash
maybe the shell on the sun isn t bash or maybe there is something else going on

1267878
contains	elements
it s faster .when the last few elements do not contains an orbited

1267902
double	int
is there a common interface for all numbers types int double float... that i m missing

1267914
packaging	building
if you are just trying to automate buildinging packaging of your apps you should look into msbuilding -- it is microsoft s building engine that lets you scripting automation of most of the functions of visual-studio

1267947
any	set
you can set a nonsense default-value and .when you have it log the prior page and any other information that might be useful to help you find how users are getting to that page without going to the form before it

1267959
callback	methods
these parsing xml document an entity at a time and call your callback methods

1267965
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit systemd it s obvious but even on 64bit systemd both variables will probably be stored in a 64bit register and pushed on stack as a 64bit value

1267967
folder	dir
my next goal is to make this recurse subdirectories but this seems a bit more challenging changing it to dir -recurse makes it quit after the parent folder for some reason

1267974
selected	textbox
selected project | properties selected the make tab enter the command-line params in the command-line arguments textbox

1267987
build-process	nant
however this has recently become a need and we would like to run a few of these cmdlets from our nant based build-process

1268008
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
defined the points and paths in php perl ruby python coldfusion asp.net whatever

1268037
where-clause	sql
oh and bear in mind that if the column is null the recording is less likely to appear in practically any query that selected has a where-clause in sql terms based off of that column unless the selection is for a null column of course

1268044
database-table	mysql
i am using mysql as my database and php as my programming language.i wanted to run a crontab which would run until the current systemd date matches the deadline date column in my database-table called project .once the dates are same an updates query has to run which would change the status field of project table from open to close

1268077
ms-dos	dos
now i want to compile my code to run under an ms-dos environment .so i can put it on my dos formatted floppy disc

1268083

i want the div to stay still .when mouseenter the div region and div should disappear .when i do mouseout from div or the td.any help is appreciated

1268101
cross-compiling	buildroot
my coworker has a fedora x64_86 machine with a gcc 4.3.3 cross-compiling from buildroot

1268104
grooveshark	last.fm
also wondering what is the algorithm last.fm grooveshark pandora using for their recommendation systemd

1268131
controllers	routes
i am not familiar with the variables way of defining routes but you can take from my example the ability to set default controllers modules and actions without the need to explicit defined them in the url

1268157
gentoo	ubuntu
they usually have a quite large set of patches applied to gcc for example on gentoo there are about 20 patches fedora and ubuntu won t be that different

1268179
.when	ready
for development you would work on a copy of the front end changing forms report code etc. and .when ready to deploy the users would just copy it over top of their existing front ends

1268197
configuration	logging
i ve wrestled my way to make the application read the configuration file and whatnot and actually i m having decent results but i was wondering how should i enable the remaining logging levels

1268201
selected	cell
the cell can be click once to selected it as usual

1268201
highlight	cell
the cell value a string can still be edited by single-clicking a second time after a pause or by pressing f2 .when the cell is highlight

1268207
deep-copy	object
the last points made me wonder on how some frameworks manage to handle this do they deep-copy the object

1268217
mousedown	mouseup
i have noticed that there is no mouseup and mousedown triggers .when playing with stylus acting as a mouse on the screens

1268227
safari	opera
the ones that do reload the page are some of the older ones such as safari 2.0.4 and opera 8.5x

1268241
boolean	int
strings boolean and int are currently the only allowed data types

1268245
pixels	line
if your only problem is that you need to draw a line by painting each pixels that you catch in mouse move just connect the dots and you should be set

1268313
default	reset
that should reset it to the default

1268317
nsmutablearray	nsarray
although the questions are different the answer is the same and that is that due to the setup of nsarray and therefore nsmutablearray you cannot subclassing it without implements the methods yourself

1268320
windows-xp	windows	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp
this works and correctly detection many windows product editions including windows-xp windows 7 home professional windows-server 2003 and windows-server 2008 and contains code that should identify windows 8 and windows-server 2012

1268320
windows-server	windows	32-bit	64bit
it compiles on delphi 2007 xe2 and xe3 and has been tested on winxp professional sp2 and sp3 windows 7 pro 64bit and windows-server 2003 2008 32-bit 2003 64bit 2008

1268334
subclassing	nsobject	subclassing	ivar	nsobject	ivar
it s better to make a category on nsarray or make an nsobject subclassing that has an nsarray ivar that you talk to

1268334
abstract-class	subclassing
to create a subclassing of a class cluster you have to implements all the primitive methods of the abstract-class you are inheriting from manage your own storage and basically reimplements all the stuff you were hoping to get for free by subclassinging

1268343
cross-compiling	binutils
cross-compiling need their own set of binutils for the target architecture

1268343
environment	building
however unlike gcc i do not believe the binutils tools do a double bootstrap building and verify step .so it is possible that .some difference from the original x86_64 building environment made it into them

1268343
cross-compiling	binutils
i d try building the binutils package for arm again using the arm cross-compiling

1268344
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you will printing _nscfarray which is a concrete subclassing of nsmutablearray and nsarray

1268361
value	field	updating	updates
you can run the commented out selected usually i specify the field i m updating old and new value next to each other to make sure that what i am going to updates is exactly what i meant to updates

1268365
functional-programming	imperative
as such it required a different approach from the usual imperative mindset and that will deter some people from fully investigating it i m not dismissing functional-programming btw but in the web client-server world it s not the most common paradigms

1268366
networkstream	binaryreader
in this case you re using binarywriter on one side .so attaching a binaryreader to the networkstream returned by tcpclient.getstream would seem like the easiest approach

1268376
put	get
my normals query is to get all post with the category it is put into

1268376
put	get
now i want to get all .post that belongs to a certain category id with all the category the .post is put into

1268405
environment	building
it turns out that if you make the building parameterized any string parameters you add become environment variables

1268405
any	set	environment	building
with this approach it is possible to set any environment variables for the building including java_home which is picked up by ant

1268405
environment	building
it s not obvious that building string parameters become environment variables but once you know that they do it s easy to set the jdk this way

1268432
python	php
i m new to python and pylons although experienced in php

1268449
sql-server	mysql
i don t know about mysql but in sql-server it will let you defined field such that the total numbers of bytes used is greater than the total numbers of bytes that can actually be stored in a recording

1268449
value	field
additionally yes you do not want people to put 200 characters in a field where the maximum value should be 10

1268464
plugins	add-on
exit extraneous applications kill background tasks stop all scheduling events crontab eliminate plugins and uninstaller browser add-on

1268472
json	xml
imo what is returned should only be data as you get with xml text or json formats

1268515
expression	brackets
is it possible to convert a properly formed in terms of brackets expression such as

1268518
icollection	ienumerable
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generics than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

1268552
decimal-point	digits
i m looking to accept digits and the decimal-point but no sign

1268565
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox and safari but will not work in ie7

1268569
google-chrome	firefox
i confirmed with a much simpler test that both browsers i m working with google-chrome firefox 3.5 can do input checked + ul if it s simply an input followed by a ul

1268580
put	get
im trying to get the contents of a webpage put into a field in filemaker pro 10

1268583
click	mouse
the defaultcelleditor has a setclickcounttostart methods to control mouse click for editing

1268584
global-assembly-cache	gac
gac global-assembly-cache

1268587
put	get
.when you get to an open parentheses push stack in and put characters that aren t parentheses into string of stack

1268590
compass-sass	compass
i m not a fan of the blueprint 960.gs and yui plugins for compass either they were originally built for use with extra markup and don t take full advantage of compass-sass for extra flexibility

1268597
webserver	upload
have you tried obtaining a copy of those videos upload it to your webserver and embed your videos that way

1268598
rhino-mocks	moq
i can t see moq or rhino-mocks allowing me to mock out sharepoint-object-model code

1268614
implements	abstract
however if you were using in a family of classes there could be a virtual or abstract methods that return and icollections then in the subclassing implementation one can return a collections or a funkycollections or any object that implements the interface .so this gives you a lot more f lexibility that saying you can only return a collections

1268639
plugins	add-on
many technologies allow pluggable features called plugins or add-on usually

1268639
contains	any
the registry contains the menus the framework himself declare plus any additionals provided by plugins.

1268657
highlight	selected
i have a highlight mode forget what it s called that show me through highlight the text what region i have selected between mark and points

1268670
google-chrome	opera
in google-chrome and opera neither methods appears to work properly

1268680
return-value	arguments
the use of s for the input arguments s types as well as for the return-value tells the compiler that whatever the types of object may be that is passed to the function the result has the same types or a derived types actually

1268698
licensing	gpl
however based on various licensing that i ve read .so far java is supposed to be fully gpl d now with the exception-handling of the snmp implementation which is still encumbered

1268700
attributes	properties
yes it is okay to return a complex structure provided you have explicit applied the data-members attributes to each and every needed properties of the object s

1268712
associations	model
note that there are project like hobo for ruby-on-rails which allow you to keep your field and associations within the model itself

1268740
revision	updates
it updates every time you save the document but seems to keep its own revision numbering systemd correlated to but independent of the sharepoint versioning numbering systemd

1268741
installation	building
.when the building installation is complete a webpage is updates with the results of the install pass fail

1268746
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m mixing asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc

1268746
webforms	asp.net
but javascript postback on the asp.net webforms pages don t work

1268757
primitive	int
note that y has to be an object int not a primitive types

1268760
highlight	selected
just selected highlight a few lines-of-code and click the - icons on the left

1268774
nspredicateeditor	nspredicate
i can create an nspredicate easily using an nspredicateeditor a subclassing of nsruleeditor

1268789
web-services	api
as a suggested alternative strategy since you ve got an internal api with web-services consider a web service methods that implements a single private static logger in the background and adds entries to the log

1268810
enterprise-architect	visio
i believe this required the visio enterprise-architect edition

1268819
webserver	upload
keep in mind you ll also have to give the iusr account write access for the folder once you upload to your webserver

1268827
value	field
in the formula you ll set the shared variables to the value of the rowcount field in the subreport

1268829
constructor	private
this works however if you wish to create the arrays within the constructor you al.so need a private dummy constructor .so that you can get the class

1268834
queue	fifo
in a flowchart or process diagram what is the symbols for a fifo queue

1268854
union-all	union
union instead of union-all

1268855
settings.settings	app-config
.when i deploy i would like the windowsservice and serviceconsole to be in the same folder since serviceconsole needs access to windowsservice s app-config settings.settings file to configure it

1268894
directory	folder
they get buried in one of those hidden folder inside the user s .profile directory

1268896
joomla	drupal
drupal and joomla are platform-independent

1268896
joomla	drupal
personally i think drupal is an outstanding choice for nonprofit org this being my own background that have tech-skilled staff and joomla is an outstanding fit for nonprofits that don t have much in-house web expertise

1268900
mstest	nunit
have tried using a different framework than mstest like nunit to see if that reproduces the problem

1268955
directory	folder
if that isn t the problem checked that the user account used to run your website has permissions to the directory and all the files and folder contains within it and make sure that the network service has permissions

1268963
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i ve also used a bunch of dynamic-languages like perl python php and javascript

1268963
scala	java
my question is why do you see such extensive use of preprocessor in c++ and objective-c but rarely or never see it in languages like java c# or scala

1268968
python	php
long answer you ll need to building a query locally maybe with a scripting python php or just upload the csv in a table and doing a join query or just the where x in selected y from mytmmptable...

1268977
expression	brackets
i m trying to parsing an expression like where the directions of the angle brackets determine whether the interval is inclusive or exclusive

1268983
abstract	sealed
this msdn article states that static-classes should be declare as sealed and abstract

1268984
python	ruby
for a general idea of what i m looking to building see ruby proxy for scale and monitor - except in python

1268984
eventmachine	twisted
i realize that twisted is an exceedingly good answer for this and that eventmachine was inspired by twisted but i m looking for something other than twisted

1268994
silverlight	wpf
we wrote a mac versioning in silverlight 3 which supports quite alot of wpf .net stuff

1268994
silverlight	wpf
our codebase is now on wpf and silverlight 3 and is the same .when we compile it produces the sl3 and desktop apps

1268998
put	get
what i usually do is lay out the templates in the index.phtml and then .when i need to get .something from a model put that snippet in a detail.phtml .so logic is as far out of the way as possible

1269000
any	set
and create a page webcamimage.aspx that streaming the static image file back to the browser while ignoring the data request parameter which is only used to avoid any caching make sure to set the response content-type to image jpeg or whatever is adequate in the page header

1269003
constructor	private	instances	private	abstract	sealed
do declare static-classes as sealed and abstract and add a private instances constructor if your programming language does not have built-in support for static-classes

1269006
bmp	png	loading	png
i am writing an imaging libs using the mit licence and would like to hook it up to a libs that supports loading and saving of images in various file-format bmp png jpg etc

1269012
constructor	private	static-classes	static-class	abstract	sealed
it appears to be saying that declaring a class as sealed and abstract with a private constructor is an alternative to the static-class if the language does not support static-classes

1269021
command-prompt	cmd
i m trying to get my visual-studio qt plugins to work .so to recompile the qt libs i ran the following cmd from a vs command-prompt

1269026
constructor	private	abstract	sealed
.so if you have a class with only static-methods it was suggested to declare it sealed abstract and make constructor private

1269034
static-class	inherited
that s what a static-class actually is -- a class that cannot be initializer and that cannot be inherited

1269034
abstract	sealed
.so the article doesn t state you should mark your static-classes as abstract and sealed additionally but this is the way how static-classes are represented in il

1269034
abstract	sealed
other languages may allow you to do this if they do not have a static keyword although i doubt it because an abstract sealed class doesn t make a lot of sense semantically.

1269037
scala	java
the reason why you don t see the preprocessor used in java c# or scala is that those languages obviously don t have one

1269042
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
they are working as intended in firefox safari but internet-explorer throw the following error

1269043
32-bit	64bit
for example i needed to switching an application-pool to classic instead of integrated mode and explicit set it to run in 32-bit mode .when on 64bit windows in distilled form this resulted in this

1269047
arrays	map
colortostring looks color named up with an inttoident map using the const arrays colors defined in graphics.pas

1269048
macros	basic
c was built with the preprocessor in mind as a powerful tool it was used to implements very basic stuff such as inclusion guard and developers were able to use it to either optimize their code through macros or to optional include exclude certain blocks of code in addition to other things

1269053
conditional-compilation	compile-time
c al.so doesn t have runtime or compile-time polymorphism .so #ifdefs were needed for conditional-compilation

1269055
allocation	deep
without some deep and dark rewriting of the python core runtime to allow forcing of an allocation that uses a given segment of sharedd-memory and ensures compatible addresses between disparate process there is no way to shared object in memory in any general sense

1269055
any	set
with this single exception-handling which i don t think will cover your use case sharing of object graphing that include references pointers to other object is basically unfeasible -- and just about any object set of interest in modern languages including python falls under this classification

1269057
getter	setter
.so in the db i just have a text datatype that i want to store the comma separated list of urls and i overrides the default ar setter and getter .so i can assign an arrays and get an arrays for the value and it takes care of the joining and splitting

1269064
specifications	w3c
w3c specifications on setrequestheader

1269066
implements	extends
the fundamental question is what does it mean for a methods to be deprecated in an interface but not in an implements class or in an extends interface

1269089
scrollbar	widget
a scrollpane is a containers that just takes a single widget and puts a scrollbar on it if needed

1269089
scrollable	panels
a caveat however there was a longstanding defect with any sort of scrollable panels inside of a tabpanel

1269093
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest doing a trial of the db ghost product because they have some interesting claims concerning multiple versioning upgrade

1269093
versioning	upgrade
upgrade may be from a very old versioning

1269140
firefox	safari	fadeout	fadein
for a client i am attempting to get this site to work in ie and other web browsers currently only works in safari and firefox for mac i am using jquery s fadein and fadeout functions on the pictures to cycle them through in the background

1269150
uitableview	uiview
i would like to have a uiview with the same background as a uitableview with the uitableviewstylesgrouped styles its that grey-white pattern seen in the settings .app for example

1269156
any	set
i don t know of any existing implementation but if your set elements are strings or have a unique string representation you can use javascript-objects pretty easily

1269156
any	set
you could also use item in set or set.hasownproperty item instead of but checked by for true explicit you automatically ignore any functions that might be attached to the object in case someone modified object.prototype or it s not a plain object

1269159
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
from a theoretical points of view shared static stuff are non-object oriented stuff in an object oriented language they don t support polymorphism. there s no need to call the base-class shared constructor .when you access static-members of a derived-class

1269159
derived-class	base-class
initializer is a more correct words here. none of the rules say if derived-class shared constructor is called base-class shared constructor is guaranteed to be called too

1269166
any	set
i have change the file size in php-ini to 30m and i also set the max_file_size input any solutions

1269186
memcached	apc
then you will probably want to add .so kind of caching mecanism like apc or memcached

1269212
javassist	bcel
just to let people know i decided to go with javassist in the end instead of bcel since javassist seems to be a lot simpler to use and is perfectly adequate for my purposes

1269217
derived-class	base-class
in the above example base.do a printing base-class instead of derived-class

1269224
derived-class	base-class
this is how you would invoke the code in the base-class s versioning of the methods from the derived-class

1269228
csv	xml
maybe it s got a named owner and big blob of csv xml etc

1269254
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ada	ocaml	ada	smalltalk	ocaml
nowadays language designers recognize that textual inclusion is no way to run a railroad .so languages tend to run either to separately compiled interfaces ada modula ocaml to compiler-generated interfaces haskell or to dynamic systemd that guarantee interface consistency java smalltalk

1269257
postgresql	mysql
part of the mysql query that i m trying to convert to postgresql

1269258
expression	evaluation
note how and is just a messages on boolean itself produced as a result-of passing messages to x and the second arguments of and is not a plain expression but a block enabling lazy-evaluation short-circuiting evaluation

1269275
put	get
you put and get into and out of an mvar

1269286
display	height
the widget sizing will shrink automatically once the text and images that they are display shrinks unless you ve done bad things like hardcode height widths use gtkfixed etc

1269295
arguments	default
suppose i have a class with 3 constructor a default no arguments constructor a parameterized constructor and a static constructor

1269295
instances	private	defined	declare
the problem is this suppose i declare a private instances member variables on the class which is of a types that is defined in the embedded assembly

1269295
constructor	private
now if the static constructor has already run then the initializer on that private member will have no problem running

1269295
instances	private
if i remove the private instances variables then i don t get the fusion error

1269310
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working fine for me google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3

1269316
shell	bash
here is an example if the remote shell is bash

1269328
google-chrome	safari
i came up with a solution that doesn t run on webkit google-chrome + safari but which is very compact

1269328
google-chrome	safari
but alas oy vey the nameitem doesn t work on safari google-chrome - maybe there s an alternative approach for those browsers.

1269337
getter	setter
for example serialization urls arrays â it sounds like you ve already got a working getter and setter but it s always nice to reuse what activerecord provides

1269350
sftp	ssh
using sftp i can upload files over an ssh connection to the server

1269365
digits	zero
note that the regular expression d will match zero or more digits - this include the empty string since this is exactly zero digits

1269369
any	set
i guess the very generalized answer to this concern is simply the consideration that the set of legal return value for any function should be made as small as possible and as large as necessary

1269374
caliburn	prism
however some of the implementation of common features done in prism are nice too and the founder of caliburn has even removed some features that you would then get from prism

1269383
python	c++
for instances try c++ or python

1269387
spreadsheet	apache-poi
i suggest you to take a look at simplexlsbuilder and simplexlsslurper both are based on apache-poi and can fit your basic needs for reading from and writing to excel 97 spreadsheet in a concise way

1269399
json	csv
this is a webpage that will convert your csv to json from a url

1269399
json	csv
uses jquery and the csv and json plugins

1269415
getter	setter
if you just open your class internals with getter and setter then you re giving up encapsulation completely

1269421
audio	id3
id3 information can be read retrieving the kaudiofilepropertiesinfodictionary properties of an audio file using the audiofilegetproperties function of the audiotoolbox framework

1269424
groovy	java
imo two good ways to go from java that also have practical application together with java would be groovy for a dynamic fun language and c for low-level knowledge using jni with java

1269424
python	ruby	python	java
no harm learning a scripting-language as well - you could even glue that to a java program by calling out to the command-line - or in some cases python ruby running a java based versioning of it

firefox	safari	firefox	opera	mobile-safari	opera	mobile-safari	safari	safari	opera
on my website at the site as a whole display well in mobile-safari and the homepage display well on desktop firefox opera safari and ie but the homepage specifically does not look at all good on mobile-safari it display one words per line stretching out the text vertically

1269434
contains	elements
the half-spectrum format of kissfft and fftw and imkl for that matter contains x y 2+1 complex elements

1269441
user-interface	drawing
note this is specifically windows client user-interface paradigms but i am certainly open to drawing inspiration from the web the mac etc

1269449
jquery	.post
i am trying to make an ajax call with jquery if i put an alert in the success part it launchd the alert .so i know the call is working and there is no errors but if i try to u a value returned from the ajax call it is null i would .post code but i m on an iphone

1269461
internet-explorer	firefox
use firebug for firefox or stumbler for internet-explorer

1269470
uiscrollview	subviews
i have uiimageviews as subviews for uiscrollview

1269472
if-statement	loops
the body of loops is a minefield of if-statement variables assignments and there is a continue in the middle somewhere

1269484
exception-handling	try-catch
i would probably put a try-catch in that code to see if something is triggers an exception-handling

1269506
selected	cell	show	next
if a user selected a cell and i implements didselectrowatindexpath the cell flashes blue and the next view show up

1269506
selected	cell
ie while in edit mode .when a user selected a cell nothing is happening

1269511
margins	padding
are you setting any widths or padding margins border which might make your problematic div too wide to fit

1269516
imageview	spinner
.so instead of putting the spinner within the imageview just put it within the cell.

1269518
sequences	unique
here is my suggestion not very well tested but in my head it sounds right as long as id is unique and a continious sequences

1269540
cursor	row
using table data one row at a time instead of one table at a time cursor

1269561
google-chrome	firefox
the actual output in firefox and google-chrome is a box the tabcontainer with a themed border

1269579
sql-server	ms-access	sql-server	mysql	ms-access	mysql
i m trying to create a completely new database from an existing mysql database bringing over both data and schema but .so far the only way i ve been able to do this is to first import the mysql database into ms-access and then into sql-server 2005

1269584
memcached	apc
also as someone else mentioned take a look at a caching mechanism like apc or memcached but i would also reccommend a php class caching systemd

1269585
ruby	php
i m something of a new reluctant convert to c++ from a pascal ruby and php background

1269585
pascal	delphi
i haven t worked with pascal since a few months of torture with delphi turbo

1269585
ruby	php
since then i ve practically been eating and sleeping ruby and php

1269600
implements	extends
if jquery did decide to implements something like this into the core this is a huge decision that will affect a lot of people and may affect how they use extends jquery and if they continue to use jquery

1269619
dialog	pop-up
you mentioned pop-up modal dialog and i d argue that non-modal ones are just as bad

1269625
value	field
what i m looking for is the best idiomatic way of including in this view the unicode representation and generator field a datetimefield from the most recent turn that points to the current game in loops based on the value of generator

1269638
any	set
from there you can do ldap queries to your ad and it returns like any other recording set

1269653
autoit	vba
i m programming the problem in autoit but the answer could be in vba vbs asp java or c#

1269664
updating	updates
only caveat since you are updating is providing the proper permissions to the ldap server to do the updates

1269692
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

1269703
sql-server	mysql
it s been a couple years since i had to do it myself but as i recall that was the process i used to transfer a mysql database to sql-server in the past

1269704
animation	rotation
using two-stage rotation animation

1269704
animation	rotation
mysterious because i m not using two-stage rotation animation

1269711
javascript	dom
i think what sets jquery apart from libs like prototype is that it concentrates on features such as fast dom selection traversal and manipulation rather than adding flavor to javascript

1269713
mbunit	moq
and here s a failing unit test that i think should be passing but isn t using mbunit moq

1269722
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have the following jquery code similar to this question that works in firefox and ie but fails no errors just doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

1269733
order	add
you may need to add a metaclass to the turn model to order from newest to oldest

1269740
rhino-mocks	moq	rhino-mocks	typemock	typemock	moq
as i don t care too much for the record-replay step of typemock and rhino-mocks i ve opted for the newer moq which will happily mock either the datarepository classes or the service-layer call themselves with minimal hassle

1269742
dictionary	map
then parsing it and store it in a dictionary map whatever-the-language-or-framework-has-for-hashtables

1269761
any	set
you can set any properties at most once in this block

1269788
cygwin	gnu
edit i m using cygwin gnu sed versioning 4.1.5 on windows-vista and i want a case-insensitive search

1269792
credentials	account
if you use any other non-domain account sql-server will not receive your credentials

1269795
python	c++
for a speed comparison i decided to make the most direct translation of the algorithm i knew of from python to c++

1269795
python	c++
surprisingly the c++ versioning runs significantly slower than the python versioning

1269795
python	c++
accurate speed tests between the execution time for discovering the first 10 000 happy numbers indicate the python program runs on average in 0.59 seconds and the c++ versioning runs on average in 8.5 seconds

1269795
python	c++
i would attributes this speed difference to the fact that i had to write helpers functions for parts of the calculations for example determining if an elements is in a list arrays vector in the c++ versioning which were already built-in to the python language

1269795
python	c++
firstly is this the true reason for such an absurd speed difference and secondly how can i change the c++ versioning to execute more quickly than the python versioning the way it should be in my opinion

1269795
python	c++
the two pieces of code with speed testing are here python versioning c++ versioning

1269813
ole-automation	com
com is a misnomer my bad it is really an ole-automation extension

1269820
python	c++
i am not an expert at c++ optimization but i believe the speed difference may be due to the fact that python lists have preallocated more spaces at the beginning while your c++ vectors must reallocate and possibly copy every time it grows

1269823
stateless	stateful
silverlight apps are interactive stateful applications not stateless webpage contains information and page request

1269829
stderr	stdout
stdin stdout stderr from the spawned ps

1269833
getter	setter
first you need to understand the difference between instance-variables and properties and getter setter

1269833
getter	setter
getter setter implements that interface and may use an ivar as backing storage

1269833
getter	setter
further you need to know that you should not use getter setter in either the init or dealloc routines

1269842
arrays	loops
.so you probably want to have the arrays pre-allocated and using it inside your loops

1269868
directory	folder
however the easiest thing to do is set your test files and folder to be copy-paste to the output directory

1269869
selected	cell
i can t click on them directly to selected them but if i selected the cell to the lower right of a locked cell and then shift-click the one to the upper left all 9 cell including the locked one are selecteded

1269869
selected	cell
i can also click-drag to selected the 9 cell

1269869
selected	cell
am i missing .something obvious or is there .some other programmatic way to mark a cell .so that it can t be selected later on

1269890
xsd	xml
i have an xml that looks like this and a corresponding xsd with it

1269890
xsd	xml
is there any way i can get xjc of jaxb to generator classes without me having to alter the xml xsd file

1269890
xsd	xml
i don t want to alter xml xsd file as it is 20 000 line file

1269893
sftp	ftp
it s not available yet but haven will allow you to edit files via ftp sftp in your browser

1269900
perl	awk
i m not familiar with the java regex engine but other regex engines i ve used perl awk allow you to capture matches

1269904
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are implements as a class cluster see string object in the iphone versioning of the documentation

1269928

import the icons your want in the pop-up dialog and make sure the id of the icons is the smallest one

1269929
decrement	increment
my date class of course provides methods for getting the year month and day adding subtract increment and decrement comparing getting the numbers of days between dates etc

1269946
uisearchbar	uitableview
the uisearchbar in my uitableview header is the strong color

1269977
selected	cell	selection	cell
i think you ll need to create .some code in the worksheet_selectionchange event that checked whether your protected cell are include in the new selection and if .so selected .some other cell perhaps the next unprotected one to the right or below

1269977
selection	cell
i haven t reviewed the code but a cursory search for worksheet_selectionchange protected cell selection brought up

1269993
authentication	login
if the user is not authentication he is throw back to the login page

1269996
data-members	constructor
double checked that constructor have initializer for all data-members

1269998
python	c++
for 100000 elements the python code took 6.9 seconds while the c++ originally took above 37 seconds

1269998
python	c++
i did some basic optimizations on your code and managed to get the c++ code above 100 time faster than the python implementation

1270005
registration	login
i replace each after the login registration handler by in my code since does not include _session - still the same problem and i cannot see the username in the homepage after registration login

1270019
32-bit	64bit
it is working fine on 32-bit windows-xp but .when i use it on 64bit windows-xp it is not working

1270038
multiplication	division
you can implements fastdivbyonemillion as a multiplication and a division by a power of 2

1270044
constructor	object
object s constructor - fn - is then being called in a context of that newly created object but since it doesn t mutate ab object in any way we can consider that step irrelevant

1270044
constructor	object
its constructor object is then being called in a context of this newly created object as well but nothing happens there either

1270044
constructor	object
now you can augment object constructor in such way that it would somehow mutate initializer object

1270056
multiplication	division
division is the same as multiplication by a fractions

1270063
spaces	output
the problem is not with empty line or spaces it is with output

1270064
observers	listener
in contrast the observers design pattern which javabeans properties change listener are an implementsation of are much easier to implements

1270070
entity-framework	nhibernate
how you retrieve data from the db using an or m is going to be different if you re using entity-framework linq-to-sql subsonic nhibernate or any other or m

1270104
downgrade	upgrade
basically is boils down to creating a small sql scripting to upgrade and downgrade each little change to the database

1270104
versioning	migrate
.when you are testing the application you migrate your database to the versioning you want and on deployment the application can checked what versioning it needs and migrate to that versioning

1270107
any	set
if the properties file is something you have full control over yourself you can starting from java6 also use utf-8 or any other character set directly in the properties file and specify that encoding .when you load it

1270127
uitouch	uiview
in these messagess tracking the uitouch object location converted to points on the view by using the convertpoint toview messages of the uiview you re subclassing and calculate the difference of movement

1270134
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you could also try using the developer-tools in safari or google-chrome if you re not a firefox fan

1270167
player	movie
you can relatively easily find movie player flowplayer

1270171
linux	unix
historically unix systemd wanted swap spaces available like that but they don t work that way anymore and linux never worked that way

1270182
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

1270199
onmousemove	mouseevent
protected overrides void onmousemove mouseeventargs mouseevent

1270215
inno-setup	nsis
would it be ok to suggest using inno-setup or nsis instead

1270233
linux	unix
for service install4j generator service executable on windows startup items on mac os x and start stop scripting on unix linux platform

1270234
sniffing	traffic
traffic sniffing replay

1270235
python	java
there are a couple solutions online including a behavior that someone posted in the bakery but that s just stuff that any good orm framework like propel torque java hibernate java sqlobject python sqlalchemy python support right out of the box

1270235
cakephp	symfony
i was going to use cakephp for a project that i am working on after running to too many of those types of issues i switched to symfony and it s been smooth sailing

1270242
click	mouse
the current set-up of drop down is .when you click the parent title how to change to mouse over to show the childs of a parent

1270260
32-bit	64bit
suppose the program you start comes with 32-bit and 64bit versioning

1270260
32-bit	64bit
maybe the 32-bit versioning can detection that it s running on a 64bit platform start the 64bit versioning of itself and then terminate the 32-bit versioning

1270260
32-bit	64bit
in that case your program would detection the termination of the 32-bit child but it would be oblivious to the 64bit grandchild process

1270274
beautifulsoup	mechanize
i am trying to login into a website in python using mechanize and beautifulsoup

1270274
any	set
in no where did i see any cookies set am i looking at the wrong places

1270275
double	int
xslt 1.0 does not have an int data types only double

1270279
fwrite	fread
but you could probably use functions like fwrite and fread and fseek which will be manipulating the pointers and allocation more spaces if necessary

1270285
show	next
as soon as i hit the next line where it had show the value it now show the following error

1270297
jquery	.post
thought i d add to this .post for .when someone comes across it the following link which is quite useful .when using jquery or javascript for that matter

1270331
administration	account
or run in built-in administration s account

1270351
textmate	bbedit
for example textmate stores the selection for a document this way much as bbedit mpw and others used to store tab settings windows size etc

1270372
comma	words
meaning move past the words call w highlight a quoted string va delete it d move one spaces to the right l highlight a words vaw paste p move backward to the comma f paste before it p

1270381
postgresql	mysql
you can always look at something like specifications for example that show both postgresql and mysql at least

1270387
strncpy	strcpy
there was a question recently on .so why on earth would anyone use strncpy instead of strcpy

1270393
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for login last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393
postgresql	mysql
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1270393
perl	tcl	python	tcl	python	perl
both have stored-procedures these days but postgresql has much more flexible .so far for example support for stored-procedures in perl python tcl r etc

1270403
python	java
a little background i m in the process of learning python through o reilly s learning python book i ve had some experience in java

1270423
value	field
in the order table you will store the orderid and an enumerated value of which methods the user used to pay in addition to any other field you need

1270433
textchanged	textbox
and have it all in the boxes textchanged parts i can only get one textbox written

1270438
constructor	object
if the latter how will that work i usually pass an object into the constructor that can be used to register hooks with

1270447
linux	unix
cross platform unix linux and mac os x os 2 and windows win32 and wince are supported out of the box

1270459
any	set
i mean you set the wanted value at the beginning and the decoding takes that into account .so you could decode to any bit depth you need

1270489
modularity	paradigms
within the oo paradigms we choose to use classes because they help us to break the systemd down and provide nice side benefits such as encapsulation separation of responsibilities inherited modularity etc

1270500
firefox	safari
per this .post here on .so firefox 3.5 safari 4 and ie8 support html5 storage

1270502
boost	stl
by using the stl containers classes and the various boost smart_ptrs there s little need to ever explicit call new or delete in your c++ code

1270535
windows-vista	windows-xp
this is a deployment problem in my case because the difference between the dlls is the assembly versioning which i can view fine in windows-xp but not in windows-vista

1270538
hide	show
in jquery you could move to the correct layer and hide or show it relatively easily

1270540
procedural-programming	procedural
but since sequential procedural-programming languages can be understood in terms of lambda-calculus and c# happens to fit well within the parameters of a sequential procedural language it s a good fit

1270553
vba	vb6
.so i ve learned that i need to user-interface to make it work and i need to regasm the dll to create a types libs file which i can reference directly from the vba vb6 .app

1270561
selected	cell
if its a single click and its on a selected cell you can return true otherwise return false

1270565
constructor	object
skeet s third sample he states this clearly the java-memory-model doesn t ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object is assign to instances

1270565
constructor	object
that makes sense but what seems to be missing is the guarantee that the reference to the new object is assign only after the constructor completes - otherwise we d get the same kind of issue that makes double-check locking fail unless you mark the instances as volatile

1270565
constructor	object
is there a guarantee that .when using static initialization to call the instances constructor as opposed to calling the instances constructor from a properties s get like we do with double-check locking that the constructor will fully complete before any other thread can get a reference to the object

1270570
multiplying	division
as joshua haberman mentioned your compiler will probably already convert the division by a constants 1000000 to a multiplying by a magic numbers followed by a shift if the division is an int operation

1270575
required	checked
checked the procedure describe in what is the minimum client footprint required to connect c# to an oracle

1270579
any	set
provided your are using debian or some derivative of it if the dpkg ... cmd gives you any useful output you should set the java_home to the location of the installation directory for instances

1270626
jlist	jtree
i have designed two components i.e calculator and engine source codes below which need to be inside any of the swing components either jlist jtree or any

1270628
atom-feed	feed
by using different xslt files i can use the same xml source to create multiple polyglot x html files presenting the same data in different ways a rss feed an atom-feed a rdf descriptor file and fragment of a site map

1270640
desktop-application	multi-user
i uses it for multi-user and desktop-application

1270649
constructor	object
that the constructor will fully complete before any other thread can get a reference to the object

1270649
constructor	object
the reference to the new object is assign only after the constructor completes

1270668
publishing	release
for example .when we publishing release notes we can create xml that looks something like

1270707
xquery	xslt
i ve used xslt and also xquery extensively for various things - to generator c++ code as part of build-process to produce .documentation from .doc comments and within an application that had to work with xml in general and xhtml in particular a lot

1270733
export	report
i ve found that a 2 step process with the first step export the report data as an xml file and the second step generator the visual report from the xml using xslt

1270757
json	xml
of course these days i d probably have written those web apps using a restful interface - and i think data languages such as json are gaining traction in areas that xml has traditionally been transformed by xslt

1270761
put	get
headers get applied afterwards and then the messages gets put directly into the requestcontext s requestmessages properties

1270837
selected	cell
one of the tabs needs to display a tableview and selected a cell from within the table view will do something else - maybe show another table view or a webpage

1270855
sql-server	mysql
as the question says what is the sql-server equivalent of inet_aton from mysql

1270858
value	field
this will always return the value of the field with the internal named first

1270859
click	mouse
its working fine .when i use it from the same thread .when i get a callback from web service which is in a different thread i use dispatcher to show a messages i can see the new text in the pop-up but the binding isn t working the button remaining unavailable canexecute false .when i click on the screens with the mouse the pop-up updates the real value of canexecute and the button is appear available

1270863
xsd	xml
i used xml xsd and xslt on an integration project between very dis-similar db systemd sometime in 2004

1270863
xsd	xml
the great thing about these tools was that it enabled me to write data independent c++ code relying on xsd and xslt to validation verify and then transform the xml document

1270871
javafx	swing
the swing application framework is dead in the water -- from what i hear most of the developers have been move over to javafx

1270876
optional-parameters	named
with optional-parameters and named arguments all of this is solved

1270883
default-value	default
this gets set by default as the per.son who created the issue .so effectively becomes my default-value

1270897
any	set
.so yes after running this- input- .post username through the form validation with the xss option set any dirty data will come out clean

1270901

google-chrome	safari
i have sifr v3 revision 419 running fabulously on ie7 ff3 and safari but in google-chrome and ff2 the text rendering really tiny

1270938
contains	any
more generally to test whether the list only contains things that evaluate to false you can use any

1270941
deep-copy	object
since you want the easiest way to deep-copy a scala object and not the fastest you can always serialization the object provided that it s serialization and then deserialization it back

1270960
filesystems	fat
windows fat does not .so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available

1270964
web-config	app-config
i copy-paste the app-config data vs2008 added to my framework project for the service into the web-config but that didn t seem to work

1270978
positioning	embed
the problem is that the embed seems to jump to the very top layer ignoring all z-index or positioning statements

1270981
sql-server	sqlcommand
i have inherited a little c# methods that creates an ado.net sqlcommand object and loops over a list of items to be saved to the database sql-server 2005

1270981
sqltransaction	sqlcommand
right now the traditional sqlconnection sqlcommand approach is used and to make sure everything works the two step delete old entries then insert new ones are wrapped into an ado.net sqltransaction

1270982
linux	unix
even unix linux does not have a built-in feature but they package sed and awk as programs out of the box

1270987
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
it is totally independent of whether you re using asp.net-mvc asp.net webforms or anything else for that matter

1271020
getter	setter
you should create yourself setter and getter for the properties you want to modify and a refresh is required afterwards

1271023
heatmap	plot
i m creating heatmap sub plot that differ in aspect-ratio according to the data used

1271024
contains	set
slightly more complicated but perhaps more flexible would be to make use of a table contains a sequential set of numbers

1271033
response	timeout
i m not very experienced in that field but what happens .when a timer triggers a new request before the response streaming has been fully received because the timeout time is equals to the timer interval

1271046
arrays	loops
the extraction methods of cakephp s core set class allows you to filtering your data quickly without having to loops through multi dimentional arrays or traversal through tree structures

1271049
arrays	loops
you are calling breader.basestream.length every time through loops and your call to breader.readbytes is allocation a new byte arrays every time

1271070
httplistener	http.sys
my thinking is that iis is really a user-mode wrapper around the windows o s http.sys kernel-module that does all the heavy duty network handling and .so is httplistener

1271076
javascript-framework	dojo
i m using dojo as javascript-framework

1271078
communication	messages
this leads me to conclude that telnet.exe the command-prompt tool does some initial communication to get the proprietary messages

1271094
solaris	procfs
while you ask for a c solution maybe you could look into the perl-module solaris procfs to see what it does to extraction information

1271114
selected	checkbox
jquery tutorial selected all checkbox

1271115
expression	evaluation
between the previous and next sequences points a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

1271117
administration	integrated
like remote administration logging integrated windows security etc

1271121
contains	elements	contains	any
.so if you really want to be careful you could test first whether it contains any elements at all as follows

1271124
database-table	mysql	hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
i use nested-set-model for saving hierarchical-data into database-table and i m interested in if mysql has built-in support for adding deleting nodes or i have to write stored-procedures from scratch

.when you write a value to view state it is stored on that page in an encrypted field

1271189
constructor	object
checked the object s constructor is another option but note that it won t work across global contexts between a parent page and a frame

1271193
push	pull
my personal feeling is that microsoft have invented the notion that the xmlreader is better with the explanation of the push pull model but i don t really buy it

1271224
listitem	selected
the server controls in asp.net uses viewstate to keep the listitem object that form the option tags in the rendering selected tag

1271226
32-bit	64bit
i cannot find any option that would force dbxtool to use the 64-but debugger in fact the only one i can find is one to force use of the 32-bit debugger in a 64bit environment

1271241
managed-code	unmanaged
i believe you have to mark the pointers as pinned in the managed-code and then copy the bytes over to some unmanaged memory region and then use the pointers to that

1271243
32-bit	64bit
according to msdn if you are running 64bit windows you need to use getwindowlongptr because getwindowlong only uses a 32-bit long which would give you negative value after it reached the end of the 32-bit long

1271254
put	get
after a while i tend to get a lot of small static-classes usually with only one methods which i usualy put in a utility namespace that gets bloated with classes

1271260
directory	folder
but .when its install as a virtual directory it break because it is looking for files in root folder and not in virtualdirectorypath folder

1271263
output	cat
could also use to read from the file directly i suppose -- used cat first to output the content of the file and only after i added sed to my command-line

1271283
solaris	linux
that are outside of the java platform can be different across os platform solaris windows linux macintosh etc. and can change at any time without notice with sdk versioning 1.2 1.2.1 1.2.3 etc

1271296
version-control	git
i m going to use this tool to tracking database dml plsql changes with git version-control

1271314
return-value	arguments
you cannot use it as member variables or a global and you can t pass it as an arguments or return-value

1271318
textbox	button
.when the button is click teh first time i write the data contains in the textbox into that text file

1271318
textbox	button
if the user wants to do the same thing with different data in the textbox then the click on the button should write the new data into the text file without losing the old data

1271325
selected	cell
if i m in my final screens after pressing the secondbutton and i press on the backbutton it would be great if it could play the previous video in other words the video connect to the previously selected cell

1271325
selected	cell
i thought i could do that by popping the last screens and then selected the previously click cell in morning workout

1271334
spring	grails
i reckon introducing a portlet framework such as the spring portlet api will make development faster and more comfortable .so being able to further add groovy and grails conventions to the mix .sounds almost too good to be true

1271345
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the same scenario works just fine on firefox opera and google-chrome

1271375
selected	listbox	click	mouse
i want to get notified .when an item in a listbox gets click by the mouse whether it is already selected or not

1271376
versioning	staging
a staging versioning of our web application redeployed 5-8 time per day

1271376
spaces	output
i ve noticed that the survivor spaces are next to inexisting and the garbage collector output is similar to

1271386
contains	elements
the variables that contains the named of the file that is opened to is not which is the first elements of argv

1271402
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
it should therefore be possible to do what you want by implements the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods in your controllers

1271402
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
your viewcontroller will get the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages in that case - by maintaining state and receiving those messages you can then implements logic to decide whether or not you need to play the movie

1271404
liferay	jboss
i assume liferay is using jboss or tomcat in this case

1271438
ruby	php
i ve found tools for ruby and php that will take a css file and some separate markup as input and return you the merged result - a single file of markup with all the css converted to styles attributes

1271444
hardware	monitor
if you re monitor the status of .some external hardware and only need to checked it periodically it s better to open and close it every time you access it .so other programs can al.so access it if necessary

1271456
inlining	inline
to summarize there are few scenarios where you should attempt to take manual control of inlining by placing or omitting inline statements

1271486
callback	methods
add a callback to your custom animation methods call this callback if supplied in the callback code for the animation to allow you to append some stuff to do after the animation is complete

1271490
jquery	.post
i tried using .post and got the same behavior though i haven t checked the jquery code i assume .post is a wrapper around .ajax

1271500
contains	elements
what you could do is to measure the size of an elements that contains text and from that decuce what fonts might be used to rendering the text

1271508
constructor	object
...so that the javascript object i m creating follow a similar inheriteded pattern to standards oop and therefore b would inherited a s constructor and methods

1271513
graphviz	doxygen
i ve just tried doxygen and graphviz but the results are

1271516
google-chrome	opera
if i remember correctly in google-chrome and opera simply calling

1271529
base-class	inherited
considering the following mapping file where temporaryaccessopencmd and temporaryaccessclosecmd both inherited from base-class cmd

1271570
value	field
would it be a better idea to perform the arithmetic in the application and updates the points database field with the resulting value or have the database do the math

1271580
compatibility	platform
but you need to watch for platform compatibility - windows os.pathsep is different than unix

1271607
google-chrome	firefox
it looks difirefoxerent in all 3 browsers that i use google-chrome ie and firefox

1271607
margins	padding
i have been trying to add a separate stylesheet for ie and removed the padding margins again but that didn t work

1271613
primitive	int
it s different from java s primitive types int which is not a class

1271618
arrays	map
arrays - then i thought may be use arrays and their indexes map to strings

1271646
geocoding	geocode
you can try a very ugly hack which consists in geocoding your full adresse and all subset of the words your adress contains you get a lot of geocode that you use to get the adresses related to them with reverse geocoding tool

1271663
difference	zero	any	set
the obvious difference is that the second example uses an assignment but i ve set assignment inline wrapping to use default indentation and i ve set that default indentation to zero .so i don t see any rea.son why it should be misbehaving

1271667
configuration	installation
i am installing sql-server 2008 developer here and on the server configuration step of the installation it asks me about service-accounts

1271668
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
see you cannot view or change the readonly or the systemd attributes of folder in windows-server 2003 in windows-xp or in windows-vista

1271668
attributes	properties
the readonly and systemd attributes is only used by windows-explorer to determine whether the folder is a special folder such as a systemd folder that has its view customized by windows for example my document favorites fonts downloading program files or a folder that you customized by using the customize tab of the folder s properties dialog box

1271674
margins	padding
every browser has their own set of default for margins padding spacing etc

1271700
hard-drive	hdd
since in-memory ops are mostly trivial anyways given a hard-drive based database an updates can change a database field in-place on the hdd while a delete would remove a row leaving an empty spaces and insert a new row perhaps to the end of the table again it s all in the implementation

1271702
hide	show
the basic idea is that you show the containers elements .when you hover over the triggers then .when you leave the containers you hide the containers

1271712
sql-server	oracle
you could create a dblink from oracle to sql-server and connect using odbc and then populate the data as for time date-format mismatches you can always format them using to_char function

1271722
arguments	default
error c2440 default arguments cannot convert from const char 1 to wxstring

1271746
mouseover	mouseout
why have mouseover mouseout on the

1271754
margins	padding
the problem might be the way different browsers create lists either with padding or margins on list items

1271774
attributes	properties
from your question it s not clear whether you fully understand the pack properties of the structlayout attributes

1271798
.when	ready
i ve done many applications using java comm and have had no problems with available returning 0 .when there are bytes ready to be read in

1271798
baud-rate	parity
you may want to make sure that your baud-rate parity flowcontrol etc are all set correctly

1271801
arguments	default
default arguments promotions are

1271801
arguments	default
.so for your float arguments default arguments promotions are performed

1271801
arguments	default
are called the default arguments

1271804
arguments	default
it allows you to create a temporary of types wxstring that is used as a default arguments for csend constructor but it can t be bound to non-const reference - only to const

1271806
versioning	migrate
in fact these tests will allow me to migrate to the next versioning of the technology since they will ring an alarm .when one of the assumptions i ve been using has changed

1271806
versioning	upgrade
otherwise i d have to stay with the current versioning or be very careful with any upgrade since i couldn t be sure what it would break

1271817
droppable	draggable
i can drag my draggable items and drop them on my droppable and get the drop positioning from

1271819
version-control	cvs
svn cvs and other version-control systemd try to resolve conflicts automatically and .when cannot will just tell user there is a conflict

1271819
children	nodes
.when there are disconnect updates to a shared object from two different users two separate children versioninging leaf nodes result from the same parent versioning

1271825
while-loop	cursor
i could do this with a cursor or while-loop but if someone could suggest how to do this without iterator that would be great - thanks

1271848
treeview	listview
how to display treeview inside a listview actually this listview has headers namely workbook description date .so .when i display the treeview inside the listview the treeview should open as per the listview headers

1271848
treeview	listview
how to insert treeview inside listview and my xaml code is

1271854
sql-server	oracle
this works for oracle and sql-server you might be able to get it to work on another rdbms

1271880
logout	login
the login process works but the logout is garbled

1271906
jquery	.post
i don t really use jquery but my guess is that the .post and click events aren t around anymore since it s been updates via ajax

1271907
binary-tree	nodes
say i have a binary-tree with the following definition for a nodes

1271907
unique	words
the actual problem where i required this is count numbers of occurrences of unique words in a file and display the result in decreasing order of frequency.

1271916
animation	rotation
the console messages regarding two-stage rotation animation suggests that something within the framework the more navigation controllers

1271919
swing	awt
try swing or awt

1271926
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you re using mod_php you could put either in a .htaccess in users or in your httpd.conf for the users directory

1271957
authentication	login
i know that what i m about to suggest will result in duplicates code and add to maintenance down the road but .when you balance that against short-circuiting the authentication mechanism or tampering with a well-known and trustworthy mechanism to weaken it .so as to allow another application to use a back doors which is what you re really talking about doing here - creating a back doors for this other application but attempting to use query-string parameters as part of the login mechanism it is really the lesser of two evils to have more code and more to maintain

1272001
exception-handling	try-catch
on the client end use try-catch blocks to catch all exception-handling faults

1272005
.net	wcf	asp.net-mvc	wcf
all the newer .net technologies make extensive use of attributes such as linq-to-sql asp.net-mvc wcf enterprise libs etc and i was wondering what effect this would have on performance

1272027
environment	execution
i say less than ideal because this is what i expected the contents of the .gemrc to do for me automatically for all ruby execution under my users environment

1272038
contains	elements
my code for generator the arrays contains the elements is along the line of

1272038
children	nodes
any way to convert the children list to xmllistcollection sort it and integrated it back into the nodes variables

1272045
contains	set
the where-clause contains the criterion which filtering my result set

1272047
dictionary	map
map bst are good if you need to have sorted output for your dictionary

1272047
arrays	map	contains	sorted
updates simply consider that a map could generator more memory caching misses than a sorted arrays as an arrays get its data contiguous in memory and as each nodes in a map contains 2 pointers to other nodess in the map

1272050
loading	gif
any listener would be triggers automatically whenever an xmlhttprequest call is about to be made ideal for disabling your widget or showing a loading gif etc e.g

1272076
order	add
i d like to write a selenium test to assert that .when the user presses add order my additional data gets added to #table .data order

1272079
reflection	runtime
however if you use reflection to inspect attributes at runtime it can be expensive

1272089
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you re open to this i would checkout entity-framework linq-to-sql nhibernate etc

1272105
default-value	dbnull
in windows forms .net 2.0 visual-studio 2005 sp1 i have a typesd dataset with a column which types is system.boolean which is nullable and which default-value is dbnull

1272120
nvidia	ati
the question is ati and nvidia have different conventions for these error messages and the only way i ve found to decide what types of error the shader had is to parsing the error string generator by glgetshaderinfolog

1272120
nvidia	ati
given that is there a listing somewhere or does anyone know what the error output for both ati and nvidia cards looks like

1272133
document	editing
the application is basically a huge words document with people editing their own versioning all at the same time

1272191
exception-handling	try-catch
one idea would be to wrap the whole process in the try-catch .so the if an exception-handling is throw the context gets dispose thus object is no longer in the context. .something like

1272198
32-bit	64bit
if you re on 64bit windows or you re happy to run 32-bit windows with the 3gb switching then you can configure visual-studio to be largeaddressaware which rather than 2gb will give it 4gb or 3gb on 3gb of address spaces to play with

1272245
order	join
one issue with having the order s clustered index like it is that it encourages the qo to use a scan and hash join .when joining many order and order line together an unfortunately all too common occurrence even if i only use 5 of the data in the end

1272245
order	join
there are too many rows selected to loop-seek into the order line table although forcing this does sometimes help and making the organization the first part of the order key prevents a merge join from working without a sort

1272269
hide	show
just use a jquery show hide for your content

1272304
click	mouse
this will make the contextmenu open where you right click your mouse on the button

1272307
postback	ajax
this methods would required an ajax postback on each menu click

1272317
sharp-architecture	nhibernate
sharp-architecture src sharparch sharparch.data nhibernate

1272324
json	xml
in many ways i could extends this to an api json or xml and oembed handling

1272330
updating	updates
in the end i d suggest just updating a recording if you mean to updates it

1272331
worksheet	excel
i need to combine rows from two excel worksheet into one long row based on an id column in each of the worksheet

1272342
exception-handling	error-handling
while searching .so for approaches to error-handling related to business rules validation all i encounter are examples of structured exception-handling

1272343
attributes	properties
unfortunately this attributes can only be applied to a field or properties and not a class

1272343
attributes	properties
if you can expose your collections as a properties of a class you can use the attributes as follows

1272354
any	set
once you have attached to the process for debugging you can just open a web browser and use the address for the virtual directory that you setup and visual-studio will stop at any breakpoints that you have set in the code

1272357
32-bit	64bit
is it possible to compile a project in 32-bit with cmake and gcc on a 64bit systemd

1272359
concatenation	comma
if you always expect the same numbers of columns and only the first column can contains comma just read anything and concatenation excess columns at the beginning

1272363
updatepanel	gridview
i put the gridview in an updatepanel and the callback is fireing on the client but the data in the grid never gets updates

1272382
32-bit	64bit
because 32-bit apis are used to store pointers to things using data types like dwords it was necessary to create new types for 64bit compatibility that acted like a dword in 32-bit but were extended to 64bit .when used in a 64bit .app

1272382
32-bit	64bit
.so for example application developers who want to write code that works as 32-bit or 64bit the windows 32-bit api setwindowlong hwnd int long was changed to setwindowlongptr hwnd int long_ptr

1272382
32-bit	64bit
.when performing pointer-arithmetic these types should also be used in 32-bit code that needs to be compatible with 64bit

1272383
base-class	inherited
instead of inheriteding from system.web.ui.page in each of your pages inherited from your new base-class

1272391
repository	entity
would it be best to have the repository entity be an object with three arrays of content that varies

1272451
response	timeout
if you need to know faster you must send a small test messages to the server and handle the timeout no response within a few seconds yourself probably in a different thread

1272464
contains	set
if no column or set of columns matches this requirement an column contains a unique id is often added as a primary key

1272478
increment	is-empty
.when the vector is-empty have the reader block on the semaphore until a writer puts something in the vector and increment the semaphore

1272492
tapestry	wicket
i ve used both wicket and tapestry to building web-applications in scala

1272492
scala	java
of course there are some things to keep in mind .when using a java web framework with scala

1272497
swing	swt
the critical parts to master are in my opinion the list tree-models and the general data-binding mechanisms and to find learn and stick to a layout manager that works miglayout is superb and has backends for swing and swt

1272514
exception-handling	try-catch
the only way that i can of handling this is to have a nested try-catch inside of the main try-catch to try to move the file that way if the move fails another exception-handling is throw

1272526
export	csv
i have a need to export the contents in a componentart grid into a file preferably excel in csv format

1272526
contains	any
.so .when the grid is exported i would like the file to contains what is in the grid at the moment of export including any templates changes that may be visible if possible

1272562
versioning	upgrade
for some reason everyone who upgrade their flash player to the latest versioning 10 0 32 18 immediately start having problems with my application

1272572
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
for php i would recommend yii cakephp or codeigniter .

1272574
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

1272575
base-class	inherited
all classes that inherited from the base-class will also be marked as serialization

1272577
string.format	stringbuilder
did you know that string.format creates a new stringbuilder behind the scenes and call it s appendformat methods

1272591
digits	base
don t assume that the codes are cryptography they can be encode in different base like base64 or rot13 for example or be computed with some sort of checked digits algorithm for example luhn isbn verhoeff etc

1272645
getter	setter
in many other languages python delphi groovy the compiler will generator the getter and setter for you unless you supply the code

1272665
noscript	anchor
for example i have an extension that will add a button that will work with either javascript enabled rendering as an anchor or disabled rendering a button inside a noscript tag

1272666
instances	self
the other solution is to reset the user.account instances to self .when updating user attributes

1272672
versioning	migrate
then i simply created and migrate the database execute .warbler and deployed the .war to my local tomcat versioning 6.0.23

1272675
python	perl
i guess i could write a small perl python whatever scripting to open the file seek to the offset then read and write the required amount of data in chunks

1272688
upgrade	staging
after the development is done and the basic functionality is tested we run the development code with an upgrade production database on the staging server

1272691
ruby-on-rails	grails
in terms of development speed i would say that there is not much to choose between ruby-on-rails and grails as both allow similarly rapid development

1272691
groovy	java
groovy could also be regarded as a framework on top of java stretching a points as you can freely call any java code from groovy

1272691
python	java
would you also discount this because it s based on python rather than java

1272691
groovy	java	python	java
if you insist on sticking to java + java language frameworks such as available from springsource then you lose a lot of the agility that python and groovy provide though spring has nice frameworks too if you want to go down that route

1272695
constructor	object
if i were to pass no arguments to the myclass constructor it would result in an equivalent object being created to the versioning with the initializer list

1272701
subclassing	superclass
however .when retrieving an instances of containerclass via hibernate.isession.get it always returns me an instances of superclass even .when the item in question should be an instances of subclassing

1272707
value	field
it is a way to initializer some field of your object all of them if you want with value of your choice instead of leaving them as undefined

1272707
value	field
inside it you could do more assignments but once you have entered it all the field have already been initializer - either to random unspecified value or to the ones you chose in your initialization list

1272711
decimal	hex
convert hex to decimal .when no datatype can hold the full numbers

1272737
csv	xml
my test data doesn t map well to xml or csv .so using the data.sourceattribute is not a viable option

1272758
32-bit	64bit
.so basically you create a 64bit register using two 32-bit int

1272764
constructor	object
now if you assign a value to them in the body of the constructor you are calling the copy assignment-operator which may mean releasing and reacquiring resources memory if the object has any

1272764
constructor	object
in the case of object that have a constructor it is a performance optimization because it avoids going through two object initializations instead of one

1272767
python	perl
use any other scripting-language perl python whatever then create a single connection and pound away on the request as quickly as possible

1272772
value	field
any business rules that must always be applied to all data in the table should always be applied in the database through a datatype such as a datatime datatype which willnot accept 02 31 2009 as a valid date a constraint say one that does not allow the field to have a value greater than 100 or through a triggers is the logic is .so complex it cannot be handled by an ordinary constraint

1272792
png	gif	bmp	png	bmp	gif
the image-formats considered are bmp jpeg png and gif

1272800
hash	md5	duplicates	contains
assuming that dictionary is a dictionaryionary that contains the filename as the key and the md5 hash as the value you could use the following code to display duplicates files

1272820
any	set
there doesn t seem to be any way to set the address of the hyperlink based on a formula though

1272834
web-config	app-config
if you considered scalability and are 100 positive that it s only going to be a max of 20 value and the nature of the value is such that you could store in an xml file you should explore storing them in the app-config or web-config of your application

1272863
google-maps	openlayers
why would i use openlayers instead of google-maps

1272863
arcgis-server	mapserver
google yahoo microsoft wms arcgis-server mapserver etc

1272875
combinations	permutation
since order does not matter these are actually combinations and not permutation

1272896
.net	wcf
just as a quick clarification is your wcf service returning the .net 3 3.5 points class whilst the sl is attempting to use the sl points class

1272902
combinations	permutation
what you re asking for are combinations not permutation the latter term implies that order matters

1272912
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i tried to put it in viewdidload and viewwillappear but those didn t work unless i assign the view of the root view controllers to the view of the navigation controllers used in the modal which then caused other issues.

1272923
contains	elements
dl0005 the component elements contains an unexpected child elements website

1272923
contains	elements
dl0005 the component elements contains an unexpected child elements webvirtuald

1272925
attributes	properties
alternatively you may be able to hack together a solution with reflection and attributes where the value of the properties in one object are copy-paste over to the matching and marked properties in the other

1272927
getter	setter
i don t believe there s a language ready solution for this all the properties would need to have getter and setter

1272928
decimal-point	digits
assuming that the numbers is just a fixed-point fixed width numbers with 1 digits left and 5 digitss right of the decimal-point try decimal.parse 268179 100000d .round 2

1272934
implements	extends
the simplest to implements is just to extends the checkbox class

1272945
python	ruby	python	java	erlang	python
it also has libs available in many languages python java erlang ruby etc

1272947
internet-explorer	firefox
i have gotten it to work fine with firefox but in internet-explorer it simply opens a new windows

1272948
firefox	safari
i have tested my website on safari and firefox on both pc and mac and the links work fine

1272948
internet-explorer	opera
however my links show up as just plain text on internet-explorer and opera

1272951
response	timeout
the communication is simply that the java code writes a line for a request and the server then writes a line in response but .sometimes it seems that the server doesn t respond .so i ve implements an executorservice based timeout which tries to drop and restart the connection

1272956
put	get
to consume an ado.net data service all that is needed is the ability to make http request using the get .post put and delete verbs and to set the accept header

1272956
put	get
not all programming environment offer these silverlight 2 and j2me can only do get and .post not put and delete

1272968
malloc	free
calling free on a pointers that wasnt allocated by malloc or its brethren is undefined

1272987
versioning	upgrade
this assumes that intermediate building are free upgrade and major versioning changes are paid

1272999
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so after a few weeks i have got my head around asp.net-mvc and have converted two webforms sites over

1273005
splash-screen	about-box
.so our splash-screen and about-box display the program versioning as 2009 2009a etc

1273024
firefox	safari
your links are all held within a table missing its starting tag but tables are not supported in all document types and perhaps firefox and safari are guessing better

1273040
player	movie
specifies the base directory or url used to resolve all relative-path statements in the flash player movie

1273040
player	movie
this attributes is helpful .when your flash player movie are kept in a different directory from your other files

1273044
shell	bash
i am new to bash shell programming .so there is probably a better way to do this

1273069
constructor	object
there s no parameterless constructor for system.string .so it can t be created using activator.createinstance which is what is usually used to dynamically create object

1273076
bufferedreader	writer
closing the bufferedreader writer that wrap the socket will close the socket

1273090
web-services	api
i did have a situation like this once where the web-services in question were the salesforce.com api

1273092
webserver	upload
i m trying to write an adobe air application that compresses multiple-files into one archive and then upload that archive to a webserver

1273092
compression	streaming
i m looking for an example of doing streaming file compression in air such that i can manage the amount of memory my .app uses at any given time

1273096
32-bit	64bit
.so on a 32-bit systemd the object would take 8 bytes on a 64bit systemd it would take 16 bytes

1273105
circular-buffer	queue
the best fit seems to be a circular-buffer if you can find one that supports the operations necessary for std queue i think that s push_back pop_front and size but i haven t checked

1273113
version-control	cvs
he s not new to version-control having used cvs svn and clearcase before

1273116
xlsx	xls	xlsx	xlsm	xlsm	xls
is there another way that i can read an excel file xls xlsx xlsm on a server no user-interface in such a way that doesn t suffer the same sort of threading security license issues imposed within the excel api

1273120
button	popup
to dismiss the keyboard u need to have a button popup whenever the user starts ediing and have them press it to dismiss the keyboard

1273123
tree-balancing	tree
this may not be enough as all it will mean is that higher-frequency words will be near the top of the tree not necessarily order in any fashion but if you do happen to have or find or make a tree-balancing algorithm it may run a lot faster on such a splay tree

1273125
http	ssl	udp	tcp	ip-address	proxy
ncat has a hosts of new features such as connection brokering tcp udp redirection socks4 client and server supprt ability to chaining ncat process http connect proxy and proxy chaininging ssl connect listen support ip-address connection filtering plus much more.

1273137
handler	service
i am querying a 3rd party web service and not all the data seems to be making it to the event handler

1273141
directory	folder
you can programmatically checked to see if an updates has just been downloading using applicationdeployment.currentdeployment.isfirstrun and then write your own migration code to move the appropriate folder from .pre into the parent directory

1273141
directory	folder
a different answer and the one we ve used is to bypass the clickonce datadirectory completely and set your own folder up in the user s application data directory remembering to use the .net alias for that folder

1273141
directory	folder
the folder follow a user that is using roaming profiling our experience has been that in a roaming .profile situation the clickonce directory are not configure to roam

1273149
put	get
java s hashmap has the put and get methods for setting getting items

1273162
servicehost	wcf-rest
using the wcf-rest starter kit one can intercept a request to a wcf service using a new servicehost that exposes a properties called interceptor which lets you intercept request and response

1273176
height	frame
if you want the field to change height like in apple s sms application you re going to have to mess around with watching changes in the field s frame and adjust your background view appropriately.

1273179
constructor	object
in particular if any of your member variables are constants references or object without default constructor then method1 is the only way you can initializer them

1273179
constructor	object
another small difference of methods 1 is that if any of your member variables are object using methodss 2 or 3 they will be construct with their default constructor first and then modified or assign to int he constructor code while with methods 1 you can create them with a constructor other than the default in the first place

1273217
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

1273257
put	get
either put them in the same translation unit or use a function to get log

1273259
arrays	loops
1 use a loops and run through the arrays of fb_uid and find the username one by one

1273285
directory	folder	chown	chmod
.so i used chmod and chown to make the project directory static document folder writable to apache

1273285
chown	chmod
i m not too familiar with this distro it s the flavor of red hat we re given .so i ve never had to go beyond chmod and or chown to fix a permissions problem

1273296
sniffing	packets
i am using packets sniffing for my application but i only need to packets sniff one application .so i d like to know to what ip addresses that application is connect

1273298
webserver	security
what i found was we didn t have to set up the smtp server at all - simply setting up smtp email was enough - with the additional benefit of not having the security concerns of smtp relaying thru the webserver

1273316
required	checked
i checked the attendee page for that session login required but no code is posted

1273343
unix-domain-sockets	netstat
if you are on linux you can say netstat -nap which will list open network and unix-domain-sockets

1273351
implements	abstract
since set s - is abstract you don t know how it might be implementss and a sortedset is free to implements it in a way which returns a non-sorted set

1273353
arguments	undefined
jquery s extends function can do what i think you re aiming for with undefined albeit with a slightly different syntax and without mutating the passed arguments

1273376
rollback	commit
you cannot use it to target a specific tranasction either for commit or rollback

1273385
base-class	inherited
one very common mistake with class hierarchies is to specify a methods in a base-class as being virtual inorder for all overrides in the inherited chaining to do some work and forgetting to propagate the call on to base implementation

1273385
protected	public
this required to use a public non-virtual-method as interface for the clients and making the virtual-method protected which is actually a good thing to do but it required the use of a member variables specifically for this purpose which needs to be mutable if the virtual-method must be const

1273407
javascript	dom
every include solution for javascript that i ve found does it by loading into a tag which is not an option for worker since they don t have access to the dom

1273426
derived-class	base-class
or if failing to propagate causes the derived-class to fail let it fail with an exception-handling messages that informs the author of the derived-class that he failed to use the base-class correctly

1273433
webforms	asp.net	checkbox	listbox	checkbox	textbox	listbox	textbox
i have an asp.net webforms with a numbers of dropdownlistfor multi-select enabled listbox checkbox and textbox

1273437
contains	set
i have an entity set that has entities with a compound key contains id guid and createdat datetime

1273478
while-loop	for-loop
yes you should use a for-loop but since you already commented on that i left the while-loop alone with the assumption that there s more code you didn t show us

1273479
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i m using the sphinx search-engine with the thinking-sphinx plugins for ruby-on-rails

1273479
ruby-on-rails	django
job.search ruby-on-rails django symfony

1273479
ruby-on-rails	django
...and get an arrays of job object with the following title ruby-on-rails developer for hire looking for a django wizard anyone know symfony

1273484
decimal	hex
i have some large hex value that i want to display as regular numbers i was using hexdec to convert to float and i found a function on php.net to convert that to decimal but it seems to hit a ceiling

1273492
derived-class	base-class
derived-classes would register some function or member function with the base-class while in the derived-class constructor

1273492
derived-class	inherited
this scale to many levels of inherited each derived-class only has to be concerned with its own function

1273498
callback	methods
one way out is to not use virtual methods at all but instead to allow the user to register callback and call those before doing the work of prepareforinsertion

1273511
fflush	gets
if this is critical data however you should call fflush after each write to make sure it gets to disk

1273570
grouping	sorting
in report design-view open sorting and grouping from menu or toolbar

1273575
key-value	key
with this you can create a caching of key-value pair where the key is the userid and the value is an object contains the information you would like to store

1273580
put	get
if you put styles in app.xmal then you can get the styles with the code like

1273593
wicket	spring
the di part of spring is great and is something you can easily use together with wicket

1273609
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
it is actually less expensive to use mouseenter mouseleave because they do not fire for the menu .when children mouseover mouseout fire

1273612
base-class	inherited
if you have more than one level of inherited and want each class to call its base-class then you can still use the template-method-pattern but with a twisted make the return-value of the virtual function only constructable by base .so derived will be forced to call the base implementation inorder to return a value enforced at compile-time

1273612
instances	private
remember_to_call_base has an explicit-constructor declare private .so only its friend in this case base can create a new instances of this class

1273618
compression	streaming
you wouldn t get any compression but could then modify fzip to streaming from the file source without preload the entire file for compression

1273621
background-image	height
i also thought about simply making all the cell the same height and turning off clipstobounds on the background-image except the background-image is a stretchable image both horizontally and vertically and needs to be able to resize based on the height of the contents of the cell

1273626
updating	updates
the basic measurement methodology is to turn off all background updating particularly mail s automatic mail downloading and calendar updates reset the transfer statistics in settings general usage and then launchd your application

1273679
latex	tex
is it possible to create a document for an ebook-reader in the epub-format with latex tex

1273682
directory	folder
create the remote directory or folder

1273684
hide	show
it s not stack it side but side but the short cut of ctrl-r lets you show hide the results windows very quickly and not bother moving the vertical divider

1273688
pixels	line
if i simple repaint a single line rectangle then i end up with spotting on the corners because the curve don t quite abut and or because aa affects surrounding pixels

1273702
twitter	gmail
i can be reached on twitter via or email via rory nothinggoeshere becker gmail . com

1273705
tapestry	wicket
wicket s goal is to support static-typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines-of-code

1273705
tapestry	wicket
.so with tapestry your codebase is likely smaller which is good for maintenance and with wicket you much is statically typed which makes it easier to navigate with an ide and checked with a compiler which al.so is good for maintenance

1273708
scp	ssh
i like to use scp secure copy .when the remote hosts supports ssh as .so many of them do

1273713
favicon	web
i was looking around the web at the way different sites put their favicon into the site

1273739
any	set
i am unable to triggers any breakpoints i set though making it harder to find where the problem originates

1273759
any	set
it only has to work on a single pc that i can set up with any options and plugins needed

1273760
sql-server-express	sql-server
take the database and attach it to sql-server or sql-server-express on your server

1273766
button	popup
i want to read from a table and .when the user click a button a messagebox popup with the value in the applicationname column

1273791
32-bit	16-bit
you may get a different answer if you left off the ul suffix say if your systemd had 16-bit int and 32-bit longs

1273815
duplicates	elements
alas setmember1d as it exists in numpy is broken .when either arrays has duplicates elements as a does here

1273830
expression	evaluation
# expression evaluation works just like in double-quoted strings even if you use q as your delimiter

1273833
.net	wcf
my boss has asked me for the possibility to â œalsoâ send the results generator by â eâ and â dâ to a .net web service platform using wcf without modifying â eâ and â dâ

1273837
version-control	git
it could be combined with git version-control for better integration

1273856
any	set
how can i calculate the average of a set of data while smooth over any points that are outside the norm

1273862
display	height
i m trying to use jquery to grab the height of each image and display it after the image

1273862
display	height
my logic behind the jquery is that i want to go through each thumb selector assign the height of the img inside thumb to the variables imagewidth and then display the height in text after each thumb

1273863
stderr	stdout
i ve been learning qt on windows for a little while background in unix embedded and would like to have stderr stdout dumped out somewhere unit test event logging debugging from my win32 qt gui .app

1273894
nsarray	plist
you can use nspropertylistseralization since nsarray is a types of plist

1273902
perl	php
perl or even command-line php

1273919
ftp	scp	udp	tcp
and my conclusion is pretty similar to yours the only currently available methods are using the .net ftp .net-ssh .net scp being the easiest solution and the standards tcp udp protocols

1273919
udp	tcp
the problem with the latter tcp udp is that you have to write custom code to splice and dice the binary file and package it in such a way you can send it as a packets and on the receiving end you have to authentication it validation it and unpack the damn packets

1273922
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i know how to do it with a normals uiviewcontroller as the root vc but not sure with a uitabbarcontroller

1273929
selected	checkbox
right ctrl click on the grouping you want to copy and selected reveal in finder. selected the files you want to import into the new project and then just drag and drop into the new xcode-project being sure to selected the copy these files checkbox that popup

1273931
contains	any
configuration files that contains passwd or any other sensitive information

1273936
interpreter	runtime
you re telling the interpreter to create a new runtime arrays

1273936
constructor	object
you re telling the interpreter i want to call the constructor arrays and generator an object

1273941
observers	listener
each one has his own listener which on a change event notify the observers the other one with the new value in parameter

1273943
javadoc	doxygen
anything generator by the building including code documentations doxygen javadoc pydoc etc.

1273963
environment	building
updates .net 3.5 environment w sql 2005 .so things like dynamic-linq possible although i always tend to think of dynamic building on fly queries of any kind as kind of clunky

1273969
click	mouse
i m getting mouse click on the map surface on markers etc

1273984
development-environment	build-process
like corey d has said anything that is generator specifically anything that is generator by the build-process and development-environment are good candidates

1273984
binaries	install
binaries and install

1274004
ref	out
you shouldn t pass an instances as ref parameter .when the methods awaits an out paramter which upon calling should be an unassigned reference preceded by the out keyword

1274008
temporary	copy
if you change the column display order in ssms what it ll do in the background is renamed the old table to a temporary named create the new table with the columns in the order you specified and then copy around the data

1274020
input-field	selected
i believe that doing something similar for input-field won t be difficult what i find most challenging is the regex for the selected and option field

1274022
instances	private
i m using qt and c++ i need to find out the amount of memory used by instances of certain qt classes this is usually done using sizeof however in qt each class holds a pointers to an another class contains the actual implementation the definition of this private implementation class is not found in headers but only in the source-code

1274029
selected	checkbox
ok .so if i add an actionlistener to a gui elements and it s the only elements i use that actionlistener with does it matter which of the following line a b i use to get the checkbox selected state

1274033
spaces	output
since the crash occurs in an inject dll beeing inject into the memory spaces of a 3rd party software s memory spaces i cannot use the visual-studio debugger but i can get some output to the console using iter-process communication i m using a mailbox

1274036
logging	trace
i ve been utilizing backtrace and backtrace_symbols to generator programmatic stack trace for the purposes of logging diagnosis

1274037
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
your sin and cos functions expect arguments in radians

1274038
execution	jobs
by the time you enter actual_foo the boost-bind and boost function-object have finished their jobs and you are execution the real function actual_foo

1274052
transient	entity
if the entity is not saved transient it won t find an entitykey in the internal dictionary

1274052
transient	entity
by reading it it looks like this function looks it the entity is transient or not and call the good function i guess entityistransient triggers save behavior entityispersitent triggers updates behavior

1274074
double-quotes	single-quotes
attributes can have double-quotes single-quotes or even nothing arround their value

1274117
ref	out
now f# has a magic cast associated with a ref types that lets you pass an instances of that types to a foreign function that expects a byref arguments both ref and out in c# map to byref in il

1274138
value	field
i m writing a couple of value into hidden field of another form

1274138
value	field
if i write some value into those field outside the live click

1274138
value	field
but i need to write the value into the hidden field out of the live

1274138
value	field
click function i m insert value from field of my form into

1274143
internet-explorer	firefox
how can you display a video mpeg or avi with controls play stop fullscreen in both internet-explorer 7 and up and firefox 3.0 and up

1274145
xsl-fo	xslt
if for some reason you like xslt then you could use xsl-fo but i think it s painful

1274158
traversal	parent
you might want to see how you can add a class to the elements or at least find the parent elements first and traversal from there

1274186
any	set
it s set around six time throughout the class once per function that needs it - is there any way to set it once and then allow all the functions to access it

1274193
value	field
the main problem with your code that i see is that your field both the radio and the input are being built with only an id value as the first parameter

1274199
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
i couldn t get the maven-jar-plugin to work i had to use the maven-assembly-plugin

1274225
lighttpd	apache
i m using lighttpd + fastcgi not apache + mod_php

1274226
development-environment	continuous-integration
continuous-integration is extremely helpful .when you have to integrated changes into a codebase from more than one development-environment and it s pretty tough to automate building .when you re tied to a gui

1274226
myeclipse	ant
afaikt there is no ootb feature that can generator an ant scripting or equivalent headless-build scripting from myeclipse nor is there an exposed way to invoke myeclipse builder from a build-scripting platform

1274226
myeclipse	maven
from my initial research it looks like maven myeclipse integration is even worse

1274281
ruby-on-rails	django
last option that you didn t mention is django which is mostly like python versioning of ruby-on-rails yep i m gonna burn in hell for saying this

1274281
ruby-on-rails	django
both django and ruby-on-rails follow asp.net-mvc .so it s matter of taste

1274283
return-value	arguments
once you do it you can just use as a return-value with no need for out arguments

1274296
order	join
you could create a table called dates and selected from that table and join the order table

1274301
processor	affinity
std thread does not include support for priorities controlling the size of the thread stack controlling the scheduling policy or controlling the processor affinity

1274301
processor	affinity
processor affinity and stack size are really important for high-performance systemd

1274302
32-bit	64bit
its just worth noting that these _ptr types are just types that are 32-bit wide on a 32-bit .app and 64bit wide on a 64bit .app

1274308
ref	out
the guidelines say to try to avoid ref and out parameters if they are not absolutely required because they make the api harder to use no more chaining of methodss the developer has to declare all the variables before calling the methods

1274343
contains	any
now i want to checked whether any of the songs in an album contains a tag

1274350
any	set
i am noticing that .when this filtering is set in the web.xml any page that have the errorpage set is never used and the messages i receive is the default tomcat 500 messages without a stack-trace the server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request

1274361
hide	show
i then used javascript that would hide the submit button and show the decoy button in the onclientclick event

1274361
hide	show
finally the end of the server side methods would updates the css properties on the button to hide and show them afterwards

1274427
qapplication	qthread
you probably don t have a qapplication object created .when you are trying to call execute in the qthread

1274447
any	set
gitignore will prevent untrackinged files from being added without an add -f to the set of files trackinged by git however git will continue to tracking any files that are already being trackinged

1274451
checkbox	button
that state change is signaled to the itemlistener -- which is also defined on abstractbutton even though state changes are meaningless to other button types the javadoc even says checkbox

1274451
jcheckbox	jmenuitem
finally from a usability perspective there s a difference between controls that maintain state such as jcheckbox and jtextarea and those that initiate actions such as jbutton and jmenuitem

1274485
localization	translation
i ve tried cleaning the building copying the translation text back into the sounds.plist files and even nuking the files deleting the lproj folder removing the localization and starting over

1274497
macports	fink
this is likely because you have macports or maybe fink install which overrides the default pkg-config with its own

1274501
protected	public
and make any methods that you need to access from the child either public or protected

1274509
any	set
you can set the uisearchbar to any color you like using

1274514
vb.net	vb6
also in-house utility programs are written in c# vb6 vb.net

1274514
vbscript	vb6
to handle this problem i wrote a vb6 vbscript encryption routine which i converted to .net

1274514
salt	md5
both of which were considerably enhanced with multiple features such as the md5 is a salt versioning and the rc4 contains a crc checked and an option for double encrypting using multiple passkeys

1274517
directory	folder
i already have it setup .so after every successful building an svn export is done from trunk into a directory within the project folder on the server

1274525
textarea	textbox
use the jquery way or pass the clientid of your textbox to your methods .so you can get the reference to the textarea via the asp.net generator elements id

1274527
contains	any
this appears to reset the configuration because i can execute the objectfactory.whatdoihave methods and it does not contains any of my configuration

1274529
debian	linux
.when i try to building this project with cmake and gcc on a 64bit linux debian machine i get an error from the linker

1274529
dlopen	dlsym
apparently dlopen dlclose dlerror and dlsym are references to libdl.so

1274562
value	field
in other words i need to be able to do random key lookup by id and modify the data actually only the floating-point outcome field - .so i ll never need to modify the size of the value

1274562
embedded-database	db4o
i ve thought about using an embedded-database but db4o is not an option as it is gpl and the rest of my code is not

1274572
contains	elements
i have an absolutely positioning div inside of which i have 3 elements 1 textinput 1 passwd and a button contains an image

1274572
margins	padding
i d like to vertically align all 3 elements in the middle of the div but after trying a numbers of different padding margins combinations couldn t find anything that looks presentable across browsers

1274575
value	field
.when you submit the form and the model bind the two un-editable field come back in the viewmodel as empty strings or as default datetime value depending on the types of properties

1274575
value	field
ok .so i guess i m not trying to ignore the field i m trying to make sure that i don t persistent null or empty string value

1274580
url-encoding	url
on url - url-encoding

1274583
selected	button
.when one is selected a dashed focus box appears around the button

1274617
autocad	cad
and from personal experience computer-aided design cad plugins addins are also c++ especially if you want to target multiple cad systemd e.e pro engineer soludworks catia ug autocad etc

1274624
order	add
if you use filtering predicates or order on the computed column and want to add an index on it see creating indexes on computed columns

1274635
environment	execution
note that in this case i had to exceed the actual allocated memory by a fair amount before i could provoke the program to die - just hello didn t crash although it certainly could depending on various aspects of the compiler and execution environment

1274648
sql-server	mysql
i think this will do it but i don t have a place to test it right now and i m used to sql-server rather than mysql

1274650
authentication	login
i ve written a provider that works as a layer between the asp.net authentication systemd and poco classes together with a repository and nhibernate that way i can let users login and get authentication the asp.net-mvc out-of-the-box-way yet have the users and roles as any other model-view-controller in my systemd

1274654
selected	button
the multiplechoicequestioncontroller would set up a question and 3-4 button for the user to selected an answer

1274668
tuples	set
the preparation of the set is a small one-time cost wich saves doing tuples unpack and repacking or tuples indexing a lot of time

1274676
substitution	replace
if the files are big enough for that to be unfeasible what you need to do is read the file in chunkss if the pattern you want to replace won t span multiple line then one chunks usually means one line - you can use file.foreach to read a file line by line and for each chunks perform the substitution on it and append it to a temporary file

1274680
uiscrollview	subviews
i have a uiscrollview with a single subviews a uiview backed by a catiledlayer

this only happens in quirks-mode .so fix your doctype

1274986
aquamacs	emacs
just as a backup i plan to also include the code that makes .m files always open in obj-mode using auto-mode-alist since my matlab days are far behind me - but hopefully this magic-mode change can go into the official distribution of aquamacs at least if not emacs 23 itself the regexs probably should be beefed up a little more for that to happen

1275917
return-value	arguments
to checked readelf -s usr .lib .libc.a | grep dlsym should help. declare it as an external linked function with the same arguments and return-value that dlsym has and use it to wrap dlsym itself

1276022
oracle	mysql
that query won t work on oracle as limit is a proprietary extension to mysql you would have to go about paginator using oracle s rownum which can only take one arguments .so essentially you will have to rewrite your paginator queries to look like this

1276558
directory	folder
go inside your phpmyadmin directory inside xampp installation folder

1276560
put	get
put that encrypted string in a url parameter my advice is to base64_encode the data twice inorder to ensure you don t get bad characters in the url and then send it to them in an email

1276563
environment	building
just building a credible test environment for high performance systemdd tends to be a big job and such a systemd would required several such environment

subclassing	superclass
there is one superclass and 8 different subclassing

1276683
factors	matrix
basically you reduce the matrix to something smaller and easier to compute and sum those results up it involves some -1 factors which should be describe on the page i linked to

1276695
prepend	offset
or for both prepend and append keep an arrays with spare capacity on both sides wrapped in something like but more complex than a - and maintain the offset - you have an arrays of 100 and know that your zero is 50 and you ve used 20

1276695
decrement	increment
insert at zero is then simple changes the value at offset 49 decrement the main zero offset to 49 and increment the virtual length to 21

1276703

1276716
insertion-sort	timsort
e.g. timsort uses binary insertion-sort for arrays up to 64 elements

1276716
quicksort	mergesort
some divide-and-conquer algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort sort by recursively dividing the list into smaller sublists which are then sorted

1276739
truncated	isnumeric
al.so isnumeric will probably have to truncated iav.attribute_value to try and test if it is a numbers probably to the length of maximum int which is 2147483647 signed - .so to 10 characters long - hence the warning

1276753
duplicates	elements
.so the idea was to use an elements to specify the location of another elements that could have duplicates search results scattered all around the document

punctuation	comma
for the recording i don t just want to stripes periods and comma and other punctuation but also quotes brackets etc

1276768

database designs with mostly field like parameter types and parameter value that try to cover very generics situations are mostly considered to be bad designs

1276783
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails fast flash-to-bang django s more than just crud is include wicket s designer-friendly templating.... listed on to see if they match what you want

1276795
base-class	inherited
if you want to checked if it s or inherited from it you should traversal the inherited hierarchy and checked the above statement for each base-class

1276805
any	set
however i am not certain that this is the cause of the problem - and in any case i had set up the data.source under weblogic 10.3 .so that it has the same jndi named .so it should pick it up although i am nothing close to an expert on these matters .so i could be wrong

1276805
value	field
with the various .somestring field being replace with actual value by the building scripting which gets them from a deploy.properties file .so that we can specify either the live production database or the development database depending on whether we are compiling for development or production

1276805
jndi	jdbc
even that is entirely different to the original weblogic 8 .application since with the weblogic 8 .app we needed to set up a jdbc connection pool which had all the database details and then set up a separate jdbc datasource which referred to the jdbc connection pool but provided a jndi named that could be used to find the datasource within the java .application

1276839
long-integer	short
org.hibernate.id.identifiergenerationexception this id generator generator long-integer short or string

1276839
long-integer	short
it seems that as my sequences returns numbers hibenate considering it as bigdecimal while hibernate s sequece generator class considering value that are long-integer short and string only

1276840
folder	dir
to recurse down folder just pass the s switching to dir

1276846
configuration	environment
for each environment target simulator unit test... you create one configuration function that creates all needed object drivers and all threads giving threads their list of dependencies

1276853
sniffing	traffic
i understand i could always get extra content downloading by my .app from a website and install locally but in such situation i could not control who will be accessing my website and it is always possible to discover its url along with any unique identifier via traffic sniffing

1276867
long-integer	short
the sequences as per hibernate s error messages can be cast to long-integer short or string while your sequences returns a bigdecimal

this arraylist is guaranteed to contains only elements of this unknown

1277007
contains	any
you have the same problem as above the list on the right hand side can only contains object of class d whose type-parameter is c and you are trying to assign it to a list on the left hand side can contains object of class d whose type-parameter can be any object

1277025
contains	any
it doesn t contains any tag descriptions as it is for validation

1277033
ref	out
i can think of one though i would probably do it differently and that would be that you want to pass the field named to a methods as an out or ref parameter like this

1277048
design-time	designer
you could even make it a design-time expert which loads the images in the designer

1277067
getter	setter
now you have a private setter and a public getter

1277080
value	field
now i need to insert-into q selected value from p with last field getting named like table _named in table q

1277092
put	get
in fact to get really wacky you could have each row have the time that the user started activity a and the activity code and the time started activity b and the time stamp which as mentioned above gets put down again for the following row

1277092
show	next
you probably would have less need of knowing the user info as well since you d know that any row show both activity codes thus you can just query the average for all users on any given day and compare it to the next day unless you are trying to find out which users are having the problem as well

1277115
value	field
set the data items value portion of the pivot-table to be the max of your high field

environment	restart
turns out the delphi install or whatnot has added a platform bnb environment variables on operating systemd level removing that restart delphi and all is well

1277315
google-chrome	firefox
but i would tend to a paradigms as google-chrome and firefox show in their latest incarnations

1277319
put	get
either get it to put the code in the clipboard or you can add your custom methods to the managed object class as a category in a separate file where it will be safe from automated tampering

1277325
postback	ajax
just recently with heavier usage there have been errors whilst cannot connect to server in the middle of an postback or ajax call

1277371
iprincipal	iidentity
knowing that i decided to implements iidentity and iprincipal to store the encrypted passwd and be able to provide it .when performing webservice call

1277371
iprincipal	iidentity
is it correct to use membership and custom iidentity and iprincipal at the same time

1277376
authentication	login
you can get xauthcodex in view which will later call authentication and then login

1277376
authentication	login
you would have to write your own authentication backend though that will take this auth_code will checked against it and would return respective user for login function to work

1277388
carbon	cocoa
i ve read that there is no hope with the cocoa 64bit versioning but some report it works with the carbon versioning

for a set of rows with the same value for some field

1277477
aggregate	grouping
the grouping by aggregate the results based on the field you specified

1277570
jeditable	jquery
i m trying to assign different parameter value to different divs on which i have enabled the jquery plugins jeditable

1277572
value	field	getter	setter
i am not talking about more complex examples where the getter and setter actually do something special or there is only one get or set read write only rather than just returning setting a value of a private field

1277574
keyboard	hid
i ve done something similar for a usb barcode reader that presents as a hid keyboard

1277590
getter	setter
using getter and setter the object is always aware that a change has been made

1277592
getter	setter
you can t do that without getter and setter

1277595
xsd	xml
i have xml files that i read in at runtime is is possible to validation the xml against an xsd file at runtime

1277597
getter	setter
you may eventually need a more complex getter or setter but if it s a field changing it would break the api

1277600
header-files	makefile
is it possible to combine the different versioning of the .a and ..so files and header-files of the libs for different linux computers .so that the include and link files and directory of the libs are the same for all the computers and i don t have to specify different directory for different computer in the makefile of my c++ program

1277606
value	field
the idea is you should not accidentally unintentionally change the value of a class private field outside

1277612
xsd	xml
validation of xml with xsd

1277614
value	field
.when you create private field named and a simple public properties named that actually gets and sets the named field value

1277615
value	field
setting a value into a private field only changes that field but making them in properties you can handle another arguments for example you can call a methods after setting a value

1277618
getter	setter
i always use getter setter since they created this shortcut

1277629
command-prompt	cmd
according to the the following article command-prompt cmd

1277630
click	mouse
also you can make another trick - handle all mouse click or and focus events and if some another control is selected then your own is blurred of course if it was selected previously

1277639
carbon	cocoa
beyond this i guess the fix will be to request that the 3rd party sdk is edited to take carbon cocoa windows handles

1277646
redmine	trac
redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

1277659
panels	grid
long answer write a custom panels and overrides arrangeoverrides and measureoverrides to simulate grid behavior

function-pointers	virtual-functions
somewhat longer answer virtual-functions are implements using an additional indirection the programmer s general all-purpose cure usually implements as a table of function-pointers the so-called virtual function table often abbreviated vtable

1277721
exception-handling	error-handling
since the error strings are from an external application which i take to mean you don t have any control over them the best option would be to wrap the call to that external application .so you can encapsulate the error-handling the string evaluation and either throw exception-handling as appropriate or return .some .sort of error-code handled through an enum

1277725
richtextbox	picturebox
if you need the scrollability of the richtextbox you could place the picturebox on a panels

1277773
oracle	mysql
third oracle s versioning of sql is much differnt from mysql and the administration of oracle databases is much more complex

1277832
cryptography	openssl
i link against openssl for cryptography in my objective-c project

1277834
sql-server	mysql

1277850
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the linq-to-sql dbmx file and its associated classes are just pure c# business-objects and methods - there s nothing web- or winforms-specific about those - you can use those in winforms wpf webforms asp.net-mvc - you named it

1277865
contains	set
the table in question contains exactly 22 rows index set in orderid

1277874
upgrade	migrate
oh and lest i forget if you have to upgrade migrate or reinstall your server you ll need an external copy of that proc to re-add to master and you ll need to remember to do that

1277912
put	get
the simplest .approach is to create a system.threading.timer in your .app on .application_start and put it in .some static field .so it does not get collected

1277915
triggers	insert
while i also voted for creating a windows service to perform this function for you the simplest way i could think to do it would be to put a triggers on your users table that would create the xml file for you .when a user is insert

1277932
contains	any
sql searching al.so does not provide any form of ranking to the data .so any text contains the terms could end up near the top

1277944
swing	awt
first of all i d recommend you use jfilechooser from swing unless you are restrict to awt for some reason

1277957
binaries	objdump
objdump is probably the program you are looking for to dump the contents of binaries

1277962
xsd	xml
on the other hand the data being exchanged - being serialization into xml format by default - will always be concrete classes no interfaces which are infered from the wsdl xsd - again the client does not depend on the server s classes - only on their xmlserializer fingerprint .so to speak

1277995
webserver	upload
the best way to do this would be to upload the files to a directory on the webserver then just store the path to the file in the sql database

1278034
selected	button
i keep getting this button in the header i can click on the button to selected all rows

1278064

this is probably keeping the javascript from finding the div in the dom

1278067
any	set
as an added bonus you can structure the mypreferences class any way you like bringing the benefits of oo programming to the whole set of preferences

1278070
subclassing	abc
editing to add the benefit of checked against the mapping abc instead of against dictionary is that the same test will work for dictionary-like classes regardless of whether or not they subclassing dictionary .so it s more flexible just in case

1278086
csv	xml
i couldn t find an appropriate list in xml excel csv types format anywhere easily but i did find this wikipedia page with roughly the info i needed

1278087
tiff	png

1278194
base-class	inherited
they inherited from a base-class that adds a unique entity key and change tracker

1278206
put	get
using private functions you can effectively emulate the behavior of local functions limited scoping function-overloading etc. without having to put all the functions in the same m-file which can get very big for some applications

1278220
background-image	transparency
then i took that screenshot and made it semi transparency in photoshop and overlay my original background-image to find exactly where the textfield appeared on the background

1278243

asp.net-mvc	webforms
we me and my team have a asp.net-mvc application and we are integration a page or two that are webforms

1278258
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we are trying to reuse the master page from our asp.net-mvc part of the .app in the webforms part

1278258
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we have found a way of rendering an asp.net-mvc partials view in webformss which works great until we try and do a postback which is the reason for using a webforms

1278258
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so far the work-around is to move the header content to a partialsview then use an ajax call to call a page with just the partials view from the webforms and then using the partialsview directly on the asp.net-mvc views

1278261
contains	any
i don t expect these email to contains any significant amount of images company logo is all

with things the way they are you ll have to do some nasty splitting on comma-separated value in the other sources field

1278898
value	field
maybe i m missing something obvious been known to but why are you using a single field in your first table with a comma-delimited set of value rather than a simple jointable

1278900
environment	building
what would be a good way to tell the session buildinger to use the correct hibernate cfg i will building 1 for each environment

1278901

1279050
checkbox	button
instead of performing the checkbox functionality on button click you could use the oncheckedchanged event of the checkbox and set autopostback to true in asp.net

1279050
checkbox	button
then you will can execute the checkbox actions automatically and perform the data validation on the button click event

1279051
concatenation	comma
i think the error you mention is due to the comma at the last concatenation at the end of thumbnailimage

1279053

browsers it works in are ie 5.5 6 and 7 google-chrome 2 firefox 2 3 and 3.5 and safari 4 all on windows

1279167
webrick	apache
some subtle changes can happen .when using apache vs webrick mongrel best practice would be to actually setup apache+passenger locally for development

1279175
teamcity	gallio
teamcity runs our mbunit 3.1 tests at the end of the process with gallio

1279178
mousedown	mouseup
after that handle the event mousedown or mouseup depending of the behavior you want

1279185
keyboard	mouse
ideally i don t want to setup a keyboard mouse and monitor

1279208
decimal-point	numeric
if you need the precision to that decimal-point use the decimal data types or numeric same thing

1279211
httpd.conf	.htaccess
my first guess would be an issue with the .htaccess or httpd.conf file

1279211
httpd.conf	.htaccess
having said that if you know the issue isn t with the httpd.conf file checked to see if the root of the publishing path has a .htaccess

1279238
if-statement	loops
usually you d want to use || and for if-statement and loops and such for your examples above

1279240
dialog	pop-up
i have all the code to do this but i simply want a modal windows pop-up dialog to launchd in which i can have my simple add form

one thing you can do is add an order meta option

1279307
margins	padding
if that doesn t solve it add a css rules to remove all margins and padding from form elements

1279309
selected	button
to model this in visio once you have created the package you can open model explorer selected the package and with the right button selected new- class-diagram

1279316
value	field
if you store the value 26.1295 in a single precision field it may actually end up as 26.129499435424805 as that is as close that you can get with the precision of the field

1279317
administration	account
i have cruisecontrol.net running under its own account on my server which is a member of the administration grouping .so the cruisecontrol.net service should have access to everything it needs

1279339
ftp	ssh
.when you use any server side language only people with access to the ftp protocols or ssh can see the files

1279353
haskell	ada
if you want to be very careful about security use a language which supports easy verification and or proof such as haskell or ada

1279353
python	ruby
a typical web application probably would be ok with a modern dynamic-languages such as python or ruby

1279353
perl	php
any of these will make developing secure applications significantly easier than in legacy platform such as php perl cgi or classic asp

1279353
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
lastly as a small pet peeve -- php python ruby perl etc are not scripting languages

1279359

it was fast of course but i cringed every time i had to write a for-loop to go through the elements of an arrays which was very often

1279371
web-applications	security
some security problems in web-applications stemming from the types of language used on the server side buffering overflow is a security problem typical of c

1279371

system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1279388
scala	java
scala and clojure will have similar performance to java -- slow slow slow

1279388
common-lisp	lisp
if you want a performant lisp try common-lisp -- it can be compiled to machine-code

1279389
arrays	loops
it doesn t accept an arrays as a parameter but one of the comments uses a loops through the arrays to concatenation the packed value of each arrays elements

1279391
.when	ready
my thought was to have them only use version-control .when they are ready to go to uat staging

1279401
groovy	java	python	tcl	python	lua	python	java	tcl	lua
it s an important technique that could serve you well in your career whether it s tcl c lua c groovy java python c etc

1279407
arrays	loops
advice 4 .when youâ re copying medium-to-large arrays use array.copy rather than explicit copy loops

1279410
attributes	properties
the propertiesdescriptor parameter represents a properties in your model class and its attributes properties represents only the attributes defined directly on the properties itself

1279410
implements	extends
however you could of course extends dataannotationsruleprovider and overrides the appropriate methods to make it do what you want extraction validation attributes from implements interfaces

1279410
attributes	properties	implements	extends
to get attributes from properties in implements interfaces you should extends dataannotationsruleprovider and overrides getrulesfromtypecore

1279421
malloc	free
his primary concern is that the malloc and free call be fast and correct

1279487
debian	rpm	ubuntu	debian
rpm is used by redhat and its derivative fedora centos while deb is used in debian and ubuntu

1279488
show	next
selected the file and hit f4 what is show next to custom tool

1279508
order	add
edit i found a way to do this using settings.i have added the settings file but i have no idea of how i m supposed to add column order or column size in those settings

1279510
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	java
it s the sort of vague criticism that you can throw at any unfamiliar language that isn t totally mainstream not c++ objective-c java ruby python or php

1279537
version-control	sync
2 make the version-control part of the development-process otherwise you will get out of sync

1279550
malloc	free
from looking at the tango .source malloc free in tango.stdc.stdlib are just the c-standard-library functions .so there should rightfully be no difference - and in fact .when i try it using phobos and std.c.stdlib under linux the memory goes right back down as it should

1279553
javascript	dom
implementation is mostly on the javascript dom side and only minimally within flash flex

1279555
contains	any
it seems to contains a couple of client domain named in the header info that i hosts for people any ideas why that would be the case

1279560
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1279563
append	input
i would use jquery and append the new input

1279572
firefox	safari
this works in firefox 3.0 and 3.5 safari 4.0.2 and i ve only found this error .when viewing the page in ie8

1279626
contains	elements	contains	set
this depends on the contains elements of the togglebutton - i believe that on a grid stackpanel or dockpanel the button will stretch to fill available spaces if you don t set width + height or maxwidth + maxheight

1279627
base-class	inherited
if you forget virtual inherited having a base-class is equivalent memory and performance wise to having a member of the same class

1279634
callback	methods
is there a non-hacky no assembly ... way to use boost functions to create callback with non-static class methods

1279663
mediator	facade
.when the proxy s state is updates rather than sending a new notification the mediator which retrieves a reference to the proxy from the facade has its state updates

1279663
mediator	facade
wouldn t it make more sense to have the proxy object send their own notifications .when their state updates which are forwarded to the interested mediator by the facade

1279668
firefox	safari
i have found this solution to work in ie 6+ firefox 3.5+ safari 4+

1279686
uiresponder	uiview
subclassing uiview and overrides the various uiresponder methods dealing with touch

1279717
visio	dia
dia is roughly inspired by the commercial windows program visio though more geared towards informal diagram for casual use

1279717
entity-relationship	diagram
it currently has special object to help draw entity-relationship diagram uml diagram flowcharts network diagram and many other diagram

1279739
arrays	loops
it allows you to loops through a whole arrays with a simple statement like .so

1279745
populate	row
i have a tableadapter filling a dataset and for some reason every selected query populate my timestamp column with the value 1 1 2000 for every selecteded row

1279756
multiplication	division
you need to change your structure to use a numeric or decimal datatype don t forget to allow a few extra places for doing division and multiplication on the value

1279797
value	field
the module provides the means to transfer all the field value of the current nodes types into field on the destination nodes types or discard them

1279809
stdin	pipe
it starts a thread to read from stdin and then pipe the read output directly back to stdout

1279809
append	input
if the input string is append to another string it works fine

1279818
python	ruby
he also points out that python is faster than ruby

1279839
json	xml
store xml yaml json or your own dsl in that column

1279843
put	get
if you put all the special value in one table you get a very sparse-matrix table

1279846
haskell	c++
second polymorphism haskell functions are implements as runtime -polymorphism and not like c++ templates where every new type-parameter initializer a new versioning of code that is optimally compiled

1279846
haskell	c++
in the end haskell will struggle to beat any decent viewmodel such as hotspot jviewmodel or clr in .net 2.0+ much less c++

1279846
scala	java
scala uses jvm as a backend and thus is not going to be any faster than java - and if you use higher-level abstractions it will most likely be slower somewhat but probably in the same ballpark

1279846
haskell	ocaml
it should be noted however that this would not be typical of idiomatic ocaml code - for example its polymorphism is also runtime similar to haskell and that carries the appropriate penalty

1279846
boost	stl
it can be fairly high-level if you use high-level libs such as stl and boost

1279846
arrays	map
for example you don t have to write a for -loop to iterate over an arrays - you can use std for_each std copy_if std transform std accumulate and similar algorithms which are mostly analogous to map filtering folding and similar traditional fp primitive and also boost-lambda to cut down on boilerplace

1279873
sftp	ftp
netbeans has php highlight code completition db manager and ftp sftp + xdebug your next step support

1279893
malloc	free
it just means that digital mars implementation of malloc and free doesn t return memory to the os even .when you allocate a huge chunks like that

1279893
malloc	free
you could try using malloc and free from msvcrt.dll instead maybe they ll free the memory

1279902
python	ruby
in python i could use psyco libs that compiles the code or a part before the execution to improve the perfromance but i dont know if exists something like that in ruby

1279903
value	field
don t create a new recording for each words occurrence just add a new value to a big field in the words recording

1279903
key-value	key
even better if you don t use sql for this table use a key-value store where the key is the words and the value is the list of occurrences

1279909
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
for fulltext search compare sql-server vs lucene.net vs clucene vs mysql vs postgresql

1279915

google-chrome	safari
i have tried on ie8 google-chrome safari and in all three as the page loads the linkbutton just disappears

1279930
authentication	impersonation
if you re getting that error messages and the only thing you have enabled is anonymous authentication via iis that means that the asp.net impersonation user doesn t have ntfs permissions on the files in question

1279933
value	field
changing a field in the datatable to a value that i know this field will never have

1279935
meta-inf	jar
if meta-inf persistence.xml were contains in foo.jar assuming meta-inf persistence.xml were located on the root folder of the jar your classpath should have this

1279944
sftp	ftp
it has syntax-highlighting for almost any language ftp sftp remote editing sql plugins code-completion plugins and .so many others that i can t even begin to list them

1279945
double	int
f is a function that takes a single int parameter and returns a pointers to a function that takes a double parameter and returns int

1279946
linked-list	nodes
iterator over a linked-list causes an inner loops assuming you are using loopss index to retrieve the next value instead of holding onto the nodes and referencing .next which would be fine iterator over an arraylist does not

1279962
getter	setter
the data capsule is a simple class with lots of getter and setter properties it uses a di framework and consistently use the inversion-of-control containers to provide instances of the data capsule lucky me

1279973
required	checked
checked the class you re inheriting from and you ll see a create that required some parameters

1279992
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari ignore this while ie does not allow scripting to overwrite this

1279992
defined	declare
1 declare top you are using as local variables to defined it s scoping where it is used

1279998
if-statement	loops
if-statement are not loops

1280018
function-call	inline
notice that it actually makes a function-call to assign the string reference to src i while the int is done inline

1280020
associations	model
.when you use the include parameter for the eds you would need to know which associations to use which isnt obvious until you look in the eds model

1280047
tcsh	bash
updates this works in bash 4.0 as well as tcsh and dash if you change source to

1280055
numeric	zero	base	zero
numeric literals with leading zero are how you specify something in octal base 8

1280056
javadoc	doxygen
it supports xml-documentation doxygen javadoc and qt format comments

1280067
decimal	octal
the thing is that 027447002 in terms of numbers is octal base-8 - not a zero-filled decimal base-10 int

1280090
pascal	basic
the dpr is the basic pascal program file

1280114
constructor	object
of course since base constructor are called before descendant constructor if a base constructor initializer the properties to the wrong value a descendant constructor has a chance to rectify that before construction of the object is final

1280139
variables	boolean
as a public member or preferably a readonly properties make a boolean variables

1280139
any	set
if you re waiting for the parsing to complete you might want to set a timeout or some sort of try-catch mechanism just in case there are any unforeseen errors that would cause some sort of

1280141
put	get
if i put a breakpoints on the line of code under test vs tells me the properties or indexer presenter.iqueryform.queryresults cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

1280141
object-reference	instances
finally nunit gives an object-reference not set to an instances of an object exception-handling

1280149
digits	zero
a nine digits numbers that s padded with zero on the left

1280178
defined	declare
but i believe his original question had declare instead of defined .so all the answers seem a bit inappropriate

1280178
defined	declare
probably my idea of defined and declare were flawed

1280181
binary	octal
the real question is why haven t more languages adopted octal and binary notations in a more regular fashion

1280186
binary	octal
in c# there are no binary or octal literals perhaps the reasoning is that you shouldn t do as much bit fiddling that the language needs it.

1280188
defined	declare
you can consider declare and defined to be interchangeable in that question

1280203
hide	show
and finally one more option show hide different panels on the page

1280232
jcarousel	slider
i am using the plugins jcarousel and rather than the images slider in like in the carousel with autoscroll demo

1280232
contains	elements
but i looked at cycle plugins but it didn t seem to work with my scenario as the elements i want to show contains text and an image

1280235
32-bit	x86
install the 32-bit x86 versioning and try again

1280239
set	bag
use set instead of bag

1280243
administration	account
it seems pretty simple but the problem is that there needs to be one administration account that can read all the input of all other users

1280252
export	report
export of report regarding the difference

1280266
lookup	any
are there any ready lookup tables available that provide me an output saying x location belongs to y country

1280315
checkbox	button
some form controls automatically have labels associated with them press button while most do not textfield checkbox and radio button and menus

1280322
communication	messages
if two devices want to communication with each other initiator switches to other device s ssid and broadcasting udp messages

1280342
getter	setter
the actual implementation of datagridview isn t under mocks control .so it can t intercept the getter and setter for selectionmode

1280344
perl	ruby
it s funny that the result in .net is the exact opposite of the results in ruby and perl

1280345
oracle	mysql
the relational part is a relational-database manager systemd a database that is there are other types of databases but the most popular is relational you know tables columns pk fk etc eg oracle mysql ms-sql

1280354
input-field	selected
if you click on the labels of an input-field it selected it

1280362
binary-operators	operands
many binary-operators that expect operands of arithmetic or enumerator types cause conversions and yield result typess in a similar way

1280362
unsigned	short
1 an rvalue of types char signed char unsigned char short int or unsigned short int can be converted to an rvalue of types int if int can represent all the value of the source types

1280368
margins	padding
the best i could do in gecko was either put a border radius in the inner div too or add a margins padding to the wrapper div .so that the inner divs sat below the corners

1280370
pixels	line
annoyingly the jradiobutton s don t line up with the rest of the controls as they have a large amount of padding all around pushing them to the right a couple of pixels and adding a lot of spaces between line

1280387
hide	show
i m looking for some non-javascript techniques by which to reload a page of tree items basically divs within divs while remembering their show hide status

1280387
hide	show
basically my goal is to be able to show hide the tree whether javascript is enabled or not

1280396
duplicates	elements
document.getelementsbyid won t work right with duplicates id s obviously as it only returns one elements

1280407
factors	primes
the numbers of divisors according to the divisor function is the product of the power of each primes factors plus 1

1280407
multiplying	exponent
we can multiplying numbers written in the exponential primes form simply by adding up the exponent at each positioning

1280418
g++	gcc
i want my code to compile with the intel compiler s or with gcc g++ depending on a configure arguments

1280453
user-controls	ascx
we have a bunch of user-controls we would like to pull out of a web application and into a separate assembly libs and i thought it would be as simple as creating a class-libs and pulling the ascx and ascx.cs files into the project and compiling a dll to be reused among our applications

1280488
blitz++	boost
you could try blitz++ -- or boost s ublas

1280491
perl	php
in fact the vast majority of modern language implementation cython perl php yarv ironruby hotspot mono clr tracemonkey and .so on use both an interpreter and a compiler

1280492
subclassing	superclass
let s say we have a superclass called super and a subclassing called sub

1280492
extends	super
now you would probably expect since sub extends super that sub would now inherited all of super s methods however it seems to only receive references to the sub s methods

1280492
superclass	inherited
.so this means that .when i call an inherited static function the function s scoping will be the superclass not the one called upon even if you printing the backtrace it will show that the call was made on the superclass

1280492
subclassing	inherited	static-class	inherited
.so my question is can i ever extends a static-class call one of the inherited methods and have the subclassing s scoping

1280502
valarray	std
std valarray is pretty lightweight

1280525
margins	padding
you should make sure you have no margins padding or borders on your two column elements

1280525
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this out in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome 3

1280537
subproject	libs
moreover some subproject need to include other subproject libs

1280556
nsrunloop	nstimer
nstimer created by this call is owned by current nsrunloop object .so it is not going to be autoreleased by any autorelease pool drain

1280562
.net	wcf
if you re up to-date on .net 3.5 sp1 then you should use wcf

1280580
selected	button
it all seems fine but .when i selected the navbar back button two items are lopped off the items stack rather than 1 as i would have expected

1280582
.when	ready
then .when you re ready to integrated those changes treat it like you re merging into the trunk or merging the trunk into yours

1280582
environment	building
at the very least do this with the basic tools that you personally use and try to building your environment to something where you can trust your code

1280583
.when	ready
each developer gets their own branch that they can do with as the please then .when they are ready to shared their changes with the other developers they just merge their changes back into the main branch

1280590
bazaar	git
any dvcs such as bazaar mercurial darcs or git supports private branches

1280612
contains	elements
say i have two columns of data contains different elements

1280613
.when	ready
i can move changes between those branches sort and organise commit and only push my changes upstream .when i m ready to shared them

1280615
tokenize	parsing
i m using the regex in conjunction with a tokenize parsing a larger document

1280623
contains	elements	contains	set
this tends to be a problem in firefox .when you have a flash movie with wmode set to transparency or opaque contains in a float ed elements

1280626
installation	environment
module installation was automated and ran against my local environment .so i could be rea.sonable sure i could reliably install it to the live environment

1280628
subclassing	inherited
the code uses inherited to do its thing you have to use that subclassing to store your value

1280631
stderr	stdout
his favorite trick was to have shell scripting calling shell scripting calling shell scripting and explicit redirecting stdout and stderr to dev-null sometimes 2 and 3 layer deep

1280659
getline	scanf
my code is c++ but you should be able to use scanf and the rest where i use the c++ input function getline

1280664
digits	zero
0 . d+ this matches a zero followed by a dot followed by at least one digits 0.1 0.123 0.88

1280670
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but not ie anyone know why

1280672
puts	gets
the wrapfig package takes an entire column away .so text below the images gets wrapped to a fixed width even without the image there and pushes the description environment past the left margins and the floatflt package puts the image exactly where i want it but no text gets wrapped

1280681
readline	ncurses
another alternative to using ncurses or threads is to use gnu readline specifically the part of it that allows you to register callback functions

1280681
.when	ready
.when selected tells you that stdin is ready to read from call readline s rl_callback_read_char

1280686
tree	trie
a somewhat simpler trie is the burst-trie which essentially gives you an interpolation between a standards tree of some sort like a bst and a trie

1280693
postgresql	mysql
if you are just doing development work look into mamp which has a whole bunch of extensions including pdo for mysql and postgresql built-in

1280702
linux	osx
also i would like to install it as a service on any platform windows linux mac osx

1280705
shipping	tax
id | subtotal | tax | shipping | datecreated

1280705
value	field
i want to have the autoincrement field start from that value

1280707
enumerate	next
for a wrapfigure effect with an environment enumerate itemize etc etc. you should put the environment in a minipage and the graphic in in a minipage then set the two minipages next to each other

1280710
file-descriptor	stdin
i ended up with a stdindataio class that wrap around the appropriate os-specific implementation .so that the rest of my program can selected on the file-descriptor stdindataio provides remaining blissfully ignorant of windows limitations regarding stdin

1280717
any	set
once in a while i need a gui to set numeric ranges but .so far i ve never really found any component that does it nicely

1280717
any	set
is there any free component available to set a range or can something similar be done by using out-of-the-box vcl components creatively

1280719
target-platform	platform
it s not platform independent you would have to compile one for each target-platform but i don t see how you can distribute platform-independent bytecode and yet hide that bytecode from your end users

1280728
linux	osx
imho the best solution is a normals archive contains several scripting .bat .cmd for windows .sh for linux osx for the program-start under the operating systemd the program supports

1280748
moss	wss
edit an alternative is fulltextsqlquery if you are using moss not wss which uses the sspâ s search indexed

1280764
shell	bash
if using bash shell no need to call external cmd

1280797
subclassing	inherited
since the subclassing inherited from the double class you still get all the functionality of the double class and the added functionality of your custom mydouble class

1280820
attr	src
this always works for me #foo attr src url

1280836
ruby	php
i would like to access a couple of different mac os x applications from preferably ruby but i would settle for php

1280836
ruby	php
if i can t do this in ruby or php perhaps i can do it in objective-c cocoa and create some kind of wrapper that i could call from ruby

1280862
safari	opera
you might be looking for the elementfrompoint methods that exists in msie ff3+ and in some form in safari and opera

1280868
updating	updates
updates in addition to suggesting implementation methods i d also like to further understand where the performance issues come into play assuming the naive approach of simply checked if the ip exists and updating the view column on every page view

1280868
mapping	unique
is the main issue vast amount of insert occuring assuming heavy traffic or is it more the size of the object-to-ip mapping table which could be huge since a new row will be insert per question for each new unique visitor

1280872
testng	junit
this happens because it keeps tracking of the current test being execute by the test runner which can be a junit 3.8 a junit 4.5+ or a testng 5.8+ runner

1280872
testng	junit
.so .when not running in the context of a testing framework junit or testng it lacks the necessary test tracking information

1280872
testng	junit
but what would be the points of running a test suite that is neither written with junit nor with testng or with any other test framework if one existed

1280888
put	get
grouping the data by question_id such that i can put tags to my questions i have tried to manipulate the data by php but i get only this far

1280890
buffering	streaming
for internal streaming specific errors the bad bit is used such as if there is no buffering connect to the streaming

1280891
instances	private
to summarize you have a private instances methods setprogressbarvalue

1280903
firefox	safari
safari 4 is perfect firefox 3.5 is great etc

1280919
value	field
the field has the id #art and i m trying to get the selected value .when i submit any solutions

1280965
click	mouse
in my case i handling the low-level mouse events not click

1280974
linux	bsd
it s not pthreads but it s on both bsd and systemv derived systemd .so it s almost everywhere - including linux

1280982
itextsharp	itext
itextsharp a ports of the java versioning itext is a good open source libs that we are using to do just that

1280998
subtract	add
you should have done a search - i posted a complete answer to this question over here just the other day for utc at least - to adjust for other timezones just add or subtract the timezone offset in seconds from the unixtime before you call the function

1281001
couchdb	mnesia
i see much more code using mnesia couchdb tokyo-cabinet and other such alternative database technologies

1281027
expression	evaluation
fwiw i ve had access apps with jet back ends-with 100s of thousands of recording in multiple tables used by a dozen simultaneous users adding and updating recording and response time retrieving individual recording and small dataset was nearly instantaneous except for a few complex operations like checked newly entered recording for duplication against existing data -- that s slower because it uses lots of like comparisons and evaluation of expression for comparison

1281034
contains	elements
the xhtml files contains images elements whose src attributes points to an external reference

1281036
buffering	streaming
if you must read from your buffering while the serial-port is reading to your buffering then try using a bufferinging streaming object to avoid deadlock and race conditional

1281051
default	reset
default to true meaning django will create the appropriate database tables in syncdb and remove them as part of a reset management cmd

1281052
command-line	cmd	runas	cmd
and yes .when i have been execution the regsvcs cmd they have been from a command-line launchd with runas administration

1281056
contains	any
any dsn that contains a passwd encrypted or not is a security risk

1281073
solaris	linux
needs easily be compiled on multiple platform linux solaris win32 ideally with mingw darwin

1281087
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you are looking for is mouseenter and mouseleave

1281087
mouseenter	mouseover
a good example can be found at this link they have compared both mouseenter and mouseover

1281089
difference	factors
if you compare the time between this versioning running with one thread and the original versioning the only factors that could cause a difference in time are the overhead from starting the thread and variables systemd performance issues

1281094
perl	tcl
tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning

1281094
python	perl
it s straightforward certainly far easier than doing the same with perl or in general python

1281097
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
running your application through an obfuscation makes reverse-engineering more difficult and costly

1281112
python	lua
we looked at both python and lua for scripting for a .net product

1281114
i2c	spi
it uses a samsung micro and the development hardware has some generous peripherals including uart spi i2c and usb interfaces

1281119
button	popup
i have this application where the users can change text files and .when they forget to save them a little messages popup reminding them that the changes are not saved and asks them if they want to save the changes or not with two button yes and no

1281119
selected	checkbox
1 should the checkbox value if they checked it be remembered if the user only selected yes only selected no or any of them

1281143
png	gif
.so is this methods reliable for gettting the photo s file types like jpg gif png

1281175
stdin	pipe
searching around the web tells me that it is because stdin is somehow a pipe instead of a real tty

1281175
ftp	ssh
how do i fix this and get back usage of ssh and i guess other tools like ftp latex and anything that needs a tty inside emacs s shell

1281181
user-interface	look-and-feel
relatively rich set of user-interface widget with uniform look-and-feel

1281181
event-bus	mvp
maturing framework with 1.6+ and forthcoming 2.0 release event-bus event handler gui architecture with mvp pattern compiler-optimization etc.

1281182
difference	zero
in that case there is absolutely zero difference between using a ref or a non-ref parameter

1281195
populate	row
if you use the new sparse-matrix table feature of 2008 it could help but there are other issues too it s a little hard to constrain normalize because you want only only one of the multiple value to be populate for each row - having two value in two columns would be an error but the design doesn t reflect that

1281214
content-disposition	content-type
if you re attempting to output binary-data look into php s header function and ensure you set the proper content-type and content-disposition

1281236
sqldatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that show a list of contact via a sqldatasource

1281236
sqldatasource	gridview
gridview and sqldatasource here

1281244
bazaar	git
if you were managing leading a large or distribute team i d strongly recommend dvcs hg is my choice but git and bazaar are very popular too but as you appear to be working on your own svn s just fine

1281244
emacs	vim
what ide or editor you like -- eclipse vim emacs zend stuff w ever -- is really secondary

1281246
radio-button	selected
from the terminal .app choose preferences selected startup and verify that the on startup open new windows with settings radio-button is selecteded and selected basic from the pull-down menu

1281258
actionscript	mxml
mxml is simply declarative actionscript .so there is no difference between creating your instances in actionscript or using the mxml notation

1281260
any	set
i have set up an annotations that will be used to keep tracking of classes however i am getting an error .when i try to compile any java code that uses the annotations

1281269
any	set
any ideas what is wrong and how to set bigger response size

1281274
order	add
the goal is to take the least quantity of numbers out of m where .when you add them in the decided order you get intermediate results as close as possible to all of the points in p

1281293
key-value	key
the problem i m having is that i m trying to allow passing more that one key-value pair at a time .so key can be an arrays of strings but value have to be object and contentvalue.put doesn t allow object they need to be cast to string double float etc

1281299
subclassing	superclass
.when you create a new subclassing a new types of structure is defined with all the superclass s ivars followed by the new class s ivars

1281299
base-class	superclass
the superclass structure must contains the ivars of its superclass and then it s turtles all the way down to a structure which represents the ivars of the base-class

1281299
nsobject	ivar
in the case of nsobject and indeed object the base-class structure only contains one ivar - a pointers called isa to the class structure representing this object s class

1281322
extends	final
if contentvalues wasn t final another option would be to extends it and add a methods that takes an object

1281326
updating	updates
to be perfectly honest i d probably sneak this updates it .when you updates whatever other data they are updating say the chat logs

1281334
selected	button
choose sftp plugins and then click selected required button

1281336
display	width
this is to say that the outer pixelss appear to have half the width as the inner pixelss where the issue really comes in is .when i add a tooltip to display the x y co-ordinates of the current moused-over pixels it is throw off

1281358
perl	php
php string support isn t as great as say perl but it s very usable

1281359
robot	nxt
get a moveable camera and or a lego nxt robot and attach a camera to its arm

1281365
python	c++
one cool example i can think of immediately is the civilization iv game most of which runs on python scripting on top of a c++ api

1281368
textbox	button
i next created an excel addin using vs 2008 and added a user-controls with two textbox and a button to the addin the user-controls appears as a custom task panels .when excel starts

1281368
textbox	button
the idea was this .when i click the button a hosted powershell instances is created and i can pass to it the current excel.application instances as a variables just like in the first sample .so i can use this variables to automate excel from powershell one textbox would be used for input and the other one for output

1281372
build-process	ant
updates i m not saying you should change your build-process - if ant works for you stick with it

1281390
filtering	grouping
.when you want to sort by any date you need to add a date filtering located in the date grouping

1281390
value	field
however in your case you want to add the date filtering twice one for each of the date field as you have different value for the field

1281394
any	set
well autopostback means it will send a postback request any time any control with that properties set on it changes .so if you have it on multiple controls it is going to exhibit the behavior you don t want

1281399
dfa	nfa
one of the other major difference between dfa s and nfa s is that badly-written nfa s are prone to serious even catastrophic performance problems and sloppy alternations are one of the easiest ways to triggers them

1281400
account	userid
i ve customised the asp.net login-control and it seems to create new account fine but if i duplicates the userid thats already registered or enter an email thats already used the error messages arn t display

1281422
getter	setter
from what i can tell django follows the gorm model more than it does the ar model .so that model might be .something worth looking into especially given that java probably wouldn t lend itself to dynamic getter and setter as ruby does unless you starting delving into generator bytecode on-the-fly but your compiler and ide wouldn t like that very much

1281424
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i don t think that there are themes to windows-ce5 because windows-ce produced to run enterprise program not like windows-mobile produce for personal usage

1281428
exponent	modulo
the int are the modulo and the public exponent

1281447
specifications	w3c
from the w3c css2 selector specifications

1281447
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
css introduces the concepts of pseudo-element and pseudo-class to permit formatting based on information that lies outside the document tree

1281490
getter	setter
cheat and bind to a string properties in my viewmodel whose setter getter does the conversion loading value into the combobox using code-behind in the view

1281495
functional-programming	imperative
they are not real multi-paradigm imperative functional languages they are imperative oo languages that have some small functional bits you can t do real functional-programming in them

1281510
ubuntu	linux
could you please give me a assembly code in linux ubuntu 9.04 to printing floating-point numbers

1281521
uiimage	nsdata
how do i take a uiimage and store it preferably as nsdata to write to a file

1281545
silverlight	wpf
any comments would be appreciated as i m somewhat of a xaml silverlight wpf etc

1281549
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
example objectinputstream and objectoutputstream keep references to all object they have seen inorder to send subsequent occurences of the same object as references rather than copies and thereby deal with circular references

1281552
svg	vml
not quite charting but lightweight svg vml cross-browser graphic libs raphaeljs.com

1281562
shell	bash
types bash again and now you ll see that the shell is just bash without dash

1281568
solaris	bsd	solaris	linux	linux	bsd
sure it s easier but won t work on mac linux bsd solaris and probably nor very later windows versioning

1281578
user-controls	itemtemplate
i have a custom user-controls which has a dependencyproperty itemtemplate of types datatemplate

1281578
contentcontrol	itemtemplate
i create an instances of this itemtemplate via .loadcontent assign the .datacontext and put it an contentcontrol

1281581
continuous-integration	automated-tests	continuous-integration	build-process
if you re going to have automated-tests it d be good to have an automated build-process to run them ie a continuous-integration server

1281588
value	field
just set up a test conditional to see if node- types foo and then run a function to create two nodes or however many using the value from the predefined field

1281588
.when	ready
you can even set hook_nodesapi to only run .when the op is almost ready to insert the nodes into the database thus ensuring the object has been run through appropriate validation before being passed on to the new nodess that need to be created

1281590
silverlight	wpf
.net provides newer better alternatives such as wpf and silverlight both of which are much closer to the web design paradigms and will likely be easier for a web developer to pick up

1281618
png	gif
is it possible to include an external image gif jpg or png into a gd generator image

1281645
click	mouse
however if you want to drop a component over a jbutton you should pass other mouse events e.g click to the underlying jbutton

1281650
python	ruby
python less easy to embed slightly harder to use string features than ruby

1281651
string.format	stringbuilder
i run this separately for each approach the + operators string.format and stringbuilder calling tostring .so the memory used will not be affected by other approaches

1281678
python	php
the code is in python but should be really easy to ports to other languages such as php

1281697
managed-code	unmanaged
the only reliable way i can suggest is to write a tiny unmanaged proxy dll which will call first getcurrentthreadid writing it into an out intptr someplace where it will be visible to managed-code and then your native blocking function

1281732
protected-mode	real-mode
i ve written a simple real-mode pre-emptive multitasking systemd for the pc and later created a protected-mode systemd too - all in assembly

1281749
execution	restart
the way i did autostart on my clickonce application was that every time it starts up it checked the autostart registry setting if it exists then it sets it to the location of the currently execution executable to be sure that the most current versioning is being autostarted it handled updates manually and restart itself .when it was done

1281758
contains	elements
the enumerate generator produces a sequences of 2-tuples each contains the arrays index and the elements

1281770
tabcontrol	treeview
currently i populate the treeview or tabcontrol manually iterator through the xml adding the nodes to the appropriate leaf

1281784
key-value	key
the #define key-value directive tells the pre-compiler whenever you see key replace it with value

1281796
cpu-architecture	x86
you don t state which cpu-architecture .so i m assuming x86

1281806
32-bit	64bit

this has asp.net-mvc web client and wcf web-services for third party integration as front-end

1281860
observers	listener
then there is the usage of observers-pattern which could lead to memory-leaks - .when the observers delists itself from the subject memory cannot be reclaimed unless the subject also release the reference to the observers listener

1281860
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
this variety of memory-leaks eventually results in a out-of-memory with a permgen spaces issue reported as the root cause making it more difficult to diagnose

1281870
directory	folder
in the latter case your deployment scripting would simply move the bits to a staging web folder accessible via beta.mysite.com and then another deployment scripting could move that to the live web directory

1281873

python	c++
python is a powerful and easy to learn high level language and has good documentation of extends it with c and c++

1281891
python	c++
using swig see extends python with c++ for a nice little tutorial you create the c++ code as if it was to be run by itself plus an interface file that swig takes to create some wrapping code for you that you can use in python or other languages for that matter

managed-code	native-code
system.data.sqlite.dll is a mixed assembly it contains both managed-code and native-code

1281902
default-value	default	default	reset
the defaultvalueattribute is used to inform the propertiesgrid or other properties browser types controls of what the default-value of the properties should be .so they can indicate .when it has been changed from that default and reset it back to that default

1281902
function-call	inline
using this approach you could still use the attributes but would need to write some reflection code to get it s value and you would need to initializer the private _myprop variables through a function-call rather than inline like i ve show

1281922
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	lua	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	lua	python	perl

watermark the embedded splash-screen or about-box logo image

1282215
32-bit	64bit
64bit systemd can process data in chunks twice as large as 32-bit which helps some operations go more quickly

1282215
32-bit	64bit
for some programs like office-automation suites 32-bit vs 64bit makes little observable difference

1282215
32-bit	64bit
note that today many 32-bit chip have 64bit extension functions as many fpu math or ssmd vector operations are done in 64bit mode already

1282218
positioning	slider
if you scroll down one of the panels and click the tabs at the top again it slider the tab over but it doesn t change the overflow positioning

c++	lua
i like to use languages that are specifically made to be embedded in c++ or c like lua falcon or chaiscript

1282403
python	c++
falcon is a good alternative to python in this case embedding a high level language in c++

1282403

1282885
sql-server	oracle
with either database i would use a client-generated guid for the primary key which would map to uniqueidentifier in sql-server or raw 20 in oracle

1282895
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
youâ re using inherited give priority to creating a sensible superclass subclassing

1282906
value	field
if they were field instances or static then you could use reflection to get the value

1282925
value	field
if your variables is a class field then you can use the static getfield methods from class types to obtain field information such as its current value

1282928
png	gif
i have a watermark scripting i am working on the results are good on png and on jpg images however a gif image not .so good

1283066
subprocess	pexpect
i suggest you consider instead using pexpect or on windows wexpect to defeat such buffering and get smooth regular output from the subprocess

1283069
delphi	c++
i would say that the only really safe way to protect your code is by using isapi or cgi and developing the application with .some hard compiled language like c++ vb 5 or higher but any .net delphi 5 or higher and .so on

1283072
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c s specifications the hover pseudo-class should only be applied .when the user initiates the action

1283072
mouseover	mouseout
.so your best best in this situation would be to apply a concrete class let s say .hover via a function bound to the mouseover and mouseout events of the desired target elements

1283100
arrays	loops
it seems silly to have to loops through a arrays of 1 control

1283143
ref	out
ref and out are not part of the type-parameter definition .so you can t use the built-in func delegation to pass ref and out arguments

1283171
arrays	loops
apart from the wrong arrays size in the first of the inner loops you re going along the right line

1283188
windows-vista	windows-xp
this is on windows-xp windows-vista and it s java 1.5 and java 1.6

1283195
daemons	systemd
configuration of the server both apache php mysql other possible daemons and systemd

1283195
reverse-proxy	varnish
the first thing that could be really useful is using a reverse-proxy like varnish in front of your webserver let it caching as many things as possible .so only request that really need php mysql calculations and of course .some other request .when they are not in the caching of the proxy make it to apache php mysql

1283195
xdebug	xhprof
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generator callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1283198
linux	osx
i would consider such integration between the two environment very cool on linux and osx .so i was wondering if it already exists ipython is not really the same and if not why

1283205

but if you are trying to combine strcat with the formatting possibilities of printf you may try this

1283390
apache-fop	docbook
the easiest for engineers is probably docbook xslt apache-fop and either ant or make

1283409
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
use strutils.ansistartsstr for case-sensitive strutils.ansistartstext for case-insensitive

1283412
contains	set
i ve got a mysql table that acts like a nested set inorder to contains a hierarchy of category

1283416
32-bit	64bit
on my work laptop 32-bit xp 3gb ram 7200 rpm hdd 2.2 ghz dual core it suffers but on my home pc 64bit win 7 8gb ram 7200 rpm hdd 2.9 ghz quad core it flies and i barely notice the performance hit

1283422
accessor	ivar
in the meantime using the accessor directly is the only way to do it without providing an explicit ivar

is there any way to trick python into thinking that a descriptor is a data descriptor but letting a contains class instances still be able to use its setattr cmd as normals

1283446
nvidia	ati
even if you know what the error messages look like now nvidia and ati are under no obligation to keep them the same in the next versioning s of their drivers

1283484
spring	seam
however there are quite a few popular and valid alternatives such as spring seam gwt and even more radical alternatives such as jruby on ruby-on-rails

1283496
contains	lookup
note that the bundle object also provides getentry string path to lookup resources contains within a specific bundle rather than searching that bundle s entire classpath

1283504
base	zero
.when i convert a # from base 10 to base 16 hex using javascript it doesn t zero pad the numbers

1283504
digits	zero
any easy way to zero pad my numbers to be 2 digits in length

1283520
filtering	sorting
the option sajaxsource is used to specify the ajax source and setting the option bprocess allows us to configure the systemd to do all the process like page loading sorting and filtering in the server side

1283555
font-size	width
the only solution i came up with is pre-computing the width in points of each character in each font-size used then adding these up over each string

1283594
web-applications	security
i am currently re factors one of my web-applications and i was hoping for some advice on improving my security

1283606
localization	translation
well even if you could get a list and you can i guess by inspector the filesystems depending on how you implements your localization it may not be accurate may have not provided a translation for the specific .resx you re looking for

1283615
unsigned	bigint
it looks like the id column in the wp_1_posts table is an unsigned bigint just not sure what to do about it.

1283628
subclassing	accessor
subclassing the ogre3d entities and give them a collections of basic shapes and an accessor to them

children	nodes
i need to assign n entities each with possible parent and possible children to m computation nodes while satisfying the following optimization conditional

1283644
children	nodes
children of an entity want to be assign to the same computation nodes to maximize data locality among siblings

1283646
python	php
without concentrating on the fact that maybe sometimes more control over the mapping process may be good are there similar one-click or one-command solutions for other mainly open source like python or php programming languages or frameworks

1283650
value	field
is there some kind of standardized way which would allow me to make my asp.net-mvc web .app sessions entirely cookies less but still keep session support through some standardized hidden form field value on every page which would get parsing transparently on every request

1283652
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i m guessing without the relevant code but if you store an nsmutablearray into an nsarray variables the compiler uses static-typing based on the variables types and assumes the object is an nsarray and thus immutable

1283652
nsmutablearray	nsarray
hence the may not respond to... warnings. conversely you could be trying to store an nsarray in an nsmutablearray variables which would cause failure at runtime as well

1283658
common-lisp	scheme	common-lisp	elisp	scheme	elisp
afaik javascript uses dynamic scoping like common-lisp elisp does and not lexical scoping like scheme lisp-1 does

1283667
32-bit	64bit
the programfiles itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variables is itself 32-bit or 64bit this is caused by windows-on-windows 64bit redirection

1283674
constructor	object
that operators creates a new object that inherited from the prototype of the operands constructor function and then it call the function assign the new object to this

1283674
constructor	object
if you forget to use the new-operator .when calling a constructor function you get instead normals function-call and this is bound to the global object windows instead of to a new object

.net	wcf
i am using vsts2008 + c# + .net 3.5 to develop a wcf service hosted in iis 7.0 6.0

1283691
databound	datalist
in your code-behind handle the datalist s item databound event

1283700
ready	live
if you want to refactor large parts of it then i would move the live handler outside of that function bind it in .doc ready and then store the current link using .data on the #flag-form-submit elements

1283729
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
nscalendar + nsdatecomponents

1283740
selection	cell
the jlist has no ability to change size of cell depending on selection or whatever

1283740
selected	cell
the possible solution is to write own listui implementation which is able to use different sizes for selected and unselected cell

1283740
selection	cell
this brings also possibility to adjust size of cell around selection by logarithm or other interpolation

1283746
internationalization	localization	internationalization	globalization	globalization	localization
one project that is working towards a database of globalization internationalization and localization knowledge is the unicode common locale data repository based on the old icu project at ibm

1283746
contains	any
as it is a database of xml data it doesn t contains any .net-specific code but as a body of knowledge it is very good

1283762
remote-server	vpn
since i keep every configuration file and my home-directory under version-control on a remote-server on my vpn these are the only two things i need to get back all the rest regardless of where in the world i happen to be

1283763
instances	self
speaking of you would al.so want to have a measurement called .something like self for instances of the ingredient being eggs and quantity being 3 .so that it would re.solve to 3 eggs without the need for ounces or cups

1283783
assign	add
i need to add projectgrouping table represeting grouping of project .so that one project is assign to only one particular grouping and grouping can have many project assign to it

1283788
python	c++
i would be interest in the results of someone else s timing comparison of my python code against one of the optimized c++ versioning of the same algorithm

1283791
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome and safari but .when the request if sent from ie the server send me to an error page

1283793
httphandler	httpmodule
3 i have httphandler to handle other things like file upload and file downloading is there a limit to how many httpmodule httphandler should be used or should these be combined somehow to reduce overhead

1283815
32-bit	64bit
many modern processor can run in two modes 32-bit mode and 64bit mode

1283815
32-bit	64bit
operating systemd chose to use the processor in one of these modes at installation time a choice is made whether to operate the processor in 32-bit mode or in 64bit mode

1283815
32-bit	64bit
even though the processor can continue to operate in 64bit mode switching from 32-bit to 64bit would required a reinstallation of the systemd

1283815
32-bit	64bit
applications can also be written in or compiled for 32-bit or 64bit mode

1283815
32-bit	64bit
compatibility here is more tricky as the processor .when run in 64bit mode can still support 32-bit applications as an emulation feature

1283815
32-bit	64bit
.so on a 64bit operating systemd you can run either 32-bit applications or 64bit applications

1283815
32-bit	64bit
at the same time they may also be a bit faster since they can perform 64bit int operations as one instruction whereas 32-bit processor need to emulate them with multiple instructions

1283815
32-bit	64bit
one al.so may wonder what the cost is of running a 32-bit application on a 64bit proces.sor on amd64 and intel64 proces.sor this emulation mode is mostly in hardware .so there is no real performance loss over running the 32-bit application natively

1283815
32-bit	x86
this is significantly different on itanium where 32-bit x86 applications are emulated very poorly

1283856
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
apache 2.2.11 ubuntu dav 2 php 5.2.6-3ubuntu4.1 with suhosin-patch mod_python 3.3.1 python 2.6.2 mod_ruby 1.2.6 ruby 1.8.7 2008-08-11 mod_ssl 2.2.11 openssl 0.9.8g server at 127.0.0.1 ports 80

1283861
constructor	object
constructor can return an object a function or an arrays

1283885
direct3d	directx
online resources direct3d matrix projection metrices direct3d transformation the importance of matrix in the directx api

1283886
32-bit	64bit
naturally the size of these registers are the same width in bits as the #-bits of architecture it is .so a 32-bit cpu s registers will be 32-bit wide and 64bit cpu s registers will be 64bit wide

1283886
32-bit	64bit
would have to simulate having a 64bit register by taking up two 32-bit registers and handling any overflow situations

1283886
32-bit	64bit
the drawback is that a 64bit cpu with everything equals would consume more power than a 32-bit cpu just due to roughly twice the amount of circuitry needed

1283908
python	java
i have seen reports on irc about jython the java ports of python being able to do a few operations using the pure modules

1283909
directory	folder
the filled-up forms are verified by javascript in the folder javascript and if the information is found ok the data is submitted via javascript http-request object and the php file somefile.php kept in the folder somefolder under the root directory does the database insert

1283910
document	editing
using the software in any other way such as for doing email playing games or editing a document is another use and is not covered by the msdn subscription license

1283919
any	set
.so at the start of a scripting we set error_reporting to any value but zero - we can now do .some beautiful if else magic

1283919
any	set
to avoid any errors being show at the frontend we also set display_errors to 0 this will overrides error_reporting but we can still use it s value for magic

1283921
value	field
a ruby-on-rails controllers receives the .post value in a hash which has no natural order but for my application i need it because the user can change the order of the form field via javascript

1283924
attributes	properties
i am not sure how the formule attributes of the properties elements could be used to return an object from the sql

1283931
ubuntu	debian
an apache 2.x webserver with default configuration from the ubuntu debian repositories will use the www-data unix account for apache2 process handling web request

1283948
show	next
i want to give the user the ability to actually ummm browse the file ie prev page next page button while each page will show only a portion of the file

1283956
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i haven t found that the asp.net webforms page master pages or asp.net-mvc is a very good fit for this sort of thing

1283961
contains	any
my page contains the utf-8 charset tag .so it may well be .something before that is not using utf8-decode - any ideas what it may be or how i can fix it

1283977
multiplication	addition
is there really no equivalent right-sided addition multiplication in ruby and does that make it necessary to redefine + for each potential class of other

1284012
environment	building
environment for building and presumes

1284014
callback	methods
i mean have a non-template class callback which wrap any pointers to methods

1284027
contains	set
i am trying to setup a directory that contains perl modules that should be set aside to not interfere with a production systemd

1284041
associations	model
but what you could do is to add an associations to your conceptual model

1284041
dialog	pop-up
this will pop-up a add associations dialog in which you can pick what two entities to link and how

1284041
associations	model
with this you should be able to add associations and thus relationships between entities on the conceptual side of the ef model without touching the underlying database-schema

1284048
stdin	eof
echo -n puts an eof immediately on stdin

1284048
stdin	eof
netcat -q 0 returns immediately after seeing that eof on stdin

1284079
value	field
following the http specifications the value for the location header field must be an absoluteuri value

1284112
value	field
how do i get the field named value

1284124
updating	updates
it s easy to have one module updates include new extra params in the hashtable without updating the other side

1284127
.net	wcf
the best way of accomplishing this in .net 3.0 onwards is with the windows communication foundation wcf - a generics framework developed by microsoft for communication between programs in various different manners transports on a common basis

1284127
json	xml
although i suspect you will probably want to use named pipe for the purposes of efficiency and robustness there are a numbers of other transports available such as tcp and http see this msdn article not to mention a variety of serialization formats from binary to xml to json

1284138
vbscript	jscript
there is no need to convert everything to jscript you can use utilities written in jscript from vbscript

1284141
contains	elements
i assumed that this would access the span elements parent the li and children the ul contains instead the li but this doesn t seem to be the case

1284163
fadeout	fadein
basically i use fadein and fadeout for jquery - the problem is that everything works fine except in ie

1284163
fadeout	fadein
its really annoying - i am using all the correct filtering etc its just the fadein and fadeout in ie

1284183
regedit	autorun
then you can force it to start the regedit utility and remove the autorun key the autoexec.bat file is rarely used from what i saw

1284183
put	get
once you get to the os you will need to put in some dll s to make most pda programs work but it should do the job

1284186
any	set
there is some operation on which the junit3.jar will be set before junit4.jar but i am not able to find any clue

1284196
progress-bar	progress
how can i get the progress from the output the percentage in brackets and have my progress-bar be set to follow that progress

1284196
progress-bar	progress
if .so how can i do that and still be able to pass the progress to the progress-bar

1284209
stdin	pipe
which you refer to the material coming in from stdin is being pipe from the output of another program

1284215
stderr	stdout
i m afraid i don t want to waste lots of cds testing it out .so i haven t run it but by you re comment it looks like it s not outputing the info to stdout but to stderr

1284215
stderr	stdout
i suggest running a sample cmd directly on the cmd-line and redirecting stdout and stderr to different files

1284215
stderr	stdout
then you can work out which things come out on stdout and which on stderr

1284227
keydown	keyup
the control.keypress event and related keydown and keyup should do what you need

1284231
keydown	keyup
what you search are the 2 events keydown and keyup

1284250
scala	java
code compiled with scala versioning 2.7.5.final running on java 1.6.0_14

1284260
csv	xml
i am working on a web service where the user would input parameters and have the option of have the data returned in various file-format xml html on screens csv etc.

1284261
xml-parsing	tag-soup
there are tools you can use such as tag-soup which will generator proper sax events you can use the same sax xml-parsing code as before but tag-soup will take care of mapping the poorly-formed-html events to proper sax xml events

1284279
webserver	upload
i rarely hit this problem though - usually anything that size can t be upload by a user as the webserver won t allow it

1284295
nsmutabledata	plist
i was previously using initwithcontent.sofurl to downloading a plist into an nsdictionary but this hang the user-interface .when run on the same thread .so now i have move to nsurlconnection the issue is that i can no longer call a methods to init the nsdictionary with nsmutabledata

1284296
hashtable	set
i m looking for the optimal way to compute a hashcode for a set of bi-dimensional points .so that i can store polygons in a hashtable

1284309
web-services	api	web-applications	web-services
the points of web-services is that they are not meant to be accessed directly by a browser - they are an api for other web-applications to use

1284323
duplicates	contains
i also had to work with a code simultaneously contains identifier in italian german english and french not only because it was developed in many different places but also because the main developer thought it was fun and helped him not to duplicates identifier named of course with a routine 2000 line long....

1284349
spaces	output
one thing make sure nothing is send to the output before calling the header function else you might get an error headers cannot be sent if any output like html code or even white spaces

1284361
haskell	scala
this is where scala slightly differs from haskell

1284363
perl	php
in the past i have built highly bespoke solution in perl and or php using javascript jquery et al

1284368
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
this only happens against sql-server but not against oracle and postgresql with similar drop sql queries

1284385
configuration	environment
if you deploy the same code and configuration to both the production and the staging environment you can get up to 4 process

1284401
widget	button
i want to use forms labels button and some other widget types in that pop-up windows

1284405
configuration	installation
i would really prefer something that has a one time license and does not required end user registration only a minimal installation and configuration and ideally is free.

1284406
user-controls	tabcontrol
i want an approach whether to use ajax tabcontrol with 4 tabs with 4 different user-controls or single form and just give look-and-feel of tab

1284415
freebsd	ubuntu	ubuntu-server	ubuntu	ubuntu-server	freebsd
if you re coming from a primarily windows background i think freebsd would be a great way to dive into unix but you may also want to checkout ubuntu linux-- specifically ubuntu-server

1284415
virtualbox	vmware
something to consider-- if you have the hardware run vmware or virtualbox and set up a few virtual machines to get used to various distributions before making the commitment to install a particular one on bare hardware

1284434
aggregate	grouping
granted its not as flash as the devexpress but i ve worked with report service before you can with a bit of effort building report that you can .sort grouping use aggregate and .so on

1284456
private-members	object
for example the results could be assign to private-members of the thread object and guarded with a flag that is atomically by the thread to say it is done

1284464
value	field
is it possible to make ajaxsubmit or serialization grab the disabled field as it s moving through the dom and grabbing value

1284466
value	field
you can make your field readonly this will disallow changes to the value of your controls

1284482
buildpath	libs
i want to add my libs folder to java buildpath which has several jars in it

1284486
value	field
if the value is disabled because it s something like a total field which updates via javascript based on other non-disabled field i d go with cms on making it readonly instead

1284492
controllers	routes
particularly if you are using ruby-on-rails restful routes your controllers should be closely matched to the domain model of your data

1284492
json	xml
whether that data is then presented to a desktop browser to an iphone to a different types of mobile device to a json xml rest api client etc

1284516
listbox	textbox
i have a listbox and a textbox in my xaml codebase on the user-input in the textbox the dataset must get filtering and the list box must only show the relevant rows

1284516
listbox	textbox
for example if the user types in the t in the textbox the listbox must only show words like television

1284516
listbox	textbox
my problem is that .when the form loads the listbox gets filled with 50 words but .when i types anything in the textbox the listbox becomes blank

1284548
32-bit	64bit
you can see what i am talking about just by starting the 64bit and the 32-bit versioning of the command-prompt

1284558
required	checked
i don t know how .net arrays.sort is implements but in .net an access in an arrays required a bounds checked unlike in c++ which could largely account for the performance difference

1284561
remote-server	network-drive
the directory path to the remote-server is mapped as a network-drive in windows

1284590
jquery	.post
serialization the sortable on submit via your jquery .post

1284596
daemons	systemd
the database file is relatively small and will be updates by a daemons process but must be accessible to all users on the systemd via a command-line tool

1284596
linux	osx
on linux i have used variables .lib myapp mydata.db what would be the osx equivalent

1284611
static-class	inherited
but if you don t need it with a static-class you can of course have inherited not sure about interface implementation and data and function encapsulation

1284617
base-class	inherited
in short normals inherited should be used .when you need your own base-class that shouldn t be shared with sibling classes a is a containers b c d are parts that each have a containers e combines these parts bad example why not use composition

1284617
base-class	inherited
while virtual inherited is for .when your base-class should be shared with them

1284619
g++	gcc
which is compiled in codesourcery g++ gcc 4.3.2 for bare-metal arm

1284619
g++	gcc
all files for c and c++ compilation are identical the only difference is the call to compiler - g++ for main.cpp gcc for main.c with difference in the level of warnings and c++ has rtti and exception-handling disabled

1284620
version-control	git
i know one programming contractor that used git to keep tracking on his own work on a proprietary systemd at company who were still using sourcesafe for version-control

1284625
bucket-sort	radix-sort
the idea behind bucket-sort is to use an elements of radix-sort for an initial pass over the input and then use a different sort or an iterated radix-sort on the small buckets which may be small and more easily sorted or the concatenation of all the buckets such as back into the arrays may be sorted with lesser complexity

1284634
implements	extends
if your 4 controls have .so many things in common wouldn t worth the pain to have class for the common stuff and the 4 actual controls extends that class to implements their unique behavior

1284644
fflush	gets
another way to do it would be to simply buffering elements in the queue and .when the queue gets too large fflush it explicit

1284651
decimal-point	digits
to calculate 1000000.0 + 3.14159 you re going to lose most of the digits after the decimal-point

1284658
google-chrome	opera
note display inline-block is only supported in ff3+ ie8+ opera and google-chrome

1284667
subtract	add
the only arithmetic you should ever do with pointerss is to subtract them to obtain an offset or to add a pointers with an offset to get another pointers

1284667
constructor	object
this initialization code is called before entry into main akin to constructor for global object

1284667
put	get
you can get gcc to put variables in a specific data section with the section attributes

1284677
verilog	vhdl
it understands c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a numbers of other languages

1284689
32-bit	16-bit
i have two signed 16-bit value in a 32-bit words and i need to shift them right divide on constants value it can be from 1 to 6 and saturate to byte 0..0xff

1284690
reliability	scalability
scalability and the reliability of the

1284712
logout	login
they are using session_id store the login and logout time for every successful logged in user in a temporary table

1284712
logout	login
what are the others uses of session_id in login and logout temporary table

1284712
logout	login
i just cant figured out the connection and use of the session_id login and logout time in temporary tables.

1284734
controllers	routes
.so if you have a post controllers your routes file is now

1284739
constructor	private
both mutable and immutable classes can either have public constructor or private constructor with static factory methods

1284740
object-reference	instances
this by the way is handled differently in python where you have to explicit put the object-reference in as the first parameter of an instances methods definition though not in the call.

1284781
haskell	scala
scala unfortunately has neither of these properties and .so cannot provide a full equivalent to haskell s where-clause

1284818
classname	inherited
checked the inherited attributes of the aspx page s page directive and make sure it matches the classname in the code-behind

1284834
installation	environment
a big advantage of .msi over .exe is that they can be rebundled i don t recall the correct term by sysadmins for installation over the network for deployment in corporate environment

1284843
void	main
static void main string arguments

1284864
restart	reload
it might seem silly but did you restart or reload your project .so the plugins is loaded

1284872
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in firefox safari google-chrome opera - the search bar and 4 slider from the page linked above are all on 1 row

1284899
hide	next
what if pressing the x without any javascript interference lead to sending a request to the server and in the server side we hide that dialog next time we are rendering the page and also we bind a javascript function to onclientclick of the link and in case of the javascript enabled it will hide the dialog instantly

1284905
export	csv
because of this and because the two columns you want to swap are seemingly of different types int and varchar i think you will need to export the table contents as sql csv drop the table create a table with the structure you want and then import the file you dropped back into that table

1284908
nmake	qmake
then make sure qmake and nmake can be run from the qt command-line without errors

1284926
oracle	mysql
while it is true that setting up and tearing down a mysql connection is relatively cheap .when compared to for example oracle doing it every 3 seconds is a waste of resources

1284946
arrays	loops
basically i pass arrays of popular books to a templates and from the templates i loops thru this arrays and should say if book.is_in_favorites request.user ... but this is not possible from templates

1284948
environment	execution
the interpreter contains the complete execution and debugging environment

1285000
attributes	properties
unless the only thing your application does is properties lookup or you have an enormous numbers of attributes i would not worry too much about overhead here

1285011
rubinius	jruby	jruby	mri
jruby include the ffi api which was originally created for rubinius but is now supported on jruby macruby maglev tinyrb mri and yarv the last two via the ffi gem as well

1285015
put	get
if you use an object as a key in a hashmap or if you put it in a hashset and then change the state of the object .so that hashcode would return a different value then you re confusing the hashmap or hashset and you ll get strange things

1285022
coldfusion	railo
you might look at fusionreactor it lists railo resin support .so it might work for coldfusion resin and you could use the trial to test it or just ask them

1285031
firefox	safari
firefox and safari have -khtml- and -moz-

1285040
web-services	api
the standards api for restful web-services which is going to be include in java ee 6 to be release later in 2009 is jax-rs

1285047
.net	wcf
a windows service or just about any other kind of .net program can hosts a wcf service

1285081
contains	elements
please note that i only need a specific elements to contains the color

1285097
fseek	ftell
google reveals that i need to use fseek and ftell but for that the file apparently needs to be opened in binary mode and that gives only garbage

1285103
background-image	background-color
each report item will have a set of properties such as borders background-color foreground color fonts background-image hyperlink etc.

1285110
implements	abstract
i ve a lot of abstract factory and they re usually implements as singleton

1285112
dictionary	arrays
nsnumber is a class not a primitive and is used .when you need to put raw numbers into dictionary arrays or otherwise encapsulate them

1285112
nsinteger	int
nsinteger nsuinteger cgfloat etc are simple types and correspond on 32-bt systemd like the iphone to int unsigned int and float

1285115
nsinteger	int
nsinteger is just like a traditional int in c

1285115
primitive	int
nsnumber essentially wrap an int or float etc into an objective-c object similar to c# java s concept of boxing a primitive types that can be added to an arrays

1285127
implements	abstract
i see no problem you said my programs don t need more therefore your implements anything more flexible abstract might be a case of you ain t gonna need it

1285136
constructor	object
it probably makes the most sense to store the factory types as a member and pass it to the constructor of new object that need it or create a new one as needed etc.

1285137
double	int
is there any difference in speed .when reading writing to ram and doing mathematical operations on different types of variables such as bool short int int float and double

1285137
32-bit	64bit
from what i understand .so far mathematical operations with double takes much longer i am talking about 32-bit proces.sor i know little about 64bit proces.sor than say operations with floats

1285137
unsigned	short
how about int and short int or even difference between signed and unsigned versioning of each of the types

1285160
unsigned	bigint
at the moment we don t have a way to sense if something is unsigned cause i don t know how but what you would need to do is use ulong for unsigned bigint

1285161
32-bit	64bit
from what i understand .so far mathematical operations with double takes much longer we are talking about 32-bit proces.sor i know little about 64bit proces.sor than say operations with floats

1285161
unsigned	short
how about int and short int or even difference between signed and unsigned versioning of each of the variables

1285168
32-bit	64bit
using 64bit int types on a 32-bit platform will have a penalty naturally since there s no single instruction to handle that

1285176
factory-method	singleton
the problem is that .when you are testing class b and it gets class c a singleton you have no way to mock out class c at least easymock wouldn t allow us to replace the static factory-method of a singleton class

1285178
macports	fink
also macports and fink two oss package-managers for os x use the opt and sw tree respectively

1285178
macports	fink
of course one of the best ways to go if you want to keep things unix-y is to package your .app for macports or fink

1285178
macports	fink
macports is of the bsd ports tree lineage and fink is of the debian lineage

1285205
contact	submit
i m currently using form.serialize in an ajax request to submit a contact form but my problem is that form.serialize grabs all form elements including button

1285212
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox opera and google-chrome or any other browser that correctly implements window.getcomputedstyle is very simple

1285221
subclassing	nsobject
.when i create an nsobject subclassing i always get an empty implementation

updating	updates
by updating the caching each time a new .post is submitted you divide this huge one-time calculation work into small updates distribute onto many request and thus almost unnoticeable

1285241
triggers	insert
secondly you could create a triggers on the table to log after insert and put the new ids in a little audit table

1285254
vbscript	jscript
you will need to building some other jscript functions to assist converting the object into something more easily consumed in vbscript

t.c returns by popping the return address to t.a off of stack and setting the instruction pointers to that value

1285265
pointers	stack
there is no way that thread 1 could see thread 2 because all key data value and pointers to object is stored on the thread s local stack

1285304
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule and httphandler are useful .when you wish to change iis s default handling of document either by changing the behavior entirely or adding pre or .post process to the document

1285308
arguments	default
what you do is your write that templates .so that it takes a big enough numbers of arguments but give default ones to all of them

1285308

then you use template-meta programming to sift through the arguments and weed out the default ones

1285313
pdcurses	ncurses
the ncurses is pdcurses

1285323

32-bit	64bit
wouldn t this be the same as building a 32-bit vs 64bit versioning of the libs

1285446
32-bit	64bit
32-bit depends on 32-bit libs while the 64 depends on 64bit libs

1285454
32-bit	64bit
i m using templates union to both assure myself that i always get a 64bit field for pointers even on 32-bit machines since there is transmission of data to a 64bit machine occurring and to save both the user and myself casting

1285460
contains	elements
html tables have tbody and thead and tfoot elements which contains tablerow elements which contains table data cell and table header cell elements

1285465

then you go and grab the arrays from arrays2 that has the same id as the one we are currently looking at loops through each value and printing the value

1285611
monit	nice
use the collectiveidea fork of delayed_job besides being actively maintained this versioning has a nice scripting delayed_job daemons you can use with monit

1285621
uitouch	uiview
will the view properties of the uitouch still correctly return the correct pixels of the touch points even if the uiview uiimageview is being scale and rotated

1285631
error-handling	try-catch
thus error-handling is relegated to try-catch and return codes are used to return useful data to the client code consuming your methods

1285768
jquery	.post
at the risk of sounding completely self-promoting as well as pushing yet another api on you i wrote a blog .post about implements bing for your site using jquery

1285768
json	xml
the advantage in using the jquery approach is that you can tune the results quite specifically based on filtering passed to the api and playing around with the json or xml soap if you prefer result bing returns as well as having the ability to be more selective about what data you actually have jquery display

1285774
any	set
the second methods of attacking this problem is where i add another set of threads between the worker threads and the saver thread taking one task out of the current worker thread and add it to another thread i also add a queue for each of these threads the application does not seem to gain any speed on my machine as there seems to be too much contention for resources ram bus saturation and processor contention

1285790
nsinteger	int
yes nsuinteger gives twice the range among positive int as nsinteger but i think another critical reason to choose between the two is simply to distinguish among cases where negative value simply do not make sense

1285790
32-bit	64bit
for example a cgfloat uses 32-bit on some machines and 64bit on others depending largely on how much of an efficiency gap there is on those machines for those sizes

1285790
32-bit	64bit
in .some cases there s no real speedup for using 32-bit vs 64bit .so you might as well use 64bit

1285871
google-chrome	firefox
given this html above the css is just the files bundled with 960 firefox and google-chrome centering the grid whereas ie pushes it to the left

1285935
vba	vb6	macros	vba
the thing is i didn t anticipate the .net dll to be used for other than .net .apps .so now i was told this all is going to be used in a vba powerpoint macros which i figure is rather similar to a vb6 .app .so that is how i m planning to test it right now

1285935

1287652
contains	lookup
one simple way to make your current approach faster would be to have a second list alongside the first which stores false true against each numbers .so that rather than doing a contains an o n algorithm would allow a direct lookup which is o 1

1287673
protected	public
thus you can access anything at that points accessible as protected public to that particular page control

1287678

of course .when my_function call malloc itself there is a question of how the allocated buffering is free d

1287680
z-index	overlap
the reason giving a parent elements envelope-1 in your example a higher z-index works is because then all children of envelope-1 including the menu will overlap all siblings of envelope-1 specifically envelope-2

1287680
z-index	overlap
although z-index lets you explicit defined how things overlap even without z-index the layering order is well definedd

1287692
getter	setter
although i usually try to have getter and setter for each private data field because you can easily see any validation for each field

1287696
servicecontract	datacontract
however .when discussing having contracts in a shared libs between client and service typically this would include both service contracts servicecontract as well as the entities datacontract for any parameters to service operations

1287698
getter	setter
having setter and getter in you case is pointless

1287698

click	mouse
i had hoped to use the front end by seting it up using the open-with right mouse click menu option

1287951
return-value	arguments
my suspicion is that all your methodss return strings whereas com methodss tend to return hresult s no idea if this is generally true - actually your example codeproject page seems to suggest otherwise which means you would need to put your input and output into the methods arguments and explicit marshalling them with in out and or return-value

1287958
constructor	object
but my legacy object does not declare a default no arg constructor and i am not able to change the contract because it is part of an api model

1288774
16-bit	8bit
8bit addressable is very common but i work with chip that are 16-bit addressable and 16-bit words size .so sizeof int is 1

1288774
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86

1290799
value	field
if you need to set a value on the field use the spfieldmultichoicevalue types

1290807
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
just tested it in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1290834
linked-list	nodes
where a queue_t comprises a linked-list of nodes each with a field

1290834
malloc	free
the systemd i m on doesn t have a malloc implementation .so there ll need to be a global pool of free nodes and then one of the following perceived issues in bold

1290838
dialog	pop-up
the value needs to be able to be restrict to certain types like bool or float with valid ranges but should also support more complex types perhaps requiring a pop-up dialog .when click and then it can just display a tostring versioning in the windows

1290851
atom-feed	feed
i found this very easy to do with rss feed and linq but i am stuck trying to do the same with an atom-feed

1290860
contains	set
instead of assign the column named directly to the datagridcolumn.header properties i created a textblock contains the column named set the textwrapping properties of the textblock to wrap and assign the textblock to the datagridcolumn.header properties

1290888
intel-syntax	gas
you can have gas work perfectly fine with intel-syntax by putting the following line at the top of your source file

1290901
jquery	dojo
use jquery dojo any other libs instead

1290902
stderr	stdout
foo 2 1 means redirect all of the output including handle 2 that is stderr from the foo cmd to handle 1 that is stdout

1290911
value	field
if the call is guaranteed to already be inside .somemethod then nothing unusual will happen - this is an implicit arguments for methods .so it would never use the value of the field or properties whichever it is directly

1290912
difference	zero	difference	count	digits	zero
.so this makes sure that you have a digits finds out which digits it is by measuring its difference from zero and then increment a count in the corresponding positioning in the arrays

1290940
javascript	dom
if i have two nodes in an html document how can i tell which one comes first in html document order in javascript using dom methods

1290951
strcmp	strcat	strncmp	strcat	strncmp	strcmp
never ever use strcpy strcmp strcat etc.. instead use their safe variants strncmp strcat strndup .

1290951
strncmp	strcmp
use strcmp or better strncmp

1290972
contains	elements	contains	any
the reason this works is because your absolutely positioning elements are positioning relative to the viewport due to the absence of any other contains block

1290973
linked-list	arrays
arrays is a pointers to a linked-list

1290981
z-index	overlap
z-index will still allow the elementss to overlap - it will only dictate which elements is on top

1290982
qtableview	qtreeview
qtreeview or qtableview

1290994
.net	wcf	json	xml
i would suggest if you are using .net to create a wcf service with webhttp bidding and implements get and .post methods you can get response back in json and xml theres a set of classes to parsing json on the iphone that will make parsing the response a breeze they are avaialble in the web with little setup you will be able to perform gets and .post from the iphone using nsurlrequest

1290997
double	int
i have some .dll native c++ programs which mainly return int double value arrays structures and string value

1290997
xsd	xml
i would like to know if it is really necessary to modify my c++ programs and adapt to web service return value such as a xml string file together with a xsd string file

1291000
pointers	stack
with char p you are allocation spaces for holding a pointers bytes on stack

1291002
variables	boolean
will the best .solution be to introduce a new boolean variables dataalreadybeensetandwaitingtobeprocessed that is set in setdata to true and at the end of dolongoperationwith_d it could be set to true .so if setdata is called with this variables set to true it could just return

1291015
priority-queue	heap
but delete and decrease-key both seem to required the priority-queue to be able to find an item s index in the heap given the item itself -- it s clear from the code that at least a few of these methods use an index into the heap rather than the item s priority

1291029
default	reset
i am trying to change the color of a single sifr d nav item in a list to have a different color without reload the page -- .so the others would have to be turned off color reset to default

1291029
hide	show
i m still deciding how i will filtering the map contents on the left either with ajax or a javascript show hide -- hence my need for this solution

1291031
unmanaged	c++-cli
it will allow you to pass your simple and composite types between managed and unmanaged code and you won t have to write any c++-cli wrapper assemblies

1291033
.net	wcf
should i be using something other than wcf to communication between the two .net project

1291052
telnet	ssh
should a basic sockets server like this be accessible via a regular telnet or ssh client .app

1291056
binary-tree	tree
since your shards can be strictly order it seems like storing them in a binary-tree and then simply running a binary-search through that tree would give you the fastest results

1291066
parentheses	braces
cib cib change the text inside the current set of parentheses or braces respectively

1291067
telnet	tcp
windows telnet assumes it s a plain text protocols straight tcp data transfer until it sees .some data it recognizes as a telnet protocols .so if you want to test this .app of yours try that

1291067
telnet	ssh
try to determine the protocols that the ssh and telnet clients you re using are running and lookup their rfcs

1291092
network-interface	packets
a tool like wireshark is good for debugging network i o -- it lets you see exactly what packets are entering and leaving your network-interface in near real time

1291094
display	height
you could either wrap it in a div and set that div s display to none or it s height to zero - i believe that if you set display none on the actual object where the flash lives it won t rendering the flash content

1291096
execute	prepare
the performance benefit comes .when you execute a prepare query multiple time with different parameter value

1291097
ado	jet
thus the only viable methods for working with a jet ace data store in a web application is oledb ado classic

1291111
restart	reload
this program once started cannot be reload or restart that s why i m expecting to have new helpers functionality from the plugins not from the main program

1291117
base-class	inherited
is this kind of inherited possible where the base-class required a constructor with parameters

1291125
.net	wcf
i don t see any immediate issues with this approach - wcf is generally the best choice for interprocess inter-machine communication in .net due to the vast arrays of options it supports via configuration

1291136
factory-girl	webrat
i am using authlogic shoulda webrat and factory-girl and here s my test

1291142
dbd	dbi
nvm no odbc interface but it is dbi like seeing as dbi doesn t use odbc except in dbd odbc

1291142
dbd	dbi
in c similar to the dbi dbd layer in

1291147
cout	cin
a tutorial is talking about cin and cout

1291159
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java	any	set
just read them in and keep a set of the ip addresses and a dictionary from product named to numbers of mentions -- you don t mention any specific language constraint .so i assume a language that will do implicit excellent hashing of such strings on your behalf is acceptable perl python ruby java c# etc all have fine facilities for the purpose

1291179
ubuntu	linux
.so for a start i would like to create a server which manages the game rules and player integration and a client on the local cli i m running ubuntu linux for convenience

1291187
put	get
this works great for get operations and the put and .post operations are about as easy to write

1291220
children	nodes
i haven t ever worked with antlr from c# but following your link to api basetree is clearly not an interface - it s a class and it has public properties types to get types of the nodes text to get i assume source text corresponding to it and children to get the child nodess

1291225
selected	button	show	next
if they selected custom they get a bunch of dialog relating to sql settings as show below with the next button starting the startupmenu dialog if they have selecteded custom install

1291234
linked-list	nodes
because the nodes ctor is a a structure that is private to the linked-list

1291242
numeric	digits
if all of your targets consist of things like foo1 bar22 etc in other words a sequences of letters followed by a sequences of digits and everything else sequencess of digits words without numeric suffixes etc is junk then the following seems to be sufficient

1291243
json	xml
- workaround for that is ajax-y even though the x makes little sense as i suggest json payload not xml ones

1291253
chronometer	stopwatch
here s my two cents on how to turn it into a real stopwatch function without subclassing chronometer

1291262
autoscroll	panels
place the labels inside a panels and set autoscroll to true

1291267
sql-server	mysql
if mysql has row_number then the median is be inspired by this sql-server query

1291268
constructor	object
you have either forgotten to defined in addition to declaring the constructor for list nodes or you have forgotten to link the object file produced from .cpp file with the definition of that constructor into your application

1291270
selected	button
in iphone os 3.0 apple added the ability to shared multiple pictures at once using the shared button and selected multiple uiimage s where a checkmark is used

1291286
factors	matrix
if i m understanding what you wrote then multiplying your matrix by a shape say s2 will scale each of s2 s points by a factors of x

1291288
getdate	dateadd
to duplicates your asp code it would look something like dateadd m -6 getdate

1291289
msbuild-task	msbuild
if you re wanting to combine c# with msbuild you generally do that by creating an msbuild-task

1291290
populate	row
that works fine however the options are populate one click behind - ie i click on accountid in row 1 and the dropdown is-empty however .when i then click on accountid in row 3 the options i set in the row 1 click are show in the row 3 click

1291296
filtering	sorting
make sure your columns are well indexed and the index is used for filtering and sorting

1291300
contains	elements
sometimes the elements contains multiple text nodes as they do have a maximum size in which case you ll need something ã la this from the page linked earlier

1291304
contains	set
this is not an sdk but rather a set of libs that contains code that a lot of other developers find useful

1291307
shell	bash
this is the behavior of the shell you re using presumably bash or similar not python although you can escape characters within python strings too

1291309
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
why does ie not change the background-color on my site for tabs a hover but does .so in firefox google-chrome safari correctly

1291325
scriptaculous	jquery
here s the scenario i m using prototype and scriptaculous but i believe jquery would have the same issue

1291329
windows-server	windows-xp
make sure the task scheduling service is allowed to interact with the desktop as describe in how to troubleshoot scheduled-tasks in windows-xp and in windows-server 2003 also make sure that run only if logged on is not selected on the task

1291343
codeigniter	symfony
likewise symfony and codeigniter will help you with the scaling

1291351
any	set
that avoids any need to worry about hash-function and will work just fine on a million recording set

1291352
firefox	safari
after spending over 15 hours on this issue dedication i know i found a partials solution that works in firefox and safari but not in ie

1291352
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this function will insert the content at the current caret positioning within the iframe that wordpress uses as a tinymce editor

1291362
strncpy	strcpy
i would discuss .when and .when not to use strcpy and strncpy and what can go wrong

1291368
any	set
i know that on the mac that s really not a good idea as an nstextview may redraw at any time if anything has set it as needing display or told it directly to display and would then clobber anything you d draw over it

1291370
contains	any
i know that blogengine.net uses an xmlmembershipprovider and xmlroleprovider but it s covered under the microsoft recipricol license which states that you have to provide your users customers the source code to any file that contains source code from any file that was previously licensed under the microsoft recipricol license and that new file is now under that same license

1291373
put	get
al.so .sounds like this might be one of your first iphone .apps .so you re likely learning new stuff every day - now you get to put all the new stuff in this .app too

1291395
superclass	inherited
for instances methods without inherited from superclass

1291421
contains	set
in the second option first outer.inner is set to contains the address null

1291453
alter-column	alter-table
try alter-table big list alter-column num test character

1291467
boolean	double
now that i think about it might be easier overall to just have a separate boolean value that identifies if there is a elevation height restrictions and then a regular double properties that identifies what the restrictions is if it is enabled

1291474
contains	elements
if you then deserialized a copy of an old versioning the new elements contains the new properties would be missing .so you would correctly leave the properties uninitialized as null

1291477
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have a little project consisting of a root uiviewcontroller which manages 5 other view controllers with a uitabbar i m not using uitabbarcontroller

1291479
vba	vb6
i don t have much experience with vba which is why i m simulating this using vb6 which i know a tiny bit more about

1291479
vba	vb6
.so i m hoping there s other tools methods that i can use which can allows me to properly debugging what s going on between the vb6 vba .app and the .net dll

1291493
pointers	stack
for walking stack and getting frame pointers read the details on the visual leak detection stack walking mechanism which uses stackwalk64 internally

1291507
windows-xp	windows
however .when i use the following html tag-it doesn t work in windows-xp i am not sure other windows

1291546
attributes	properties
you want to always write the xml for the properties but if the properties value is null you want to include an xsi nil true attributes

1291559
directory	folder
i m working with a lot of files in my resources directory and i d like to create folder to organise them

1291559
directory	folder
i ve tried both grouping in xcode and creating an actual folder in the resources directory

1291578
folder	dir
place the file in the cmd folder of your git install dir eg c program files x86 git cmd

1291587
integration-testing	system-testing
there entries for tools etc that support system-testing integration-testing etc in various forms

1291605
contains	any
in any case i have turned off screens updating there is no copying and pasting in the functions the use of variant types is minimal all the data is contains in one sheet i convert all range type-variables to arrays before getting the contents

1291607
put	get
even if you were to put a cert on the other server i think it may still get confused because of different sites can t confirm nor deny though and regardless you don t want to waste the time of your media server by encrypting images

1291613
opengl-es	fps
the problem is that mixing uikit stuff in some views and the eaglview opengl-es call can lead to serious performance issues and fps drops

1291618
sniffing	traffic
it is reasonably secure in as much as the sign on protocols is not vulnerable to network sniffing and it is very very difficult to inject anything into the network traffic

1291636
export	csv
i need to do a big database preload in a php webpage which required an ini_set of 1024mb for a database export in csv format data preload in an arrays

1291642
contains	any
the fix is to either reject somestring if it contains any characters or other nasties or preprocess it with a methods that insert sql string escapes

1291691
any	set
letter single quote followed by any lower case letter is a cmd to move to the locate where a mark was most recently set using the m cmd of course

1291708
authentication	login
currently i have a login dialog box with a formopen boolean properties and an authentication boolean properties

1291708
authentication	login
if a user logs in successfully i hide the login form set formopen to false and authentication to true

1291723
environment	execution
as havenard mentioned however if you are loading this from a webpage then your webserver will automatically clear the memory .when the php scripting finishes execution as the web thread will shut down the php environment

1291743
getter	setter
i left only methods signature for java example and skipped getter setter

1291753
sql-server	mysql
having said that .when i converted from mysql to sql-server 2008 with the same queries and same database structures the queries ran 1-3 order of magnitude faster

1291757
mouseover	mouseout
the live event does support mouseover and mouseout - if you were to use those events instead of hover you d be able to wire them outside of the click event

1291770
ternary-operator	operands
since method-overloading is done at compile-time you can see that the static types of the ternary-operator expression is object since the typess of the operands differ

1291777
punctuation	words
then you d consider any words with two or more punctuation consecutively

1291778
sql-server	oracle	metaphone	soundex
sounds like based on soundex or metaphone is not uncommon option for proprietary full-text-search in databases oracle ms sql-server or open source search engines such as lucene

1291788
.net	wcf
ws-discovery will have a way of getting around this limitation but you d have to wait till .net 4.0 or use one of the open source implementation for wcf 3.5

1291798
textbox	button
invisible textbox and a button to .post to database.

1291798
textbox	button
.when i click on the link button i want to show the textbox

1291808
compression	streaming
i also wonder if you may get better results in this case using table.writexml streaming perhaps with compression such as gzip if spaces is a premium

1291812
javascript	dom
is there any way for javascript in my iframe to make changes to the parent s dom

1291812
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera	iframe	popup
edit also firefox 3.5 opera google-chrome etc seem to be adopting the html5 postmessage api which allows secure cross-domain data transmission between frame iframe and popup

1291813
textbox	button
if you are not using javascript ajax then on the link button s click event set the textbox s visible value to true

1291813
textbox	button
if this is a cmd field or a button field that you are using then you can use the rowcmd and the e.cmdargument to now which row you are on and then set the textbox to true

1291813
value	field
if you created a templates field with the link button then on the cmd arguments for the link button set it s value to # ctype containers gridviewrow .rowindex

1291830
hashtable	set
len yourstring - 1 and then simply checked each of those in a set or hashtable

1291831
hashtable	set
words existence could be done with a trie or more simply with a set a hashtable

1291836
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
what is the difference between using the wrapper class synchronizedmap on a hashmap and concurrenthashmap

1291836
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
is it just being able to modify the hashmap while iterator it concurrenthashmap

1291848
worksheet	excel
excel then reads the downloading html into a worksheet

1291856
contains	any
this will allow any subdomain that only contains valid subdomain characters

1291861
linux	unix
i was using that .when i wanted linux unix utilities on windows

1291889
contains	set
however this approach fell over .when i came to implements the filtering and order of query set of musicians based on the data contains in a single user dataset

1291894
authentication	impersonation
ideally you should be able to use windows impersonation to use the client kerberos ticket to authentication and do things on behalf of the client

1291896
textbox	button
on my home page i have a textbox that .when the submit button is click passes the year value typed in the textbox to the action methods results in my archive controllers that takes one parameter year

1291926
show	next
.so for instances given the letter t the letter h is more likely to show up next than any other letter

1291954
hash	md5
you could md5 the resulting mysqldump on the server and the transfer locally by rsync then compare the two hash to ensure they match

1291963
show	next
next you have to decide what the criterion is for picking one item out of the many that match the same productid if 3 items have the same id which one do you want to show

1291982
communication	messages
also at what points in the wcf communication are you trying to intercept these messages

1291984
primitive	int
other primitive types wrapper such as int also have a similar methods

1292007
meta-inf	jar
.when you sign a jar file new files get added to the meta-inf directory mksign.sf and mksign.dsa

1292009
accessor	ivar
in objective-c if the using the getter and directly accessing the ivar do exactly the same thing no lazy-loading code in the getter all it does is returns the ivar would you still use the accessor or access the ivar directly since there is no difference

1292032
firefox	safari
it refreshes safari and firefox but as i said it only works the mac

1292033
protected	public
first of all the default visibility for ivars in objective-c is protected .so unless you explicit make them public you have to use an acces.sor

1292033
subclassing	accessor
aside from this you use the accessor because you never know if you or someone else might subclassing your class and change it enough that using the accessor is necessary

1292033
getter	setter
using both getter outside the class and setter is good practice

1292075
csv	xml
say csv xml or tab separated

1292096
selected	checkbox
this is needed to provide false value if checkbox is not selected

1292096
selected	checkbox
because of according to w3.org the value only gets posted to server if the checkbox is selected otherwise it is not .so you don t know if it is true or false eg is null

1292096
selected	checkbox
.so if you selected the checkbox true false comes to the server and you can safely assume the value is true

1292096
selected	checkbox
if the checkbox is not selected the false comes to the server and you can be sure it is not selected

1292098
communication	messages
typically a windows service and then communication with it to start it process and to receive a messages .when it s done i generally use msmq

1292099
any	set
the struts2 parametersinterceptor will then pick this up an try to set your properties either with string or any kind collections

1292102
unix	aix
nick meyer s answer is correct on windows and aix but is unlikely to be correct on every other unix platform by default

1292104
value	field
my theory is for some reason the database is ignoring some of the value that are being sent from the form but the validation is still recognising that all field have been completed

1292104
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine with any modern browser firefox google-chrome safari ie7 + 8 but is falling over on 6

1292104
value	field
what would be the possible cause for the value not getting sent to the database even though the user is getting a checked mark appearing next to the field as if there has been a successful updates

1292109
put	get
and don t use a wildcard .when you both want to get and put from to a structure

1292134
expression	evaluation
you can compile an xpath expression using libxml without evaluation it

1292158
execution	restart
if set to transparency the browser definitely will stop its execution music local connection network etc and might also restart the movie

1292164
ole-automation	com
qtp supplies a com interface for automation inorder to create the automation object you need to use activexobject see this article on using ole-automation in javascript

1292170
selected	cell
actually you have to selected a cell first then all the cell on that row will paint correctly

1292170
selected	cell
if you don t selected a cell of a row all the cell on that row will not paint accordingly .when the mouse is over them

1292170
selected	cell
i think this is some kind of optimization of the grid such that .when you selected a cell the underlying object of that row is activated and the grid will call paint methods .when invlidatecell methods is call

1292176
droppable	draggable
because one of the droppable is configure tolerance intersect it s possible for a draggable to be dropped on more than one kind of droppable at the same time

1292176
droppable	draggable
none of the droppable overlap but the draggable is large enough to overlap a droppable with tolerance intersect while the mouse pointers is over another droppable with tolerance pointers

1292189
python	c++
i am used to the c++ way of for loops but the python loops have left me confused

1292190
delta	diff
the first change is to get rid of the first occurrence of delta replacing diff

1292202
exception-handling	error-handling
.when to go for error-handling and .when to go for exception-handling

1292203
web-services	webserver
i think spring web-services can be configure to run in a fake webserver as well - there is a discussion on this on spring web-services forum for sure i needed the same thing but ended up using a webserver due to other issues

1292209
droppable	draggable
are you going to calculate percentage of the draggable on each intersection droppable

1292219
directory	folder
i have all my web application contents inside a directory user-interface page of web folder

1292222
web-config	app-config	configuration-files	web-config	configuration-files	app-config
from that you should be able to gather that now you have duplicates code and duplicates configuration-files that both gets treated as the main app-config web-config

1292237
signals	sigpipe
i am developing an application in cocoa which consists of a client part written in java listens for a request from server like reading some songs or files from client machine sometime this works fine but some time an exception-handling like recieved signals sigpipe occurs .i have no idea about this exception-handling and how to handle this

1292258
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page that rendering differently in google-chrome .when compared to firefox

1292276
culture	locale
and invariantculture is .so called culture agnostic locale

1292277
selected	button
it works in new form mode where the control is responsible for setting its own value the control include a button that .when you click it gives you a pop-up and you selected which value of lookup data you want

1292295
any	set
without any code i d have to take a guess and say that your scrollview is not set to fill_parent

1292309
python	php	python	c++
in python for bucles aren t like the c++ ones they re most like php s foreach

1292319
margins	padding
ie7 is already consistent with all common css styles properties which i would defined as colors backgrounds borders fonts styless and placement margins padding spacing wrapping

1292329
implements	extends
1 you are right you cannot extends this but here are two alternatives one is to avoid the need for extendss this at all and making use of what is provided such as using viewdata and the other is to implements your own

1292340
value	field
in the example show a messages somewhere and selected the field in the gui with the illegal value

1292346
checkbox	button
i have a button while click the button i just produce a div contains some checkbox

1292346
selected	checkbox
if the user selected the required checkbox it will produce a iframe according to the value of the checkbox and the div will disappear

dialog	pop-up
if you are using asp.net you can checkout the ajax control toolkit which has a modal pop-up dialog

1292359
dialog	pop-up
jquery pop-up dialog

1292380
profiling	debugging
the difference is in the profiling you are using for code-sign where for debugging building you re using your developer .profile and for the distribution building ad-hoc or app-store you need to create ad-hoc or app-store profiling respectively

1292396
show	next
the tricky part is in xaml i need to styles this collections such that all items with the same grouping named are listed next to each other and the grouping named is show at the top

1292421
build-process	nant
you use nant s built-in ability to copy files and do variables substitution through filterchain to dynamically generator your web-config file during the build-process

1292432
droppable	draggable
maybe in the over event of the less preferred droppable you could checked if the draggable is also over the preferred droppable and if it is disable the less preferred droppable

1292433
asp.net-mvc	wcf
anything that supports the domain model in an framework-neutral way no references to asp.net-mvc wcf wpf etc. belongs in the domain model

1292487
configuration	logging
the main reasons you should not use jul is that it implements the bare minimum that you need for logging the configuration is hard at best and if you use any component that doesn t use it you ll have to deal with two logging frameworks

1292508
click	mouse
and you get to browse the different versioning and have a nice diff view just one mouse click away

1292510
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you wanted a finer grain control over the process you can use the writeobject readobject methods that the objectoutputstream objectinputstream use as part of the serialization process and you could combine that with some custom annotations or any logic you wanted

1292511
double	int
i ve kind of solved this problem by changing the sorting to sort double instead of int

1292511
double	int
my problem is that i want to sort the double value by int using the function stable_sort

1292531
svn2git	git-svn
i m moving a project from svn to git completely .so no need for git-svn s svn interop features and i ve tried using both git-svn and svn2git nirvdrum s fork on github and one problem i ve got is that our repository layout in svn was like .so

1292531
contains	any
otherwise a directory that shouldn t be the root of the repository and contains other unrelated code will have to be the root of the repository in git which is strange and for some reason with svn this was not the case the root of the repository was base and the parent directory did not have any svn stuff

1292547
configuration	environment
as this is a public intranet site you are updating presumably there is already a test environment for it that is close or the same in configuration

1292565
drupal	modx
i am mainly an asp.net developer but recently due to low resourses at work i ve helped out with a few modx and drupal sites

1292565
drupal	modx
i didn t take to drupal at all but i love modx really love

1292574
macports	fink
can anyone recommend a good fortran debugger for the mac other than installing gdb etc via fink or macports

1292590
contains	elements
in firefox .when you hide a dom elements that contains a sl .app the sl .application is re-initialized

1292594
javafx	swing
if you need to embed javafx inside swing i recommend to take a look at this hack

1292602
archive	backup
mysqlhotcopy works only for backup myisam and archive tables

1292602
csv	xml
however mysqldump can also be used to generator files in csv other delimited text or xml format

1292604
short	base
if your base types and not int types char int short long-long long types will not be promoted .so assignment will fail

1292633
web-applications	scalability
c++ can and has been used to successfully develop highly scalability web-applications

1292659
pointers	stack
sara is the struct itself not a pointers the variables representing location on stack where actual struct data is stored

1292670
modifiers	final
under the code styles tab selected use modifiers final where possible in the variables declarations section then ensure parameter is selecteded

1292672
any	set
i was wondering if there is any function in jquery which will allow me to call a generics function which will set the alt or value or innerhtml based on the nodetype

1292688
hide	show
however from a software design-view i ve always tended to have each layer have their own collections of members .when doing editor - it makes operations on the layer better encapsulated show layer hide layer selected only from one layer move layer to top etc

1292691
data-access	ado.net
rather than using ado.net natively the orm layer can help reduce the amount of error prone an repetitive data-access code that you right

1292692
appdata	temp
c users tfsservice appdata local temp release sources source trunk themes

1292735
asp.net-mvc	wcf
asp.net-mvc teamsystem linq wcf etc.. i know pluralsight.com offereing on demand video training with latest contents

1292744
png	gif
anybody knows of a good java libs for retrieving mime types and dimension of a jpeg gif and png image file in java

1292759
datagrid	textbox
now the default for a textbox binding is oneway maybe since its nested in a datagrid its default behavior is different

1292767
shipping	tax
you can collect personal company payment details then shipping payment addresses and then present the user with a final confirmation screens showing tax delivery charges before process the order

1292770
thickbox	jquery
how to change the jquery thickbox windows dynamically .when the browser windows reduces or increases please help me to solve this problem

1292780
contains	any
but my repository doesn t contains any updates

1292805
macros	vba
i have written a vba macros to do some stuff in excel and i want to know if the following is possible

1292805
selected	button
the protection needs to be strong enough that even if they press alt + f11 and pull up the macros the edit button options need to be greyed out even if the macros has been selected

1292874
export	report
export a datagridview to an excel pdf image file by using report service report generator

1292874
export	report
another way is to use crystal-reports after generator report from datagridview you can use crystal-reports to export the report to pdf

1292883
primitive	int
you can have a dramatic increase in performance with smaller types floats 8bit int etc if you can use simd primitive

1292883
double	int	primitive	int
the simd primitive can pack eight 8bit int operations or two double or 4 floats etc into a single operation that gets parallelized in hardware

1292889
json	xml
followed by xml and json .when it comes to ajax and automated access to the web application

1292896
switching	screens
sending cameraarguments .when invoking the .app which .appears to be useless and now i was thinking a solution could be as simple generator a back key event before switching back to my .app which would theoretically dismiss the annoying edit screens

1292901
ref	out
an out arguments is just a ref arguments with the outattribute applied to the parameter

1292954
scriptmanager	updatepanel
we use the asp.net updatepanel and the scriptmanager scriptmanagerproxy for ajax related functionality

1292961
any	set
once you have these basic join set up - and indeed any other complex queries that result from the separation of class instances data in a way that may not be convenient for your code - consider creating a view or a stored procedure to perform them behind the scenes .so that your application code doesn t have to worry about it any more

1292974
subclassing	nsobject
the member not being recognized is a properly declare and synthesized properties of an nsobject subclassing whose .h file is properly import in the uiview .m file whose drawrect function-calls the nsenumerator

1292975
local-variables	class-members
in php you have to use to access variables or methods of the current class this is necessary to distinguish class-members from local-variables

1292978
value	field
in the constructor body you have an option to do extra initialization but only if you wish - change field value call other methods whatever

1292981
default	reset
unfortunately it seems that a fresh new actioncontext is created .when the action is invoked and the locale is reset to the default

1292982
constructor	object
therefore it s safer to access this within the constructor body you can be sure that the object is initializer at least in respect to its base-class and upwards

1292988
protected	public
also consider to add visibility to your methods and members public protected private

1292993
environment	building
this depends on the building-system you use but you can always try adding the cflags -std c99 as a building and or environment variables the the buildinger

1292995
ofstream	fopen
i am using mkdir to make the directory and ofstream i tried fopen as well to write the files to a solid state drive i m doing speed tests for comparison

1292995
ofstream	fopen
i ve tried putting a delay before each write in case it was some kind of overload and also tried using fopen instead of ofstream but it always stops writing the files around the 1000th file mark

1293014
export	csv
i have an access db and am looking to export the tables to csv

1293026
while-loop	infinite
is it possible to read those response whenever they are written just like having an infinite while-loop on inputstream of http url connection in java

1293040
.when	ready
now the problem is that on different views i need to do different things .when dom is ready

1293040
slidedown	slideup
for example lets assume i want to slideup elements with id id1 on view1 and slidedown elements with id id2 on view2

1293046
selected	textbox
it is very easy to selected specific textbox

1293055
textmate	emacs	auctex	latex
i use ii2 to manage latex software for the back end and i have used both textmate it has a very nice latex bundle and emacs with auctex as front ends

1293055
aquamacs	emacs
you can get a nice baked-in latex experience in emacs by using the aquamacs distribution i can t use it because i have a non-english keyboard with no aquamacs-specific mapping

1293057
binary	hex
i ve just reverse engineered a binary with ida and loaded hex ray to checkout a specific function

1293098
configuration	installation
i use carbon emacs for file-writing and editing i don t recall any installation or configuration problems getting it to work with latex

1293110
python	php
php python asp jsp c#.net all should work

1293130
keyboard	mouse
if you really want an elements that isn t a link but which can be activated as normals by mouse or keyboard what you want is a or is just as good for simple textual contents

1293140
keyvaluepair	key
if items source for combo box is a dictionary selecteditem is of types keyvaluepair types of key jobtypes

1293142
expression	evaluation
i m pretty sure you can somehow do it with lots of regular expression but at some points you will end up with writing your own scripting-language like the smarty guys did with parsing your view file creating a syntax tree evaluation it and compile it to a new php file

1293155
constructor	object
i mean if for root class in the hierarchy you have let s say 3 or 4 parameters then in it s derived-class you need to call base constructor and pass additional parameters for derived part of the object and .so forth.

1293169
arrays	loops
i can t loops through the arrays removing object 1-by-1 and setting to nil because i m not allowed to modify an arrays during iterator

1293182
shell	bash	cygwin	gnu
if you need anything more complex i d suggest installing cygwin or gnu tools and using the bash shell or unix-like utilities from that something like

1293193
subclassing	superclass
subclassing that have constructor parameter lists that differ significantly from their superclass is another example of a class doing too much

1293193
subclassing	superclass
if a subclassing truly is-a superclass then it shouldn t required significantly more data to do its job

1293194
constructor	object
for classes whose construction really is complex consider using the builder or factory-pattern to initializer these object in a readable way - unlike methods named constructor parameters lack the ability to self document

1293195
constructor	object
don t use constructor to initializer the whole object at once

1293195
getter	setter
for a typical hierarchy like you will have getter and setter to retrieve and change the various properties of the object

1293199
pagespeed	yslow
1 install yslow and pagespeed extensions for firefox and follow their advice where possible

1293213
contains	set
can you just get a wrapped set contains the and then use the .css cmd to set the appropriate value for it

1293227
firefox	safari
firefox 2 firefox 3.5 safari 3 and

1293234
firefox	safari
in case it is any solace to you the url you posted here works nicely in firefox but it does not work in safari 4 safari 4 only show the image at the end not the countdown

1293243
configuration	environment
you could put phpinfo at the top of your scripting to printing all your environment variables configuration settings etc

1293250
javascript	dom
if everything else fails you can use javascript on the client to navigate the dom and add the attributes in onload

1293257
push	pull
it permits execution only of server-side git cmd implements the pull push functionality

1293293
decimal	hex
maybe there are other html entity references in there like eacute which would be valid now we have iris or numerical character references in both decimal and hex

1293294
javascript	dom
in other words work with the dom elements using javascript prototype functions instead of the mojo object

1293317
versioning	upgrade
this happened because as soon as a client sees a working copy it upgrade it to its current versioning

1293324
gridview	listview
i don t think there is any points in using a listview if as you say you cannot use gridview or any other view

1293331
controllers	routes
if you run rake routes in the root of your project it will give you a list of all of the routes currently setup and if it s a blank ruby-on-rails project then there will not be a route to handle the .post to your file2.html although you don t really want to be .posting to a static file in public you should be .posting to a controllers

1293337
static-methods	unit-testing	implements	final
i m trying to implements unit-testing for aproject it uses a legacy utility project that is littered with static-methods and many of the classes are final or their methods are final

1293337
easymock	jmock
jmock and easymock both choke on final methods and i don t see a nice way to test the static call

1293341
linux	osx
using gcc4 in mac osx linux and windows

1293344
easymock	mockito	powermockito	easymock	extends	final
alternatively you can use powermockito which extends easymock and mockito to allow mocking of final and static-methods

1293344
powermockito	easymock
powermockito is a framework that extends other mock libs such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1293344
constructor	private
powermockito uses a custom classloader and bytecode-manipulation to enable mocking of static-methods constructor final classes and methods private methods removal of static initializer and more

1293347
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
here are some ways to do it in ansi iso aka should work on any sql dbms mysql sql-server and oracle

1293347
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
be advised that my suggested ansi iso methods will typically be much slower than the other two methodss but if you re using a sql dbms other than mysql sql-server or oracle then it may be the only way to go if your sql dbms doesn t support merge

1293348
versioning	upgrade
upgrade one of your svn clients .so that they are at the same versioning preferable

1293355
messagebox	alert
.when i first load the page in safari it show the alert before the applet has finished loading .so the messagebox display undefined

1293361
python	php
i ve programmed in php for 2 years and then switched to python and have about 3 years of experience in it

1293361
python	php
we have suitable resources for both php and python project

1293376
callback	methods
plus i always found it better to defined ready callback as an anonymous methods then named one

1293379
internet-explorer	safari
in particular internet-explorer versioning 9 and safari 3.2 definitely don t support it although internet-explorer 7 and safari 3.2 do support first-child curiously

1293395
contains	any
therefor a variables can contains any types and therefor no ide can guess what is the types of your parameter nor give you code-completion for the methods

1293397
versioning	migrate
i would attempt to migrate the codebase to the more recent versioning of php

1293399
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
one option that works for sql-server oracle and mysql

1293405
python	php
this are just some things you have to consider before presenting with your boss with a php sucks let s use python instead speech

1293409
buffering	streaming
you can find that you run out of spaces before the clr limit of 2 because the backing buffering in the streaming is expanded in a doubling fashion and this swiftly results in the buffering being allocated in the large object heap

1293409
compression	streaming
if you are doing this .so that the data can be compressed then consider using streaming compression

1293409
compression	streaming
any block based compression streaming can be fairly easily converted into a streaminging mode with the addition of padding

1293410
python	java
with that said you really need to abandon the idea that you re going to find any ides that work as well for python as they do for java or c#

1293422
build-process	release
is there a way to get qt 4.5 to work with ltcg release build-process

1293424
javassist	bcel
alternatively you could use a libs like bcel assembly or javassist

1293429
value	field
a session bean creates an entity instances and stores it with field a set to value 1

1293429
value	field
a session bean looks up an entity with id 4 sets its field a to value 2 and saves it

1293433
mta	sta
the single-threaded application model required that no single object live in more than one sta thread at a time verses the mta thread model

1293433
mta	sta
you can read about sta and mta threads from the msdn article at

1293440
delphi	c++
as a professional i have to admit that i prefer to use delphi instead of c++ for any win32 desktop development

1293440
delphi	c++
doesn t mean that delphi or c++ is more powerful than .net since .net is gaining quickly on the gui application level

1293440
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight is going to promise a lot of new possibilities for developers

1293440
delphi	c++
another reason why many people are still using delphi c++ for win32 is because they still have lots of legacy code

1293451
.when	ready
place them afterwards and the dom will be ready before they are loaded because it s complete .when the closing tag is parsing which as you have found will not work

1293477
low-level	hardware
c is mainly used for low-level programming such as for hardware devices

1293499
postgresql	mysql
has a significant algorithmic performance benefit in postgresql or mysql implementation .when scanning the indexed column s or whether the unique keyword simply introduces a unique alongside the index

1293503
constructor	object
also it is fairly hard to inject anything to a static-class because you don t control the static constructor in any way - that s why i tend to pass all the object i want to inject as parameters

1293513
sql-server	postgresql
in sql-server and in postgresql for instances if you sort on a unique-key the optimizer ignore the order by clauses used after that since they are irrelevant i

1293513
innodb	myisam
an index always contains .some kind of a pointers to the row ctid in postgresql row pointers in myisam primary key uniquifier in innodb and the leaves are order on these pointerss .so in fact every index leaf is unique is .some way though it may not be obvious

1293518
ftp-client	ftplib
i m developing an ftp-client in python ftplib

1293522
abstract	sealed
there are never any instances of static-classes they are both abstract and sealed in the il .so the clr will prevent any instances being created

1293542
any	set
i d recommend creating a simple client application that polls that server to query for any problems and returns a set of status messages

1293542
user-interface	tray
then an appropriate user-interface would be raised balloon on the tray an email sent etc

1293542
contains	any
contains any warning or failure messages

1293547
any	set
i m not sure if you could or should also specify the details of the service binding - in a sense it s not a part of the wire protocols any more than the fact that ports 80 on stackoverflow.com will only serve a particular set of urls but of course it is a vital part of understanding what can happen on the ports in question

1293568
header-files	stdafx.h
in visual-c++ it is customary to #include all your non-changing header-files in stdafx.h

1293568
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
the stdafx.cpp will have an individual settings that instructs the compiler to generator stdafx.pch and if you have some source files that doesn t include stdafx.h you can set individual settings on these to not use precompiled-headers

1293617
linux	bsd
you could invest a lot of work into recognizing different versioning of windows and linux as well as bsd or macos - and it would probably take a lot less work to remove the checked from the compiled code once it s out there

1293628
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i m checked the view outlet at viewdidload and viewwillappear with nslog statements

1293628
viewwillappear	viewdidload
.when i selected an item from the table view though viewdidload gets called again followed by viewwillappear and i get these

1293640
getter	setter
know that wpf optimizes dependency properties access such that the getter and setter of your clr wrapper are not invoked

1293650
any	set
expectations to be set on any kind of

1293652
python	perl
the pre-fork example from the perl cookbook does not have any sort of locking around selected and chris siebenmann s python example says it s based on apache but uses paired sockets for the scoreboard not shared-memory and use the sockets for controls include the control for a given child to a ccept

1293683
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview that is inside of an updatepanel

1293693
perl	awk
i mention awk because even if you don t have access to perl sed and awk tend to be both install

1293700
arrays	loops
.when assign variables in the controllers to the view and i have a recordset i tend to loops through that recordset and push them onto an associativity arrays

1293713
sip	sdp	sip	rtp	sdp	rtp
i ve read that this is possible with sdp and rtp and i ve found multiple examples on how to defined a sdp rtp body in a sip packets

1293720
environment	building
if not then clearing the building environment cleared a little bit too much

1293741
hash	md5
if an md5 hash is almost unique for a unique id then what is wrong from md5 ing a uniqid

1293764
hide	show
i also want to show and hide this panels control onmouseover and onmouseout event

1293769
hash	md5
a md5 hash is 128 bits wide and doesn t guarantee uniquess only a low probablity of collision

1293769
hash	md5
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid .so it doesn t help with storage

1293769
sequences	unique
a monotonically increasing sequences bounded by unique machine identifier typically a mac and time is still a perfectly valid uuid but highly predictable if you can reverse engineer a single uuid from the sequences of tokens

1293769
mersenne-twister	generator
mersenne-twister is an example of such a generator

1293774
tuples	sorted
store the string size offset tuples in sorted order by string and use a binary-search for the string

1293775
base-class	inherited
an approach i have taken with a numbers of forms mainly multipage but same applies for single page is for each form page to inherited from a common base-class which has a numbers of properties

1293780
hide	show
you can use the display properties to show and hide panels

1293788
key-value	key
the extended properties dictionary key - value configuration snippet should log all key-value pairs in the extended properties dictionary

1293788
configuration	logging
that the policy specified in the handleexception methods is configure for logging with a loggingexceptionhandler in the configuration

1293789
httpwebrequest	webrequest
i m using the webrequest object and i ve tried using the httpwebrequest object

1293800
jquery	.post
i need to run a .post on the jquery .when a button is click on the user-controls

1293821
value	field
both key and id are present in the db whether you put a field in your class using the encode key syntax just gives you access to this value

1293826
thickbox	jquery
i want to use thickbox the popular jquery modal pop-up box but unobtrusively

1293836
double	int
byte to short int long float or double

1293836
double	int
short to int long float or double

1293836
double	int
char to int long float or double

1293836
double	int
int to long float or double

1293836
double	int
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision-that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

1293852
callback	methods
i would put the code in the callback of the load methods

1293860
salt	md5
the advantage of md5 -ing the output along with an application-specific salt string or random numbers is a way harder to guess string

1293861
display	height	display	width
using maxpower47 s suggestion about re.solution the only way to display the page on the other monitor would be to open a pop-up and use the options to set the top right width and height properties .so the windows will appear on the second monitor in a decent size

1293866
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the site loads and display perfectly .when viewed with google-chrome firefox and safari but break .when viewed with ie8 both sidebar disappear and only the main content windows is visible

1293867
double	int
the choice could certainly have been made to required all implicit-conversion to lose no information at all - .so int and long to float would have been explicit and long to double would have been explicit

1293867
double	int
int to double is okay

1293867
double	int
a double has enough precision to accurately represent all int values.

1293872
json	xml
if you had many search field another way would be to have a controllers with a list action returning json xml or an html table that you could call using an ajax get

1293888
restrict	shared
assuming your setup allows this of course - on a shared hosts you may be restrict

1293893
python	php
the problem is your boss who knows php but doesn t know python

1293893
delphi	basic
i also made it clear that visual basic would be less powerful than delphi since delphi had much better database-aware components

1293893
pascal	delphi
but delphi was pascal and he knew nothing about pascal and couldn t be bothered to learn more about it .so he chose to develop in powerbuilder for new project

1293896
arrays	loops
if i know the length of an arrays how do i printing each of its value in a loops

1293899
any	set
in general you can set the title of the current view to be any nsstring object .so

1293902
boolean	int
that is it s roughly identical to an arrays of boolean except you pack your boolean into a large int

1293902
boolean	int
for instances if you had 8bit int you would store 8 bits boolean per int which would further reduce your spaces requirements

1293907
command-line	cmd
for years i have used the cmd dos windows-shell and passed command-line arguments to batch-file

1293908
uiimage	nsdata

python	php
if you can demonstrate that python out performs php in these areas then its going to make a saving for the company

1293981
triggers	insert
however for the best performance if you created a new table clustered index on startdate+callid that contains both the start and end dates of a single call possibly using a triggers .when the evid 0 insert with start date and .when evid 1 updates end date then the derived table could be removed with this new table

1294141
derived-class	base-class
for onevent methodss if you don t call the base-class methods then the event will not be raised that s the responsibility of the base-class methods. if the base-class performs some kind of state management inside of the onevent methods this means that the derived-class can accidentally invalidate the state of the object if the user chooses to omit a call to the base-class methods

getter	setter
getter and setter get internally translation into standards methods such that the runtime has no idea whether some getter or setter is associated with a certain properties

1294288
getter	setter
however there is an important software engineering benefit your code tends to be easier to understand if you restrict yourself to use getter and setter with get and set semantics

1294288
getter	setter
your class could provide two properties kilometers and miles with respective setter and getter

1294295

i get that you are saving code by not having to declare a private variables but what s the points of a properties .when you are not using any get or set logic

1294682
cvs	git	version-control	git	version-control	cvs
you may also need to use a version-control systemd such as subversion cvs git etc. to get the source but not all the intricacies -- most project i ve seen want you to submit a patch before giving you commit access

1294686
attributes	properties
changing a data attributes to a properties will force existing clients to recompile before they can interact again

a cast to unsigned short would probably prevent that from happening but the best way to be sure is to mask off the bits

1294787
.net	wcf
clemens vasters the technical lead for the microsoft .net service bus that means both remoting as well as wcf talks about wcf vs

1294801
versioning	upgrade
.when application starts the db upgrade code compares current db versioning and code versioning and if the code is newer - looks into scripting folder and applies all db changes automatically

1294801
versioning	upgrade
this way every instances of application on production or developers machines always upgrade db to their code versioning and it works great

1294804
linked-list	queue
given your implementation this may seem a little strange but they probably intended some kind of linked-list implementation of stack which has the advantage of not having a predefined upper limit in which case the queue inherited from stack makes clear design sense

1294808
contains	any
run it on any directory contains those pesky files

1294810
queue	fifo
for a fifo queue you need two stack -- to quote the

1294826
queue	fifo
typically a queue is fifo while a stack is obviously last in first out

1294826
queue	fifo
a fifo queue would just be a stack with enqueue being push and dequeue being pop

1294826
queue	fifo
that doesn t make any sense as an exercise .so i d definitely assume a fifo queue was intended

hide	show
positioning the link as you d like it to appear on hover then hide it with javascript and use the onmouseover event to show it

1295026

from there assuming component art has good well formed markup you could consider parsing the html as xml and pulling the cell value out to turn into your csv

1295028
beautifulsoup	mechanize
pyparsing mechanize and beautifulsoup are include with twill for convenience.

1295048
moss	wss

i ve read with interest the techniques available on the web to extraction a unique list of items from a xml file contains duplicates using xslt

1295210
aggregate	grouping
and i would like to grouping based on the aggregate data

1295216
boolean	int
and i m not sure but i think the result-of bitwise-operators is going to be an int even for boolean

1295218
difference	factors
i m not sure if the gwt factors makes a difference but in general

1295218
primitive	boolean
boolean is a java primitive types whereas boolean is an object-reference types that wrap a boolean

export	csv	show	next
the next issue is that .when i go to export the ods to csv i m getting a timeout exception-handling on the selected methods of the ods show below

1295357
contains	any
the base types is concrete not abstract .so it is perfectly acceptable for the collections to contains instances of the base types and or the derived typess in any combinations

1295360
python	perl
if i could execute an external python perl scripting to do this that would be fine also but i think that there is perhaps a better maveny way to do this

1295364
bamboo	hudson
not to mention it seems to get all the integration love .when it comes to things like continuous-integration cruisecontrol.net bamboo hudson etc...

1295367
for-loop	loops
i am stuck with a bunch of foreach loops and would like to know if there is a way to hone them down to a simple for-loop or a recursive function

1295425
keyboard	mouse
i prefer the command-line because i have a shell window.open in the source anyway to run building and tests and along with file named completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295435
web-services	api
i have an windows application written in wpf and wf which also interacts with external web-services and a local copy of quickbooks via quickbooks api

1295440

1295480
callback	methods
java applet had some callback methods to do that but how would i do it in javafx running in browser

1295484
constructor	object
however since you re creating the object in mainwindow s constructor you can set the datacontext in the code-behind like .so

1295485
buffering	capture
as an example i just recently encountered the new-in-5.10.x named capture buffering

1295489
basic	vb6
vb6 had a basic versioning should work for most needs of the crystal-reports engine in it

1295498
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
it goes over the use of execute and sp_executeutesql and discusses sql-injection in depth within the context of dynamic-sql

1295502
account	api
having said all that i would still rather make a web application front-end in flash flex than html javascript css since the latter needs a sharp learning curve that gets quite bewildering after a while since you have to account for the good design aspects of css and javascript and the bad ones too - and also the peccadilloes that javascript css inherently have and those which are introduced by the javascript libs vendor yahoo s yui google s ajax api scriptaculous etc

1295505
windows-xp	windows	selected	checkbox

1295591
create-table	alter-table
you can t do a meaningful diff of create-table and alter-table

1295594
contains	any
at any rate i wouldn t be overly concerned with the efficiency or speed of this operation there are plenty of other things that you will likely be doing that are far more wasteful and expensive than initializer an arrays of arbitrary length contains zero

1295627
javascript	dom
i think you re getting it confused with the standards javascript this reference which will give you the current dom object

1295652
value	field
there are a numbers of field in your selected and grouping by clauses which from the their named sound like either primary key value such as memberid or field likely to be very unique such as dateentered this last one probably include time info as well. any one of these field could prevent your query from doing any kind of groupinging at all

1295671
arrays	loops	key-value	key
but javascript arrays aren t really arrays they re key-value maps just like all other javascript-objects .so there s no pre-allocate to do setting the length doesn t allocate that many slots to fill nor is there any rea.son to believe that the benefit of count down to zero which is just to make the compari.son in loops fast isn t outweighed by adding the key in reverse order .when the implementation may well have optimized their handling of the key related to arrays on the theory you ll generally do them inorder

1295679
arrays	loops
loops allocates each myclass instances into that arrays

1295689
selected	cell
if you want to get the selected cell use the

1295697
attributes	properties
i want to deserialize this attributes value into the properties with types of nullable int

triggers	insert
is it possible using triggers in postgresql to create updates and insert sql statements of changes that have happened to a table and log them to a file for later execution

1295796
data-access	nhibernate
you can still use nhibernate to read from your data store but you might want to make it obvious by creating two different classes to encapsulate your data-access

1295797
build-system	autotools
the software written in c++ uses the autotools build-system mdash

1295800
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade an asp.net-mvc project written with the beta versioning of the framework to the use the full 1.0 versioning

1295800
contains	any
none of the errors have any line or column numbers and most of the views contains hardly any server-side code at all

1295805
javadoc	doxygen
there s also a way to generator your own xcode compatible documentation with doxygen just like you could with javadoc

1295812
highlight	selected
the brackets highlight is working .so i know that it is loading but the smart tag will not appear the three dots in a box below selected text

1295861
constructor	object
.when you extends the prototype of a constructor function all the members that reside on it will be inherited to the object instances created with the new-operator

1295861
constructor	object
.so you defined this methods only once in your constructor function and it will be accessible in the context of each instances the this keyword inside the methods refers to the object instances

1295868
stderr	stdout
what you can t do however is access stdin stdout stderr without a console

1295890
progress-bar	progress
is there a way that in my c# forms i can force my taskbar progress-bar to match the progress of whatever task i m doing

1295904
postgresql	mysql
super smack originally a load-test tool for mysql it also supports postgresql and it include a generator of mock data

1295929
attributes	properties	contains	elements
there is a list on mozilla developer centering which if you ll look carefully contains an elements properties important for you because form elements may be accessed as direct attributes of the form object

1295953
logout	login
user click logout link and .when the user click back it will be a new request and by that time you can checked if the session is logged in or not if not redirect to the login page

1295970
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
there are silverlight plugins for ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1295977
elementtree	lxml
personally whenever possible i d start with elementtree preferably the c implementation that comes with python standard-library or the lxml implementation but that s essentialy a matter of higher speed only

1295977
celementtree	lxml
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1295981
markup	xhtml
in this example load.php should return the markup source not rendering xhtml

1296025
configuration	installation
for each installation use the listen directive in the configuration file to selected which ip-address or virtual hosts that daemons service

1296025
ip-address	hostname
it is recommended that you use an ip-address instead of a hostname see dns caveats

1296044
handler	service
in the file upload event handler call a web service on the non-admin domain with necessary details named content etc

1296104
google-chrome	firefox
alright i got the ul s to show in firefox and google-chrome

1296105
touch	drag
on the touch ended event i want the image to continue to animate along the path in the directions of the drag

1296123
triggers	insert
two pairs of triggers are generator per fk before insert and before updates on referencing table and before delete and after updates on referenced table

1296149
selected	checkbox
i want have this ability to selected multiple items with checkbox and delete them in one place

1296159
proxy-pattern	lazy-loading
i am familiar with the proxy-pattern for lazy-loading object

1296166
.net	wcf
i hear that wcf is the new standards for communication across the network and applications in .net

1296166
.net	wcf
on the .net side server i would like to use wcf while the ruby side client will be chewing gum and duct tape

1296181
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
rows that contains named and lastnamed in any single column should be excluded from the result set rather than only rows that contains named and lastnamed in every column which is going to be unlikely

1296181
contains	any
the only option available seems to be to checked if the user query contains any exclude value eg

1296185
32-bit	64bit
the executable doesn t have to be able to run on different os es but ideally there would be something possible with automatically selected 32-bit and 64bit as well

1296206
python	perl
you could probably do this with a bash perl python scripting or windows scriptinging hosts on windows

1296208
vba	vb6
vba vb6 392 chars w formatting

1296214
put	get
secondly i can t get the onresize event to fire regardless of whether i put it on the canvas or on the surrounding box

1296224
instances	private
it seems as though different instances of a class can know about each others private member variables

1296224
private-members	instances	private-members	object
can anyone explain why private-members of object are accessible to other instances of the same class

1296226
.net	wcf
other binding you will have to use soap headers and such to communication with your wcf i have not done this myself but im sure theres info out there on how to do it for non .net applications

1296232
.net	wcf
you don t mention which side .net or ruby will be the server but i would expect that this will be much easier to do if you hosts the service in wcf and consume it from ruby

1296256
abstract-class	accessor
my opinion is that even in abstract-class using private-members and protected accessor protected getbuddy is a better practice

1296263
subtraction	addition
as far as i know bitwise operations are the cheapest operations slightly faster than addition and subtraction

1296263
multiplication	division
multiplication and division operations are a little more expensive and comparation is the highest coast operation

1296269
contains	set
because of this limitation the output in the c# versioning of the application is that instead of 255 as expected the buffering contains a set of 254

1296274
contains	any
is there any editor which will allow me to specify the contains tag of a block and follow normals html syntax rules to limit what can be added inside the block

1296276
arrays	loops
get rid of the crazy arrays logic just have one loops to set the colors of all classes that coincide with winning numbers to green

1296289
export	csv
import into outlook and then export as csv is still probably the quickest solution but libpst would certainly be useful if all you have is the pst file and no outlook

1296293
carbon	cocoa
is there a systemd call to change the look-and-feel of scrollbar in cocoa or carbon

1296294
hide	show
and you just show or hide it

1296311
nested-class	inherited
but i have an unclear understanding of alex martelli s code of singleton utilizing inherited instead of privated nested-class

1296373
duplicates	contains
assuming the delete logic is not contains in the action itself but rather some conditional checked and the like that call the correct business-logic it doesn t make sense to duplicates the structure of the delete action .when i can instead have a private methods that returns an actionresult which i call in both actions which can cause a delete

1296378
triggers	insert
the rowid is generator .when the row is insert .so it would not be available in a before triggers

1296379
while-loop	arrays
i m using and a while-loop to iterate over the arrays

1296384
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
php python ruby c# etc.

1296389
contains	any
any string that doesn t contains characters

1296394
put	get
in addition to that i advise you to read your web service might not be restful ifâ as just properly handling get .post put delete is not the all that is needed to be really rest

1296397
datepart	getdate
.when i do for example datepart mm getdate i get the result-of the month being 8 for august

1296399
multiplication	addition
if the multiplication unit is being used by another instruction perhaps we can find an addition instruction to execute instead for example

1296406
administration	account
all administration are stored locally and required full functionality to manage their account reset-password etc

1296406
authentication	login
by this i mean integration the login authentication systemd with both and assign them a role based on which database confirm their credentials

1296408
contains	any
to be clear it does not match any string that contains or

1296414
dump	temp
i would use a temp table to dump shipmentid s into that match your otherinfo where-clause

1296432
export	csv
obviously there is still some plumbing in process one of the converted formats into sql but if import into outlook and then export as csv is not an option libpst would be a good alternative

1296448
linux	osx
neil butterworth already suggested making separate dynamic libs but that required some non-trivial cross-platform considerations manually loading dynamic libs is different on linux windows osx etc. and getting it right will likely take some time

1296453
json	xml
if you want any technology to be able to consume it i would not use activeresource and would create xml or json that suits the data

1296456
stateless	stateful
don t try to wedge a fundamentally stateful integration into a stateless model just because you read about it on wikipedia

1296471
any	set
if a user hasn t set any filtering then this object will be empty

1296472
sql-server	mysql
it is different than mysql or sql-server where there are thousands of resources available but quantity is matched here with the quality of the documentation

1296511
realloc	free
in particular will the underlying arrays used by the python list implementation continue to grow indefinitely have millions of spots even though the list only has a thousand things or will python eventually do a realloc and free up some of that memory

1296512
windows-server	windows
originally i install subversion 1.5.6 for windows i run windows-server 2008 on my server and i made a repository for a project

1296519
response	timeout
we have timeout set to 30 seconds and we almost never wait that long for a response

1296552
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i have too little experience with postgresql or oracle to judge .so i will just stick with not recommending mysql

1296560
plugins	add-on
if as you ve said to lucky you can confirm this is a firefox issue then have your users disable all their plugins add-on and try again

1296563
sql-server	postgresql
ms sql-server postgresql db2 progress openedge almost anything will do if you create proper indexes

1296568
order	add
within the comments collections you can add edit remove order etc

1296568
order	add
that way you don t cloud the main namespace if say you wanted to also be able to add edit remove order etc a list of references editor moderators historical snapshots whatever not saying you would want a collections for each of these many most you probably wouldn t

1296575
teradata	oracle
but seriously if you want a high-end database look to oracle teradata and db2

1296578
arrays	loops
if you change your for loops to use these 2 value rather than the arrays bounds it will solve your problem and will work for both single and multiple rows

1296595
constructor	object
it may seem obvious to put the remaining initialization into helper_readyevent but that would result in the constructor returning prior to the object being ready for use

1296595
constructor	object
since the classes using the confwizard object assume once the constructor returns the object is fully ready for use returning prematurely is not desirable

1296600
oracle	mysql
mysql will work for smaller apps but to answer your question if you are truly concerned about db performance i would go with oracle if you can afford it but if you are like the most of us who can t use an 80 000 database i would suggest ms sql it works well

1296601
instrumentation	profiling
however i suggest testing such optimizations using a profiling such as instrumentation just to make sure you re not over-complicating your code for not a lot of benefit

1296628
lookup	any
i have a numbers of lists and document libs that have been in production for some time with some lookup field dependencies between them - whats the best way to replicate this within a non-production environment and ensure that any features are compatible between both environment .when deployed

1296642
order	add
this is .so that as each module is initializer they add their view into a tabcontrol region and the order of the tabs needs to be deterministic and controlled by the module author

1296676
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
microsoft sql-server mysql oracle and db2 can all handle millions and millions of rows without a problem

1296681
contains	any
the rmdir function fails if the folder contains any files

1296684
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i ve tested all combinations of pre-allocating not pre-allocating count up down and for while loops in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5 google-chrome and opera

1296684
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the functions below was consistently the fastest or extremely close in firefox google-chrome and ie8 and not much slower than the fastest in opera and ie 6

1296692
haskell	python
python none haskell nothing etc.

1296703
linux	unix
i know on linux i can get this from the proc directory but i would like to do this on unix and windows as well

1296704
contains	elements
if you want to contains r5 sort pile by the lengths of its elements before joining as in

1296717
.when	ready
one alternate solution is let the form show even .when the helpers class isn t ready and redirect all actions on the helpers class to a queue of actions that get process .when it is ready

1296717
.when	ready
then .when it s ready you go through and process all the actions

1296719
versioning	upgrade
by default .when using a new versioning of a subversioning client it will upgrade the repository to that versioning

1296721
sql-server	postgresql
i ve used ms sql-server and postgresql for databases of that size before both work great

1296727
sql-server	oracle
i can speak most to oracle and sql-server

does anyone know of any other way to traversal the result set from a stored proc via a cursor

1296767
repository	entity
i then inherited the repository class and i can then add methods that are specific to that entity

1296770
directory	folder
either copy the python .lib directory to the ironpython folder or set ironpythonpath

1296799
removeclass	addclass
to prevent your row styles from vanishing put them in a css class and use addclass and removeclass instead to apply them bearing in mind that if they re not in a class then they don t exist

1296802
put	get
if you put it in an external file this won t get evaluated and that scripting text will be in the javascripting file on the client which is not going to work because it doesn t have the proper id

1296813
display	width
what else is needed to display image to full tableview width

1296816
linux	aix	linux	unix	unix	aix	sunos	aix	sunos	unix
there s libstatgrab which doesn t seem to be very actively developed it already supports a decent variety of unix platform though and the very active psi python systemd information which works on aix linux sunos and darwin

1296830
button	popup
.when i click on a button it immediately popup an error file-not-found vba6.dll

1296835
sql-server	oracle
sql compare - sql-server not oracle

1296843
difference	zero
in c there appear to be difference between various value of zero -- null nul and 0

1296867
row	col
you could add an id to each cell something like cell- row - col

1296885
value	field
in a database it means there is no value in a field which is not the same thing as saying the field is blank 0 or filled with spaces

1296897
beautifulsoup	html5lib
maybe beautifulsoup or html5lib

1296903
uilabel	uiview
i am new to interface-builder and i would like to have a screens which containss a 3x3 grid of a uiview each of which contains a uiimageview and 4 uilabel

1296921
instances	self
i keep tracking of it with nslog initializing server-communication instances p self

1296925
macros	vba
i m looking for a way to printing a words document programmatically with vba in an outlook macros

1296928
32-bit	64bit
pointers context - null is used and means the value of the pointers is 0 independent of whether it is 32-bit or 64bit one case 4 bytes the other 8 bytes of zero

1296928
digits	zero
string context - the character representing the digits zero has a hex value of 0x30 whereas the nul character has hex value of 0x00 used for terminating strings

1296932
lookup	any
phpwhois is a scripting for php that allows you to perform whois lookup on any domain

1296936
xmpp	sip
now typically with shared-hosting you can t install any low-level service to talk protocols like pop3 imap for email sip or xmpp and for instant messaging

1296949
nsnotifications	observers
i bet you add your server-communication object as an nsnotifications observers but never remove them

1296953
contains	any
any class that uses either of the above examples could not be tested independently of the class that contains the truncatetosize methods typemock aside

1296963
sql-server	mysql
in no cases were anonymous types faster in linq-to-sql against sql-server linq-to-entities against mysql and linq-to-objects against a list

1296970
specifications	w3c
this agrees with description in document object-model dom level 3 events w3c specifications chapter 1

1296970
private-members	private	static-variables	private-members
alternate solution would be to use closures to have private static-variables as describe somewhat in private-members in javascript by douglas crockford and in example 3 encapsulating related functionality in comp.lang.javascript faq notes javascript closures

1296972
sprite-sheet	tile
you should have all your tile in one big textures atlas sprite-sheet and instead of rebinding your texturess you should just bind your atlas once and then draw small parts of it

1297009
selected	button
but since the submit button is below the form tag you can use the closest function to selected the closest form

1297026
listitem	selected
i m selected a listitem as i add it to a listitemcollection

1297026
listitem	selected
is there a way to make the dropdownlistfor selected the selecteded listitem from the listitemcollections or any other types of collections

1297041
rollback	commit
is there any way to commit my insert that have them saved even .when a rollback is issued

1297045
32-bit	64bit
compilers linker need to support cross-platform compilations - you might be building for a 64bit target on a 32-bit platform and vice-versa and not have the correct architecture dll present

1297045
hide	show
.lib files enable you to hide certain parts of your implementation - you could have private export that do not show up in the .lib but are discoverable via getprocaddress

1297048
private-members	object
after all the one who writes the class decides if she needs to access private-members from object passed as arguments

1297065
output	mode
in debugging mode scriptsrc might output something like this

1297067
environment	building
then append it to your systemd environment s path variables then re-run building active blackberry simulation and you should see

1297107
display	height
i m using the current jquery to hide fade out a notification div and then remove it however .when it completes there s an odd gap around the height of a - meaning that subsequent forms and page elements don t display where they were before the notice appeared

1297119
32-bit	x86
on x86 the obvious algorithm translation into adding 500 and then a long multiplying by 274877907 followed by grabbing the most significant 32-bit from edx and shifting them 6 bit right - .so it beats this code above hands down 5 time time performance difference

1297126
32-bit	64bit
thus on a 32-bit architecture null likely is 4-byte and on 64bit architecture 8-byte

1297126
linux	unix
this is the common datamodel used by other 64bit unix systemd from sun and sgi as well as 64bit linux

1297126
g++	gcc
the above code returns 4 on gcc and 1 on g++

1297137
nskeyedarchiver	nsarray
is this recommended for something as simple as an nsarray of custom object that are serialization with nskeyedarchiver

1297144
implements	extends
zend_rest_client extends zend_service_abstract which in turn implements a gethttpclient methods which returns a zend_http_client instances which exposes a getlastresponse methods which returns a zend_http_response instances which once again exposes a getbody methods

1297147
ruby	php
i ve used capistrano with php even though it s more of a rails-y thing as it s written in ruby

1297159
having	union
any scalability benefits you might gain by splitting the table are offset by the complexity of having to do these union queries

1297180
rhino-mocks	moq
i usually use moq which uses castle .so you might consider it instead together with of rhino-mocks

1297197
32-bit	64bit
the performance promise for the 64bit world is that instead of sending 4 bytes at a time abcd a 64bit computer can send 8 bytes at a time abcdefgh .so the alphabet is transfer between different areas of memory up to twice as fast as a 32-bit computer

1297197
32-bit	64bit
in the real world 64bit desktop proces.sor by intel et al are not really true 64bit proces.sor and still are limited to 32-bit for several types of operations .so in the real world the performance between 32-bit and 64bit applications is marginal

1297205
g++	gcc
edit to clarify things i m using gcc g++ 4.3

1297232
arrays	map
replace each with map and it will return an arrays with the results of invoking the block on each elements

1297239
dictionary	arrays
json does not allow trailing comma in arrays or dictionary object

1297248
python	ruby
another option which is that of in house built test harness - a simple tool over the top of a scripting-language groovy python ruby that allows qa to put test data into the application either via a gui or via data files

1297249
push	pull
it allow full round-tripping of revision full clone pull and push however as of this writing xxx amend this if .when it becomes incorrect it is still in development and there are not yet official release

1297249
any	set
the cmd set is typically though it aims at being integrated to the points that you don t need the svn part it wants to treat a subversion clone as much as possible like any other mercurial repository

1297249
push	pull
up until recently this only let you clone and pull a subversion repository but as of hgsvn 0.1.7 it supports push

1297249
revision	svn
it puts a local tag on every changeset to mark its svn revision

1297249
revision	svn
it puts every mercurial revision on a named branch named after its svn branch

1297256
arrays	map
use list util shuffle to shuffle a list of indexes and map the results onto the arrays

1297263
shopping-cart	cart
i m making a drag and drop shopping-cart using jquery and foxycart the drag and drop work but i don t know how to automatically open a link inside the drag elements once item is dropped into the cart

1297263
shopping-cart	cart
the link for adding to cart is hidden using css but i need it such that .when i drop an item in the shopping-cart it will open this hidden link because the link opens a modal box and add the item in the real shopping-cart provided by foxycart

1297270
callgrind	valgrind
for this you need to be running in linux which i think you are and have the callgrind and valgrind programs available

1297275
put	get
.when you say go and create a medication you put or .post to the medications resource and you get a reference back to that medication

1297275
put	get
for example they re usually a side effect vs explicit managed via get put delete

1297275
json	xml
then i would store the filtering as an xml or json document whichever is more comfortable appropriate for the application

1297285
dojo	gwt
openlayers gwt integration exists but the esri libs is based on dojo

1297306
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to the latest versioning from 2.0 and i have a feeling that this has something to do with it

1297340
interface-builder	iboutlet
since it is an iboutlet you can wire up the delegation like any other delegation in interface-builder

1297342
required	checked
i have checked following links there are suggesting to create working set.i am not happy with that because i have browse down to each package and selected the required resource

1297354
core-audio	openal
openal covers most audio cases nicely and it is tied to the core-audio .so playback speed is never lagged

1297365
arrays	loops
this way you can iterate directly over shuffled_pairs without needing to keep an extra arrays for the indexes and avoid c-style loops

1297382
serialization	casting
casting is an important part of object oriented life and i wish i could find a better way to do it than ugly serialization hacks

1297410
shell	bash
the documentation says that ccsh compiles bourne shell not bash ... scripting to c code and that it understands how to replicate the functionality of 50 odd standards cmd avoiding the need to fork them

1297414
contains	elements
checked the rounded corners of the main tabs in this site those are background images with width of 440px and still it adjusts to the contains elements without loosing the rounded edges

1297418
sql-server	ms-access
before anyone even says syntax of ms-access is different than sql-server t-sql remember that with adp everything happens on the server and one is actually passing thru to t-sql

1297422
value	field
.so my current approach implements a couple of methods to convert this linq model into a pure domain model which is nearly an identical object but just replace the id field with their actual textual value strings

1297427
jquery	.post
the submit button on that form post to my controllers via ajax using jquery .post

1297427
javascript	dom
on the client side in the completion javascript function i have to differentiate between the success and failure cases because the dom target for the returned html will be different

1297427
contains	elements
i guess i could inspect the html for some known elements to differentiate the cases but it seemed to me that a better solution would be to return a jsonresult that contains a boolean status in one field and the html in another

1297448
associations	model
how would you go about making the associations between these model

1297463
bazaar	git
i m attempting to find a bazaar workflow i like and being a regular git user i can t avoid using git as a reference points

1297463
.when	ready
.when a branch is ready i cd into trunk and run bazaar merge .. branch1 commit the merge then bazaar push to push changes into upstream

but since it contains a few html elements not just pure text a no-wrap doesn t seem to work in all browsers

1298285
display	height	display	width
i suspect this is due to the display block in the li elements but they need to have fixed width height is there a way around this

1298307
if-statement	loops
this might be completely unrelated to what you were trying to ask but php comes with automated test scripting .so that anyone can test that basic language functionality variables if-statement loops etc are working correctly

1298353

the above only hide the sibling right next to the current one

1298355
default-value	default
.so why do the controls use compatible text-rendering by default if the default-value of the properties is false that seems to be.

1298355

add a xml namedspace for the local assembly and namedspace that contains your new base-class and remember you keep the x class attributes at the top of the file but modify the user-controls root elements to be the local named

1298416
contains	set
if a treeset contains object a then object b is considered part of the set if a.comparator b returns 0 even if a.equals b is false .so if comparator and equals isn t implements in a consistent way you are in for a bad ride

1298419
order	add	assign	add
you could add a computed column to your selected list using case where you have assign a value to that column based on the occurence of the search term in the columns of interest and then order by that column

1298459
webforms	asp.net
as for the tech side of your question i developed my project in vs2005 using asp.net webforms and web-services with a sql-server back end .so stack that you re looking at is definitely capable of delivering a working product

1298459
masstransit	nservicebus
the biggest thing i would change now if i was going to start again would be to replace the intermediate web-service with messages based service using nservicebus masstransit or the like

1298573
web-inf	maven
for maven .war project it is slightly more complicated there is also the src main webapp directory wherein maven expects to find web-inf web.xml

1298574

if this is a true custom control derives from control you d want to use a plus you should probably also connect to the textchanged event on the textbox after setting up the templates part in the onapplytemplates methods

1298599
specifications	w3c
the w3c specifications maybe of some help though it s not the easiest read

1298617
swing	swt
we also had this question in company and decided to go with swing because for normals desktop-application you just cannot sense the speed difference which is supposedly on swt side and this speed you are buying with ruining wora principles you have to bring with your application needed .dlls or .so files to natively support your application running in desired os-es

1298625
controllers	routes
now you need to set up the routes and controllers to do the following

1298639

button	popup
i want that .when user click on button the calendar will popup next to the button

my company is performing a svn repository migration and i would like to avoid overlapping of revision numbers between the two repositories which are both active at the time being

1298810

did you try to put the nonserialized attributes on the properties as well

1298815
updating	updates
what s the best and most correct way of acheiving this - should can i create a custom model binder that links to an object via it s unique id and then create each record-object in the session updating them as i go through each one s page flow and then finally calling the updates methods

1298817
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
using pure objective-c cocoa and pdf kit iterate on the pages of your pdf document and for each one create an nsimage whose size is that of the media box of the page lock focus on it tell the page to draw create an nsbitmapimagerep with the focused view the image unlock focus on the image then ask the bitmap image rep for the jpeg data and write that data to the file

1298881
instances	private
instances field private to lowercamelcase

1298882
lookup	any
this solution works with extensions of any length but is less performant than the hash lookup of course and slightly less performant than the original solution

1298884
cvs	git
we have now reached the points where we want to migrate to something better and i am considering that using git masquerading as a cvs server might be exactly what would suit us in terms of learning curve

1298892
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i am using a uinavigationcontroller side note inside a uitabbar which by default gives you a uinavigationbar on the top

1298893

however that s .when the .app dies the selected table cell is still blue from where the user t.apped before

1298898
callback	methods
in that callback methods i try to set value on some of the control s parts that i retrieve from onapplymethods using the gettemplatechild methods

1298905

the last option doesn t do any resizing it just copies the hash from the set and increment references

1298909
postgresql	mysql
here i m using mysql as master_database for some model and postgresql for some other model

1298909
postgresql	mysql
stack-trace show that it is still using the postgresql adaptor to access my mysql model

1298911
default	reset
this assumes that the default styles is from a styles sheet if it isn t you ll have to reset it manually

1298944

1298956
xsd	xml
i have an xsd and i want to verify incoming xml files from a webservice against that xsd for schema validation

1298963

1298993
hide	show
i ve got the following piece of code that show a pop-up and then hide it after a short period of time

1299004
32-bit	64bit
in that case you have to use the 32-bit versioning of ssis due to the fact that there is no 64bit drivers for excel jet engine and there never will be

1299018
python	java
how can i checked from inside a java program if python is install in windows

1299023
textbox	button	textarea	textbox
button textbox textarea fieldset and dropdowns are different across browsers and platform

1299026
selected	button
you could then listen for the key pressed events on your canvas and based on which key was pressed left right up down selected etc you could updates which of the button is now in focus using a simple index into your data structure

1299026
selected	button
now .when you listen for the selected key press you will know which button has the focus and therefore which action to perform

1299028
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
finally although i risk comparing apple and oranges but isn t think more like asking do you want rapid website development asp.net webforms swing or more control on your html asp.net-mvc ruby-on-rails

1299030
any	set
is there any way that urlreplacer can be set up .so that the configuration page is only visible to certain ip addresses

1299036

edit redsquare has pointed out that the above will not work in firefox and google-chrome as those browsers will append a tbody elements to tables

1299038

modified modified the user decides which value to keep maybe on a field by field basis

1299048
value	field
the query plan show that the index is being used and on different surnames and various value for the other numeric field the query can be instantaneous

this is the simplest and fastest way to shuffle nsarray or nsmutablearray

1299054
associations	model	has-many-through	model	has-many-through	associations
this kind of associations belongs in your model a has-many-through relationship is perfect for this

1299062
python	java
use the java runtime to execute the following cmd python --version

1299100
parentheses	let
as others suggested wrapping this with parentheses to create a temporary variables will still let you invoke the anonymous-function

1299120
debugging	trace
if it is not possible to debugging your code for whatever reason - write a trace file - i think the solution will fall into your lap

1299125
google-chrome	firefox
i think firefox google-chrome etc will add the tbody in for you therefore the selector should be

1299147
stderr	stdout
you can even capture the stdout and stderr streaming from the ffmpeg process and use that information to for example drive a progress-bar or display errors

1299154
json	xml
it work fine with xml but .when i use json then error showing in jquery.base.js as

1299171
selected	button
the only way i can think of approaching this scenario for a non-js user is to have a form button that will reload the php page and append a variables to the url and then the php will detection this and send the value to the child selected

1299175
value	field
if there isn t a unique-index you will end up with duplicates value in the new table mdb even in autonumber field

1299178

1299191
safari	opera
more people use safari and opera and a lot of people don t even bother to test their sites on those browsers

1299200
arrays	loops
...otherwise it will be reseted every time loops is run and there will be only one marker in the arrays at index num - 1

1299212
filtering	grouping
you can simply load all possible value into the second selected with option grouping for reliability and use javascript to filtering them once a parent is selecteded

1299244
required	checked
you ll have to write a function which checked the buffering named and sets the mode if required and add it to the hook using something like the following in your .emacs

1299250
instances	private
as a design practice you could use a naming conventions for private properties that s different from normals public members - for instances using m_itemname for private items instead of itemname for public ones

1299272
contains	elements
i have a vector contains large numbers of elements

1299272
if-statement	loops
since performance is a major concern i don t want to put an if-statement inside loops

1299273
base-class	inherited	instances	private	getter	setter
i don t know c# but in java you may have a base-class with only private instances-variables and public setter and getter should return a copy of the instances var. and do all other in an inherited class

1299276
getter	setter
at least in c# you can have adders and removers for events like getter and setter for properties

1299296
keydown	keyup
set the form s keypreview properties to true handle the keydown and keyup events tracking which function key s are pressed and call the invalidate methods on the button for each key the went down or up

1299401
textarea	textbox
if i have a textarea or textbox with its value set on serverside to eg

1299427
required	checked
this i believe would required you to have access to a lot of serverfarms around the world as blizzard does with wow or you will have to invent some sort of intelligent p2p hosts that will upgrade itself to subserver .when then bandwidth is big enough and enough player are close in proxsamity of it always checked the lag from its points of view.

1299434
