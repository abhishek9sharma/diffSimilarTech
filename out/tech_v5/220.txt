2200003
constructor	object
to beat this particular problem you could use object and just bind in constructor some of common used parameters to object s members

2200033
specifications	w3c
w3c s specifications

2200039
perl	php
regex is normally very similar between languages in fact i can almost always copy between javascript php and perl with only minor adjustments for their wrapping functions .so if that is working regex then you should be able to ports it easily

2200045
implements	abstract
an alternative would be to have a abstract image newinstance arguments in your image class and implements it in your subclassing

2200056
worksheet	excel
however .when attempting to save the excel worksheet as an xml worksheet i get warned that the image will be lost

2200063
sql-server	oracle
likewise are there some issues that might arise between different databases oracle and sql-server that might affect how the columns are handled

2200087
administration	account
reregister this time make sure that you are running regsvr32.exe in a administration account with uac turned off

are there any simple libs for this types of network communication for php c# that automatically reads from the socket until the messages is done and then send an event to the game controllers

2200134
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql any datatype is implicit convertible to boolean

2200134
sql-server	oracle
which is impossible in sql-server and oracle you need to have some kind or a predicates there

2200141
children	tree	children	nodes
this starts with the root nodes of your tree as those items whose item_parent does not exist in the table as item_id and selected all children of those nodes along with their depth in the tree

2200153
auctex	tex
if you dig around in the auctex sources you can probably find the regex it uses on tex output buffering

2200154
gridview	listview	selected	listbox
i d like to have the selected item of a listbox on the right to look like the selected item of a listview with gridview on the left

2200195
click	mouse
for example somewhere in mouse click handle

2200196
debugging	trace
another good considerations would be disabling trace debugging mode to false and turn off features of dotnetnuke that you don t use scheduling is the first one to turn off

2200205
where-clause	sql
standards sql disallows references to column alias in a where-clause but you can use the alias in grouping by order by or having clauses to refer to the column

2200214
boolean	int
that s great and works fine but one thing that i have .so far not been able to find explained anywhere is whether the dictionary value-type are supposed to be specific int long float boolean or generics strings that the managed service then parsing converts into a suitable form by itself instead of expecting the correct value-type

2200221
debugging	trace
i d recommend using messages inspectors if you plan to do anything with the request response otherwise trace viewer would be better for debugging types checked as langdon suggest

2200289
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework an entity object cannot be referenced by multiple-instances of ientitychangetracker

2200289
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework an entity object cannot be referenced by multiple-instances of ientitychangetracker

it reminds me of c just as vhdl reminds me of ada

2200296
verilog	hdl
for a verilog book i recommend these especially verilog hdl

2200325
contains	elements
the tag can only contains inline elements

2200329
cassini	iis
however .when i encrypt my web-config and i m using cassini not iis on my machine it doesn t seem to use the newly created section in my machine.config

2200329
environment	restart
and to try to prove that my custom key is used i change a character in the decryptionkey value and restart the dev environment

2200342
arrays	loops	input-field	selected
.so loops through the forms input-field i only have textfield but if you have radio or selected you need to change this a bit look elsewhere on this site for tips on how to loops through a field and then building the arrays

2200369
value	field	lookup	any
if there is any way i can checked it programmatically and then perform an action for example if it is a lookup field then if i want its value i need to do..

2200383
required	checked
should resources.designer.cs be checked in or can i rely on visual-studio generator it .when required

2200397
arrays	loops
is there a way to remove them from the without having to loops round detection if string is-empty then adding to new arrays

2200417
defined	declare
you have just declare your static-members inside the class but haven t defined them yet

2200448
.when	ready
.when ready to merge with trunk merge trunk changes to your branch

2200452
shallow-copy	deep-copy
the only thing that you should maybe be aware is that you get shallow-copy and deep-copy

2200452
deep-copy	object	shallow-copy	deep-copy
shallow-copy only makes a copy of an object at the root level where as deep-copy will produce a copy of an object and all its child object

2200486
difference	factors
for c for example the difference between the fastest and slowest implementation is a factors of 100000 or .so

2200486
declarative	imperative
in general running well-designed code on well-designed high-performance execution engines will yield about the same performance independent of whether the language is static or dynamic procedural object-oriented or functional imperative or declarative lazy-evaluation or strict pure or impure

2200486
smalltalk	lisp
take for example smalltalk lisp java and c++

2200486
smalltalk	lisp
in fact several modern high-performance jviewmodels are actually either smalltalk viewmodels in disguise derived from smalltalk viewmodels or written by smalltalk viewmodel companies. lisp is also interesting because although it is a dynamic-languages there are some although not many static high-performance implementation

2200486
environment	execution
and we haven t even begun talking about the rest of the execution environment modern mainstream operating systemd mainstream cpus and mainstream hardware architectures are heavily biased towards static languages to the points of being actively hostile for dynamic-languages

2200486
environment	execution
given that modern mainstream execution environment are pretty much of a worst-case scenario for dynamic-languages it is quite astonishing how well they actually perform and one can only imagine what the performance in a less hostile environment would look like

2200504
filtering	grouping
but with the pins on their own or in small grouping i want to make sure they don t get filtering

2200540
jquery	.post
i am using jquery to execute server call by .post

httpconnection	downloading
i have downloading a file from httpconnection using the fstream in android and now its being written in phone s internal memory on path as i found it in file explorer

2200548
restart	reload	environment	restart
put some garbage invalid xml in your machine.config and restart your dev environment not cassini and see if cassini chokes which would indicate that it is reload machine.config

2200549
python	c++	python	ruby
root is a c++ framework and also comes with python and ruby binding

2200577
python	java	python	ruby
is there such a tool or a nice libs in a mainstream scripting-language preferred are ruby and python or in java

2200586
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
we were running on a standards 32-bit server 3gb of ram with centos and we were running ruby-enterprise-edition latest building passenger latest building and nginx latest building - .when there is only one or two users the site runs fine as you would expect however .when we try to ramp up the load to 50 concurrent request it completely dies

2200588
binary-search-tree	map
binary-search-tree - used in many search applications where data is constantly entering leaving such as the map and set object in many languages libs

2200636
sql-server	oracle
is there a equivalent clause to connect by of oracle in sql-server

2200637
delphi	c++
if you can t change the dll then write a wrapper dll in delphi or c++ builder that uses pansichar or pwidechar and then forwarding those parameters to the original delphi dll

2200640
unsigned	zero
personally i use unsigned int with zero problems

2200649
xlsx	xls
for example i sometimes need to convert a large set of thousands of workbooks between formats xls xlsx from a c# console application

2200651
children	nodes
the children nodes themselves are not copy-paste just referred to which doesn t cause problems because they are immutable

2200651
children	nodes
however if you are adding children to a nodes way down on the xml hierarchy things get complicated

2200651
children	nodes
you d need a rewriterule against books which would then get its child which really should have been named children find the n th book in them add the new child to that and then recompose the children and building the new nodes

2200681
smalltalk	tcl
for reference other winners of this award were tex smalltalk postscript rpc the web mosaic tcl tk java make .

32-bit	x86
you can use a junction points in ntfs to points program files x86 to program files on 32-bit clients

2200685
sys.path	sys
i know this because .when i import sys and do a sys.path it only has jython libs directory

2200688
administration	account
.when i run the scripting from the command-prompt it can read that value just fine under an administration account

2200692
any	set
in short .when using set they both act as assignment operators but in any non-set statements is for assingment and checked for equality

2200701
void	main
main should return an int not void

2200701
realloc	malloc
you do not have to cast the return-value of malloc or realloc

2200724
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m rewriting a webforms application as an exercise to learn some asp.net-mvc skills

2200726
ostream	std
you ve defined types manip to be a function that takes a std ostream by reference and returns a std ostream by reference but you ve defined endd to take a dxfitem and return a dxfitem and dxfitem does not derive from std ostream

2200731
triggers	insert	value	field
however we re now having trouble with instead of insert triggers defined on those views .when the field may have default value

2200731
triggers	insert	value	field
.when the legacy .app tries to insert a value into its view we use an instead of insert triggers to lookup the value that should go in field c something like this

2200731
triggers	insert
even if b was non-nullable i don t know how to write the insert query in the triggers such that if a value was provided for b it s used in the triggers but if not the default is used instead

2200733
session-storage	cookies
.when the request is posted session reads the value from the cookies and knows which recording to pull back from session-storage

2200755
python	java	python	php	python	c++
hamcrest has been ported to java c++ objective-c python and php

2200761
qwidget	qobject
.when a qwidget or any qobject is destroy it will remove itself from its parent s to-delete list .so you can delete it yourself and not worry about double deletes

2200776
haskell	erlang
i returned to haskell for my personal project from erlang for the simple virtue of haskell s amazing types systemd

2200776
haskell	erlang
you also get a bunch of overloading sugar from haskell s typeclass machinery but that is largely secondary to me -- even if it does allow me to express a numbers of abstractions that would be terribly verbose or non-idiomatic and unusable in erlang haskell s category-extras

2200783
value	field
i have a mac application that supports customising field value programatically for printing dialog

2200783
carbon	cocoa	any	set
however i could not find any api in mac cocoa carbon to set the value for

2200783
dictionary	arrays
i couldn t find which object dictionary arrays can contains these key to be effective

2200785
hash	md5
the field is binded with my entity.password field that is stored as an md5 hash

2200785
hash	md5
problem is that a empty string has also an md5 hash

2200785
hash	md5
the validation doesn t checked the actual input but the converted md5 hash

2200822
sql-server-express	sql-server
i restored the systemd then removed each one of the sql-server-express instancess then fully reinstalled the sql 2005 developper edition with its default instances named but again no sql-server 2005 developper instances was listed on the sql-server management studio

2200833
cargo	maven
possible answer we could use maven plugins for deployment cargo and use maven s profiling to handle several configuration

2200850
duplicates	contains
if there isn t a unique on the combinations of field_1 and field_2 the second query may contains duplicates while the first won t as minus will suppress them

2200873
versioning	staging
the versioning numbers used .when the application was written is 7.0.2.3 and the application was deployed onto a staging server

2200873
versioning	staging
the versioning of the software on the staging server is 7.0.2.8 and the application is breaking saying that it cannot find versioning 7.0.2.3

2200898
value	field
.when you create .profile information for an asp.net user it creates all the properties value in 1 field

2200900
response	timeout
however seemingly at random the import methods does not get called asynchronously the browser sits waiting for a response and eventually timeout

2200912
python	c++
i have c++ libs that need communication with python plugged in modules

2200912
python	c++
communication supposes implements by python some callback c++ interface

2200927
windows-xp	windows
101 is running a simple webserver on windows-xp 102 running windows 7

2200937
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have the basic functionality working in opera firefox google-chrome safari but ie7 is failing to co-operate

2200963
put	get
you could return a 202 accepted in response to the initial put and then 204 no content to any get request until the representation is available

2200965
sniffing	traffic
in fact http is not .somewhat secure in a slightly different sense there s nothing in that protocols to stop intruders from sniffing your traffic .so you should never use http to send confidential payload unless maybe you use strong encryption on the payload before sending it and undo that after receiving it

2200965
json	xml
i would personally recommend json instead of xml for encoding the payload -- see here for an xml-rpc-like json-based rpc server and client for example -- but i guess that using the xml-rpc server and client that come with python standard-library is even simpler thus probably closer to what you re looking for

2200971
any	set
you can t set several datasource on any control

2200978
access-control	authentication
how you authentication actions or perform access-control has nothing to do with whether your admin interface uses nested controllers and a different interface or uses the same interface as regular users with a few more button

2200980
ole-automation	com
you created a clr assembly which is different than a unmanaged extended stored procedure or a ole-automation com object

2200999
nskeyedarchiver	nsmutabledata
i was wondering if it is possible to send a uiimage over bluetooth after encoding it into a nsmutabledata using nskeyedarchiver

2201000
javafx	swing
it cannot replace swing or javafx

2201042
data-members	instances
.when you put things in the prototype-chain they re shared by all instancess of that object--ideal for member-functions not ideal for data-members since you want each object instances to have its own collections of data-members

2201045
sql-server	oracle
the sql-server 2005+ equivalent of oracle s connect by hierarchical query syntax is to use a recursive cte

2201047
factors	primes
.when you see the load factors of a bucket getting too high pick the next primes in the arrays recreate the bucket list and move the elements from the old buckets to the new table

2201070
order	add
there is no way for you to discover the order in which you add items to an associativity arrays without creating additional metadata

2201096
delphi	c++
i have 4 years of full time experience with c++ 12 years of part-time experience with delphi and 2+ years of full-time php experience

2201101
aggregate-functions	sum
.when i open expression windows and click on dataset all dataset show to me but all of their field use of an aggregate-functions like sum

2201102
traversal	parent
technically descending and ascending aren t correct because you can also traversal first up then back down with functions like parent or .closest both of which can be terminate with .end to return to the original selector

2201107
base-class	inherited
c# only allows single inheriteded you can only inherited from one base-class

2201123
constructor	object
in c++ i would take advantage of the scoping of an object created on stack and would lock the mutex in the object s constructor and then release it in the destructor

2201170
contains	set
the result set that the latter returns is a single row contains the value

2201172
python	java
pyro can be used similarly in python as terracotta in java

2201193
selected	cell
then selected the entire f1 f6 range and use fill down home tab editing to copy this formula down into all the cell in the range f1 f6

2201197
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works well with ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.0 3.5 safari and google-chrome

2201201
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
in oracle sql-server and postgresql you also can generator recordset of arbitrary numbers of rows providable with an external variables

2201202
instances	destroy
in languages where instances are allocated in a heap and destroy asynchronously by a garbage collector c# java destructor aka finalize are not the right tool for that

2201227
click	mouse
this exact code does in one occasion exactly what it is supposed to do and hardly five minutes later i can click the button all i want nothing happens but the mouse pointers turning into a little busy-indicator and then nothing

2201236
put	get
put text-align left on the outermost div swap the second and the third inner div and then get rid of the unnecessary monster replacing it with the semantics correct and much shorter

2201236
margins	padding
you can then still apply margins and padding to the h1 as you see fit

2201269
selected	button
selected the file and before you click add click the dropdown next to the add button and selected add as link

2201282
dictionary	arrays
there s an easy solution for that read the properties into a dictionary and overload the fileloader s arrays operators

2201306
contains	any
if the console uses a windowstation that does not contains a desktop named default this may cause the compiler process or any other process that is spawned from the w3wp.exe process that depends on the user32.dll file not to start

2201308
sql-server	oracle
databases used are sql-server oracle sybase

2201315
double	int
the odometer reading is an int on the incoming data and double on the database changed to int on the dbml file

2201317
http	ssl
since http s works in a similar fashion secure websocket over ssl can leverage the same http connect technique

2201324
display	height	display	width
i also applied a scaletransform instead of setting width and height to reduce screens artifacts a bit if control grips etc are display and to avoid conflicts if the control being hidden already has width and height properties set assuming that the control doesn t already have a layouttransform set on it

2201329
32-bit	64bit

placing exit points throughout a chunks of code can make it hard to follow and debugging

2201341
checkbox	textbox
the groupbox contains a few labels textbox and checkbox

2201355
entity-framework	nhibernate
what you all think about both nhibernate and entity-framework avenues

2201358
contains	elements
it s failing because the empty parametertemplate elements because if it contains child elementss it deserializes fine

2201369
contains	elements
this does result in q contains an objectresult collections but the actual productionunit elements are detached and their entitykey is null

2201369
contains	set
mysql query returns a result set contains all the columns of the respective productionunits table and nothing more

2201380
scala	java
scala is limited somewhat by the fact that java threads are rather heavy

2201381
user-controls	ascx
a supposedly proven technique to turn user-controls of a website into reusable server controls while retaining the ability to use declarative code gives me a nullreferenceexception on any reference of any control that s declare inside the ascx code

2201391
frame-rate	fps
you need to cap the frame-rate to x frame per second 60 fps is the most common

2201408
hide	show
i am able to display the loading messages but how can i hide the contents of the tab panels .when it s selected and show the contents .when loaded

2201414
compatibility	platform
the only thing against it i can think of is platform compatibility but if you re limiting yourself to c++ mfc that shouldn t be a concern to you

2201426
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
works well in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.0 3.5 google-chrome and safari

2201430
getter	setter
is there a way to do something like this in tcl or do i always need to create protected getter and setter

2201444
response	timeout
a brutal .solution would be to set off 5 or .so threads at a time each thread trying a different ports until it got a response on a relatively short timeout

2201456
naming-conventions	conventions
have a good understanding of maven principles conventions over configuration the default layout the naming-conventions the philosophy of the tool one primary output per project

2201460
button	popup
this works fine and i then popup a dialog saying i have detected the call and then the user presses a button to close the dialog which call finish on that activity

2201489
getter	setter
and it will create all the getter and setter that you need

2201517
transparency	frame
you can create a windows without any frame use ws_ex_layered to get transparency then either draw the windows including your custom frame normally in wm_paint or you compose an off-screen bitmap and use updatelayeredwindows the latter methods is more efficient

2201570
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textbox
for dropdownlistfor textbox checkbox we can use enum string or int bool but if i want to add radio-button radio-buttonlist or any other control in a particular category then how can add it

google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen in any other browsers firefox and google-chrome

2201674
command-line	cmd
you can t put multiple cmd to cmd.exe on one command-line

2201701
order	add
my best attempt is to add a handling fee of â 250 and give a discount of â 250 if the customer order more than 1 tour

2201715
python	c++
exposing the python subclassing back to c++ code is a little more tedious

2201715
python	c++	subclassing	inherited
the python classes won t be c++ subclassinging .so you need a c++ wrapper class that does inherited from listener that contains a for the python subclassing instances and that has a notify methods that translation the arguments to python object call the notify methods of the using pyobject_callmethods translation the result back to c++ types and returns

2201719
installation	building
these bi-weekly msis need to co-exist on the same machine as separate installation versioning 1 2 3 etc... do i need to change the package guid of my merge module for each bi-weekly msi building

2201723
core-animation	uikit
core-animation calayers should be your first choice for animation object that play nicely with uikit

2201745
settings.settings	app-config
i do have a settings.settings designer added and i can get to those settings the standards way even though the settings added in that designer do not show up in the app-config like they normally would if i am not using the enterprise block

2201751
version-control	git
in git or any distribute version-control systemd the question is not can you lock a file

2201757
nvidia	ati
i think you should rather stick with opencl which is an open standards and supported by ati nvidia and more

2201758
linux	unix
i m specifically running on a linux 2.4.22 kernel but i m curious to know for any unix based implementation of socket

2201760
nvidia	ati

i have this code working fine with firefox and opera but not with safari and google-chrome

2201793
entity-framework	nhibernate
there are little things here and there that are different but in general nhibernate is still years ahead of entity-framework even in efv4

2201793
entity-framework	nhibernate
as a consultant it is probably worth your time to become an expert in both nhibernate and entity-framework

2201793
entity-framework	data-access
micro.soft tends to have a short attention span .when it comes to data-access .so it s not clear where entity-framework will be a couple of years from now

2201802
typedef	struct
i d prefer to look at an older os targeted to a single device as current operating systemd contains a tangle of macros and layer of typedef that make following even a simple struct definition difficult

2201809
communication	messages
messages communication link failure

2201816
malloc	free
another option is to use more classic c memory-management malloc free and manage your arrays that way

2201829
haskell	ocaml
we use haskell ocaml and now f# .so for us it has nothing to do with lack of c-like syntax

search-engine	web-crawler
my first thought was to filtering on user-agent and if the requester is a spider search-engine web-crawler to display a call for availability or some such messages which would be the same messages we would display if the backend systemdd were down for maintenance or generally unavailable rather than make a call to the backend systemd for real availability

cvtypes is a third party implementation that essentially wrap python around object written in c the language that opencv is written in along with c++

2202401
scriptmanager	ascx
the only problem is that i don t seem to find a way to include scriptmanager inside the ascx itself - only on the pages that hosts this control which is prone to error and defeats the purpose and just seems wrong

2202401
scriptmanager	ascx
is there a way to defined scriptmanager inside the ascx and defined web methods as you normally would in the code-behind of the control itself

2202403
while-loop	loops
the first setting of unescaped is to loops is then invoked as there has been a change and as such unescaped becomes loops is called again as there has yet again been a change but this time there us nothing to unescape and .so url and unescaped become the same breaking the while-loop

if i made a document editing application i d make the entire editing area the drop target unless that would make an embedded object of course .

2202662
expression	evaluation

2202668
selected	button
click with the right button on the taskbar inside de ie 8 developer-tools them selected move

2202686
background-color	transparency
the only problem may be that the swf might look weird since setting wmode to transparency will remove the stage background-color if any

2202692
callback	methods
for the recording i think that overwriting the default updates methods is a dangerous game and such programming is better off in a before_updates callback where it belongs

2202696
json	xml
the difference being xml makes sacrifices to include humans use and json makes sacrifices to be easily parseable and fast

2202696
json	csv
json is not really a replacement for a csv

2202701
json	xml
if you have any experience with xml just think of json as the same thing it s just a string-representation of data

2- if #1 didn t work i d add a button to pop-up a div overlay contains the order numbers

2202762
callback	methods
you could make every single methods call include a randomcontext or a logcontext - but it would get in the way of your api s cleanliness - and the chaining would be broken if you ever had to call into another api which would callback to yours through a virtual-methods or something similar

2202764
credentials	security
take spring-security for instances the security filtering will perform the authentication and then store the users credentials in a thread-local variables

2202770
createobject	clsid
you need clsidfromprogid to map the arguments you normally pass to createobject to a clsid

2202789
defined	declare
however the systemd does not enforce a requirement that the referenced columns be unique or be declare not null.the handling of foreign key references to nonunique key or key that contains null value is not well defined for operations such as updates or delete cascade

2202792
virtual-functions	base-class
the rest of the code just uses display whatever .so as long as both namespaces implements the entire interface i can use either one without changing the rest of the code at all and without any runtime overhead from using a pointers reference to a base-class with virtual-functions for the implementsation

2202817
lightbox	jquery
does anyone have a solution for using jquery qtip and lightbox at the same time

2202844

2203123
hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	show	fadeout	show	fadeout	fadein
i m also not sure that enable disable will work with a div or a-tag you might be better off using fadeout and fadein or just show and hide to disable the links

setup a virtual directory in iis that points to the website folder of your dotnetnuke installation

2203285
versioning	upgrade
note the use of a source versioning of dotnetnuke for production use is not recommended additionally it is my personal recommendation to not modify the source unless you are truly willing to accept that future upgrade might not be possible due to your modifications

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
then get it looking right for both firefox and google-chrome

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
only after you have it looking right in firefox and google-chrome should you start concerning yourself with how it looks in ie

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
after you do the above if it still doesn t look right in both firefox and google-chrome set the first and second padding value for your #s rule-set to 0 change 8px to 0px and then add a margin-top declaration to both #s and #searchsubmit and give both the same value for example margin-top 8px

2203774
delphi	vb6
in the mean time we also still use a mix of self-registration and automatic wxs generator with heat.exe for our old vb6 and delphi libs

2203774
versioning	upgrade
we just completely uninstaller the previous versioning of the product during an upgrade aka a major upgrade .so we don t need to worry about such things

2203776
uiscrollview	subviews
i am developing an iphone .app that places multiple custom uiview as subviews in a uiscrollview

2203776
uiscrollview	subviews
the problem i am having is that .when i zoom in and out of my uiscrollview the subviews do not redraw themselves while the user is zooming

2203782
configuration	logging
could proper configuration of a webserver acheive the same effect tcp connection logging file delivery

2203791
relevance	sphinx
i want to be able to rank by relevance just like sphinx

2203799
dictionary	arrays
you are trying to recreate an associativity arrays - in c# i would usually use a dictionary

2203804
margins	padding
padding margins and border

2203804
margins	padding
where marge means margins bordure means border and espacement means padding

2203804
margins	padding
margins falls around the border which in turn falls around the padding which in turns falls around the actual elements size

2203804
margins	padding
in this example which was taken by inspector stack overflow answer tag show that there is no margins the border is 1px wide and there is a 3px padding between the border of the and its contents

2203804
margins	padding
padding on the parent will cause your nested items to keep a margins

2203804
margins	padding
if you want your nested to take all the room it can you must set its margins properties to 0px and the padding properties of its parent to 0px as well

2203807
rational-numbers	base
but if you re using int or rational-numbers for your control points then you can use groebner base to rewrite your bi-variate order-3 polynomialss into a possibly-up-to-order-9-thus-your-nine-possible-intersections monovariate polynomials

2203807
short	base
burchburger has a layman-friendly introduction to groebner base called grã bner base a short introduction for systemd theorists that was very helpful for me

2203811
systemd	sysv
that link is for linux other systemd should do one or the other depending on their sysv vs

2203812
value	field
i m not sure i completely understand your question but if you want to set the value of the selected field with javascript you need to obtain the value in javascript at some points

2203812
value	field
to do this your ajax request is going to have to provide information about the object this selected field is for .so the server can lookup the object s current serving_size_id value

2203812
value	field
2 .when you rendering the field in your original partials also rendering some javascript which sets the current value of the field for example underneath what you have above

2203820
contains	any
for extra safety you could also verify that the string doesn t contains any characters that are illegal even in quoted identifier particularly nulls see the mysql docs but in truth mysql should catch those

2203822
.war	jar
the next day sit with him her and have them explain how to compile and building a jar or .war

2203822
.war	jar
the should be able to compile and building a jar .war at the very least imo

2203825
xsd	xml
also i am not 100 sure if i need to create an xsd of my xml snippet and register that on the oracle before i can use any of the other pl sql xml tools queries

2203840
sql-server	oracle
which is impossible in sql-server and oracle you need to have some kind or a predicates there .

2203840
sql-server	oracle
which goes only to show what a ludicrous and laughable abomination oracle and sql-server really are

2203841
widget	button
you might have to overrides qwidget sizehint in the toolbox class to make the widget exactly as large as it needs to be to fit all the button in the case of your six button the width would be 64 and the height would be 96

2203843
csv	xml
i wonder if somebody can help me flatten an xml file to csv format

2203845
native-code	unmanaged
personally i use it .when i need to talk to existing com object like msxml or if i absolutely needed to talk to a .net-assembly from native-code where something like unmanaged export isn t an option but don t consider it useful for new development

2203849
hashtable	set
you could then keep tracking of the unknown relationships of each thing in a separate hashtable set

2203865
value	field
i defined two object off of that one field one is designated the id and represents the raw value of the field and the other is designated readonly and represents the object being referred to

2203894
backslash	regex	put	get
it s like for example if you re writing a regex to detection backslashes you have to escape the backslash in the regex by doubling it and if you re using a language without regex literals you have to put it in a string with correct escapes .so it ends up as four backslashes in a row which looks completely wrong but it s right .when you think about the integration of different levels of escape mechanism by the way i originally tried to write out those backslashes but inorder to get around stackoverflow s own escape mechanism i would have had to write eight backslashes in a row and it didn t feel safe to write that

2203903
keyboard	mouse
it disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget

2203927
windows-media-player	embed
problem is we cannot seem to either stop it from auto-playing using the windows-media-player or start it playing by click using flash embed

2203931
textures	fbo
create a separate fbo for each textures you want to rendering to

2203931
textures	fbo
single fbo multiple textures attachment

2203931
textures	fbo
single fbo multiple textures attachment

2203949
any	set	default-value	default
for doing that you should set the default-value of the exposed filtering in some combinations that doesn t return anything in this way .when the user visits the page they will not see any result and those filtering will have the value that you choose by default

2203950
put	get
constants is an alternative way to get hold of a constants but a function-call can t be put into a string without concatenation either

2203979
contains	lookup
then you want to lookup your string1 in your example above from the map and see if your associated string list contains your string2

2203980
32-bit	64bit
now that office also comes in a 64bit install where in the registry do you find out if the versioning of office install is 32-bit or 64bit

2203995
concatenation	comma
note in this example echo takes a numbers of parameters look at the comma .so it isn t real concatenation

2203995
concatenation	comma
also if you consider concatenation strings passings strings as parameters or writing whole strings with the comma versioning is always fastest next goes

2203995
double-quotes	single-quotes
concatenation with single-quotes and the slowest string building methods is using double-quotes because expression written this way have to be evaluated against declare variables and functions

2203998
xsd	xml
you seem to need the xsd format a subset of iso8601 used in xml schema see datetime-format xsd

2204011
any	set
you can t set the named attributes of any elements in ie by using .setattributes named value

2204019
optgroup	selected
this code iterates over all the options in the selected tag and wrap every set of two in an optgroup

2204030
c++	lua
if you know c++ and lua then you re going to be far more employable

2204035
lightbox	jquery
scripting jquery lightbox

2204042
installation	building
however it makes building the cmd strings a little more complicated and everything will break if the user move the programs around after installation

2204049
contains	any	populate	row
once any updates is made to the row this field needs to be populate with a new row contains the updatess data

2204049
updating	updates
.when save is click you run updates queries for all rows with a non-null updatesdrow updating the database with data in updatesdrow which do not match those from the original row don t updates if the user changes data back to how it was originally

2204049
checkbox	button
probably best to implements this by having a checkbox with each row then .when the delete button is click it call sql to delete each checked row using the filtering from 1 and primary key metadata mentioned in 2 as well as to remove it from the table

2204056
installation	building
this buildinging the source and move perl modules and other files into the building libs or blib as an intermediate step in the full installation

2204057
scala	java
i know that you can use java s reflection api to do simple things but this does not work well with scala s language-features

2204064
any	set
whatever language you choose to keep at the top of your list always keep your options open and don t set your mind to any one single language

2204069
macros	vba
this vba macros works

2204074
javascript	dom
you can asssign class to dom elements only by hands or via javascript

2204078
binaries	install
you should definitely let the user specify the path with an environment variables to the install binaries

2204078
binaries	install
if your program is install in a home-directory that user will have to set and env variables to say where the binaries are copy-paste to

2204087
python	c++
i wonder what would be the best approach to use a scripting python bash etc or program i can compile c and c++ that gives me the linear-regression coefficients without the need to add external libs numpy etc

2204109
autopostback	checked
it d be a bit redundant code-wise but you could give it a cssclass autopostback and then checked for that via jquery

2204126
compact-framework	.net
hopefully this isn t a duplicates but does anyone know of any good orms that work with sql compact edition and can run in the .net compact-framework windows-mobile 5- 6.x

2204128
static-members	non-static
and vice versa that is to say use static-members inside non-static methods

2204145
static-members	non-static
but you can use static-members in a non-static function

2204158
installation	environment
i m not sure if it s a best practice but what i do in these cases is i write my c code to extends the path environment variables to include the installation directory at the end

2204164
any	set
remove any buffering caching pages in memory that have not been altered since loaded or there is memory pressure either low free memory on the machine or a maximum memory set on sql-server

2204194
primitive	int
for setting an arrays of primitive int types to 0 specifically memset is fine though it may raise eyebrows

2204200
javascript	dom
the general technique of delay loading or loading based on a click is to actually wrap the object html code in some javascript and have it dynamically added to the dom based on your click event

2204208
constructor	object
if the memory you are allocation is a class with a constructor that does something useful the operators new will call that constructor and leave your object initializer

2204208
constructor	object
but if you re allocation a pod or something that doesn t have a constructor that initializerr the object s state then you cannot allocate memory and initializer that memory with operators new in one operation

2204213
dialect	hql
this is available at least using hql extends the dialect as show in nh 2.1

2204216
boost	stl
its codebase goes back maybe 12 or 13 years and while we have put work into upgrading and maintaining it use of stl and boost - .when i joined most containers were custom for example - fully upgrade to unicode and the 2010 vcl etc there s one remaining very significant problem it s fully single-threaded

2204219
webserver	security
just make sure your webserver doesn t have that security bug

2204220
constructor	object
now say you are in your own object constructor and you make a call to some jquery code how is it able to hijack this from you

2204222
malloc	free
the second easiest is to malloc and free them

2204223
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
it could be a framework in php python ruby

2204226
lookup	any
lookup the standards call function that s available for any javascript function-object

2204232
pointers	stack
by doing this instances of the function further up the call stack will automatically inherited the reallocations made by the recursive call because the pointed-to value of the pointers a that they passed to the recursive call was modified to reflect the new location of the actual data

2204249
groovy	java	ruby-on-rails	grails
if you have experience with java there s a groovy framework called grails that is similar to ruby-on-rails but runs on java servers

2204251
continuous-integration	code-coverage
i use atlassian s bamboo continuous-integration server for my main php project along with their other product such as fisheye repository browsing jira issue tracker and clover code-coverage

2204255
void	main
also if the main thread is waiting for something like for example waiting for the disk drive to return data the other threads can run in that void

2204275
contains	elements
instead drop the id and then selected them by named or by a contains elements

2204282
internet-explorer	opera
i checked my page today on my phone and it didn t display correctly on opera or in internet-explorer

2204285
attributes	properties

2204291
defined	declare
.when you declare a member of a class that has get and or set defined formally known as accessor you are defining a properties

2204291
value	field
properties are a convenient way to expose value of private field because you can add logic to the getting and setting mechanims

2204298
value	field
each row will have a count field the rows with the 20 highest count value will be retrieved quite a lot probably on a one-for-one ratio to every row updates

2204299
value	field
the easiest way to do that is using a content-type and a cck field in the field configuration you can set the numbers of value to unlimited

2204301
value	field
instead of working i end up with all field the same seems to be whatever was the last arrays value

2204321
environment	building
many of these reliances will not crop up during the design phase or even during the development phase but only after a release building is put in a harsh environment

2204330
assign	add
third add users corresponding to the subject s distinguished named subjectdn attributes in the client s digital-certificate in weblogic security realm and assign them to grouping

2204354
duplicates	contains
particular we find that we are supplied with user-interface wireframes that contains much more complexity than the original stories would have implied functionality duplicates for usability reasons

2204359
any	set	base-class	inherited
the advantage of this is that you are guaranteeing that the properties can only be set by either the base-class or any class that inherited the base-class

2204364
populate	row
ie a numbers of field underneath the table that populate based on the selected row

2204373
positioning	slider
i want to implements something like a buffering playback control where the fill is the max amount buffering and the slider handle show the current positioning

2204387
authentication	login
if there is no ssoauth parameter then mruser is redirected to the login page otherwise bar.com uses the decrypted id to authentication mruser before it send him on to page.aspx

2204395
dialog	pop-up
a solution i ve seen implements with grid components is to have a column chooser - some sort of pop-up dialog that lists the columns and you can selected which ones you would like to see in the grid

2204436
ip-address	proxy
people are often tempted to use the web client s ip-address as one of the elements of this encryption but this is a bad idea for several proxy and gateways use different public ips within their pool to access different domains servers

2204454
dictionary	arrays
i have an arrays of dictionary

2204454
dictionary	arrays
i would like to filtering that arrays by seeing if the named field of each dictionary contains a given string

2204455
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp and i guess ruby-on-rails has a pages controllers

2204457
delphi	c++
anyone with bcb6 c++ not delphi have an example of adding soap headers to a tremotable subclassing

2204479
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can only dynamically resize something that was the result-of malloc calloc or realloc

2204482
databound	gridview
now i need to be able to retrieve a value databound in a labels inside of a repeater and use it as an input parameter for the gridview

2204497
.war	jar
what usually happens is that another developer adds or removes a jar say changes myjar-1.0.0 to myjar-1.1.0 and updates all of the manifest.mf files in each .war

2204497
.war	jar
the only way to cure this is to open the properties of each .war go into the j2ee module dependencies tab uncheck a random jar which prompt the user to checkout the manifest.mf .classpath and .project click apply which saves the manifest and then re-check the jar and hit apply once again

2204511
.net	wcf
realized that vs2010 beta2 has separate wcf ria installation package which only works with .net 4.0

2204511
.net	wcf
is there anyway to get wcf ria in vs2010 working with .net 3.5 as the targeted framework

2204516
auctex	latex
the most widely used is likely emacs auctex s tex-command-region c-c c-r which generator a temporary latex file whose dvi eps pdf whatever output is just that from the selected region

2204548
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to make every tab in my application autorotate properly i ve defined -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in my custom view controllers but they are all inside uinavigationcontroller within a uitabbarcontroller .so the messages won t get sent down the chaining to my vc until those two al.so respond

2204552
put	get
i install on the simulator and it works fine but as soon as i put it on my device i get the following error

2204571
syntax-error	syntax
sqlstate 42000 syntax-error or access violation 1064 you have an error in your sql syntax

2204583
deep-copy	object
i understand that inorder to copy an arraylist and have two lists independent of one another you must use a deep-copy copying the object from one list to another not just the references however is there a way this can be done cross-class

2204615
http	ssl
.when i deployed the project with the web-config below enabling ssl http www.mydomain .com service.svc sessions does not even pull up at all

2204628

2204657
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i ve put my cd call into viewwillappear currently in viewdidload

2204673
binary-tree	tree
the ideal is an interval tree specialized binary-tree

2204685
value	field
ensure that the value for this field is not null while persistent the transactional

2204693
deep-copy	object
for a deep-copy it means you implements a copy methods i believe they are supposed to be called .clone i never use this stuff--as i said it s bad juju for each object in the arraylist then you call your copy methods on each one to get the new copy in your next list

2204696
any	set
i can set the help_text attributes on any form field but is it possible to set help_text on the choices used for a radioselect

2204696
selected	button
i d also like to be able to rendering membership_types attributes with a labels membership types radio button open membership and closed membership and help text associated to each radio elements anyone can join this grouping and only selected members can join this grouping

2204699
derived-class	base-class
if i instances a derived-class i want the dosomething of the derived-class and if i instances a base-class i want the dosomething of the base-class in spite of i m calling from the foo methods implements in the base-class

2204721
value	field
i guess that typically it will mean that the value field is not available

2204730
javascript	dom
if you have php it s better to do it with php as changing dom elements with javascript makes page load slower and required javascript

2204741
subclassing	metaclass	subclassing	inherited
the first question as somebody noted has nothing to do with metaclass you simply can t multiplying inherited from any two classes a and b in this order where b is a subclassing of a

2204753
response	timeout
it automates active response based on any types of log with a low timeout period 10 minutes to avoid those issues

2204793
value	field
basically i have a bool field in the database but i wanted three states only return rows where the value is true only return rows where the value is false do not filtering and return all rows

2204802
shopping-cart	cart
of course it depends on the data and for some things eg shopping-cart contents actually deleting the recording .when the user empties his or her cart is fine

2204817
show	next
i personally prefer using because i clearly read that as not equals but if you enter and save it as a constrait the next time you query it it will show up as

2204818
double	int
yet why are the int written big-endian yet the double written little-endian

2204824
reflection	runtime
c++ does not have runtime reflection capabilities which is what your solution would required

2204836
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the kinds of things i am looking for would be a comparison between the webforms paradigms and the cocoa-touch paradigms without just saying it s asp.net-mvc

2204864
default	reset
that doesn t mean you need all of the resets nor is a global css-reset necessarily the best thing to do some beneficial styles default are also reset

2204880
default	reset
i believe some browsers have it as none by default for which is probably why it is in the reset

2204880
default	reset
you can of course change the reset to default to the disc option and then set it to none manually for navigation

2204898
any	set
if we had some large list of numbers called numlist and wanted to get rid of any duplicates we could use a set operators on the list example set numlist

2204904
keyboard	mouse
the controllers interpreter the keyboard and mouse and manipulates both the camera view and scene model

2204908
webforms	asp.net
stay away from asp.net webforms entirely

2204917
properties-file	jar
the other methods i m considering is to just include all the properties-files in the jar and use a systemd properties or command-line arguments to fill in the named of the properties-file at runtime like this

2204917
environment	building
the process i m constrained to use required a single building which will be promoted through the environment to production .so i m unable to use substitution ala maven or ant

2204928
value	field
.when i get the same field from win32_perfformatteddata_perfos_pagingfile i get a more reasonable value of 5 but that still doesn t seem to coincide with task manager which show 1.06g usage out of the 3g maximum

2204979
plugins	add-on
internet-explorer opens without add-on toolbar or plugins

2204979
default	reset
reset internet-explorer to its default configuration

2204979
plugins	add-on
this step will also disable any add-on plugins or toolbar that are install

2204979
restart	exit
exit and then restart internet-explorer

2204992
nested	order
if it is useful to know the items form field are a nested for within order and order are set to

2205023
time-complexity	big-o
time-complexity which is expressed in big-o is a formal measure of how long an algorithm takes to run for a given set size

2205024
space-complexity	time-complexity
as many people have discovered you can often trade off space-complexity for time-complexity

2205025
value	field
i need to pass the value to in put 2 from in put 1 .when the user focuses his her cursor to next field

2205027
dictionary	arrays
i m guessing it s either a list arrays or dictionary

2205027
dictionary	arrays
i d then like this value to be used as an index if using arrays or key if using a dictionary within the session

2205044
dialog	pop-up
i am using the below code to pop-up the authentication dialog

2205064
vhdl	rtl
with vhdl you can defined your own new types which lets you program at a higher level still rtl of course

2205064
verilog	vhdl	altera	xilinx
i m pretty sure the xilinx and altera free tools support both vhdl and verilog

2205071
scrollbar	popup
if you like you can bind value to the width and height and turn off the scrollbar .so they don t popup if the image is bigger than the windows

2205105
contains	set
in my bashrc i set my pythonpath to my home-directory which contains all my django sites.

2205110
deep-copy	object
i want to deep-copy or in ruby-ese deep clone an attachment thus creating a completely new binary object in the db_files table

2205110
deep-copy	object
my initial theory was that the parent attachment object would be set to new upon a deep-copy attempt thus i did something like

2205145
sequences	unique
row_numbers generator a unique sequences for each parent id partition by starting from the numbers 1

2205145
triggers	insert
i probably should also mention that if you only ever need to insert one new child entity at a time you re better off just funneling those operations through a stored procedure instead of using a triggers - you ll definitely get better performance out of it

2205148
moss	wss
whether it is wss or moss

2205151
gridview	listview
i m using listview with gridview

2205161
maven-antrun-plugin	maven-plugin
since h2 doesn t provide maven-plugin you should start it using maven-antrun-plugin

2205165
protected	public
another useful trick that is applicable while using properties is the ability to modify the modifiers of the the derived properties like changing from public access to protected

2205169
any	set
i would still like to be able to set the checkmarks without the user touching any cell

2205191
msvcrt	crt
however the third party libs are built using dynamic crt msvcrt

2205195
.war	jar
i am not familiar with rad but i do store the jar .war in clearcase without the versioning numbers meaning our manifest.mf file does not change that often

2205195
.war	jar
that being said this ibm article references some methods to include those jar .war files that could be worth a try to see of the manifest is updates

2205195
.war	jar
either reference them through a common project not referenced on clearcase and only there to include the jar .war files

2205205
switching	screens
if you login and go to your blog page then switching to structure editing mode by click the cube icons at the top right of the screens you can then access the configure this page button for the blog page

contains	elements
a blockquote elements cannot be inside a paragraph and in html4 actually needs to contains paragraph

2205228
data-structures	trie
while other data-structures trie do come to mind the real questions are

2205256
push	pull
with the reactive framework due out in .net 4.0 we will see linq expand to not only pull queries but to push scenarios too

2205257
web-applications	webserver
web-applications basically work the way you describe the application s files reside in a webserver all the users connect to it using a browser and to updates the application you only need to updates the files in the server

2205258
background-color	transparency
i have a transparency logo for which i want to apply a background-color how can i do .so using css

2205279

double	int
the compiler rejects what you wrote as nonsense because int and double may be object with different sizes

2205393
double	int
this is potentially dangerous because if x and y are diffrent sizes let s say int is four bytes and double is eight bytes then .when you dereference the eight bytes of memory at to fill in y you will access four bytes of x and four bytes of .

2205393
double	int

2206001
union-all	union
if you used a union then that may well be slower as it has to apply a distinct but union-all doesn t have to do that .so it should be no different

2206176
callback	methods
a callback is appropriate if the callee the transactional in your case needs to continue doing things after a callback methods returns

2206176
callback	methods
i can see the value of using a callback methods to ask the caller if the transactional should continue though i probably would have used a simple timeout parameter

2206176
callback	methods
however using callback methods to return results is imo still wrong

2206177
double	int
if you want to reinterpret an int as a double you d have to convert it to a reference-type

2206177
double	int
and in any case this of course can t make much sense on a platform with int and double of different size since in case of larger double you will read beyond the memory occupied by x

2206177
double	int
some kind of more meaningful int to double conversion

2206181
unsigned	zero
unsigned means you only want to store numbers greater than zero

lookup	any
for any other field types it would make sense to create a custom field control but due to code that expects things to be named lookup lookup field are next to impossible to extends

2206234
selected	textbox
this creates a selected elements with options set from the pipe delimited list in the choices attributes of the textbox

2206234
selected	textbox
set properties on the textbox and selected elementss .so that the textbox as hidden and the selected elements is a visible dropdown

2206242
selected	textbox
this works perfectly for selected a value from the list however the search value you types will not display in the textbox part of the control as i have iseditable set to false

2206281
stderr	stdout
this suppresses both stderr and stdout and puts them both into output

2206303
32-bit	64bit

2206599
rollback	commit
transactional updates without a commit or rollback

2206599
rollback	commit
i used the scripting below to insert rows into a table with a delay to give me enough time to stop the transactional before it reaches the commit or rollback

2206604
primitive	boolean
the explicit cast will do the conversion to boolean and then there s the auto-unboxing to the primitive value

2206610
google-chrome	firefox
updates the code below will return the full filepath in ie but for security reasons firefox and google-chrome only give you the file named

2206614

2206867
inlining	inline
one strategy which compilers use to decide whether to inline is to keep inlining function-calls until the resulting code is too big

2206867
inlining	inline
there s an obvious potential benefit in saving call overhead but as against that people don t really expect recursive functions to get inline and there s no particular guarantee that the usual inlining heuristics will perform well with recursive functions where there are two different places the call site and the recursive call that might be inline with different benefits in each case

2206879
defined	declare
the above declare and defined the object system_mktime_max

2206882
dictionary	map

and qgraphicssimpletextitem m_textitem data-members in your mainwindow class private section

2206997
plugins	add-on
now i would like to have a plugins module add-on at the webserver end which would parsing truncated cut regex the http response based on the requested url s pattern and mask encrypt shuffle substitute a set of field in this response based on different parameters user s ldap permissions in the intranet user s geolocation if on the internet etc and send the altered response back to the user

2206997
plugins	add-on
.so is there an easy answer to creating such plugins modules add-on

2207006
32-bit	64bit
i am limiting it to a scoping of all 32-bit numbers because this is a just-for-fun project that i am doing to familiarize myself with c++ and i don t want to have to work with anything 64bit for awhile

2207006
exponentiation	mod
however part of the process relies upon modular exponentiation that is num pow mod

2207008
logout	login
i am using asp.net with c#.after i logout its possible to go back to pages using back button.i could fix the prob for the login.i have prob with the logout.i am using the inbuilt login page provided by the asp editor.should i use sessions

2207016
interface-builder	iboutlet
iboutlet does only matter to interface-builder

2207016
interface-builder	iboutlet
interface-builder takes iboutlet as a hint from the header file to list the available outlets for the class

2207020
button	popup
if you then hit the discover button in the dialog that popup it should discover your new web service

2207034
serialization	marshalling
the only way to avoid serialization is to represent your data using object which derive from marshalbyrefobject but in that case you will still have the cost of marshalling across the appdomain boundaries

2207034
serialization	marshalling
assuming marshalling by reference is not an option you will have to serialization at some points

2207038
complex-numbers	matrix
it can not only supprt scripting but can handle matrix vectors complex-numbers

2207040
any	set
these set of classes and methods will be used throughout the application and .so if i add them as any other classes i would need to manually remove them once they are not required

2207041
arrays	map
however if this 2d arrays will contains mostly zero then it might be ok to use a map with indic as key

2207065
grails	shiro
might be just me but i have a hard time understanding how to secure just some of the pages in a grails application with the shiro plugins

2207073
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
using java was in my opinion due to object oriented programming in web application but today we have a lot of object oriented web language ruby python php

2207079
spring.net	ninject
you could also use a dependency-injection framework like spring.net ninject etc

2207090
debugging	trace
if this is for out-of-process auditing or debugging you could just add a trace or messages login .config

2207106
rollback	commit
sql-server will not automatically commit or rollback a transactional on its own simply because your code didn t do .so

2207125
silverlight	wpf
if you are into web apps development and you want to learning something similar to wpf you can go for silverlight

2207125
rich-internet-application	ria
silverlight is rich-internet-application development ria platform that can be used to develop interative web apps

2207125
silverlight	wpf
i suggested silverlight because silverlight wpf both shared a markup called xaml to a great extent

2207144
selected	button
.so regardless if the user is logged in out .when the user selected the back button the page being retrieved from the caching not the server

2207164
hide	show
i would like to show and hide the divs that are just under body tag not the ones which are under another div tag

2207164
any	set
is there any way to do this without having to set a classname

2207177
numeric	zero
either use the convert database field to null option under report options which will convert the numeric field nulls to zero and make your sum work or

2207186
any	set
but you don t need another exe for appdomain work and it is much easier to set up any communication that you need

2207202
arguments	default
you may also explicit specify the named of the corresponding model attributes with modelattributes annotations by default attributes named is a arguments s classnamed with first letter decapitalized user

2207204
google-chrome	firefox
the pop-up appears fine in firefox and google-chrome but it show at the bottom of the page in ie8

2207205
administration	account
don t run cf under an administration account either.

2207212
selected	cell
then to selected all the cell you can use the currentregion properties

2207212
selected	cell
the reason is that currentregion will selected all contiguous cell based on the reference cell

2207217
launchd	daemons
every daemons is then started by launchd based on the plist file

2207222
factory-pattern	singleton
a factory-pattern can be implements as a singleton pattern that produces object

2207225
lwjgl	jogl
it s a scenegraph engine which is layer on top of lwjgl or jogl

2207236
abstract-factory	factory-method
you can see a couple examples of the abstract-factory here or the factory-method here based on the context

2207242
rollback	commit
there are msdb articles about it and how this interacts with commit rollback checkpoints etc

2207245
instances	private
you will then be able to launchd a new instances with your private ami .when you want to resume this instances

2207254
factory-pattern	singleton
a factory-pattern rather than a singleton pattern

2207257
exponentiation	modulo
exponentiation by squaring still works for modulo exponentiation

2207267
groovy	java	spring	grails
on the other hand the java platform offers some interesting new approaches like grails which is basically a groovy wrapper around spring and lift as well

2207267
installation	environment
most of the frameworks mentioned don t need a j2ee runtime environment a simple tomcat installation with around 5m and an install jre should be enough

2207267
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
and if you really can t decide at all you just run php in java works as well for ruby python javascript ...

2207279
value	field
i have tried using the validation framework but this does not support modifying the value of the field at validation time

2207293
arguments	default
since i am on linux and using my cmd is in fact a list of arguments to be execute by executable which default to bin sh

2207296
alfresco	nuxeo
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2207299
python	perl
but since not many providers allow installation of perl python .

2207309
decrement	increment
finally 2 cycles for increment and jump though its usually implements as decrement and jump

2207318
fortran	pascal
in the c fortran pascal heritage you tend to emphasize sequencing over nesting code parsing tree are shallower and wider

2207326
alfresco	nuxeo
don t know the nuxeo systemd but we are using alfresco as a document storage and session server

2207327
value	field
i understand that there are different ways to implements custom field using a named value table or using alter-table etc. and we are currently favoring using alter-table to dynamically add new user field to the database

2207327
sql-server	mysql
we are talking about a web application that is used by up to 100 users at the same time not concurrent requests.. and can use both mysql and ms sql-server databases

2207330
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
it definitely is not possible to do with pure php perl python or any other scripting-language on a restrict shared-hosting environment

2207334
where-clause	sql
i m looking at some sql code which has a where-clause like this

2207336
ruby	php
al.so i have showed watir to .some friend of mine who are programmers and they are using it to help them during development of systemd written in java php and even asp .so just because watir is a ruby project it doesn t mean you should use it only with other ruby project

2207342
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling catching data-access exception-handling throw by repository can be done by handleerror filtering

2207355
toupper	tolower
you can put constants on it or certain helpers functions often used like toupper tolower or isnumber clipnumber aso

2207366
where-clause	sql
there s no in sql and no assignments in a where-clause

2207367
textbox	onblur
then your textbox will have the onfocus and onblur events wired up

2207370
user-input	output
since it s not oop at all but what you want to do is to compile user-input to produce something - execution some code who change the data of the room and output a result

2207371
formview	ascx
i have an asp formview on a control in an ascx file which is loaded onto a portal page along with some other controls

2207387
python	ruby
- top voted mentions this was the case in the 60s and 70s but these days dynamic-languages are used ruby python and such

2207397
value	field
an alternative would be to store create 1 custom data field of types xml - this would be truly generics and required no field creation or the need for a separate named value table

2207406
getter	setter
i have a registrationvo with few properties and getter setter for that

2207445
ubuntu	osx
i have tried on both osx and ubuntu with

2207468
triggers	insert
but if neither of your columns is selective enough to sufficiently improve index performance you might have to resort to denormalization by using insert updates triggers to fill a second table feature_id store_id istrial view_count

2207486
selected	button
selected the ok button

2207499
json	xml
users of your something class that only want to work with xml don t need to even know that your object can be serialization to json

2207499
json	xml
neither users of json or xml should be affected if you later add a database persistent option to the class

2207536
python	c++
but because you can t call python functions from within c++ you can use pooling at python for some changes in shared data and do something based on this changes

2207538
contains	any
any sufficiently complicated c or fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of common lisp

2207548
cloudera	hive
in particular the cloudera distribution comes to mind - it comes with pig and hive as well

2207559
vb.net	vba
i d like to know that for vba not vb.net

2207570
cross-compiling	toolchain
i would like to learn how to building my own cross-compiling .so i can customize the setup but have had trouble getting crosstools and crosstools-ng to successfully building a toolchain

2207589
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
for firefox safari google-chrome you can use window.stop

2207591
any	set
however i can t find any good samples that show how to set things up

2207598
.doc	xls
hi does anyone know why ms office such as .doc .docx and xls can no longer be viewed .when retrieved from a mysql-python .when stored as blob

2207608
fadeout	fadein
you fadein and fadeout of jquery

2207619
contains	elements
the idea is that at each iterator you partition the arrays into two halves - the left half contains all elements less than the pivot and the right half contains all elements greater than equals to the pivot

2207620
target-platform	platform
it has more to do with your target-platform s and the connect of those platform

2207624
prolog	lisp
.so i encourage you with using a language designed for this kind of problem better suited to your application functional paradigms ex lisp logical paradigms ex prolog or .something like that

2207643
wxwidgets	mfc
i believe this is a best answered by choosing a gui framework mfc .net wxwidgets qt â

2207654
perl	php
could some tell me if there is a function which works the same as php s mysql_real_escape_string for perl from the dbi module

2207679
moss	wss
you have only the language pack for say moss and not wss install for the language

2207684
for-loop	arrays
the naive way would be to simply search one arrays for each of the elements of the other arrays with a for-loop

2207688
silverlight	wpf	caliburn	prism
if you re looking for a framework that helps you apply some best practices in wpf silverlight development similar to asp.net-mvc helping you in the asp.net world you may want to have a look at caliburn and or prism aka

2207703
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it s working fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox i ll not get started on ie s issues just yet

2207713
versioning	upgrade
once you figure out what types of features you want to offer in a lite versioning one thing you could do to offer an in-place upgrade for customers in to use the in-app purchase mechanism

2207714
spacing	layout
i m especially interested in standards for developing layout what margins and spacing between controls to use fonts sizes and stuff like that

2207723
msbuild	nant
i am just starting to pick up nant as a replacement for msbuild in our cruisecontrol.net project

2207723
directory	folder
one of the things we do inside a set of project is link in a single assemblyinfo file from outside of the project tree to make versioning easier it lives in a directory above the project folder

2207733
radio-button	selected
i already have the code of the radio-button and inside the view i can get wich one is selected

2207764
debian	linux	environment	building
platform debian linux java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_16-b01

2207765
contains	elements
there are a numbers of methods i can think of such as templates document contains placeholder elements and some form of mapping data in xml or in a db but it seems to me there should be a more elegant solution - maybe like the php xslt extension

2207793
arrays	map	duplicates	elements
if you are allowed duplicates in the arrayss an efficient o n solution it to create a frequency table map by iterator over the first arrays and then use the map to match off any elements in the second arrays

2207815
hash	md5
example generator sha1 and md5 hash in .net c#

2207841
json	xml
.when i run this result list is populate with the results of the two queries in xml but i am unsure how i can send this list to the browser in json

2207864
logout	login
one handy tip during initial installation is if you are developing on a multiple user .profile machine you log into a network and your .profile is synchronized at login logout you ll want to do the following

2207869
arguments	default
templates templates parameters and default templates arguments

2207879
keyboard	mouse
if the computer running it is left idle no mouse or keyboard input for a sufficiently long time varies between an hour or .so and a couple of days the swing display .sometimes stops updating totally we ve got among other things a clock show on-screen that stops updating until the user move the mouse

2207884
google-closure-compiler	uglifyjs
as of jquery 1.5 they are using uglifyjs ticket instead of the google-closure-compiler

2207896
updating	updates
updating your local copy won t automatically updates the data in the database

2207904
silverlight	wpf
i dont think this will be possible for silverlight that you are intending to run in the browser although you certainly could using wpf as a windows .app

2207934
jndi	jms	jndi	jdbc
i would like to also take a snapshot of the configuration jdbc connections jms jndi etc

2207941
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
unfortunately it works in firefox but not in safari and google-chrome still not tested in opera and ie

2207951
groovy	java
there is no way of doing this in java but try using groovy if it is possible for you

2207957
scala	java
in java this is very difficult since there is no first class support for functions unlike clojure or scala and probably other

2207971
jndi	jms
connections jms jndi etc

2207972
selected	button
similarly it is a design choice to force a user to selected a nodes and context-click to get a context menu that allows a choice of moving up or down every single time they want to move it that s not a design choice i d make i d be using drag-and-drop here or button that allow repeated rapid-fire relocation of any selecteded nodes anywhere in the tree

2208003
32-bit	64bit
i raised this question up because i have seen windows 7 64bit able to run several 32-bit program without any problem

2208003
32-bit	64bit
i am not sure why some 32-bit program can run just fine on 64bit but for us in the future say if we have a 128bit architecture and os release in the future what can we do in term of programming if we want our program to be able to run in a different bit architecture

2208012
constructor	object
can we create an object of the inner class in the constructor of the outer class

2208015
constructor	object
javascript does kind of confuse the matter by putting some of the same methods on the standards constructor functions for built-in object as on their prototype for example strsplit exists where really only string.prototype.split should

2208046
wsdl2java	axiom
then it appears that wsdl2java needs axiom jars .when using xmlbeans binding

2208046
jax-ws	cxf
one more reason to stay away from axis2 imho and to prefer jax-ws ri or cxf

2208047
any	set
it seems to me that msvs should already attempt to resolve any include ... statements by first looking thru the set of header-files i have include in the project

2208087
background-color	transparency
this works kind of as expected but background-color is transparency

2208104
jquery	.post
you jquery can then get or .post to a controllers action which can return as follows

2208105
instances	self
thus the messages justdoit is sent to a deallocated instances the object represented as self in your code

2208113
value	field
i tried with compairing field value of both visible and no-visible columns

2208123
order	add
now what if i add a non-asp.net button like this in the .aspx page used to place the order but for a different kind of order seperate from the existing place order button above

2208126
stderr	stdout
the main problem i m facing is how do i delete what i ve already sent into stdout stderr

2208135
macros	basic
macroizing or typedefing the basic types doesn t work because people will invariably use the macros or typedef for everything and you are back to the same positioning you were originally where you can t differentiate what should be the new int size and what really does need to be 64 or 32-bit

2208140
scala	java
i have been doing java for a long time and started scala about 6 months ago

2208140
python	perl
what surprises me is i have always been a python over perl person where

2208140
python	perl
quotes python pep20 and perl quote

2208145
implements	extends
you could also create an abstract-base-class that implements igrid that implements the setdefaults methods and let projectmodel extends the abstract-class

2208145
principles	srp
single responsibility principles srp only tells that a class should only have one reason to change which is a very vague restrictions since a change can be as narrow and broad as you want it to be

2208145
getter	setter
a dto from a purist sense shouldn t have logic in it other than accessor getter methods which makes it strange that projectmodel itself has references to pagerhelper and sorthelper which i assume can mutate it they re setter

2208176
dictionary	arrays
once you have a dictionary with all the target words you go through each positioning of your two dimension arrays and call a recursive function that expands all 8 ways

2208183
typedef	struct
it just acts as a typedef to the pointers of the struct

2208219
aggregate-functions	sum
i can use the function delta as an extracontext but also id like to include the sum of all delta results in the templates in this case i have to make an aggregate but again since delta is not a db field nor a model field i cant use it in an aggregate-functions

2208230
instances	destroy
if i remember correctly isreusable indicates to asp.net that your handler should not be destroy after process request and the same instances could be used for process subsequent request

2208232
python	ruby
disclaimer i have no idea what scala author think about this i m just expressing my opinion as a scala and python and ruby developer

2208232
haskell	lisp
if you look at functional languages like lisp and haskell there is usually one way to do it for each approach you take since you can solve a problem in recursive or list-comprehension for example

2208232
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
you can either be very flexible perl ruby or strict python

2208233
sql-server	oracle
is it possible to get copies of oracle product for development just like we get sql-server from msdn

2208235
subclassing	superclass
if that is the case then probably the best form would be to instead initializer it only in the superclass constructor and then invoke that superclass constructor in each subclassing constructor like super foo

2208244
spaces	output
however .when i output all of the characters that make it into that block of code spaces are in there

2208246
perl	c++
as perl doesn t supports readv writev required more memory cpu and also isn t very commercial i d like to sell my game later i would like to ports my server back to c++ in future - once my features stabilize

2208246
perl	c++
i know how to use those under perl and c but i haven t found any examples for c++ yet

2208246
openbsd	linux	g++	gcc
my environment i m using openbsd with its gcc g++ and i d like my server to run under linux as well

2208246
perl	c++
please let me add that i like both perl and c and i respect c++ very much .so this question is not about which language or os is better

2208264
selected	cell
the tab view will show different content depending on what cell is selected

2208273
scala	java
use the wonderful features scala provides you with and not just use it as java with nice syntax pattern-matching continuations generics and an extremely powerful types systemd higher-order functions

2208280
assign	add
.when a user that belongs to grouping a logs in does he automagically get assign credentials foobar or do i have to manually add the credentials to the user by say looking up its grouping- permissions in the db

2208280
logout	login
assuming the sf framework automagically takes care of user credentials depending on grouping membership is the effect real time or does a user have to logout login before the changes are applied in effect

2208280
logout	login
consequently i suspect that any grouping membership changes are not real time .so i will either have to force use to logout login or maybe use an event-listener or .something

2208298
windows-server	windows-xp
i m not sure if this is a good example of this but i ve seen many apps not work on windows-server because they were explicit checked for nt 5.1 windows-xp

2208311
tapestry	wicket
if you re using a component-based aka pull-based web framework tapestry wicket et al how do you determine that your markup passes w3c-validation

2208316
append	input
as michael mentions unless the iterator are input iterator the vector will figure out the required size and copy append data at one go with linear complexity

2208325
contains	any	contains	elements
i suspect the fact that any looks faster than contains .when the elements is seen very early is that the benchmarking can t reflect it easily since they are very close

2208347
google-chrome	firefox
for some maddening reason it works fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

2208348
contains	any
any is slower because contains is tailored to the specific containers you re using arraylist etc .so it doesn t have the overhead of firing up an ienumerable calling movenext all the time etc

2208348
contains	any
however using any will make refactoring easier since if you change that collections you can stil use it .so really i d only change it to contains if you know via a profiling that this is an important piece of code

2208348
contains	any
and if it is you should probably end up using a smarter data structure anyways like a hashset since both any and contains are o n

2208354
webserver	upload
if you have upload the xd_reciever file in the correct location just double checked you can actually access it with your browser and your webserver configuration doesn t prevent it

2208359
value	field
field f1 has different value based on the child class

2208359
value	field
as the methods m2 has common implementation but process field f1 which doesn t have same value for every child class .so should i place it in parent class or child class

2208360
json	xml
xml and json options

2208360
json	xml
xml json even php serialization arrays format as response parameters

2208360
put	get
faithful rest get put delete .post on noun urls

2208360
json-rpc	xml-rpc
there s some benefit to xml-rpc json-rpc in that you kinda know what you re getting back but in any case if i cant easily parsing your return-type with json or something like php s simplexml and essentially serialization it to a consistent hash i m going to be pissed

2208392
32-bit	64bit
compiling to intermediate code allows for runtime decisions that can be made that otherwise can t easily be made with a staticly-typed language like c++ it also allows the functioning of code on different hardware archetectures because the code then becomes descriptive in the sense that it also describe the intent of what should happen in a bit eg 32 or 64 -agnostic way as opposed to machine-specific code that only works on 32-bit systemd or 64bit systemd but not both

2208399
javascript	dom
otherwise javascript is not able to search manipulate dom elements correctly

2208400
ubuntu	debian	installation	environment
what are the environment variables made available to debian rules often make .when spawned by apt-get during installation of a package under ubuntu

2208400
configuration	environment
i am specifically after the environment variables that would pertain to gnome s configuration directory

2208417
32-bit	64bit
about why 32-bit application can run unmodified in 64bit systemd assuming you re talking about amd64 it s because the hw architects had that in mind and provided a legacy mode

2208420
environment	execution
assumptions about the execution environment as the jit compiler can

2208421
.when	ready
to make sure your code is run only .when your dom is ready

2208431
python	java
in the same way that dir and help will examine the documentation of package in python useful information in java can be gleaned from reading the javadoc for a particular api

2208441
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have a website that was originally written in webforms to which i have added asp.net-mvc functionality

2208441
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think the problem may be related to mixing asp.net-mvc into asp.net webforms

2208444
value	field
as the bool is a value-type and not nullable it is being rendering as a required properties and display an error client side .when the form is submitted reading the chargeable field is required. however as the html that is generator is two part both checkbox and hidden value it will pass the postback validation

2208447
click	mouse
now i m trying to change the background-color of the border elements that has the named background .when the user click the button with the left mouse button

2208455
silverlight	wpf
if i wanted to create some silverlight widget and hosts them within wpf is this possible

2208460
attributes	properties
also ensure the assembly attributes on the hibernate-mapping elements specifies the full assembly named of your project right-click project - properties - application tab

2208465
value	field
your form would need two selected field both will value 0-5 then you can take the both of them and use them to access a value in your arrays

2208490
cursor	row
i have a radgrid and i simply want the cursor to be a pointers on hover of every row

2208497
any	set
how do i initializer the new windows and pass any properties that need to be set from the windows to the user-controls

2208498
hide	show
then use jquery toggle on both all the filtering to cycle the enable disable or show hide the anchor tag or span elements

2208518
contains	elements
however you can have an arrays of variants and that can contains elements that are strings or double or other things of course

2208525
selected	cell
the keyword selectedion is already a vba range object .so you can use it directly and you don t have to selected cell to copy for example you can be on sheet1 and issue these cmd

2208528
web-config	app-config
if you are trying to encrypt your connection-string in your app-config web-config you can do .so using the configuration class

2208542
required	checked
but sanity checked are going to be required to handle either

2208566
hide	show
if i have read that wrong and you just want to show hide a link to depending on whether a user is authentication or not you can simple use

2208582
triggers	insert
thus the only way for me to prevent somebody from insert or updating these recording to an invalid state is to have a triggers to join with a and checked its detailed column

2208597
value	field
the edit control can be set programmatically - .when the dialog is being setup there may be an initial value placed into the edit field

2208620
credentials	ntlm
is there any way to reset or change the credentials java.net.authenticator is using after a successful ntlm authentication

2208623
restructuredtext	multimarkdown
if you need to go to multiple publishing mediums printing web etc you might consider a meta-format such as markdown multimarkdown restructuredtext or something similar

2208628
digits	zero
just an addition to kevin s answer since java 5 you can use string.format 0128x new biginteger 1 digesta instead of commons-codec to format the byte arrays as a 128 digits hex encode numbers with leading zero

2208637
versioning	upgrade
then the constructor of each project upgrade to the next versioning getting rid of deprecated field along the way

2208665
lighttpd	apache
you can see it being benchmarking against nginx lighttpd apache etc and come up on top link

2208668
temporary	copy
but we temporary set up our staging copy of login.domainy.com to use ssl and that had no effect

2208673
rackspace	amazon
you see in the case of amazon rackspace i can run my asp.net web .app on a single instances of windows-server 2008 and the rest on nix machines

2208673
rackspace	amazon
with ec2 rackspace youâ ll have to hire a sysadmin shelling 150k pa to do these things afaik amazon provides some of these feature at additional cost

2208673
rackspace	amazon
my comparisons are between azure and amazon rackspace instances and not cloud

2208680
contains	any	enumerator	any
as other people have already noted both the contains and any methods are extension methods of enumerator

2208680
contains	any
first of all you supply a delegation to the any which has to be called for every object while the contains methods doesn t have to

2208680
for-loop	arrays
internally this arrays.contains methods uses a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays to compare the value

2208680
contains	any
because the any methods must call your delegation a performance optimization as with the contains methods is not possible

2208680
contains	any
the reason that any is faster with small collectionss and in your case with a null value at the start of the collections has to do with the cast to icollections that the enumerable.contains does .when you do the cast to icollections yourself you ll see that the call to contains is faster than any

2208720
button	popup
the energy star software as part of the screensaver tab that is found .when you right click on the desktop anywhere a popup menu appears left click on the properties a display dialog box appears with different tab pages left click on screensaver click on power button as part of the monitor power grouping box that part of the dialog box somehow triggers the windows subsystem graphics card

2208720
hardware	monitor
to send a hardware signals to switching on the power savings functionality of the monitor itself... monitor that are branding new do not have this enabled by default afaik...feel free to dismiss this notion...

2208720
hardware	monitor
if the address of the hardware ports can be found then the value can be interrogated to determine if the monitor is in standby powered off suspended on by checked the horizontal sync and vertical sync this i think is the more reliable solution.

2208730
stateless	stateful
there is a server-side stateful component for each user .so intuitively this will limit the numbers of users compared to a traditional application that is stateless

2208730
stateless	stateful
stateful programming on the server for web apps is far far easier that stateless

2208744
nunit	mspec
mspec is not like nunit in that it only execute the context made up of the establish clauses from the current class and all base classes and the because clause once followed by all of the specifications it clauses

2208744
nunit	mspec
what you re actually doing here is using mspec like nunit

2208744
subclassing	base-class
after a while you may want to pull .some of the things in the establish context only into a base-class but in doing .so be sure that your entire subclassing stands alone in terms of understanding

2208747
extends	final
i tried to extends the java.net.url but it didn t work because its a final class

but if i put it in comp i get an error

2208876
perl	php
it can t be done without patching php or using a combinations of php and perl or something else

2208904
attributes	properties
i have considered adding a special parent attributes to these properties or using a special naming conventions but perhaps there is a better way

2208920
any	set
if loopss can be generalised you can have any numbers of elements making up loops you can keep tracking of object you ve seen already in a hashset and stop if the object is already in the set .when you visit it

2208921
arrays	map
the .net web-services framework will map a return-type of to a sequences of t at the soap level just as if you had used a arrays of t

2208937
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
i m not exactly sure what you are trying to do here but you could just maintain a hashtable with all previously visited nodes .when you are doing your breadth-first-search of depth-first-search

2208940

2208979
python	c++
i m working on a project that is written in both c++ and python

2208984
google-chrome	firefox

2209008
versioning	upgrade
i was running versioning 3 the i was able to upgrade to versioning 4 and the problem went away

2209026
deployment	install
my goal is to have the deployment install java .app server and .app deployment every time

2209030
duplicates	contains
the real pain is the event_time datetime column as it contains extremely large amounts of different datetime s and basicly everything is allowed duplicates as well as unpredictably large time intervals without recording to cover them

2209037
web-config	app-config
what this means to me is that i ve got an asp.net site that has a web-config and contains all sorts of good settings and another project that compiles to a dll that has it s own .config file app-config

2209067
expression	evaluation
for this specific question i don t think the same approach of entering insert mode and evaluation an expression is the best option

2209067
put	get
what you can do instead is to have the function get the current line put the time string at the appropriate place and set the current line again

2209072
blender	maya
in general what you ll want to do is use a model tool such as blender or maya to generator your model textures materials write out the data in some file-format then write code or use existing libs to read in your data and then display your data using opengl

2209072
converter	export
i ve seen some examples in the past of converter that actually generator code from data rather than just export data in a format that can be read in but its pretty limiting to do it that way and in the long run you might be happier you have something that works generically for any model you export

2209079
arrays	loops
if you need an odd size then absolute against an arrays of byte and loops through and convert to from each byte which would be two characters hex

2209083
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit windows 32-bit python returns

2209088
implements	extends
note that to implements an .app widget you extends .appwidgetprovider which is a broadcastreceiver

2209184
put	get
.post only becomes an issue .when it is used in a situation for which some other methods is ideally suited retrieval of information that should be a representation of some resource get complete replacement of a representation put

2209184
put	get
that means that we have to use the lowest common denominator technology - for a while we weren t able to use put because only get and .post were supported across all the client technologies

2209191
perl	php
i ve never coded in perl php before but based off of your question and the example here s a simple solution

2209213
configuration	environment
you can determine what configuration is being built via the configuration environment variables

2209213
environment	building
the same kind of thing can be done with scripting building ruless which is useful if you have multiple resources you want to apply this to you can create a scripting building rules that matches your extension and use the building settings and input files that are passed to your scripting via environment variables to do the actual copying

2209237
google-maps	openlayers
if .so both openlayers and google-maps will work with it and you are probably going to have to decide based upon client usage

2209242
application-pool	was
to answer my own question i played around with iis 7.0 and found out that .when the managed pipeline mode was set to integrated on the application-pool the above reflection code did not work

2209246
radio	click
radio click function variables mode this.value

2209248

2209340
sql-server	mysql
is there no mysql function that behaves similarly to sql-server s identity

2209346

2209356
rollback	commit
basically you should always commit or rollback your cursor

2209370
pointers	stack
in regards to speed the second approach should be theoretically faster because one less pointers is pushed onto stack at the end of the function-call do_something but a single pointers is minimal difference unless there is heavy repeated usage in which case carefully considering inlining should already be an consideration

2209380
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
this relies on a feature of java called autoboxing where it converts primitive to their corresponding boxing object -- like int to int or boolean to boolean -- automatically and without warning

2209408

2209414
cassini	iis
is this happening in cassini or in iis

2209414
handler	service
also you may want to make sure that the proper handler are in your web-config if you are still having issues after looking at the iis configuration if this ends up being web service related

2209421
button	popup
i want my code to popup a hint if it detection that the user needs to click a button

the field value in the sql-server database may or may not have leading zero as well

2209456
contains	elements
the xml document can have different child elementss inside the item elements nevertheless some of these child elementss are contains in all document the phone-number elements in the above example

2209466
stdout	stdio
you have to remember that as far as the regular stdio routines are concerned stdout is just a byte streaming with no inherent display characteristics

2209489
constructor	object
.when a constructor creates an object that object implicit references the constructorâ s â œprototypeâ properties for the purpose of resolving properties references

2209491
hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	show	fadeout	show	fadeout	fadein
the only way i could get it to work was to kill the fadein fadeout animation and just use show hide instead

2209494
emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	vim
some use eclipse some use coldfusion builder some use emacs or textmate or vim

2209495
groovy	java
i would suggest groovy rather than java

2209495

it s sort of java++ in that almost everything in java is also in groovy but groovy provides a numbers of benefits on top of that

2209509
youtube	vimeo
i want to embed videos from different video sites like youtube vimeo and .so on.

2209511
worldwind	jogl
i can t believe nobody has mentioned this yet but the nasa worldwind project seems like exactly what you need you can extends it with jogl if needed or you can use some of the vast model object already available to mark trajectory and location in 3d coordinates complete with zooming rotating and the like

2209515
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i need to copy the contents of an nsarray to nsmutablearray

2209520

also consider using a distribute version-control systemd mercurial bazaar git

2209574
contains	any
eliminate any verbiage that doesn t contains new information

2209578
json.net	wcf
if in doubt you can use the contract serialization from wcf or json.net if you re willing to include 3rd party code

2209603
double	int
there are several calculations involving dfreq .so i didn t eliminate it entirely as it does save the cost of multiple runtime conversions from int to double

2209603
double	int
i would expect performance to increase because the int to double conversion would only occur .when

2209631
jxtable	jtable
i will definitely suggest you to use jxtable for your tables instead of jtable

2209652
widget	button
the slot uses the sender methods to figure out which button was pressed .so the correct numbers would be written on the display widget

2209656
json	xml
also has some nice integration with hibernate jpa xml json serialization using xstream helpers for integration-testing and a pretty nice documentation

2209660
pixels	line
that is if the floated image is 200 pixels wide 200 pixels of text on the right end of the div will all be bumped to the next line

2209679

alternatively you might be able to defined alternately-named methods dynamically by iterator through attributes.keys and using defined_method though i m not sure .when in your object s lifecycle you would do that constructor

2209689
registration	login
we are at the early stages of creating a new website at the points where we need to building the login registration module

2209714
export	report
i m sure this is an issue anyone who uses stata for publications or report has run into how do you conveniently export your output to something that can be parsing by a scripting-language or excel

2209751
while-loop	for-loop
you aren t reinitializing the variables before the while-loop starts like in the for-loop

2209753
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am in the process of creating a hybrid webforms asp.net-mvc .app

2209770
updating	updates
i have code updating the width of the rectangle and something to updates the text in the dynamic textbox as well

2209785
updating	updates
you are using the same class for retrieving return-value types of read operation and updating an item input parameter types of updates operation in your wcf service

2209799
svg	vml
solved - cufã³n is a font-replacement solution that relies completely on javascript and javascriptable languages svg and vml thus allowing the resulting elements to be scripted like any other

2209840
data-structures	dictionary
i think you should take a look at the dictionary of algorithms and data-structures at the nist website

2209866
display	width
alternatively you can always set the blockquote to display inline but that may not be what you want as it then won t stretch to the full width anymore

2209868
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the easiest way to find this is use your browser s inspector google-chrome and safari has this built-in firefox use firebug no comment on ie

2209890
derived-class	base-class
how would you create an instances in a derived-class with a base-class with a protected constructor

2209913
contains	any
if it has any red offspring they have to be move because while the just-turned-green nodes containss their left ends it does not contains their right ends

2209936
protected	public
well the first difference that comes to mind is that an abstract-class can not be initializer but a class with protected constructor could be initializer throw another public methods

2209938
any	set
there is no concern about some future change breaking it the set of whole numbers won t change any time soon

2209940
twitter	tweets

here i am creating a form with same textbox as i used in filling the application form i am using same named for boxes .here is a button with named updates

2210052
numeric	zero
btw codes like this postal codes serial numbers ssn s etc. should always be stored as text data with the leading zero and never as an int or numeric types

2210058
.when	ready
.when someone gets the not yet ready resource use a 307 to temp

2210075
children	tree	children	nodes
the height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a terminal nodes in either of its children

2210075
children	nodes
since the nodes has no children the length of its longest path must be the empty sum 0 not -1

2210075
children	tree	children	nodes
likewise a non-empty tree has two children .so by definition there is at least a path 1 to a terminal nodes

2210077
jquery	.post
inspired by this messages board .post we tried to fix the annoyance by using javascript jquery like .so

2210100
integration	payment
i found this question but there s nothing there about storefront payment systemd integration

2210103

2210122
delphi-prism	vcl

put	get
this way they get to figure out what they want before i ve put a lot of time into the rest of the systemd

2210143
progress-bar	progress
note the unistd.h and usleep thing is just to fake the progress of an operation the progress-bar code itself just uses the standard-library

2210146
ssas	olap
olap databases or analysis service or ssas are much better suited for this kind of application and much better optimized for this kind of query

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
how can i implements a concurrent quicksort or mergesort algorithm for java

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
hence my question do you know of any correctly multithreading quicksort or mergesort implementation in java that would be coming from a reputable source

2210209
python	c++
c++ s operators is analogous to python __call__ it makes an object callable using the same syntax as a function-call

2210210
calayer	uiview
i don t think you can add a uiview subclassing to a calayer object

2210214
textbox	button
instead connect all the button to a qsignalmapper and then connect mapped to your textbox

2210223

2211351
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
note remember if you are making dynamic-sql to not leave yourself open to sql-injection attacks

2211367
authentication	login
instead you should at least have a login mechanism to create a session between client and server to make sure you can only get at stuff once you have authentication even then stuff is sniffable if security really is a concern then i would say you have to use ssl

this is one of the core underlying principles of oop an instances of a derived-class is an instances of its base-class

2211513
contains	set
here is a slight variation on the previous answers that avoids a permanent numberss table though i am not sure why people are .so afraid of this construct and allows you to building a runtime cte that contains exactly the set of numberss you ll need to perform the correct numbers of insert by checked for the highest quantity

2211554
licensing	lgpl
al.so qt is only available under the lgpl on windows .so licensing may be an issue

2211629
output	mode
now look at the run methods that is in asynchronous mode and runs as a single console windows - in fact a normals console application with no extra windows popping up notice the comments if you were to change those line it becomes a synchronous process shelling out very quickly you will notice that this console will create another windows with the output of the cmd arp

2211629
output	mode
because it is in asynchronous mode the output gets redirected to an event handler which stuffs the data into the stringbuilder instances for further processing.

2211641

2211714
verilog	vhdl	verilog	rtl	vhdl	rtl
it then synthesizes that c++ into rtl vhdl or verilog

2211714
verilog	vhdl	xilinx	fpga	altera	xilinx	altera	fpga
for hobbyists you re probably best off sticking with vhdl or verilog to describe your design and then using the free tools from xilinx or altera to synthesize that code and program the fpga

2211754
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie google-chrome but firefox show me an exception-handling at line 451 in recaptcha

subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
for example while it make sense for a calculator service to expose add subtract multiplying and divide operations i would use another service to expose a getquote operation

2211820
contains	elements
because of integer-division properties mentioned above you can verify that your output arrays will always contains n+1 2 elements

2211820
realloc	malloc
realloc null size is equivalent to malloc size .so you should replace your realloc with malloc

2211820
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc

2211820
strtol	atoi
atoi does no error checked if you have learned about strtol you should use that

tuples	sorted	sorted	lookup
consider using shelve instead -- that will use little memory since the data reside on disk and still offer pretty spiffy lookup performance not as fast as an in-memory dictionary of course but for a large amount of data it will be much faster than lookup on a list of tuples even a sorted one can ever be

2212021
contains	set	contains	elements
the problem seems to be that for some reason even .when set as const and contains only elements present at compile-time the primary__secondary struct is not a compile-time constants and thus cannot be stored in another struct at compile-time

2212023
contains	sorted
arrayss.sort is guaranteed to return a sorted arrays no matter what your arrays contains

but it wasn t for safari and google-chrome

2212544
32-bit	64bit
you may be able to reduce the effect by using int32 rather than int but that may not make much difference and could potentially harm performance as your cpu may handle native 64bit value more efficiently than half-size 32-bit value

2212544
32-bit	64bit
maybe time your code on a 32-bit pc and then time it doing the same task on a 64bit pc

the border has to be erased under the or whatever other tag will be used and since there could be a complex body background-image i can t afford to just set the background-color of the legend to match the one of the elements under

2213894
constructor	object
if a methods takes a reference to an object as a parameter and the class defined a copy construtor then the class uses the constructor to create a copy of itself and that gets passed to the function instead of a reference to the original object

2213900
getter	setter
see why getter and setter methods are evil for an interesting discussion of this

2213900
getter	setter
i typically do use setter but rarely use getter

2213902
security	owasp
if you re particularly interested in web security i heavily recommend owasp the open web application security project

2213902
security	owasp
owasp is a consortium that focuses exclusively on web security for development and testing

2213902
administration	credentials
shutting down a server obtaining administration credentials and then shutting down the server from within or disrupting users is common

2213909
constructor	object
in the second case you are passing a pointers to the constructor of object hence no copy is created

2213909
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
.so object should have a constructor not a copy-constructor which is .something like

2213910
contains	any	contains	sorted
the sorted versioning of an arrays contains england france germany would be the same in any country.

2213910
contains	any
they don t contains any accented characters or whatever

2213923
duplicates	elements
and i want to remove duplicates elements from it

2213923
tuples	set
.so i can turn all lists to tuples then use set and back to lists

2213924
software-quality	metrics
metrics and model in software-quality engineering

2213924
software-quality	metrics
not always very fun to read but it s an excellent book that covers software-quality and metrics in depth

2213925
oracle	mysql
oracle and mysql handle locking differently in different situations

2213925
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
oracle doesn t have autoincrementing primary key like mysql and sql-server

2213950
oracle	mysql
i see job ads requesting knowledge of mysql mssql oracle etc

2213952
client-server	security
you are basically talking about doing client-server architecture where your client application talks directly to the datastore mongodb. what about security

2213959
updating	updates
the problem seems to be that the textbox will not updates the presented value during updating of the source properties it is bound to by itself

2213961
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari a character is insert but the cursor won t move to the right of it

2213961
google-chrome	firefox
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2213963
any	set
the rules of engagement here are that __init__ must set all attributes to initial value then call self._dolock to forbid any further addition of attributes

2213963
python	java	python	c++	python	ruby
the thesis is controversial jeff attwood and his commenters debate it here for example but it s interesting to note that martin and eckel are both well-known experts of static languages such as c++ and java albeit with love affairs respectively with ruby and python and they re far from the only ones to have discovered the importance of unit-tests.

2213973
average	median
but .sometimes essentially for tragically crucial bottlenecks in deep inner loops of code that s pushing the boundaries of performance limits one may need to go into much more detail providing probability distributions deciding which performance measures to optimize maybe the upper bound or the 90th centile is more important than an average or median depending on one s apps performing possibly-heuristic checked at the start to pick different algorithms depending on input data characteristics and .so forth

2213973
tuples	set
it s also well worth considering keeping a different representation for k -- why does it have to be a list of lists rather than a set of tuples in the first place

2213973
tuples	set
if the duplicates removal task is frequent and profiling show it to be the program s performance bottleneck keeping a set of tuples all the time and getting a list of lists from it only if and where needed might be faster overall for example

2213981
linux	unix
if you are handling all your own licensing working under a bizspark license is it possible run windows on an ec2 instances marked for linux unix

2213986
contains	lookup
i d also like to avoid forcing a lookup in the passwd database as that is a remote rpc nis or ldap and i m pretty sure wtmp already contains the information i need

2213987
panels	grid	contains	elements
the scenario is that a parent elements which has its own drageventhandler s in this case grid contains child elements panels which also has its own drageventhandler s

2213987
mouseevent	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseevent	mouseleave	mouseenter
strange enough for mouseevent like mouseenter or mouseleave handler of both parent and child work

2213989
contains	any
this probably sounds too simple but really from the looks of things you are looking for a string that contains either a-za-z0-9 + a-za-z0-9 i mean without in depth-testing against the data really what you re looking for is a quote or double quote or any combinations in between letters you could also add numbers there

2213989
python	perl
i m sorry i don t know python regex s but in perl this would look something like this

2213993
dictionary	arrays
creating a collections object arrays of size information dictionary nsnumber of row height etc. based on the collections object that will be used for the table view

2214004
arrays	loops
since xpath returns an arrays maybe you can do more complex opration in a foreach loops

2214018
bazaar	git
pip can install from subversion svn git mercurial and bazaar repositories

2214028
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
even something as simple as an auto-incrementing primary key can be very different in oracle mysql and sql-server

2214028
sql-server	mysql
common table expression in sql-server and mysql are similar but not exactly the same

2214028
sql-server	oracle
i m sure that there are many many more difference but that should give you at least a basic idea of why 5 years of experience with oracle is completely different from 5 years of experience with sql-server

2214044
callback	methods
you can register your callback in your activity and callback to a methods in the activity

2214047
spaces	output
.so having only a 32-bit seed spaces means that an adversary wishing to determine if your streaming is truely random or break your encryption algorithm depending upon the random numbers generator only has to go through a 32-bit keyspaces seed spaces and sample the output of the generator to compare against your provided random streaming and see if it matches

2214049
base	zero
as you noted the establishes the base cases the first two value in the sequences are zero then one

2214050
contains	any
then any file you are using the c++ object from rename from .m to .mm to tell xcode the file contains a mixture of objective-c and c++

2214065
sql-server	mysql
i have a sql-server db that i would like to ports to mysql

2214081
digits	zero
b is a zero-width marker for a word-boundary therefore b0 cannot have a digits before the zero

2214089
file-access	filesystems	filesystems	fat
it s not the filesystems which is almost universally fat or fat32 for these kinds of devices or even limitations in the windows drivers although the limits are probably enforced there to avoid confusing the device but limited numbers of file descriptors in the device s embedded file-access code

2214094
updatepanel	gridview
i have an updatepanel which contains a gridview inside which is a buttonfield

2214122
stripes	wicket
some recurrent named spring-mvc stripes wicket

2214122
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
it sounds as though moving to ruby or python would actually be easier which is curious since .when i look at it java conceptually seems the closest to php albeit stricter and precompile

2214129
bluetooth	usb
if a usb device provider want to expose the device to a standards way most of them do conform to standardss to save costs on develop document and educate clients about their apis their drivers programmers can write driverss that make the device available to various windows apis massive storage wia directshow virtual-serial-port bluetooth human interface device etc

2214138
append	input
now the elements that we just computed is not just the output of the zipwith function it is at the same time also the input as it gets append to both lists which are actually the same list just shifted by one

2214168
revision	updates
.when you do team updates on the project all folder and files are updatess to a single uniform revision

2214168
revision	svn
this one explains the core svn concept of a mixed revision working copy and is essential to understanding this

2214168
revision	updates
the main thing is just to occasionally use team updates on your project to bring it all up to a single uniform revision

2214179
increment	reset
id s are there to uniquely identifiy the course and can be used as references in other tables .so you shouldn t repeat ids and shouldn t be seeking to reset the auto increment field

2214180
value	field
function add_field field value

2214193
jquery	.post
i did the very same with like 20 line of jquery code and it s a bit configurable - if you re interested i could .post it

2214196
realloc	malloc
then the next time you call setname you end up calling realloc with a pointers that you didn t get from malloc

2214201
protected	public
alice removes the public key padlock with her key meaning the package is now protected only by the private-key

2214209
key-value	key
if you really want to find the lowest unused key-value don t use auto_increment at all and manage your key manually

2214209
unsigned	bigint
do unsigned int or bigint not provide a large enough key spaces

2214219
ruby	php
i am trying to convert a small bit of ruby to php and i have had success .so far except for this one line

2214223
comparison-operators	operands
the order comparison-operators raise a typeerror exception-handling .when the operands donâ t have a meaningful natural order

2214251
.when	ready
.when you are ready to send

2214256
python	ruby
much more .so than python or ruby

2214275
hash	md5
the openssl libs allows you to add blocks of data to a ongoing hash sha1 md5 then .when you have finished adding all the data you call the final methods and it will output the final hash

2214275
hash	md5
you don t calculate md5 on each individual block then add it rather you add the data to the ongoing hash methods from the openssl libs

2214275
hash	md5
this will then give you an md5 hash of all the individual data blocks with no limit on the input data size

2214300
hash	md5
with that in mind you don t want to combine two md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its worth noting that if for .some rea.son you do want md5 hash of subsections of the file as you go along this is .sometimes useful for doing interim checked on a large file being transfer over a low bandwidth connection then you can get them by cloning the digest object at any time like .so

2214304
hash	md5
this does not affect the actual digest object .so you can continue to work with the overall md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its also worth noting that md5 is an outdated hash for cryptography purposes such as verifying file authenticity from an untrusted source and should be replace with something better in most circumstances such as sha-1

2214328
file-descriptor	fclose
once you call fdopen you should no longer do anything with the file-descriptor - not even close it .when you call fclose the underlying descriptor will be closed

2214328
file-descriptor	fclose
once you have used fdopen on a file-descriptor you must call fclose or you risk leaking resources allocated for the file and you cannot call close on the descriptor since fclose the descriptor for you can run into problems closing the descriptor multiple time

2214337
arguments	default
cache.get can take a default arguments

2214345
hash-collision	key
also as sellibitze says an operators is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2214346
defined	declare
references in c++ are a distinct advantage over c since it allows the programmer to declare and defined operators that look syntactically identical to those that are available for int

2214358
contains	elements
the main reason for this is that the form elements serves the functional and semantic purpose of contains input while fieldset has possessed since the early days had special non-reproducable visual effects

2214358
any	set	contains	any	contains	set	contains	elements
in addition if the visual elements in the fieldset are in any way functional semantics the fieldset does again contains a set of interactive widget which was the original points

2214371
directory	folder
i have created the uiwebview but want to know the best way of capturing the files .when they are linked to in the webview and then downloading them to a specified folder in the document directory

2214395
windows-xp	windows
microsoft s stack is introduced in windows-xp sp1 and is accessible using windows wireless sdk

2214405
constructor	object
the newinstance methods in a class object only works for a concrete class with a no-arg constructor

2214405
constructor	object
as it is it has an implicit constructor with the outer object as a parameter and does not have a no-arg constructor

2214408
execute	prepare
now i know .when a query using a prepare statement is execute twice in a single php scripting it s faster because the query is only parsing once once for each query

2214422
sql-server	mysql
i ve not used them recently with mysql but i ve used them heavily with sql-server - and they work great

2214428
any	set
if you must have automatic and instant configuration options set with the deployment you can specify the default configuration options to be what you need in a configuration.xml that will be loaded after your module that depends on your module. i ve never done it this way but i don t see any reason why it wouldn t work

2214435
calloc	malloc
we can also use a variation of the malloc function called calloc

2214441
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning on bundler

2214442
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
i use uinavigationcontroller and uitableview to display this menu systemd

2214472
dictionary	arrays
you can either use an arrays instead i don t see any reason why you would need a dictionary from your example or you can create an arrays that indexes the dictionary

2214472
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
.so start with the dictionary you have now create an arrays loops through the dictionary and set the arrays value to the key in the dictionary

2214474
dictionary	arrays
you need an arrays of dictionary object that have a title and a list of options

2214477
buffering	streaming
systemd produce and consume streaming of bytes or characters rather than byte buffering

2214484
treeview	listview
in the specific case of a treeview i find that switching to a listview in combinations with zero one or more controls makes for a more usable solution that often is easier to implements

2214488
windows-xp	windows
i have a c++ vs2005 application that makes use of getadaptersaddresses on windows-xp and i need to provide most of the same information from ip_adapter_addresses with regards to ipv4 i don t need ipv6 in windows 2000 win2ksp4

2214516
nhibernate	ado.net
it has a great feature set very good support and is much more polished feeling to use than most of the other options i ve tried including ado.net ef and nhibernate fluent-nhibernate

2214529
execute	prepare
each php process thread visitor that execute that same scripting again will not prevent mysql from re-parsing the query to prepare the statement as its valid in a per connection basis .so its very effective for queries repeated in the same scripting

2214529
execute	prepare
now i cant argue about prepare + execute vs simple query performance wise w o repeated queries

2214568
assign	add
but if the div is being dynamically added to the dom then i can use live instead and jquery will automatically assign an event whenever i dynamically add the elements

2214577
double	int
rectangle2d is an abstract-class that doesn t care if you re using int double or float coordinates

2214589
httpd.conf	.htaccess
i ve setting in httpd.conf to restrict access to .htaccess files for all sites and it s working for most of the sites

2214601
instance-variables	local-variables
they are stored in local-variables passed as arguments in messages expression and in function-calls held in instance-variables field inside object and in other kinds of memory structures

2214603
any	set
in other words the set of regex expression would me compared to the uri inorder to determine if any of them matches the uri and determine the action to take from that on

2214604
spaces	output
output has 4 elements .so we allocate spaces for 4+1 5 elements for the new input

2214604
spaces	output
output has 2 elements .so we allocate spaces for 2+1 3 elements for the new input

2214606
arrays	loops
arraysobject is a full-fledged object that implements numerous interfaces countable arraysaccess etc. and enables an object to act like an arrays in certain cases like in a foreach loops

2214616
webforms	asp.net
we have a webforms based asp.net application with wizard based interfaces

2214621
writetofile	nsdata
you can later decide what to do with nsdata you can save it to file on the document folder using the nsdata writetofile methods

2214637
show	next
.when that button is pressed i want the next view controllers show to be a screens which has a uinavigationcontrollers

2214649
multicast	packets
you need some centralized place to send the packets back out via a multicast or else you need a decentralized approach where every client is connect to every other client and each client is hosting a multicast

2214651
unsigned	zero
i want to create an arrays in python with 100 million entries unsigned 4-byte int initializer to zero

2214683
contains	elements
to pass parameters to the action you just need to make sure that all of the data elements you want to pass are contains within the tag

2214685
realloc	malloc
edit ok with the valgrind errors we can see that a you re passing something dodgy to printf if you compile with -g you ll get the exact line numbers and also you re calling realloc but not on a pointers you got back from malloc

2214686
contains	any
the reason why the event handler stops working .when not declare is that the html page generator by asp.net does not contains any information about server-side binding

2214686
webforms	asp.net
in short asp.net webforms tries to set up the illusion of a unified stateful client-to-server form but the illusion is easily shattered .when trying to do things outside of the usual pattern

2214710
dictionary	arrays
in addition to the other excellent solutions another way is to use a dictionary instead of an arrays elements which exist are non-zero otherwise they re zero

2214711
arrays	loops
at the moment i ve got 2 instances of that class placeinmap stored in nsmutablearrays and whenever a click happens i loops through that arrays and call each instances methods

2214711
nsinteger	int
currentlyhere is nsinteger but i ve tried it with int and bool also.

2214715
search-engine	web-crawler
the biggest problem with making a whole site in gwt is that you get basically no search-engine optimization since all the code is javascript and web-crawler don t do javascript

2214724
constructor	object
is it possible for a user object constructor to .somehow fail .so that is assign a null value and the object is free after constructor returns

2214736
traversal	parent
since you re simply iterator over a gtkliststore you can ignore all of the api dealing with child parent relations and simply use gtk_tree_model_iter_first and gtk_tree_model_iter_next to traversal the list

2214757
administration	account
.when it comes to debugging such issues i d escalate the iis account to local domain administration just to see if the problem is solved or not

2214759
javascript	dom
besides if you restart off not working with the dom then you re not getting much benefit from using almost any libs as the bulk of most javascript libs has to do with handling the dom

2214775
aggregate	grouping
the duration is stored in the yt duration nodes under the media grouping aggregate

2214775
python	java	python	php
there are client libs created by google for java .net python php and objective-c

2214779
lookup	any
you could also maybe do a site place_url_here lookup on google to see if it actually returns any pages

2214800
security	owasp
read the owasp top 10 because there is a whole lot more than can go wrong with web application security

2214802
attributes	properties
merely setting a named properties or x named attributes does not register that named into any xaml namedscope

2214802
silverlight	wpf
i d recommend reading the first link in its entirety if you plan on using wpf silverlight in any depth

2214809
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs is a mac-friendly versioning of emacs

2214809
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs has the option to rebind option cmd and meta in various stages between native mac key-binding and native emacs binding

2214812
istream	std
now i d like to implements several ways to construct a foo object and fill it with data from std istream from an iterator a vector etc

2214812
istream	std
i could just add all those constructor directly in foo but i don t really want the foo user to have to include std istream etc

2214818
default	reset
also simplified the variables at the top but that s more preferences several merely reset default value

2214826
istream	std
to include std istream etc

2214826
istream	std
your constructor for std istream can forwarding declare it and pass it as a reference

2214829
istream	std
to include std istream etc

2214833
push	pull
only the most basic mercurial cmd are subrepo-aware clone push pull updates commit and perhaps a couple of others

2214835
linked-list	arrays
bubble-sort works the same no matter if you are talking an arrays or a linked-list pointers

2214838
perl	ruby
i m migrating a perl scripting to ruby

2214844
pixels	line
i tested openmp with image-processing and there a line of pixels was convenient as well giving good speedups

2214846
radio	click
ok .so this will checked unchecked the child radio input inside the selected span .when i click inside it

2214877
command-pattern	memento
the memento pattern would be used in conjunction with command-pattern it is not a replacement to the usage of command-pattern

2214896
look-and-feel	substance
you can change the title bar look-and-feel with substance support

2214904
any	set
what you need to do is to ensure that the column that you want to make of types nvarchar has character set set to any unicode character set utf8 is the best choice i believe either explicit or by inherited

2214910
contains	elements
otherwise you reallocate input to contains elements reallocate output to contains elements and call the function step_once again

2214910
spaces	output
output has 4 elements .so we allocate spaces for 4+1 5 elements for the new input

2214910
spaces	output
output has 2 elements .so we allocate spaces for 2+1 3 elements for the new input

2214923
visitor-pattern	visitor
this may be something that you d want to use the visitor-pattern for -- -- because you might eventually want to use different sorts of serialization for different things and you can have different visitor classes rather than a lot of special cases in the model code

2214923
handler	service
frequently the transmission web service or whatever code you re using will have its own handler for this data for example objectiveresource adds a serialization and deserialization handler that works as an extension to nsobject that enables it to do a lot of this stuff transparently and you might look into that code particularly the objectivesupport part if you re trying to do this more generically

2214940
haskell	lisp
other languages like haskell give you structured types named and unnamed and - in contrast to lisp - allow for static typechecking

2214940
haskell	lisp
some lisp implementation provide such state - you get a setq opeator - while haskell doesn t

2214941
git-repo	repo	.when	ready
i ve got a staging server with git on it my buddy and i push changes to that git-repo from our local clones of that repo .when we re ready to make something public we tag-it n all that but then i have to do a git reset --hard to updates the actual files on the server to head which seems a bit strange to me

2214980
instance-variables	superclass	instance-variables	nsobject	subclassing	superclass	subclassing	nsobject
.when you subclassing nsobject and add some instance-variables you are for all intents and purposes simply creating a new c structure that contains your instance-variables as slots in that structure concatenation on the slots for the instance-variables for all superclass

2214980
subclassing	superclass
the modern runtime works slightly differently .so that a superclass can have ivars append without requiring all subclassing to be recompiled

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this this was working for google-chrome but not firefox

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this was working for firefox but not google-chrome

2214987
configuration	environment
you would have one configuration file and each client can checked it out and modify it at will to suit their own environment development testing production etc

2215012
g++	gcc
.when you get cygwin install the c++ compiler build-tools gcc g++ make autotools etc

2215028
onkeydown	onkeyup
but for some reason onkeyup and onkeydown are not getting called

2215035
controllers	routes
the 2nd routes everything else to the original controllers

2215037
linux	bsd
while i don t have extensive experience with windows kernel hooks in bsd and linux its trivial to install a kernel-module that over-writes the systemd call for creating sockets and could easily redirect all sockets to a proxy socket of choice

2215053
openssl	nss
if you needed security functions like ssl tls which you don t need for a simple game i guess there are open source libs like openssl gnu tls mozilla nss

2215060
pthreads	fork	pthreads	openmp
learn several technologies like plain old fork forget or manual multithreading java threads or pthreads mpi openmp bsp maybe even cuda or opencl

2215063
windows-vista	windows
i have found the function getcurrentprocessornumber for windows but this only works on windows-vista and later

2215085
windows-vista	windows
if you re using windows-vista or better consider windows filtering platform wfp

2215085
easyhook	detours
also consider looking at detours commercial and easyhook free

2215090
treeview	grid
alternatively perhaps there is some state setting i can make to the treeview that will leave the intermediate nodes uninitialized as i traversal the grid

2215091
haskell	ocaml
.so while r is undoubtedly the best language for statistical computing i see .some value in being familiar with another language like ocaml haskell or possibly clojure incanter

2215092
protected	public
.so basically defining a field is as simple as typing in the access public private protected giving it a types string int string object and giving it a named

2215096
pascal	delphi
part of its inherited stems from pascal and brings one of the features that delphi users have always loved in their compilation environment incredible compile speeds

2215104
treeview	listview	datagridview	treeview	datagridview	listview
the stats panels is done and working but the other panels may contains a datagridview a listview or a treeview whichever the user adds at design-time

2215126
python	c++
it isn t provided they are derived from whatever the standards base exception-handling types is std exception-handling in c++ or exception-handling in python etc...

2215146
relational-database	schema
at this points you ve hand-crafted a relational-database schema such that it has a 1 1 mapping with your domain model

2215152
nsuserdefaults	nsstring
i wonder if you just saved this nsstring to the nsuserdefaults you d have a much easier time

2215174
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
the x86 libs are for 32-bit applications and the x64 libs are for 64bit applications

2215174
32-bit	64bit
unless you have a good reason you should be writing 32-bit applications since 64bit apps will required the 64bit versioning of windows to run

this is especially true of base-class properties because you end up with a types in a derived-class and you have no idea what kind if types it is

2217061
variables	boolean
are boolean variables named .so that their meanings .when they re true are clear

2217070
javascript	dom
this is xml code and i want to write code with javascript using dom to get the father mother daughter and son named ------- ali mona ghada and mohamed

2217071
domain-object	repository
the user repository would return a user domain-object that was the aggregate root and the user object contains roles

2217075
defined	declare
i d like xcode to warn me if i defined a methods but don t declare it in the class s interface block

2217080
ruby-on-rails	django
this is something that required slightly more work in django and considering i m putting mostly emphasis on the api portion of the .app ruby-on-rails makes more sense this time around

2217081
put	get
will it get laggy if i fetch 1 million link elements and put it in the dom

2217101
textbox	button
i have several textbox in a form and have a button which insert all the value in a database and i have to clear the content of all the textbox and focus to the first one right after pressing the button

2217123
workflow-foundation	quartz.net	masstransit	nservicebus
other integration include asp.net-mvc monorail workflow-foundation nservicebus masstransit rhino service bus quartz.net solrnet solrsharp windows fax service

2217143
contains	elements
the other one only contains the last minimum elements seen

2217152
constructor	private
i know singleton class is not supporting in flex.because it does not access private constructor

2217154
arrays	loops
you could loops through the arrays

2217168
specifications	w3c
note that this is standards-compliant because w3c doesn t say anything about supporting alternate spelling of gray and gray is indeed the color named according to the specifications for css3

2217173
interpreter	runtime
the purpose of my grammar apart from learning is to create an executable runtime interpreter language

2217214
arguments	default
keep in mind though that php versioning starting from 5.3 pass value to functions by reference by default the ampersand preceding arguments variables in the function-declaration is redundant

2217217
delphi	vb.net	delphi	c++
the original code is in c++ but there are links to ports of the code to vb.net and delphi

2217247
contains	set
if you have multiple ways a function can go wrong then you can either return different int or set a global error variables errno is used by the standard-library to contains the error-code

2217257
ruby-on-rails	django
i m a django not ruby-on-rails coder but i think you should launchd the servers at different ports

2217263
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the following show the behavior both google-chrome and ie are consistent i haven t checked opera in saying that domconfig is not a properties of windows but firefox claims it is but can t retrieve it copy-paste into url field since i can t get markdown to give a link

2217274
value	field
selected the types field and if the value is null use all ads as the default-value

2217274
value	field
then you pass it a field named and a static value

2217274
value	field
kind of makes sense that it is checked if that field value is false

2217274
value	field
and the only other thing there is the value .so we can come to the conclusion that it will use the static value if the field value is null

2217280
aggregate	grouping
the manual describe it well but the basic idea is that each grouping is aggregate and then you get one extra grouping at the end which aggregate the rows from all groupinging and where field is set to null

2217281
accessor	ivar
you seem to be moving between accessor and direct ivar access which is very confusing and error-prone

2217282
developer-tools	console.log
in ie8 using the ie8 developer-tools i also have access to a console.log which will write out as above

2217289
double	int
if the key is the double types i cannot initializer it at all and even if i can theoretically assign an int to every possible input i have several tens of thousands possible input and i only actually use a handful

2217326
getter	setter
some methods called accessor we write very frequently these are methods of the form - int variables called getter and - void setvariables int newvalue called setter

2217331
getter	setter
the code will assume your abean follows the javabeans conventions that is a properties is defined by its getter and setter

2217331
getter	setter
the getter and setter respectively are of the form and

2217331
getter	setter
note the named of the properties begins with a capital letter in the getter and setter methods while the bean properties s named begins with a lower case letter

2217338
credentials	security
the most widely-compatible methods of web service security that is still actually secure is transport with messages credentials

2217338
http	ssl
this uses ssl http for transport-layer security which handles the encryption aspects and passes a username passwd in the soap header which handles the authentication side

2217338
.net	wcf
i know that .net wcf is pretty good at this but i m not too sure how well java and c++ fare

2217343
any	set
any ideas how to get it just to set the mins seconds and mili seconds from the textinput stated above

2217364
specifications	w3c
the official specifications for well-formed xml is on the w3c website

2217367
buildpath	libs
you can verify this by right click the project and selected something like buildpath configure buildpath then click the libs tab

2217386
dictionary	hashmap
i don t know haskell specifically but how about keeping existing answers in some hash datastructure might be called a dictionary or hashmap

2217404
contains	any
shouldnâ t contains any logic that you want to test as glenn said that mvvm is not code count exercise we can write code in code-behind

2217404
getter	setter
with passive view the properties are not using databinding instead the view properties getter and setter are used to directly set the control value

2217413
jms	jmx
jmx jms spring task scheduling spring-integration mix match or all

2217424
json	xml
if your goal is to convert the data to xml or json or yaml look at this example for a gelatin syntax that produces the following output

2217426
contains	elements
my thought was that i d checked to see if this contains a particular dom elements

2217449
tuples	any
have your function return a tuples of status result where the status can be numeric or a string and the result can be any python data structure you fancy

2217459
malloc	free
it simply wrap malloc and free

2217469
value	field
now arrays is suitable to be used as the data to an arraysstore with field named and value

2217476
appdata	temp
configuration file c users sadesh appdata local temp context46924.xml .war file c users sadesh document netbeansprojects tambrambuzz building web

2217515
nsstring	nsdata
from there it is a matter of converting the nsstring to an nsdata and writing it

2217519
glib	gtk
however i m curious if this functionality is out there somewhere in the standards libs gtk or glib or in some other easily reused c libs already and i just haven t stumbled on it

2217541
selection	cell
i d like the datagridview to behave such that .when it has focus if you start typing the current row selection will jump to the row where the string value of cell 0 the first column in the row starts with the characters you typed in

2217541
selected	cell
i have a rough idea in my head to do this via some sort of short lived timer thread collecting the keystrokes on keypress events for the datagridview and selected rows based on those collected keystrokes matching a cell 0 .value.startswith types of conditional

2217554
contains	elements
i need to get the index of the li elements that contains the current image but the problem is that infinite carousel removes and reorders the li s automatically which means that their eq properties are constantly changing

2217558
value	field
you could add a methods to your manors model that will return all the field value from there you can just loops over these value in your templates checked to see if the value isn t null

2217561
multiplication	algebra
the core of any answer should be this -- the transformation that 3d engines perform are mostly specified in additions and multiplication linear algebra no branches or jumps the operations of a drawing a single frame is often specified in a way that multiple such add-mul s jobs can be done in parallels

2217588
contains	sorted
memcpy all struct and create a sorted list where each entry contains address of original struct and address of copy of struct

2217609
switching	screens
use levels of detail as much as you can -- low medium high versioninging of 3d model and switching based on distance from camera player - no points rendering a high-res versioning if it s only 5 pixels on screens

2217613
selected	textbox
i d like give focus to a textbox after a tab has been selected but no matter what i try it doesn t work

2217622
rvm	gem
as a side-effect of using rvm you no longer will have to use sudo to install gem

2217642
alt	src
img src img thumbs empty.png alt coming soon

2217646
put	get
i am able to get all of the spacing to work by setting a topmargin but this doesn t allow me to put the username header in

2217664
input-field	textarea
i want to add helpful text in javascript without any framework use in input-field text and textarea something like this but dont know what its called

2217684
glassfish	weblogic
but while some jms providers do offer such features mq weblogic jboss this is not a standards thing afaik for example glassfish openmq doesn t offer this

2217684
execution	jobs
another approach would be to use a scheduling especially if you also want to delay or scheduling the jobs execution - and i m thinking to quartz here - and to rescheduling jobs on failure this is fully supported by quartz

2217688
.when	ready
however .when developing this code on windows 7 i noticed that the progress-bar would rise to about 75 and then the button text would change to ready

2217688
progress-bar	progress
often it is very hard to make a progress-bar accurate .when the long operation involves complex code but in my particular case it was very straight forwarding and .so i was little disappointed .when i found the progress control did not accurately represent the progress

2217699
jms	jmx
of the technologies you mentioned jmx isn t relevant to the problem and while jms would probably work it is likely to be overkill the amount of effort in setting it up can be considerable depending on your platform

2217714
associations	model
assuming you set up the relationship in your model this is just how activerecord sets up these associations for you

2217721
margins	padding
this will also eliminate the few pixels white border around the edges if you want to maintain that take out the margins and padding declarations

2217731
build-system	jam
the jam build-system on mac os x causes the static lua libs to be linked in with the luabind shared libs causing duplicates symbols and duplicates static-variables .when i link my final binary

2217745
invoices	product
basically keeping tracking of invoices clients product and the attached data

2217747
configuration	installation
my configuration is a glassfish v3 installation with the current railo oss

2217751
compact-framework	.net
after having my first look into the visual-studio 2008 installation setup-project templates for smart devices and wondering how unintuitive this is and after searching the .net for about an hour and paging through my cf books i still have not been able to find out how i can create a setup package .cab file setup.exe whatever that include my compact-framework 3.5 application as well as cf 3.5 itself and sql-server-ce .so that the prerequisites get install if necessary with my application automatically

2217754
required	checked
i have an object which required the load of 2 javascript libs jquery and swfobject who may be already loaded or not .so i have to checked both before calling the final methods output

2217757
controllers	routes
to see all the routes that your application knows about for your resources and controllers

2217774
xsd	xml
look into xsd.exe - this tool allows you to create an xsd schema from a sample xml document your export form oracle and create a .net class from a given xsd schema

2217795
temporary	copy
i do not believe i make a temporary copy

2217816
environment	execution
it probably has to do with the locale of the execution environment

2217820
haskell	c++
attempting to simulate a pattern-matching styles in c++ using rtti is a neat idea but it s bound to have shortcomings because there are some significant difference between haskell and standards ml styles types constructor and c++ subclassing

2217820
subclassing	base-class
in c++ you have to go well out of your way to restrict who can subclassing your base-class

2217839
expression	brackets
the current regular expression i have is however it won t selected a methods that has brackets inside like function user

2217842
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 2 bytes

2217852
singleton	facade
if your set of c libs routines is not too large you can try combining the singleton and facade patterns .so that c libs routines are only invoked via the facade

2217852
singleton	facade
singleton insures that there is only one instances of the facade

2217873
println	output
in grails the grails test-app the output of log.debug and println is not recorded to the console and it is not in the report either

2217873
println	output
can any one please let me know how to see the output of println or log.debug in the console to speed up my developement

2217883
iframe	popup
my current setup involves having an iframe for each link and that iframe popup in a thickbox .when it is click

2217883
debugging	trace
where new_url is populate via a large switching statement and by using trace debugging i know that at least that works

2217883
lightbox	preload
however .when the lightbox popup the map that is show never changes...it is simply the initial one that i preload

2217885
show	next
on .some mouse over div1 is displayed.how to display the div next to the mouse pointers .so that even mouseover at the end of the context the div should show up next to the mouse pointers

2217894
double	int
b if compiler doesnâ t complain about implicit narrowing conversion from int literals to types byte then why doesnâ t it also allow an implicit narrowing conversion from double literals to types float i realize we could avoid this error by specifying float literals using f f suffix

2217896
value	field
i want to retrieve both title value field description textfield .when i perform the form-submit

2217896
value	field
i can access the title value field but i can t access the description

2217924
value	field
what i need to do is customize my default userform by adding a passwdagain field and set the value to the new field equals to the passwd field

2217925
python	java	python	ruby
in ruby as in java and python among others assignment does not copy the value it just stores another reference to the same value in the assigned-to variables

2217928
contains	set
excludes individual characters in a set but i want to exclude specific sequences of characters .something like .so that strings contains not or this are not matched

2217944
language-implementation	interpreter
i recommend reading chapter 9 building high-level interpreter from language-implementation patterns by terence parr

2217946
groovy	java	ruby-on-rails	grails
for quick and dirty i suggest ruby-on-rails if you fancy a bit of ruby or grails if you fancy a bit of java groovy and is essentially the java platform equivalent of ruby-on-rails

2217957
hide	show
the jquery to make the submenus hide and show

2217961
click	mouse
click button but also interact with the scene .when the mouse is no longer on top of the webpage windows

2217965
floating	margins
note the margins bug in ie can also be fixed by wrapping the div with a margins in a div without a margins and floating that outer div

2217976
ruby	php
i ve since learned php and vb.net but i never got around to ruby

2217982
implements	extends
i have written a jsp custom tag implements in a class that extends tagsupport and i d like to invoke another custom tag that was written as a .tag file

2218011
database-table	mysql
i m trying to get an order list of rows out of my mysql database-table based upon an int value place

2218024
virtual-memory	paging
due to the virtual-memory and paging you may not find the sequences in the physical memory

2218026
post-increment	pre-increment
whatâ s the points of post-increment ++ operators having higher precedence than pre-increment ++ operators

2218029
.net	wcf
i have a .net windows service which acts as a hosts for some wcf

2218029
windows-xp	windows	32-bit	64bit
this works well on windows 7 32-bit and 64bit and it can be startet with .net start on windows-xp pro sp3

2218034
defined	declare
otherwise the definition that must appear in that tu because inline-functions must be defined in the same tu where declare is an external definition

2218039
defined	declare
in c++ one must declare a function before its used defined

2218040
contains	any
using the following results in less than 10 distinct .post entities if any of .post contains more than 1 tag

2218059
nstextview	nswindow
if you are going to dynamic replace views in a nswindow or nstextview using addsubview or replacesubview cmd you need to tell the nswindow to recalculate the viewloop using nswindow s recalculatekeyviewloop or setautorecalculateskeyviewloop

2218065
httpd.conf	hosts
edited my etc apache2 httpd.conf file to add a virtual hosts entry points back to my development directory

2218075
version-control	git
i use git as my primary version-control systemd and have recently started using git on my cakephp project

2218075
directory	folder
is there a way to set it up to ignore the contents on these folder but to still have them under git control .so they appear .when i clone the repo into the hoted directory

2218084
unsigned	short
unsigned short may or may not be 2 bytes

2218084
unsigned	short
if unsigned short is 2 bytes long you have spaces worth of len 2 unsigned short value

2218084
unsigned	short
or more generally you have spaces for len n unsigned short value where n is equals to sizeof unsigned short

2218084
unsigned	short
if however you want to combine sizeof unsigned short value into one unsigned short value then your best bet would be to calculate the numbers by hand

2218101
web-hosting	hosting
my second issue stems from the fact that my asp.net hosting is done through a web-hosting company

2218114
gridview	listview
i have a listview which has a gridview with four columns

e.g to use cin cout defined in iostream

2218175
command-prompt	command-line
how to change command-prompt console windows title from command-line java .app

2218177
getter	setter
is there a way by which i can get a single test methods for both the getter setter like testemployeeid testname .so that in these methodss i can test both my setter getter rather than using 2 diff

2218183
mouseup	keyup
in windows forms you can create an event handler for the keyup and mouseup events but there is no selectionchanged event

2218190
getter	setter
getter and setter are almost always trivial code which is not worth testing by themselves

2218190
getter	setter
- .so why do you actually need to write tests for all those getter and setter in the first place

2218196
attributes	properties
as for the color you could add an attributes to the xml file that will points to the properties named of the control that we want to set and use reflection

2218207
getter	setter
and although i agree with the other poster than getter setter are pretty trivial - i think it is still worth testing them - to eliminate typos test properties change listener etc

2218209
archive	backup
you can even unzip it afterwards and archive the same effect although i must say i prefer having my backup compressed in zip file-format

2218221
google-chrome	firefox
this is using firefox and google-chrome browsers

2218223
getter	setter
if you have 100 field in a class with corresponding setter getter i suspect your object-model is not decomposed correctly

2218236
double	int
in your example treemap the key of the treemap has types double and the value referenced by this key has the types int

2218237
linux	unix	tasklist	cmd
under linux unix mac os the cmd is ps under windows it is tasklist

2218243
contains	set
you can set up a cookies on users machine and later on checked if that cookies exists and contains a proper value

2218248
ruby	php
compared to php ruby mops the floor in every area except maybe webserver deployment

2218248
python	ruby
in the interests of not starting any flame-wars with the snakes and because i use both ruby and python myself i ll call it a draw

2218248
python	ruby
there are very few applications for which ruby is well-suited that python could not perform just as well and vice-versa

2218248
python	ruby
on balance i prefer ruby myself but there are a lot of things i admire about python and i write a lot of python on account of google-app-engine

2218260
python	ruby
in comparison to python i d say ruby is python little sister

2218260
python	ruby
some might like ruby because say it s easy to building domain specific languages with it some might like python because they like being explicit let s say

2218260
python	ruby
i always recommend reading the zen of python if you agree with most of it learn python and if you have major issues with many of the points try ruby

2218260
ruby	php
in comparison to php ruby is a scripting-language without the curly braces heritage of c and with oo design much more centering stage yes i know you can do oo in php

2218296
children	tree
al.so i should mention that all the elements i m working with are on the same dom tree level .so there is no need to worry about parent children

2218303
constructor	object
in this case in debugger i see it is called a constructor of new object for permutation class what is going on

2218311
decrement	increment
we have tried hard in the definition of c# to make the increment and decrement operators sensible and strictly defined but it is impossible to come up with something that makes intuitive sense to everyone since everyone has a different experience with the operators in c and c++

2218340
boost	stl
is this a reasonable design or could one do it more succinctly maybe using stl or boost stuff

2218360
stdin	pipe
filtering programs like grep typically write to stdout and read from stdin which may be redirected by the shell to a pipe

2218360
stdin	pipe	stderr	stdout
the shell .when it fork and then execute s these programs probably uses the dup2 systemd call to redirect stdin stdout and stderr to the appropriate pipe

2218360
stderr	stdout
this should cause inetd to fork dup the socket onto stdin stdout and stderr and then execute grep with foo as an arguments

2218361
randomaccessfile	seek
use randomaccessfile to seek to a random byte positioning in the file

2218368
jquery	dojo
google hosts a numbers of javascript libs such as jquery and dojo on their cdn

zend-studio	komodo
i ve worked with a few ides using magento komodo zend-studio eclipse and i ve never had a very good result

2218381
webforms	asp.net
since you want to learn asp.net webforms start with the most recent non-beta versioning unless you have a specific need to support older software

2218388
value	field
i m trying to iterate over a dictionary of model value in a django templates - i want to list the verbose_name of each model field alongside its value

2218398
any	set
this will allow your bike class and any other class that extends vehicle for that matter to essentially set the weight by calling the superclass constructor

2218419
python	java
python and java have this and they don t need exit status

2218484
authentication	login
and the third - checked if sql-server has mixed-mode authentication - if not it will not allow you to connect using sql login and passwd

2218503
strncpy	strcpy
then you can use the standards c libs function strcpy or better yet strncpy to copy the hello into it and then you want to concatenation using the standards c libs strcat or better yet strcat function

2218507
istream	std
istream is in the namespace std

2218520
cllocationmanager	locationmanager
i ve implements with locationmanager didupdatetolocation fromlocation and created an cllocationmanager instances

2218547
synonym	term
actually the term browser object-model is not used as often as dom in web development and the term dom is used to as its synonym -- for example the list of available plugins while an attributes of a browser not a document is part of dom 0 - navigator.plugins api

2218560
udp	tcp
i would strongly suggest protocol-buffers on top of tcp or udp sockets

2218581
python	java
super easy to use and it s not only cross platform but has support for many languages as well python java etc and even an embedded versioning of the libs

2218582
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works perfectly fine in ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari etc

2218585
append	input
you need to make sure that the input elementss be it checkbox or whatever are append loaded in your case to either the form elements itself or a child elements of the form

2218586
google-chrome	firefox
as for how does firefox handle scoping in this regard differently to ie and google-chrome

2218611
sql-server	oracle
if it was sql-server or oracle i m positive that they are doing pretty good job with blobs and especially the special fstream and bfile types

2218618
any	set
is there any way for me to retrieve the passwd from elsewhere secure passwd store and set it pragmatically at the time the pooled connections are established

2218624
python	java
but if you re accustomed to eclipse and like it .so far you should really use cdt because you get the same nice look-and-feel as with the other eclipse development environment java java ee jython python ...

2218631
touch	drag
you could also use the touch drag enter connection for button in the interface-builder

2218631
selected	button
look at the connections tab by pressing cmd+2 .when having selected a button

2218633
arrays	loops
as i m working on a java android game and images are used a lot in inner loops i really want to avoid slow things like making virtual function-calls and accessing arrays maps object field .when i can avoid it

2218641
python	java
python was invented at the beginning of the 1990 s making it even older than java

2218684
defined	declare
i always use -wmissing-prototypes and -wstrict-prototypes to ensure that each external function is declare before it is defined or used and each static function is either declare or defined before it is used

2218700
duplicates	contains
what i do instead is have a folder that contains all upload files with a reference database and object that relates to the upload files but rather than just store them as is i instead store then with the filename being the corresponding md5 or sha-1 checksum of the aforementioned file which quite nicely eliminates duplicates upload and cuts down on overheads - required

2218716
gooddata	talend
you can find information on gooddata s rest apis integration with talend java sample code and other tips and tricks on our support forum - this is a good place to start

2218725
compact-framework	.net
linq is supported in the .net compact-framework versioning 3.5 and later

2218727
toolchain	gnu
m4 is a popular tool used in the gnu toolchain

2218732
triggers	insert
the only reason i see for using it then would be the row monitor but looking at the range of timestamp which will end in only 28 years i would rather go with an insert or updates triggers

2218733
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
some modern browsers firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome support the special back forwarding caching i ll call it bfcaching which is a term invented by mozilla involved .when the user navigates back

javascript	dom
unlike the regular http caching it capture the complete state of the page including the state of javascript dom

2218733
duplicates	elements
for example if you created your user-interface in the load handler and the load event was fired once on the initial load and the second time .when the page was reload from the bfcache the page would end up with duplicates user-interface elements

2218733
firefox	safari
for pages that need to know .when they re being navigated away back to firefox 1.5+ and the versioning of safari with the fix for bug 28758 support special events called pageshow and pagehide

2218735
linked-list	nodes
i have a linked-list of nodes each storing a linked-list of edges

2218766
exif	xmp
as it turns out the windows imaging component wic used by bitmapmetadata reads writes many different types of metadata blocks including tiff exif iptc and xmp

2218766
exif	xmp
as i mentioned in the question i ve now built this libs which correctly converts a very high percentage of the metadata properties from the tiff exif and xmp blocks

2218769
value	field
the _xmlattribute struct also has a field called value which i would expect to be baz except the types is xmlnodeptr

2218773
button	popup	selected	button
i am creating a sand falling game similar to the powder game and i created a class called control to create a control bar at the bottom of the screens with a slider for brush size that works fine and a button to popup a dialog to allow users to pick the selected elements

2218831
value	field
that way you don t even have to implements anything since value-type are compared according to their field value

2218915
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

2218915
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

2218915
keydown	keyup
thus you really need to hook on either the keydown or keyup events

2218923
google-chrome	firefox
but if firefox and google-chrome that alert messages it would not show up

2218925
keyboard	mouse
this technique was commonly used by tsr programs rewriting the interrupt vector table to hook the keyboard timer mouse or similar and then terminate while remaining in memory

2218934
.when	ready
.when doing transformation such as rotation scaling camera and perspective projection should i always normalize points .so that w is 1 between transformation or is it better to leave it until i m ready to display them

2218945
gethashcode	equals
if you re overridess equals then you should also overrides gethashcode as this is what the dictionary will use in the first instances to determine if two key match

2218945
gethashcode	equals
any two object of the same types that are considered equals should return the same value from gethashcode .

2218946
implements	extends
is-a means that the class extends from a superclass or implements an interface

2218950
base-class	inherited
it could be because the inherited parameter is expecting a base-class not an interface

2218954
value	field
i also think i need to restore the original value of the rounding control field before roundd returns

2219003
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
you should really investigate one of the more popular scripting languages like python ruby perl

2219003
any	set
any one of those will set you in good stead for what you re trying to achieve

2219009
selected	button
actually all i needed to do was double click the subviews within the navigation controllers .so it had focus then ctl-drag it to the button i had placed on the bar and i could selected the methods from the dropdownlistfor

2219011
pyside	pyqt
pyside free alternative to pyqt see below

2219015
perl	php	perl	awk	shell	bash
i love php and perl for these things having grown out of sed and awk for the most part but if don t rules out the bash shell i use cygwin s on windows systemd and even the windows scripting-language yes batch-file still exist can do more than i once thought

2219061
viewwillappear	dealloc
how about the viewwillappear and dealloc viewdiddisappear methods of that view s uiviewcontroller

2219067
32-bit	64bit
the problem i have is that my application which is 32-bit fails on windows 7 64bit with the error messages 1 is not a valid win32 application

2219067
32-bit	64bit
the reason for the error messages is thus that the .application tries to load c windows system32 mstask.dll which is a 64bit dll which will obviously not work from my 32-bit .app

2219091
instances	self
it seems i can use self or this for referring to the mixed-in instances or rather to constraint the mixed-in instances

2219101
triggers	insert
or you can separate the code for a delete from the code for an insert or updates by writing separate triggers or by

2219116
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
google for something like perl vs ruby vs python or best general purpose scripting-language .

2219116
ironpython	ironruby
if you re familiar with c# and the .net ironruby and ironpython would give you access to all the classes you already know

2219130
binary	hex
i can figure out the base 10 to binary or hex conversions really well however the 8bit floating-point conversions are kicking my ass and i can t find anything online that break it down in a n00b level and show the step

2219149
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have a complex set of data model that currently implements java.io.serializable and i have successfully serialization and deserialization them with objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

2219154
scientific-notation	decimal-point	scientific-notation	digits	decimal-point	digits
this is due to the requirement of normalizing scientific-notation to have one significant digits above the decimal-point

2219154
decimal-point	digits
since binary only has two states this required digits above the decimal-point is always one and eliminating it allows another bit of accuracy at the low end of the mantissa

2219157
cos	sin
starting from the top-center points move relative 1 2 top width x sin angle 1 2 top width x cos angle - that gets the top right corner points

2219157
cos	sin
continue around the rectangle using the sin and cos of the angle and widths as appropriate

2219170
python	ruby
i say ruby or python

2219170
perl	awk
traditionally perl is used for sysadmin automation and other scripting tasks plus obviously sed awk and sh

2219170
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
but languages like perl and php started as ad-hoc scripting interpreter whereas python and ruby were real object-oriented languages

2219170
perl	php
perl and php have since grown object-oriented revision but now they have all the complexity of the first nice try coupled with the oh we should make it a real language extensions

2219170
perl	ruby
ruby in particular is the product of a real language designer who combined the ultra-pure object-model of smalltalk with the populist syntax of perl

2219184
account	api
if you have an adobe account you can order your flex api posters from adobe

2219205

buildpath	libs
this way the server s libs will be automagically added to the project s buildpath

2219277
contains	any
if any un-placed tile contains three unlinked faces or unlinked faces on opposite sides the move is invalid and you can backtracking

2219286
multiplying	subtract
adding subtract and multiplying numbers with an absolute-value 1.0 can only result in overflow

2219310
factors	matrix
the pca methods is pretty close to just taking the svd and getting rid of the singular value by factors them into the u and v matrix

2219338
json	xml
json yaml xml whatever

2219399
widget	button
i m trying to get one cell in a qtablewidget to be a box with button at end ... with file selector but don t know how to change what kind of widget the cell is

push	pull
using merge to merge master changes to the feature branch git push pull and once mature do a single git-rebase in one or more commit cleanly

2219429
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you need to move from webforms to asp.net-mvc look at the dependancy on third party controls which you might have used in your application user-interface

2219429
url-rewriting	rewrite
alternatively you could use the any decent url-rewriting module publishing rest-style url first rewrite your old url to the new url then slowly convert sections of your application to asp.net-mvc

2219447
dictionary	for-loop
anyways yes get key from the dictionary in your for-loop then use key and dictionary.key inside it

2219491
defined	declare
c is sloppier or can be sloppier about that - it is recommended practice to ensure all functions are declare before being defined or referenced but it is not mandatory

2219517
shell	bash
fwiw here is the cmd i execute in the form of a bash shell scripting

2219518
json	xml

2219546
contains	elements
the long bio will obviously display the whole bio but the short bio would grab elements in the list and make them bold and contract the div to now only contains those list elements

2219570
postgresql	mysql
we had previously been using mysql which has a policy on case insensative searching however postgresql seems to lack this

2219582
constructor	object
any time you use a constructor to create an object you are creating an instances

2219584
contains	elements
.so instead use the -count methods on nsarrays to verify that the arrays actually contains the # of elements you were expecting

2219585
any	set
in any case one thing that is recommended is that you set the default border and background colour of any input .so it is consistent across all browsers

2219586
contains	lookup
but it sounds like you really want to lookup an x y points and get back a value that contains your caching information

2219631
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
i have multiple table.listings on the page but the one that contains you is selected and i want to addclass highlight to the 2nd cell in each row but the above code isn t working as i expected

2219637
implements	extends
the reason why i am asking is because afaik if i need to use attributes then i should be implements or extends the asp.net membership providers

2219642
python	lua
i have written elsewhere about why i prefer lua to python

2219669
c++	lua
how would i pass a table of unknown length from lua into a bound c++ function

2219681
.when	ready
.when a branch is ready for primetime then git-rebase merge it into master and delete its topic branch

2219689

the function i ve show you below returns a pointers to the next words in the char arrays

2219692
user-interface	drawing
what would you use for drawing user-interface mockups

2219710
contains	elements
contains the next elements of argv and

2219729
children	nodes
well i should say that you could also represent your bst as an arrays where the left and right children of the nodes at positioning i are in positioninging and respectively

2219745
datagrid	listbox
the strange thing is it works perfectly fine if the child is a listbox rather than a datagrid

2219745
datagrid	listbox
i ve pretty much decided this is a bug in the datagrid as i can t otherwise explain how it works for a listbox

2219772
contains	elements
the resize function makes vector contains the required numbers of elements

2219772
contains	elements
if we required less elements than vector already contains the last ones will be deleted

2219799
value	field
while an instances of a class for example will embody or contains all the properties field and methods of the class the field and or properties may or may not have value allocated to them .when the instances is created

2219808
constructor	private
a singleton in the strictest sense is not supported in actionscript because a constructor cannot be marked private

2219810
capacity	storage
it does not only change its storage capacity

2219810
capacity	storage
to direct a change only in storage capacity use vector reserve instead

2219827
constructor	object
i d like to pass a uri to a constructor and get back an object on which i can call obj.type obj.host obj.port etc

2219833
sql-server	oracle
im just starting to learn linq and at the same time im working on a research project for school on using link to entities with oracle and db2 im trying to find a tool or add-on that i can use to test my result sets .so that i can run a linq query and see the resulting data i have seen linqpad but it seems to be set up for micro.soft sql-server and compact is there a similar tool that i can use to test against alternate databases out there or a way to setup linqpad to be used with foreign databases

2219856
contains	any
the code-signing certificates issued by startssl contains the enhanced key usage eku attributes lifetime signing 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.13 which causes the file signature to expire .when the certificate expires regardless of any timestamps

2219862
defined	declare
it just declare the variables to types nttp and it has a reference to nothing which is commonly defined as being null hence the nullpointerexception

2219867
protected	public
protected internal - you cant bind to a non public properties

2219887
versioning	upgrade
if they are on versioning 1.9 they get upgrade to versioning 2.5

2219919
contains	elements
the size is the numbers of actual elements that the vector contains

2219919
contains	elements
the capacity is the maximum numbers of elements that the vector could contains without reallocating a larger chunks of memory

2219944
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
these two qualities combined with the fact that php is good enough make a pretty strong case for using it instead of perl ruby or python

2219952
unsigned	short
the function printing of namespace freetype has the 4th arguments as const unsigned short .so i typecasted it

2219958
response	timeout
i have worked on code but it is showing response timeout error

2219970
windows-xp	windows
you should try a windows pe sometimes also called minint installation installation guide here which is a trimmed-down versioning based on windows-xp or vista

2219982
python	php
i am trying to run a python program using php

2219990
any	set
is that possible suppose if i search any random city in google map and google map automatically set that zoomlevel

2219995
contains	any
a string can contains any alphabet digits and and

2219998
traversal	parent
you can traversal the inherited tree only from child to parent with the standards mechanism

2220004
contains	any
until the end it can contains any letter from the alphabet a digits or

2220069
sql-server	mysql
is there a sql-server 2000 functional equivalent to mysql s on duplicat key clause

2220083
stderr	stdout
i also need to store the stdout stderr and return code of each completed process

2220088
webserver	security
however make sure that the server side security is first put in-place such as ssl and other webserver security measures

2220097
command-prompt	cmd
then execute these cmd at a command-prompt

2220108
decrement	increment
the reference count represents the numbers of process using the object and process are responsible for increment and decrement the count via atomicity instructions .so the reference count itself is in shared-memory as well it could be a field of the object or the object could contains a pointers to the count i m open to suggestions if they assist with .solving this problem

2220118
push	pull
and to better manage the push and pull of parts of your global repo to a private one i would recommend the git-subtree scripting tool

2220131
any	set
if you need accuracy and if you know the vertices accurately then you can use the shortest distance to a plane to see if the sphere touches any of the planes defined by any set of three vertices which give you your triangles

2220163
webforms	asp.net
i need help in how to set webforms control proprieties in asp.net and ajax control using javascript

double-quotes	single-quotes
single-quotes double-quotes parens etc.

2220188
google-chrome	safari
how do i printing an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

2220188
google-chrome	opera
printing iframe content in opera and google-chrome

2220194
attributes	properties
another important difference is that in a graphingdb like neo4j you can traversal the graphing based on relationship edges types and directions without loading the full nodess including nodes properties attributes

2220207
value	field
you need an extra field hidden called start with the value date.struct otherwise grails will not recognize your date field

2220219
put	get
if you need to put together a report or something combining data from a mainframe systemd with external data sources it may be easier to get the data off the mainframe and do the integration elsewhere - perhaps some sort of data mart

2220224
selected	textbox
for example a drop down box to selected the issue or a textbox to write in some comment about the abuse

2220227
children	tree	children	nodes
suppose a tree may have up to k children per nodes

2220227
children	nodes
let v be the average numbers of children per nodes

2220227
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
for what value s of v is it more efficient in terms of spaces used to store the child nodes in a linked-list versus storage in an arrays

2220227
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes	average	max
more or less in plain english -- it will be more efficient to use the linked-list because rather than having a bunch of empty nodess ie empty indexes in the arrays if your average is lower than the max taking up memory you only alloc spaces for a nodes in a linked-list .when you re actually filling in a value

2220227
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree	children	tree	children	nodes
.so if you ve got an average of 6 children .when your maximum is 200 the arrays will be creating spaces for all 200 children of each nodes .when the tree is created but the linked-list will only alloc spaces for the nodess as needed

2220230
g++	gcc
this piece of code works well with my g++ compiler but gcc gives a error saying lvalue required as left operands of assignment

2220231
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
caching plays an important role in modern cpus and storing the individual child nodes in an arrays instead of a linked-list can improve the caching locality and consequently the treeâ s performance drastically

2220234
keydown	keyup
just remember that for keydown and keyup you ll have to keep tracking of the case using the e.shiftkey state

2220248
selected	button
click the little arrow next to the add button and selected add as link

2220249
javascript	dom
i d include javascript that would test if the user has modern browser features dom nodes creation and such and if .so change the action of the link .so that .when they click it the form appears right there in a small overlay box rather than taking you to a separate page

2220255
decrement	increment
if the reference count is ever left at 1 then the tracker int will be equals to the pid of the process that increment it but didn t decrement it

2220255
decrement	increment
you could alternatively use an unsigned value which is defined to wrap rather than overflow - adding the pid .when increment the usage count and subtract it .when decrement it

2220277
google-chrome	firefox
tested the above which probably needs tuning with google-chrome and firefox

2220291
keydown	keyup
i ve tried overrides the keyup keydown events but apparently that was not the way

2220291
keyboard	mouse
isenabled is a good solution however i only wish to disable keyboard integration and leave mouse integration intact

2220298
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
however i think a control that responds to mouse click by not keyboard is buggy not everyone prefers to use the mouse

2220307
any	set
any reason you would want to disable integration with the control but not set enabled false

2220312
children	nodes
let n be the actual numbers of children of a particular nodes a

2220322
value	field
right now i have a manual transactional where i first insert a special field with â trâ value representing â in transactionalâ and do the insert and do an updates with â 00â to that field

2220322
value	field
to denote all the items belonging to an order are insert and other process with query that special field for the value â 00â

2220324
twitter	tweets
i m trying to parsing an xml file of tweets as retreived from twitter s restful api

2220347
linked-list	nodes
these should implements an interface .so the linked-list implementsation can leverage that and doesn t have to wrap the items into its own nodes object

2220348
32-bit	64bit
i was able to access the 64bit registry of a remote machine from a 32-bit process

2220444
decrement	increment
memcached appears to me the best solution since it is easy to setup and they already provide counter with increment decrement

2220445
triggers	insert
use an insert triggers on table b and do the updates table a as your friend suggests

2220445
updating	updates
.when updating table b do an updates on table a in your application logic

2220453
order	add
i want to add two columns value of my table and sort it in descending order

2220458
dictionary	arrays
each elements of an arrays has dictionary and it has these two value cellvalue detail value

2220461
triggers	insert
basically a triggers is a small piece of code that gets execute .when something happens in the db in your case-.when someone insert data in table b

2220493
solaris	bsd
you probably need gnu make and not the traditional bsd make shipped with solaris

2220499
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
final solution working in ie6 7 8 firefox opera google-chrome and safari

2220539
configuration	upgrade
is there a way via configuration upgrade or a plugins to get content-assist in jsp el expression

2220541
javascript	dom
if you are familiar with the javascript prototype and writing more complex apps it might be a good idea to write your code using native inherited first and then add a jquery plugins to simplify dom implementation

2220568
bindparam	prepare	pdostatement	bindparam	pdostatement	prepare
secondly .when in a loops you can save yourself time and resources if you re running the same query over and over by preparing the statement and then only changing the value you send to to that prepare statement using the pdostatement bindparam function

2220569
attributes	properties
python properties per se do not work in django-model because django s model do some magic to set instances attributes

2220573
mta	sta
simply create an app-config file for the dll you are attempting to test and add some nunit appropriate settings to force nunit to create the test environment as sta instead of mta

2220574
solaris	linux
solaris and gnu linux have an

hotmail	gmail
i want to import address book of users from their gmail hotmail yahoo and aol address books

2220591
value	field
what s the simplest way in ruby-on-rails to create several simple hidden field with known value and the same named in a numbers of non-model forms form_remote_tag in my case but i m guessing that isn t relevant

2220591
duplicates	elements
produces an acceptable elements if there s only one such form but generator html warnings duplicates ids if there are more than one

2220609
configuration	environment
does changing this configuration works in all mysql server environment

2220609
any	set
also i think that changing the configuration will not solve my problem because i don t know what to set the value of group_concat_max_len because numbers of rows in dummy table can be any numbers

2220616
any	set
there wouldn t be any special properties you need to set for a user-controls s events to fire

2220642
configuration	environment
besides the performance increase which is likely a pre-optimization in most cases it also protects from the very odd scenario where the environment s php configuration does not have the current directory

2220643
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox everything is fine

2220655
any	set
are there any restrictions on the webpage templates i d better set .so that my div construction subroutine doesn t turn into an unmaintainable mess

2220673
32-bit	64bit
as title said i have c program complied and created a binary in 64bit machine.will this binary work under 32-bit

2220684
nstextstorage	nstextview
you should add your controllers as the delegation of the nstextstorage object of the nstextview and then implements the delegation methods â textstoragedidprocessediting

2220684
nstextstorage	nstextview
in the delegation methods you need to get the current nstextstorage object from the text view using the -textstorage methods of nstextview

2220684
document	editing
if the document you are editing are very large you will most likely want to consider offloading the parsing to a separate thread and or being clever about which sections of text are reparsed

2220685
contains	elements
it is these actionlistener implementation that will contains the logic but keep in mind that if you don t use threading your user-interface elements like the jbutton will not be responsive while your actionlistener is doing some calculations and holding control

2220689
32-bit	64bit
what matters is is the code generator 32-bit answer yes or 64bit answer no

2220695
uitableview	uitextview
uitableview s are subclassing of scroll views as are uitextview s

2220698
updating	updates
what i m left with is running my own sql which does the updates though it would be nice to actually be able to do this through linq2sql as there are other columns on the same row i m updating .when the related parent is non-existing

2220703
expression	brackets
the outer brackets are not strictly necessary but i use them to make the expression clearer

2220704
contains	set
go through the nib .xib files and make sure that all of the views have an appropriate dark background colour set most notably the nib file which contains the windows

2220714
mobile-safari	opera	opera	gecko
you may find it preferable to checked for gecko ie webkit opera explicit and redirect everything else to your mobile site - that way you re maintaining a smaller ua regex plus you d be catering for the mobile-safari iphone ipod touch by keeping them on your main website

2220716
udp	tcp
is it possible to send multiple tcp or udp packetss on a single ip packets

2220716
udp	tcp
if it is allowed by the protocols but is generally not done by tcp udp implementation could you points me to the relevant portion in the linux source code that proves this

2220716
udp	tcp

2222844
any	set
a delphi tthread object would set its terminate properties to true and the execute methods that got overrides would be expected to checked that properties periodically but since this thread is non-delphi code there is no execute methods and any terminate properties only came into existence after the thread code was already written someplace else not by overrides execute

2223118
teamcity	nant
teamcity can be configure with different building systemd too nant msbuilding et al

2223136
g++	gcc
gcc g++ and the other frontends use filenames to determine language

2223136
g++	gcc
for example the only major difference between gcc and g++ is one that bites new c++ programmers different link settings for the c++ stdlib

2223140
panels	grid
not only that i also found that there are two very similar samples tree grid and a column tree that show how to customize the tree panels component which confuses me even more

2223144
g++	gcc
g++ should be the front-end for c++ and cc for c but both points to gcc

2223153
fortran	ada
the program gcc is a drivers which can dispatcher to a c a c++ an ada a fortran a java and probably other compilers depending on what is install and the extension of the file

2223159
packaging	building
first to setup a webapp managed by maven and to building it you ll have to create a project with a packaging of types .war

2223159
maven-plugin	cargo
the cargo maven-plugin would allow to do similar things in a containers agnostic way but it might be a bit harder to setup at least for advanced use cases

2223164
oracle	mysql
i don t have a mysql install to test it on but this example is converted from oracle sql syntax

2223180
png	gif
it will allow you to load and store images that were encode in basically any known format png and gif include and allow you to efficiently operate on the images once they ve been loaded

pascal	delphi
my preferences would be to building directly from the pascal source in delphi 2007 for .net although i ll use newly-built assemblies if necessary

2223185
methodology	paradigms
i think tdd and functional-programming fp are different in that tdd is a methodology and fp is programming paradigms

2223207
webserver	security
there is an msdn article sorry no time to go searching for it explaining why you should not automate office from webserver using com dcom because of security issues involving shared-memory

2223208
firefox	safari
the firefox browser show the images clipped no matter how they are accessed .so i guess this is no longer a perl problem but the safari browser display them completely

2223215
jndi	jdbc
that being said there are lots of examples online on how to create a jdbc connection pool with ibatis but i couldn t find one example on how to do it with jndi

2223219
value	field
if this code lives in some libs and another piece of code consumes this libs if the value of the constants field change then not only will this libs need to be recompiled duh but you ll have to recompile the code consuming this libs as well

2223219
value	field
if you use static though you won t have this problem as you re referencing the field not the value

2223231
binaries	install	licensing	gpl
incidentally given that they are shipping with libx264 and it s a downloading that install on client computers checked the java caching for the binaries they should be licensing their code as gpl to compile with libx264

2223258
data-structures	tree
the former uses finger tree while the latter uses the banker s dequeue from okasaki s purely-functional data-structures a prior versioning online here

2223259
codeigniter	cakephp
if you re building an .app from scratch i would recommend using a php asp.net-mvc framework package like cakephp or codeigniter

2223405
subclassing	superclass
the points of polymorphism is that you can subclassing a class and the object implements those subclassinging will have different behavior for the same methods defined in the superclass and overrides in the subclassinging

2223408
reflection	runtime
you can use reflection to get the class of an object at runtime but the object that you get does not parallels the class hierarchy

2223408
method-overriding	polymorphism
as a consequence there is also no notion of polymorphism and therefore method-overriding makes no sense

2223412
if-statement	loops
it is o n like an if-statement it doesn t really work because you could have overlapping conditional is unpredictable because you do not know what order you will do loops and is much less clear than the equivalent if-statement

2223424
jsonp	ajax
well i was playing with google query autocomplete and noticed funny thing if i for example types in m letter it performs ajax jsonp query

2223477
protected	public	subclassing	inherited
instead static-members belong to the class and as a result overrides is not supported because subclassing only inherited protected and public instances members and not static-members

2223481
linux	unix
supposing the environment was unix linux based and was compiled like this

2223506
hide	show
the above code show image related to textbox which has focus and hide rest of the all three images at the same time

2223506
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	checkbox	selected	button

2223631
cos	sin
also what about functions i have seen all over some f# code like cos sin etc

2223631
cos	sin
also why did they provide cos sin etc like that instead of math.cos math.sin

2223670
double	int
the filesize of test.bin is 16 bytes which i guess is 4+8 int + double

2223681

i need to building an internal order entry and tracking systemd for a grocery store which required many of the features of existing e-commerce systemdd such as product catalog customer_to_order relations views movement report order statuses etc

2223732
e-commerce	product
however the first phase of the product is purely internal .so i don t need any online e-commerce features such as shipping addresses postal rates or a payment-gateway

2223732
ruby-on-rails	django	drupal	django
the main contenders i ve been considering .so far are drupal ubercart django satchmo and ruby-on-rails spree

2223732
python	ruby
the spree project looks clean and i like the ideas - but i m already writing a product customer etl in jython and don t want to balance the two languages - both python and ruby are new to me

2223732
e-commerce	product
by the way i think the gap between the feature-set i need and what i could get out-of-the-box from an existing e-commerce product is on the order of 30

2223735
sftp	ssh
as sftp uses ssh protocols for communication you may generator private public key-pair using ssh-keygen read everything their

2223748
csv	xml
of course if you want to be able to change the configuration without recompiling you might want to move everything to a separate properties-file or xml or yaml or csv or whatever you prefer and then load it at application-start up

2223777
mouseover	mouseout
i want to bind that same function instead to the mouseover and mouseout events

2223783
required	checked
after the sleep ends you checked to make sure the required amount of time has elapsed and if it hasn t you start a new sleep

2223800

google-chrome also supports it and i assume safari does as well

2223812
hide	show
you want to control the show hide behavior of images according to which input has focus

2223818
disassembly	native-code
if you try the same in c# go to disassembly you still go to native-code not il

2223827
folder	dir
i think i got 1.8.7 working - i basically downloading the zipped up file not the install one i extraction it then i copy-paste paste the extraction to overwrite the files and folder in the ruby dir in instantrails

2223843
json	xml
over-the-wire formats like json xml edi and other things

2223843
python	perl
you could say that though it does not bring parity to .net reflection which another answer speaks more about it does bring a lot of dynamic language-features think of perl python javascript to an otherwise strongly typed static-type systemd world of delphi

2223849
spaces	output
in the output above only one spaces is show between u and the actual path but you have s s in all your regexes

2223862

2223901
selected	listbox
after selected listbox item programmatically it is needed to press down up key two time to move the selection

2223910
value	field
however there are a couple cases where in addition to returning a value i also want to change a field or call a methods

2223910
punctuation	words
edit each words and punctuation mark count as one token

2223910
conditional	parentheses	value	field
is there a way to put field value somewhere besides the conditional and if not is there a construct that makes field value a boolean without the need for parentheses

2223912
build-process	xcodebuild
i don t know for sure if xcodebuild properly runs the code-signing tool but it sounds to me that you ll need to change your build-process to use that tool code-signing

2223922
controllers	routes
in asp.net-mvc 2.0 you can include the namespace s for your parent project controllers .when registering routes in the parent area

2223935

2223941
job-queue	queue
queue clientqueue job-queue enginequeue externalactivatorqueue

2223959
listboxitem	selected
set the focus to the selected listboxitem

2223964
configuration	environment
if you want to use the plugins and have the development mode windows show up instead of eclipse s development mode view set the use_remote_ui environment variables for your launchd configuration to the value false

2223995
value	field
it strikes me that they d be perfect candidates for configuration value and magento wrap the whole per-store-setting thing there really well - take a look in a system.xml file for one of the built-in modules or a downloading one...they tend to be simpler and how it building the field up and specifies at what scoping global store store-view settings can be applied

2224012
declarative	imperative
i m not interested in any potential performance cost just the potential of using declarative approaches in what is traditionally imperative code

2224014
default-value	arguments
this- test as a function arguments default-value is not allowed

2224024
joomla	drupal
why not use a cms systemd like drupal or joomla

2224034
ref	out	unsafe	out
edit unless it uses ref out parameters unsafe code or yield return

2224043
value	field
if your column list ever changes queries in your code may assign value to the wrong field

2224053
business-objects	crystal-reports
i m a total crystal-reports business-objects newbie.

2224056
any	set
3 it s easy to set default for any optional route value

2224062
windows-server	windows
i m looking at the microsoft article for operating systemd properties value and it seems that both windows-server 2008 r2 and windows 7 have a versionnt value of 601

2224085
getter	setter
the combinations getter and setter you ve defined doesn t fit ruby conventions

2224092

i store my date value in the database using the datetime field

2224105
executable	upx
it s not really a patcher it s upx - the ultimate packer for executable

defined	declare
in visual-c++ .when you are creating a windows forms application where do you defined and declare the classes and functions that the gui will be using

2224120
value	field
is your field always being filled with the value nothing

2224122
textbox	button
button and textbox probably because of something stupid i did

2224134
multiplication	addition
a multiplication roughly double digits numbers addition increases it by at most 1

2224144
getter	setter
i would like to be able to transparently convert hexadecimal uuid into binary for the setter methods and back .when i use the getter methods

2224146
linked-list	tree
if you use binary tree whose leaves are int you get all the advantages of the linked-list unbounded numbers of digits etc with simpler divide-and-conquer algorithms

2224146
digits	base
in any base the carry is always a single digits

2224150
linked-list	arrays
clarification traversal a linked-list and traversal an arrays are both o n operations

2224150
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
the overhead of allocation and deallocation n nodes in a linked-list will also be much heavier than memory-management of a single arrays of size n even if the arrays has to be resize a few time

2224172
keyboard	mouse
like for example flash and others where you go to a site with a game and it will ask you to install a certain plugins and then you can play the game in the browser with mouse and keyboard input

2224172
plugins	add-on
i have .so far primarily focused on internet-explorer but there are plugins add-on extensions etc i don t know what i need really

2224175
macports	homebrew
i recently ditched macports for homebrew as a result im now experiencing some issues with make

2224178
configuration	installation
..or have i something wrong with my jvm configuration or jruby installation i m using jruby via rvm - ruby versioning manager

2224182
constructor	object
secondly .when something is initializer automatically for automatic or dynamic object it means that the constructor is called automatically

2224185
pointers	stack
the big difference here is that a pointers set to new something refers to some area of memory in heap while local-variables are stored on stack

2224186
windows	ms-dos
under windows ms-dos prompt you can

2224195
dictionary	map
i m trying to make a dictionary store a map of delegation that correspond to a protocols

2224196
unique	words
i think i know how to efficiently go from a character vector of words to a unique character vector of the words that appeared

2224198
any	set
here i m checked whether any errors exist then whether the variables is set

2224198
value	field
if both these conditional are matched the postdata is printed in the value attributes of the field

2224208
constructor	object
that s true for non-pod object s but your object is pod since it has no user defined constructor and only contains pods itself

2224219
beautifulsoup	feedparser
i also tried using feedparser and beautifulsoup but they did not work for me

2224220
margins	padding
another example of where this issue appears is .when you don t include the 6px padding margins

2224222
attributes	properties
if you want to get attributes named and attributes value not the attributesnodes you have to call the attrnode- nodevalue properties of the domnode object

2224234
value	field
i have been looking for a database solution to allow user defined field and value allowing an unlimited numbers

2224234
value	field
is there an alternative database methods to allow user defined attributes field and value

2224251
value	field
the above implementation is clearly flawed because it guesses the relationship between a field s positioning in the product and its named by equality of the value on those field .so that the following say will not work

2224259
logout	login
consider logging user login and logout action

2224265
click	mouse
i have changed click with mouse over but how can i set mouseout event

2224270
ruby	php
but what if you could put your memcached cluster on the other side of your db interface outside the realm of the application software php ruby python... and inside the rdbms

2224270
relational-database	rdbms
then .when writing application code you can not only forget about memory caching you can start dealing with the data store as if it were a relational-database management systemd again and use normalize and join the way rdbms s traditionally encourage

2224270
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	mysql
does anyone know of a project where someone has done this already perhaps as an open source project wherin they might modify an open source rdbms such as postgresql or mysql

2224273
turbogears	pylons
turbogears and pylons are both capable of this rather than doing it yourself or using third party apps

2224276
hide	show
and with javascript you show or hide the form you want the user to see

2224276
hide	show
or even you building a single form and you show or hide some additional field between the 2 states

2224276
value	field
the signup page is loaded and then we get the reference of the form read the value of the url with the function urlparam and place the value to the field named email

2224300
any	set
you have to set the cookies before any output to the browser

2224305
keyboard	mouse
you can get an opengl program up in a few minutes by deriving from qglwidget it will create the windows context handle mouse and keyboard input etc

2224309
signals	sigint
sigint is the signals sent from a terminal interrupt control-c

2224317
mouseover	mouseout
if you want a mouseover mouseout handler use hover like .so

2224332
switching	screens
i have issues with this as i do not think it is accessible if the switching is done via ajax without page-refresh then how does a screens reader user know which tab form they are on

2224334
g++	gcc
is there a way for gcc g++ to dump its preprocessor defined from the command-line

2224336
openedge	dsn
3 i provide a connection-string and dsn for a 32-bit progress openedge 10.2a odbc drivers that i ve set up

2224338
youtube	vimeo
which is what every ok .so not every but the vast majority video sharing site does youtube break vimeo etc

2224342
primitive	boolean
but the â œwrapperâ classes like boolean store their primitive value as immutable .so it can t be updates in this way

2224349
arguments	default
the last three arguments have default value false 0 false .so those can be left out .when you call the function

2224356
contains	elements
yes you need to append because there is no guarantee that the chunks of data read will contains all of the elements text

2224358
put	get
combining the two content-type in one table lets you put a single index on the date field allowing faster querying though remember you can get a similar benefit from indexed views

2224362
constructor	object
everytime you change your object you create a new factory and a new object class which is given a versioning of the old class in its constructor and it creates itself from the old class

2224371
contains	any
views does not provide any useful variables besides that contains the entire html output

2224386
google-chrome	safari
it seems that the css -rounded corners styles works on some parts of my stackexchange site s - sf answers phonehow.com and not on others - it display correctly in google-chrome but not in safari

2224405
protected	public
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

2224405
defined	declare
methods declare without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public

2224412
hide	show
use javascript to remove the text you want to hide and reinsert it on show

2224412
hide	show
if you need more control of the display value used for show and hide you can use a css class

2224414
required	checked
assuming you required to send the .post request asynchronously you may want to checked the example below to get you going in the right directions

2224419
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms consider these two developers

2224419
webforms	asp.net
the generics .net developer will be most efficient at writing code in the original asp.net webforms

2224419
webforms	asp.net
these are the stumbling blocks this developer will find with asp.net webforms

2224419
webforms	asp.net	ruby-on-rails	django	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am the #2 kind of developer i have written web-applications most of them small in ruby-on-rails django asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc

2224419
webforms	asp.net
the most infuriating thing i find with asp.net webforms is that it tries to do too many things for the developer things like application-state web events the code output often does not play well with web-standards webforms 2.0 is tied directly to xhtml 1.0 transitional

2224427
functional-programming	imperative-programming	imperative-programming	declarative
i m reading functional-programming by tomas petricek jon skeet and i understand the difference between declarative imperative-programming

2224427
declarative	imperative
what i was wondering is how are the primitive operators functions implements are declarative languages construct from imperative operators functions

2224431
variables	boolean
as you say the boolean wrapper class is immutable .so you cannot use it to receive your output variables

2224435
selected	listbox
the code below runs fine selected a movie from the listbox runs it in the media elements

2224447
declarative	imperative
there are imperative turing-complete languages and functional declarative turing-complete languages

2224452
declarative	imperative
strangely enough most imperative languages go through a phase where all the code is transformed to be more declarative

2224460
ncover	nant	ncover	fxcop	fxcop	nant
i used to use cruisecontrol.net nunit fxcop ncover xmlpreprocess nant and a few others before transitioning to tfs where i am doing alot of sharepoint development

2224462
double	int
sbyte to short int long float double or decimal

2224462
double	int
byte to short ushort int uint long ulong float double or decimal

2224462
double	int
short to int long float double or decimal

2224462
double	int
ushort to int uint long ulong float double or decimal

2224462
double	int
int to long float double or decimal

2224462
double	int
char to ushort int uint long ulong float double or decimal

2224462
derived-class	base-class
derived-class to base-class

2224485
defined	declare
be defined even if it is declare

2224488
numerical	matrix
scipy s kmeans2 has some numerical problems others have reported error messages such as matrix is not positive definite - cholesky decomposition cannot be computed in versioning 0.6.0 and i just encountered the same in versioning 0.7.1

2224497
boost-spirit-qi	boost-spirit	lexer	lex
boost-spirit-qi doesn t need a lexer although you you can use boost-spirit lex as a front-end

2224500
dictionary	arrays
i m not sure how to say if the key will be a string dictionary or arrays

2224507
jquery	.post
using jquery .post the data and redirect to your desired location like .so

2224525
interpreter	runtime
you could consider reading the characters as a streaming of bytes instead of a streaming of characters if you don t know how to instruct the compiler to interpreter those bytes you don t know what encoding will be used at runtime

2224527
environment	building
if you actually building using the debugging setting for dev environment and release for production environment you could always just do

2224532
installation	upgrade
i have an installation of asp.net-mvc 2.0 rc1 which i am planning to upgrade to the newly release rc2

2224541
arrays	loops
.when i loops over my entries in the json insert them at the beginning of my arrays increment their index each time through loopss

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
it s true you don t want to use setinterval and settimeout in the way you ve describe

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
while you can use setinterval and or settimeout with call to settimeout again in the function body to poll for a success code that approach is dramatically inferior to just handling the callback in the first place instead of polling for it

2224562
authentication	login
however since the authentication cookies is lost it is ignore and replace on a subsequent login

2224583
xhtml	tidy
you can use html tidy to convert the html to xhtml

2224605
multiplication	addition
carry is a single bit for addition and element-sized for multiplication

2224610
background-color	transparency
well i can apply a class on alternating rows with no problem but i want for the alternating color to be a very transparency versioning of the background-color in .ui-widget-header

2224620
dictionary	arrays
i d like to have just a multi-dimensional arrays of floats not an arrays of dictionary

2224620
dictionary	arrays
i was hoping someone might know a magic bullet that could convert a dictionary of dictionary into an arrays

2224624
revision	updates	revision	svn
that is perform an svn updates inorder to get the latest revision and checked to make sure your changes don t conflict

2224627
implements	extends
it is implements as a class that extends view and is annotations with remoteview

2224632
quirks-mode	doctype
not having a doctype or having a html comment or any html content before a doctype will throw browsers into quirks-mode

2224651
attributes	properties
since model-validation involves attempting to run validation over all properties and since non-nullable value-type properties have an implicit required attributes we re validation this properties and calling its getter in the process

2224651
attributes	properties
we re considering adding in v3 of the product an attributes which will signals to us don t bind it don t validation it just pretend that this properties doesn t exist.

2224657
contains	any
in fact it is not necessary to have a relationship between the named of the contains file and any classes that are defined in the file

2224661
dictionary	arrays
i think making a dictionary item would work the same as the arrays item

2224662
internet-explorer	firefox
for example this page is rendering in standards compliance mode in firefox and ie8 standards in internet-explorer

2224675
canvas	scale
i have create a storyboard in c# to animation a scale transform on a canvas

2224678
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the opacity properties is the css standards for opacity value and works in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2224686
salt	md5
for passwd storage i suggest using md5 with a salt

2224688
quirks-mode	doctype
quirks-mode should only ever be triggers based on the lack of doctype specified for the document

2224698
getter	setter
since this is within my package this seemed like an ok way to do things given that those field aren t going to be visible from outside of the package and it seemed to be unnecessary to make things private and provide getter and setter

2224698
getter	setter
should i provide getter and setter even .when i know exactly what will be getting and setting my field and i m not worried about someone else writing something that will break my code

2224728
radio-button	buttongroup
substituting a radio-button and using a buttongroup would accommodate a unique selection

2224734
getter	setter
most java developers will prefer to see getter and setter

2224734
getter	setter
maintaining getter and setter may take a little more time but offers a lot more safety plus

2224734
getter	setter
you can refactor your code any time as drastically as you want .so long as you don t break your public api getter setter and public methods

2224739
rackspace	amazon
amazon s amazon-web-services is as good a place to start as any rackspace has a similar service which now supports self-provisioning

2224745
append	input
here is my code which is showing the decimal image and append it to the input

2224747
getter	setter
i would adhere to a common styles and in this case provide setter getter

2224747
getter-setter	conventions
a lot of java frameworks assume getter-setter conventions and are tooled to look for these expose them interrogate them

2224747
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can easily refactor what s behind them

2224752
cucumber	webrat
this error can also occur with webrat cucumber .when filling in form-data using a table

2224753
zend-framework	cakephp
i d also look into something like the zend-framework or cakephp

2224753
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is kinda of like ruby-on-rails for php

2224759
boost-regex	pcre
for perl-compatible regular expression pcre preg i d suggest boost-regex

2224762
georss	kml
if your layer are vector wfs kml georss etc. then you can reproject them with openlayer in the browser

2224774
getter	setter
even though it s painful coding up properties with getter and setter is a big win if you re ever going to use your object in a context like jsp the expression language in particular ognl or another templates language

2224783
virtual-machine	virtualbox
i would suggest using a virtual-machine such as the free virtualbox or qemu an x86 + others android-emulator

2224783
windows-xp	windows	windows-xp	ms-dos	windows	ms-dos
added note older versioning of ms-windows prior to windows-xp include ms-dos including windows 95 and 98

2224788
subdirectories	absolute-path
the reason to use a absolute-path is that you can move the myimage.html to a subdirectories without breaking the url

2224799
double	int
you usually only use d for int value you have double in your matrix

2224802
textarea	textbox
is it possible to create a macros or stylesheet .so that .when a textbox textarea is-empty it is yellow per se and .when it has data it is white

2224808
webserver	upload
i am trying to upload a lot of files from a browser to a webserver that i have total control of

2224808
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the entire browser stalls and in google-chrome just the tab

2224810
salt	md5
then add extra salt to it by taking like the first 5 characters of md5 social or something

2224816
google-chrome	safari
on safari google-chrome the iframe is resize to 75 of its original size but the content within the iframe is not scale at all

2224817
arrays	loops
you can pass an arrays of traversable object or a traversable object that iterates over traversable object to a partials loops and in the partials each object will then be accessible through the object key

2224826
click	mouse
you can associate a contextmenustrip with any control and a right mouse click automatically display the shortcut menu

2224831
jruby	mri
just don t use jruby for unit tests and rake tasks the thoughtworks mingle team for example uses mri for unit tests rake tasks and development and jruby for integration-testing regression tests and production

2224831
jruby	mri
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2224867
configuration	environment
first store the settings for the different environment in source control but not the actual configuration file

2224870
fireworks	photoshop
the easiest way to do this is to create a small flat image in photoshop fireworks gimp kreta etc

2224877
subnet	ping
i dont want to use arp caching as that would required me to either broadcasting ping which is not allowed on windows or ping the all possible ip-address of subnet which takes lot of time

2224897
tga	bmp
bmp - tga image file-conversion is an appropriate start

2224915
punctuation	words
what are common approaches for translating certain words or expression inside a given text .when the text must be reconstructed with punctuation and everythin.

2224915
punctuation	words	punctuation	tokenize
i can t simply tokenize since i loose punctuation and words positioning

2224921
getter	setter
i find getter and setter are better way to program and its not about only a matter of coding conventions

2224930
perl	awk
i migrate to perl .when i found that my simple awk sed solutions had to expand beyond the simplest cases

2224975
selection	cell
i want to intercept some cell selection without having to inherited another datagridview and overrides the selectall methods

2224978
getter	setter
on the other hand also be careful about getter and setter at all--they have a lot of pitfalls

2224978
double	int	getter	setter
setter and getter expose your internal structures if you have a getter for an int it s difficult to later change that to a double--you have to touch every place it was accessed and make sure it can handle a double without overflowing causing an error if you had just asked your object to manipulate the value in the first place the only changes would be internal to your object

2224979
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
this will typically expose you to uitableview uinavigationcontroller and its stack as well as basic network communication

2224980
cross-compiling	toolchain	toolchain	gnu
have a look at this link that might points you in the directions to find the sources...i did see that there is a way to use the gnu s gcc toolchain to produce a cross-compiling binary.

2224987
attributes	properties
the best way is to use the nodes object directly by using its attributes properties

2224993
getter	setter
having getter and setter for all field is also a bad idea

2224993
getter	setter
a field with getter and setter is almost the same as a public field - it exposes the implementation details of the class and increases coupling

2224993
getter	setter
code using those getter and setter easily violates oo principles and the code becomes procedural

2224999
any	set
how can i set up for validation to make sure hostname field aren t duplicates across any of the 3 model

2225005
keydown	keyup
i wrote code that send an alt and add keydown event followed by keydown and up events for the four character unicode sequences with the alt key ored then finally add and alt keyup events

2225044
debugging	exit
the problem is that for debugging purposes i added exit 1 as i wasn t getting the error messages for invalid date for that field

2225045
slidedown	slideup
jquery slidedown is invoked revealing more input-field in the previously hidden div and then slideup is invoked .when mousing out

2225045
slidedown	slideup
the trouble is that everything behaves in firefox but in ie7 the bottom visible portion of the div which is absolutely positioning to bottom inorder to keep at the bottom during slidedown and slideup is not visible on the initial page load

2225058
private-members	instances
one instances of the class can also access private-members of another instances of the class

2225060
python	perl
the only nonstandard regex feature needed here is backreferences 1 and these are supported in both perl and python

2225063
webserver	upload
and automaticly upload to some webserver

2225065
getter	setter
or in more specific words is it ok to not be relying on setter and getter

2225075
hide	show
what do i need to do to modify the show hide history to show either hide history if it s currently display or show history if it s currently hidden

2225081
getattr	setattr
for example if you have a class that overloads the brackets operators with getattr and setattr but uses some funny internal scheme it would be appropriate for it to behave as a dictionary if that s what it s trying to emulate

2225090
assign	add
this icons is normally associated with a uibarbuttonitem by assign the icons to uibarbuttonsystemitemaction however i cannot add a uibarbuttonitem into the uitableviewcell s view and therefore i would like to know if it s possible to assign this icons to a plain uibarbuttonitem

2225102
getter	setter
although i much prefer specified getter setter for each properties whether that s a proxy to a generalized or not

2225107
getter	setter
setter getter are the way to go and the very small performance penalty that you pay for it is usually either optimized away or trumped by elegance

2225126
lgpl	gpl
gpl lgpl mpl

2225141
streamreader	streamwriter
for instances a streamwriter and a streamreader cannot both be called on the same file

2225170
numeric	digits
you can generator them by holding down the alt key and typing in the 4 digits unicode codepoint on the numeric keypad

2225174
boost	stl
if you are looking for something to expand on the stl that is supported by almost everything it would be worth taking a look at the boost libs

2225184
display	height	display	width
the new image display correctly in it s own width and height it s just that the tag s properties do not change along with a new src

2225196
getter	setter
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
by using setter getter you add a valuable layer of encapsulation to your classes and 99 of the time this is worth the extra typing you ll need to do

2225196
getter	setter
imagine trying to do the examples above without setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
it s an object relation mapper orm that can automatically setup setter getter for you amongst other things

2225197
dictionary	arrays
dictionary - arrays - string

2225197
dictionary	arrays
dictionary - dictionary - dictionary - arrays - string

2225197
dictionary	arrays
here s code that creates a row dictionary contains a hi arrays contains 2 strings named item 0 and item 1 with named test 1 and test 2

2225213
jquery-slider	slider
i have a jquery-slider filled with movie and i would like jquery to stop the slider on a click event for either the embed object

2225214
buffering	streaming
in java this would be done by creating 2 file streaming for the 2 files reading into buffering from a.txt and writing it to the fstream of the new file

2225215
content-disposition	content-type
if internet-explorer knows the content-type specified and there is no content-disposition data internet-explorer performs a mime sniff scanning the first 200 bytes of the file to determine if the file structure matches any known mime-types

2225226
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
dragging and dropping web-parts works great in internet-explorer but it doesn t work at all in firefox google-chrome or safari

2225247
32-bit	64bit
will it work on a 64bit viewmodel on a 32-bit native os

2225247
32-bit	64bit
a surprising result is that 64bit vms can be run under a 32-bit hosts os provided the cpu is capable and you don t want to allocate too much ram 2g or thereabouts to the guest

2225253
getter	setter
once on that i d really love if java had implied getter and setter created using a properties keyword.

2225254
output	mode
ultimately my goal is to mimic the video settings that microsoft s camera capture dialog output in the messaging quality mode 64kbps from my c++ code

2225254
attributes	properties
the videoinfoheader has a bitrate properties but i suspect that specifying new settings here will do nothing to alter the actual encoding process since i wouldn t think file attributes would come into play until after the encoding

2225265
value	field
you can use partials field to display that value

2225272
jax-ws	cxf
it s an cxf webservice using jax-ws over soap

2225274
version-control	bazaar
bazaar is a more flexible version-control systemd than subversion and might suit your needs better

2225285
youtube	vimeo
because both youtube and vimeo videos are rendering using flash it s unlikely that you ll be able to listen for the click events registered by those elements because flash has its own internal event model with its own handler

2225294
hash	md5
i am creating a sequential file which required a digital-signature md5 hash

2225294
hash	md5
if i perform a md5 hash on both the sequential file and dynamic arrays can i expect the result to be the same or different

2225306
if-statement	loops
the second if-statement which i removed was unnecessary because the each loops would have run 0 time if no object matched .so the test was wasted.

2225308
authentication	login
now if i had say a frontend gui coded in swing say a login dialog which requested a username and passwd instead of using java code to authentication and store passwd could i somehow use prolog to checked the passwd instead

2225313
datagridview	databound
if you have databound via bindingsource and you store the binding source in a variables called bindingsource you can call bindingsource.removeat x and bindingsource.insert x and the data for example your list and the rows of the datagridview will swap for you

2225316
g++	gcc
normally - if you are on linux and gcc g++ gdb is install - then it should work out of the box

2225320
any	set
i wouldn t care much about the styles per se or any kind of dogma for that matter but rather the convenience in maintainability that comes with a set of getter-setter methods

2225320
getter	setter
if you or someone else later needed to change the behavior associated with a change of one of those attributes log the changes make it thread-safe sanitize input etc. but have already directly modified them in lots of other places in your code you will have wished you used getter and setter methods instead

2225330
arguments	default
.when i call through this function pointers i do not want to specify an arguments for the default arguments

2225330
arguments	default
any ideas on how to do this in conformant c++ if i do not want to specify any value for the default arguments

2225331
value	field
if the value i m adding is null all works fine and all value going to the field that are not sql_variant types work

2225393
aggregate	grouping
but i have to have column scc in grouping by or aggregate grrr

2225405
wordpress	moodle
unless you re working with a framework like wordpress or moodle that helps you generator pages the only output php creates is up to you

2225405
wordpress	moodle
if you are using wordpress or moodle or drupal or some other content-management-system or other php framework it s up to that framework how new content gets added to the head

2225416
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it working perfect in ie and firefox but both safari and google-chrome fails to load the scripting on some pageloads

2225418
local-storage	web-storage
in modern browsers you can use web-storage local-storage session-storage object for that

2225420
xsd	xml
the string is the xml file .so all you need to do is deserialize it into the classes created from the xsd

2225426
arguments	default
default arguments is a purely compile-time concept it is a form of syntactic-sugar

2225426
arguments	default
from the function s points of view there s no difference between an explicit arguments supplied by the user or a default one implicit supplied by the compiler

2225426
arguments	default
but this is not standards c++ and this does not appear to be what you are looking for since you want the default arguments value to change at runtime depending on the function the pointers is points to

2225429
configuration	environment
assuming you ve already got a jndi database resource set up the following environment for ibatis 3 s configuration xml file works for me running on tomcat

2225431
mstest	nunit
for unit-testing you shouldn t test private methods yes but for integration-testing using a unit-testing framework like mstest or nunit i would very much like to run the internal api call against a test url to make sure the current code works .when the third party api vendor changes their backend

2225439
base-class	inherited
you can also avoid the problem by using fluent-nhibernate instead of xml and inherited the classmap class for the base types that s what i personally do .when i have a common base-class in a project

2225444
member-functions	inline
as an aside member-functions defined within a class-type are implicit marked inline

2225463
perl	php
.when coding php and perl sometimes the interpreter would throw an error referencing the very last line of the file

2225536
abstract-methods	traits
of those traits with abstract-methods

2225536
abstract	extends
a tour of scala discusses using self-types annotations with abstract types members - presumably it s not possible to extends an abstract types member

2225541
google-chrome	safari
i did not experience any issues in either google-chrome or safari for windows on your product page

2225549
margins	padding
in the meantime saying things like 100 -20px has to be done with nested elements margins and padding

2225552
hidden	reset
if .so the modal pop-up is reset and hidden if not the html response text is dumped into the modal pop-up div for the user to see the fault

2225552
jquery	.post
i m doing this in asp.net-mvc using a jquery ajaxsubmit and an action that only accepts a .post verb and returns a partialviewresult

2225553
e-commerce	product
for example i am working with the spree e-commerce ruby-on-rails platform and i would like to add a multi-step form people should fill out .when trying to add to cart a product

2225562
icacls	cmd	cacls	cmd
you might find the cacls or icacls cmd useful.

2225577
machine-code	disassembly
one would have to inspect the actual machine-code generator by the jit compiler debugging with disassembly view open

2225577
32-bit	x86
there are difference between the x64 and the x86 jit compiler but i don t have access to a 32-bit machine

2225590
project-management	scrum
scrum kanban are execution of agile guiding principles from a project-management perspective whereas extreme-programming xp focuses on the engineering practices unit-testing continuous-integration pair-programming etc

2225592
google-chrome	firefox
most modern browsers i ve tested google-chrome and firefox send a referer header on link click and not on direct entry - that is if the user s settings say to which they usually do by default

2225597
margins	padding
the margins will simulate padding for the outer div

2225598
zen-cart	magento
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2225599
actionscript	mxml
or move your xml construction to a pure actionscript file instead of mxml

2225609
punctuation	words
search for the words in the ternary tree - if a partials match is found checked that the rest of the words is punctuation or at least not stuff that would make it not be a match

2225609
punctuation	words
the main problem with this approach is if there is punctuation before the words like a but that can be dealt with easily

2225613
cruisecontrol.net	buildbot
i ve been through buildbot cruisecontrol.net.net cruisecontrol.net and hudson

2225618
value	field
if i have a form that updates via ajax there is a chance that the original value field as it was output to the browser will not match the text that the form field now has inside

2225621
linked-list	queue
.when i want to use a generalized set of linked-list or in my case queue code i embed the linked-list pointers inside the larger structure that i want to use it with

2225630
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this is supported by ie8 but for firefox you would need to use -moz-box-sizing and for safari google-chrome use -webkit-box-sizing

2225644
crypt	salt
i have read the information provided on the php manual entry for crypt but i find myself still unsure of the format for a salt to triggers the blowfish algorithm

2225651
google-chrome	safari
it appears that google-chrome can handle more value at the moment but safari can t

2225654
silverlight	wpf
is it possible to make a childwindow like childwindow in silverlight but for wpf

2225654
silverlight	wpf
i tried to adapt the silverlight childwindow to wpf but ran into issues with transformation and not being able to set the pop-up s parent

2225662
checkbox	button
all checked radio button and checkbox

2225662

global-variables	call
if every function is referentially transparency --- it only depends on its input and no hidden state to compute its output and every function-call with the same input always yield the same output--- then you are in a good positioning to parallelize the algorithm since your code never mutates global-variables or files servers etc. the work a function does can be safely repeated to recompute the function s result or completely ignore no future code depends on this function s side-effects .so skipping a call completely won t break anything

if is my intention that each invoices should contains a collections of line items and that .when the invoices is formatted for printing the items are sorted by date separated into lists by category then have the price of each line calculated in a different way for each concrete types timed items will lookup the hourly in the rates properties priced items are assign a price on creation

2229569
put	get
if you put enough restrictions on the code you are searching you can probably get an approximation to what you are after but c and c++ are both very hard to analyze

2229569
python	perl	comma	words
if you can play with perl or python or any tool with pcre perl-compatible regular expression or equivalent then you can do things like ensure that on a single line the words find appears followed by an open parentheses a sequences of typename value separated by comma and white spaces and a close parentheses

2229579
any	set
in the base form you have to set the properties modifiers protected for the tablelayoutpanel and any other control you want to change in the child forms

2229613
spacing	layout
how would i go about amending my code .so that the same layout spacing between controls is maintained but is generally centered

2229624
put	get
with get data i can easily put the query in something like action prevpageurlandquery

2229638
value	field
in the main report i ve created a formula field with the value i d like to pass to the subreport and thus the stored procedure and linked it to the subreport

2229640
contains	elements
it contains different page elements than the other pages.

2229661
ubuntu	linux
i ve developed ruby-on-rails on ubuntu linux quite a bit

2229661
textmate	gedit
i found gmate a package to make gedit behave as much like textmate as possible

2229693
textchanged	textbox
if not you can recursively iterate over controls on form user-controls subscribe to appropriate events for each control for example textchanged for a textbox selecteditemchanged for a combobox control etc. and forwarding call to your tracking routines

2229738
checkbox	textbox
you could probably get away with only one handler per user-interface elements types one for textbox one for checkbox etc since i believe the handler for those events would need to have different parameters

2229793
put	get
if i put it inside a class or somewhere else i get dllimport is not defined i am using visual-studio 2008 professional

2229812
design-time	designer
inorder to add design-time functionality like additional operations known as action lists and verbs depending on how they are provided or dragging of visual elements like headers or split bars you need to implements a custom designer usually derived from controldesigner that allows the windows-forms-designer to understand how to interact with your custom control at design-time

2229826
hidden-field	input-field
obviously the problem is the two input-field specifically the hidden-field with the same named attributes but how do i stop it doing this

2229844
contains	any
if i manually edit any of the cell contains formula press f2 and then just enter without changing anything i can get excel to evaluate the formula properly

2229852
checkbox	button
i am using jquery to hide form field i am manipulating checkbox and radio button

2229852
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome .when i click the associated labels the form field still activates and checked

2229852
checkbox	button
how can i have the labels activate the checkbox radio button in ie

2229863
hide	show
and then toggle the .hidden class to show hide the elements

2229871
versioning	upgrade
then if needed you can always upgrade to a multi-user server versioning

2229891
bitwise-and	complement
if you know that you re only ever going to run on two s complement architectures you can use a bitwise-and

2229891
bitwise-and	modulo
using the modulo can result in slower code relative to the bitwise-and

2229906
variables	boolean
i think this is a common problem with threads and this particular problem you can solver with boolean variables

2229907
put	get
of course you can t access value from the map as variables directly you d always have to do put and get to updates and retrieve them but the concept is the same

2229914
value	field
if you know all of the data field that you ll be expecting you could building a dictionary with placeholder for all of your expected value before you parsing the xml

2229920
directory	folder
i created a folder in my solution called schema to save the xml file and set the building action to content and the copy to output directory value to be copy if newer

2229921
quicktime	vlc
if you mean by solution that you can building code it i can suggest quicktime easy on mac with cocoa strange on windows but it works or you can checkout mplayer vlc sources and try to integrated that

2229931
installation	building	installation	uninstall
is it possible to building an install in visual-studio that will not required the application to be uninstall prior to installation

2229992
configuration	environment
i added configuration.middleware.use rack bug to configuration environment development.rb

2230019
xsd	xml
can anyone suggest a framework for delphi for work with xml xsd like the one that makes castor for java

2230052
value	field
ie will not change the value of hidden form field

2230100
capture	player
it should work similar to vlc player s directx video output were it is not possible to capture a frame using simple screens capturing software or the printscreens-key

2230103
handler	service
you can easily expand the service to include different types of public events which can be used anywhere in the .app just remember to un-register event handler from any controls that don t live forever like the main form does

2230115
getdate	dateadd
and dbo_sdb_apphistory.starttime between getdate and dateadd d -180 getdate

2230116
salt	md5
even with md5 that has had some collision attacks discovered and has a set of rainbow tables you will be ok if you keep your salt very very safe

2230135
primitive	boolean
this methods works for arrays of primitive - strings numbers boolean

2230146
memcached	apc
we tried to use apc memcached etc

2230150
selected	button
the way i m hoping to make it work is that the user would fill out the details of the form selected a picture and hit the upload button then do an ajax updates .when the file is upload .so that they can see the picture before pressing the final submit button

2230157
value	field
this will be the default behavior if you are using sc fld to rendering field value

2230193
http	ssl
if the objective of this is to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack by virtue of the plaintext passwd being sent over http then use ssl

2230193
hash	md5	salt	md5
if the hash-function is cheap like md5 this won t be any more difficult to crack than one salt and one hash in fact it s actually weaker since hashing is a lossy function

2230197
.net	wcf
microsoft and hopefully the majority of .net developers are pushing for more adoption of wcf as opposed to old school asmx styles asp.net web-services

2230202
implements	extends
the difficulty with this is how to implements the methods efficiently as with my current understanding each level would recreate new object inorder to extends the previous object

2230228
authentication	login
i have two pages to access an application one public with a login box and one on our intranet with a auto authentication via network id

2230231

groovy	java
i m trying to use groovy s mockfor and proxydelegateinstance to mock a java class with constructor parameters but i can t seem to get it right

2230283
knopflerfish	equinox
there are several osgi containers available such as knopflerfish felix and equinox

2230292
contains	elements
also it seems that this problem exists because you are returning a reference to a private collections after which you lose control of the elements it contains

2230310
attributes	properties	assign	add
assign a function to the onclientclick properties of the elements directly does attach the handler but does not automatically add an attributes to the dom nodes

2230343
database-table	mysql
remove duplicates entries rows a mysql database-table

2230344
selected	checkbox
but i don t know why i can t tick the checkbox to selected a field inorder to map with another field in another table

2230355
contains	elements
i then calculated the total width of all elements preceding the special-link our centering link and used it to figure a padding-left for the contains paragraph tag

2230371
downcasting	upcasting
also you re upcasting and downcasting for no reason here

2230392
windows-mobile	symbian
or if the mobile has a common operating systemd like symbian or windows-mobile then you need sdk and compilers for these target platform

2230408
.when	ready
however there is some big trouble in that asp.net-mvc dump the page .when it is ready not as it is loaded

2230414
order	join
you can join this to your order table if you want to fetch extra information about each order

2230415
windows-mobile	windows-ce
for example if its windows-mobile 5 6 they can use .exe files compiled with the windows-ce sdk

2230416
put	get
the reason you get crash may be that you get a race conditional .when replacing the autocomplete source which is used by a background-thread to compute candidates while you are typing or you put null instead of string.empty in the candidate list

2230442
contains	set	contains	elements
assuming that you really have a chaining the result will be the singleton set contains the first elements in the list

2230447
value	field
that is i want to know which field within my huge nested and and or where conditional met which conditionalal and their value

2230449
progress-bar	progress
your user-interface-thread should periodically say every .5 seconds checked the thread s progress report and updates the user-interface s progress-bar

2230459
noclassdeffounderror	classpath	classnotfoundexception	classpath	classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
my cents on classnotfoundexception s or noclassdeffounderror s which in turn indicate missing jar s in the runtime classpath

2230467
freebsd	linux
for linux i can concatenation the and the contents of etc ld.so.conf process the include directives as needed and possibly filtering by architecture but that doesn t work on freebsd

2230471
scriptmanager	updatepanel
the problem is that .when i use a scriptmanager all client side javascript that was active .when the page was originally loaded is lost once an updatepanel post back

2230471
selected	textbox
the calendar are initially hidden until you click within an as.sociated textbox al.so within the updatepanel at that points the calendar popup .so you can selected a date

2230493
multiplying	modulo
since the modulo value is known at compile-time i d expect most modern compilers to go the multiplying by reciprocal and shift approach and this is fast

2230503
getter	setter
where currentversion is not getter or setter methods it is just a class methods

2230519
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am just looking into converting webforms to asp.net-mvc

2230538
contains	elements
i have an xdocument and a of the named of the elements that contains sensitive information that i need to mask replace with underscore.js in this example

2230541
freebsd	linux
for both linux and freebsd you can try working through the output of ldconfig 8

2230541
freebsd	linux
the options for listing the libs are different though -p on linux -r on freebsd . hope this helps

2230552
profiling	debugging
for instances i was painfully debugging some hql with p6spy .when someone told me about hibernate profiling which is really great and helpful

2230569
click	mouse
this doesn t seem to work my guess is that focusevents are fired before the mouse click is being process which in turn will undo the selection

2230569
click	mouse
b selected on every mouse click

2230570
content-disposition	content-type
i would recommend reading the file in as a byte and sending it out with it s content-type and content-disposition set in the response and then just perform a response.binarywrite and a response.flush

2230573
windows-mobile	windows-ce
in a windows-ce based mobile phone like windows-mobile phone this means the pe format which native c and c++ code is compiled and linked to

2230599
linux	unix
under windows for various historical rea.sons case of the file named ultimately does not matter .so your application would be working fine under windows but .when you move it to linux unix it would start giving problems

2230619
value	field
however for some of the other decimal field i am using ui.spinner.js github to allow the user to hit the up down button to toggle the value of the numbers

2230631
textmate	vim
a lot of people will swear by vim if they don t use textmate

2230638
margins	padding
margins padding div img span

2230642
any	set
the problem is that the ioexception can be throw for any numbers of reasons for example an invalid path or readonly flag set on the file

2230672
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is an exception-handling to the rules and it creates that exception-handling by reinventing a lot of standards

2230672
webforms	asp.net
what this generally tends to mean is that the solution that asp.net webforms provides although effective is a jack-of-all-trades implementation which results in some very verbose output that works well enough to satisfy most

2230672
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the numbers one comparison i like to make is simply webforms building webpage but asp.net-mvc building web-applications

2230677
children	nodes
i want to retrieve the value of children of assettype nodes who got attributes longname characters

2230682
groovy	scala
for example if you choose groovy you re implicit also choosing the grails web framework if you choose scala you re choosing lift etc

2230682
groovy	java
eclipse is a great ide for java development but a pretty crappy one for groovy grails development

2230684
value	field
that s because the recording to be dedupped often have slightly different value is some of the field

2230684
value	field
for .some types of dedupping you may need a user-interface .so that the per.son doing the dedupping can choose which of two value to use for a particular field

2230686
toggle	slider
.when the user click the basket itself it toggle slider open closed and toggle a locked on class

2230690
selected	button
find your file selected it and pick the arrow next to add button and choose add as a link

2230693
constructor	object
pass an object to the constructor and all methods supported by the object will be delegated

2230697
contains	any
there is one svn trick you can use you can use external to checkout the original files and you can get these to any directory you like but it cannot checkout to a directory that contains existing files - it clears the contents first iirc

2230698
mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mouseover
also mouseover didn t work for some reason i couldn t figure out but .when i put mouseenter and mouseleave as suggested in one of the post above it worked

2230698
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve never heard of mouseenter or mouseleave but .

2230703
qvector	qlist
qlist is partway between qvector similar to std vector and qlinkedlist similar to std list

2230703
qvector	qlist
qvector has squeeze but that doesn t seem present in qlist

2230708
any	set
the only way i know to do it with any simplicity is to set a global javascript variables in the rendering content that can be read by the external source file

2230708
ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	symfony
i can do this quite easily with cakephp and ruby-on-rails but i haven t been able to find an analogous solution for symfony

i am trying to get teamcity to work with gallio mbunit and also some legacy mstest unit tests

2230742
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc has some advantages over webforms but it also has some disadvantages as well as i covered detail in this answer

2230742
value	field
.so for example if you have a textbox whose value you must checked on the server side as well as a bunch of other field viewstate will let you handle the postback catch the error and show a labels and then return the user to the form with all of their entries intact

2230750
shell	bash
php execute external programs through the systemd shell .so the value is likely to come from bash or whatever default shell you have

2230756
macros	vba
i have created an excel 2003 .xls file created macros using vba

2230756
worksheet	excel
the excel file is protected and has hidden worksheet

2230756
worksheet	excel
i m guessing that ie doesn t access the worksheet hidden or otherwise in the excel workbook

2230756
worksheet	excel
is there a way to declare the sheets or worksheet variables in my excel-vba code .so that the excel macros can run in the ie windows as well

2230767
json	xml
very often a simple web service servlet php scripting etc. would service request read from the database and emit data to the client over http in json xml or some other format

firefox	opera
the following example works fine in firefox and opera but not in ie8

2230769
addclass	show	toggleclass	show	toggleclass	addclass	toggleclass	removeclass	removeclass	show	removeclass	addclass
the below example show the use of toggleclass but replacing this with addclass and removeclass still has the same problem

2230787
groovy	java
i can t tell you why your code above is not working but there are several ways in groovy to mock java classes without using mockfor

2230792
.war	jar
this ideally would prevent them from coming back since they re still there and not grenade jboss because they won t be include in the .war ear jar if that s actually an issue for existing project

2230800
exception-handling	error-handling
i believe that the main problem with checked-exception-handling as implements by java is that they break one of the main features of exception-handling non-local error-handling

2230819
redirecttoaction	url.action
my suggestion is to use url.action to generator the base url since it works much the same as redirecttoaction but returns a string

2230823
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
i m not sure of any service like that but it sounds to me that you want to use a virtual-machine such as vmware or virtualbox

2230832
selected	checkbox
i am trying to set the selected value of a checkbox from a dataprovider an xml file

2230842
value	field
for security reasons modern browser don t allow to set a value for file upload field

2230859
dependency-injection	singleton
rather than going down the static path or the singleton path you could investigate using dependency-injection di with an inversion-of-control containers framework

2230870
contains	any
the parent-pom has no knowledge of any of the children it simply contains boilerplate repo definitions and common plugins

2230912
uninstaller	appdata
i notice that often time .when you uninstaller a program clear out appdata references checked registries to make sure there is no residue of any relevant information

2230953
any	set
set up a function to add your images and call it .when the page is loaded either using window.onload or whatever support your javascript libs if any has for doing things a bit earlier than that

2230962
64bit	x86
i need something that can run on mac os x or iphone powerpc x86 or 64bit

2230977
javascript	dom
checkout javascript dom does not required any special libs just standards javascript dom methods

2230980
anonymous-class	abstract-class
you can write an abstract-class or interface to represent a callback such as a listener and then you can implements that interface with an anonymous-class to supply the callback

2230981
kerberos	ldap
one idea i have found was to authentication against the active-directory ldap using the kerberos ticket

2230981
kerberos	ldap
unfortunately we use windows 7 and re-using the kerberos ticket to authentication against the ldap only works .when setting a registry entry see search for allowtgtsessionkey

2230992
constructor	object
my thinking prototype are essentially attributes of the constructor function whether native constructor such as function string or object or your own custom constructor and only the new keyword is able to leverage the constructor and its prototype for object creation

installation	upgrade
i would not upgrade tangle with or otherwise modify the default installation of python if that s what you are asking

2231020
versioning	upgrade
you are much better off installing an upgrade versioning of python in an alternate location using macports

2231022
any	set
the only project in my solution is set to compile to any cpu

2231027
attributes	properties
in the case of event handler attributes ie behaves differently to all other browsers see why does an onclientclick properties set with setattribute fail to work in ie

2231028
sql-server	oracle
i am using ssis to copy data from a table in oracle to a table in sql-server 2005

2231038
arguments	default
the default is targetpath but i often set it to something like solutiondir testapp test.exe with a few command-line arguments

2231040
constructor	object
secondly the tblobfield constructor take one arguments a pointers to a tcomponent which acts as the owner for the object and is the object responsible for clearing the memory afterwards

2231040
delphi	c++
it is written in delphi but should be easily ported to c++ due to the vcl framework

2231070
unsigned	short
read it into an unsigned short int and do some range checked after if you need to

2231079
authentication	login
we used the built-in authentication to have the principal set and relied then on the default java ee login mechanisms

2231094
python	c++
it s possible that you could keep the drivers and interface code in python and just put the heavy computational code in c++

2231094
children	nodes
passdown would call whatever nodes methods is used to do the pre-order computation and nodess that have out-of-object children would call passdown on those descendant object

2231094
children	tree
invocations of passup would compute as far up into the receiving object s tree as it can until it hits a parent that hasn t received data from all its children

2231103
google-chrome	firefox
the examples work in ie and google-chrome but do nothing in firefox

2231131

now i would like to selected the data in my table with the checkbox - get the product ids that works fine i see the alert from the handleselectedion and pass it over to my custom action in the ruby-on-rails controllers to edit the specified recording very similar to ryan b s ruby-on-railscast #165

2231132
google-chrome	firefox
what is causing this misbehaviour in google-chrome while it works in firefox

google-chrome	firefox
i was doing some logging on window.getselection and noticed that it contains different information .when comparing google-chrome and firefox

2231143
event-dispatch-thread	actionevent
you should consider using javax.swing.timer which will fire actionevent s periodically directly on the event-dispatch-thread hence making your code simpler more compact and removing the need for the additional thread

2231147
google-maps	gps
if you need to building your own list of .post codes and coordinates you can probably create a scripting that will iterate through all valid .post codes and use google-maps to look them up and turn them into gps coordinates

2231161
repository	entity
to fix this i created an entity mapping and repository for userrole

2231167

this way if there s reboot required the install can be ran the exact same way and would just keep checked for required components and firing off install as needed

2231529
calloc	malloc
the fact that the function returns a malloc -ed or calloc -ed memory becomes a part of its external specifications

2231578
reflection	runtime
such a tool could be an ide plugins or could generator the new class at runtime using reflection

i ve wrote my own custom solution that uses memcached apc filesystems depending on what i need for the task because i couldn t find one that met my requirements

2231607
constructor	object
by declaring a non-default constructor in your class foo you disabled the implicit generator of the default one .so now you ll have to supply an initializer every time you create a foo object regardless of whether it is an arrays elements or not

2231622
display	height	display	width
btw the uiimage display fine i just cannot resize the image properly if i cannot get the width and height

2231661
g++	gcc
if you look at the cmd issued by xcode for a building with the 10.4 sdk selected you will see that gcc g++ flags include

i have the msbuild plugins install on my hudson server and it s attempting to execute the cmd but for some reason the path i m setting in my configuration is not being used .when the msbuild-task gets fired

2231706
put	get
the error you get if you put an arbitrary int is

2231730
python	ruby
it tends to be in the area of 10x faster than python and 100x faster than ruby

2231733
double	int
the typical implementation of a double has a 53-bit mantissa .so you can represent 53-bit int with ab.solute precision

2231737
cross-compiling	newlib
gcc cross-compiling for arm-elf with newlib runtime libs

2231737
cross-compiling	newlib

2231738
contains	any
i tried and i didn t find any way to force xsd.exe to spit out any documentation contains in the schema

2231755
set	bag
my problem is i don t know how to force or suggest to the reverse-engineering tools hibernate-tools.jar to use bag or list --it always uses set

2231763
twitter	tweets
due to the way twitter stores and serves tweets in their search api the minimum date won t really matter

2231764
constructor	object
running the constructor on each block .so if you have an object without a constructor you can still make an arrays of it since that object has a size and since memory understands size

2231764
constructor	object
you will be running the constructor as you create the object to fill the arrays with or as said previously .when you assign it to something which in turn allocates spaces runs the constructor

2231775
javascript	dom
you just use the dom to do this just like in javascript

2231777
associations	model
activerecord belongs_to associations have the ability to be autosaved along with the parent model but the functionality is off by default

2231788
constructor	private
it is hardly necessary but you can prevent anyone from inheriting this class by adding a private constructor

2231800
value	field
previously i ve only accessed value that were input from a field or from the user but never on a properties of a newly created entity

2231812
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
you could use sortedlist or a sorteddictionary see discussion below with a custom key

2231823
nsinteger	int
to be safe you should al.so cast the nsinteger to an int .when you pass it to printf .so you would write d int row because the size of nsinteger is not guaranteed to be the size the d specifier tells printf to expect

2231839
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
create a mutable arrays and loops until you reach the original arrays s count creating a dictionary and adding it to the mutable arrays on each iterator

2231841
selected	button	buildpath	libs
to include the libs in your project you must tell flexbuilder you can get a free trial or just use the free command-line tools and add-on the apollo portion where the libs is located by going to project|properties and selected apollo buildpath then choosing the libs path tab and pressing the add swc... button

2231849
jquery	.post
checkout the .post about using jquery with other libs

http-headers	content-type
i solved this exact same problem removing the content-type form the custom http-headers section in the http-headers tab in iis

2231896
python	java	python	php	python	c++
it makes a lot more sense to be verbose with something like python or php than c++ or java

2231896
instances	self
that said it s still nice to do for methods members that aren t self explanatory not named updates for instances

2231896
python	php
something very dirty that i ve done in php python is use reflection to retrieve comment blocks and labels elements in the user-interface

2231902
terminal	prompt
i don t want to run emacs on the remote machine either on the terminal or through an x session but i do want to send file to my local emacs from a remote prompt like this

type-safety	generics
using generics is another option which will improve your type-safety but i don t know enough about your code to say if it would work all around

2231906
shell	bash	shell	tcsh	tcsh	bash
the linux cmd shell bash tcsh ksh whatever will expand the into a list of files before your program even sees it

2231912
content-length	content-type
create a servlet which listens on an url-pattern of gets the requested css file by httpservletrequest#getpathinfo and basically gets an inputstream from it using the aforementioned servletcontext#getresourceasstream and writes it to the outputstream of the response along a correct set of response headers with at least content-type and content-length

2231914
javadoc	doxygen
some comments in that vein not usually with formatting that extreme actually exist to help tools like javadoc and doxygen generator documentation for your code

2231919
waitpid	fork
see perldoc perlfork perldoc -f fork and perldoc -f waitpid

2231935

to give you an idea of my background i ve been writing complex desktop apps since 1988 in c++ visual basic delphi and c#

2231980
uitextview	uilabel
the controllers here will be your existing uiviewcontrollers object or subclassing thereof -- in the first tab responding to changes in the datamodel and updating the say uilabel accordingly in the second tab changing the numbers in the datamodel .when the user for example modifies the value on a uislider or in a uitextview

2231980
subclassing	nsobject
create this datamodel object which should just be a subclassing of nsobject in your .application delegation add it as a interface member properties in your view controllers and pass it to both view controllers .when the .app starts up

2231981
keyboard	mouse
i am developing a program which send images from one computer to another similar to remote assistance without mouse keyboard input

2231981
windows-vista	windows-xp
the two computers i use to test this are one windows-xp machine and one windows-vista

2231996
swing	swt
i would start with swing and swt because the first decision you will need to make will be to pick one of them and it probably won t be feasible to switching later

2232008
selected	button
you know on some sites .when you re asked to upload say an avatar you click on the button selected your file then hit ok but before you submit the page as in no recording is created updates a little preview of the image show up

2232013
javadoc	doxygen
btw javadoc or doxygen or equiv. is a good thing tm imho

2232027
defined	declare
.when writing a simple templates used only in one place declare and defined it inline with the declarations right in the cpp file where you re going to use it

2232027
defined	declare
for small templates utilities used across translation units defined and declare them together in an h file

2232036
swing	swt
apart from swing swt and the netbeans-platform there are a few other words you should google

2232037
any	set
by conventions we set up our source control systemd svn to ignore any custom.config files

2232042
cos	exp	cos	pow	exp	pow
b. i have verified that the code is not using any runtime math libs function like log pow exp cos etc...but still my code has some operations like a+b+c 3.could this be an issue

2232047
masstransit	nservicebus
using nservicebus masstransit or rhinoservicebus all use msmq

2232048
scala	java
if you all have strong java background and no functional and or dynamic-languages background then you are likely to do well by keeping to java or migrating to scala

2232048
scala	java
i don t mean to disparage any of the other languages here but scala will be more familiar to you and you can put your java familiarity to good use

2232048
scala	java
not only there are other web-frameworks in scala but people have had success combining scala with traditional java frameworks such as wicket

2232071
groovy	java
a groovy scripting is a bit different from a groovy java class

2232075
getter	setter
a model should be a representation of the object in the database and generally only contains your crud methods create retrieve updates delete getter and setter methods and maybe some static helpers methods related to the model

2232091
scala	java
i find scala to be a nice mix between java and ruby

2232098
logout	login
route admin logout login admin_logout

2232103
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but ie fails to recognize it as a csv file thinking it is a html fle and .when i click save i get the error unable to downloading named of file from named of site

2232117
one-to-many	entity
a user has a one-to-many relationship rightsgiven to the right entity

2232117
one-to-many	entity
a user has a one-to-many relationship rightsreceived to the right entity

2232138
configuration	installation
luckily my installation and configuration experiences with a fresh tfs 2010 install in the lab have been much more smooth than my initial exposure to the tfs 2008 process

2232141
value	field
loadresstring reads the identifier field twice and it needs to have the same value both time

2232150
execute	prepare
it uses a pdo prepare statement that execute in a loops

2232156
javafx	swing
javafx i d go with this possibly combined with swing

2232174
cryptography	security
circumvents other network security controls and gains access to encrypted data without the proper cryptography key the data is unreadable and

2232211
hide	show
b needs to be hide show columns based on user s location

2232232
properties-file	jar
i have a properties-file myorg.properties which i ve include in a jar file named myorg.jar

2232240
groovy	java
it does mean you would be coding in groovy and not java but that should not be a problem

2232240
groovy	java
groovy and griffon run on the java virtual-machine and can be deployed cross-platform

2232244
hide	show
although you can hide show columns in your code to manipulate the columns before export that s not a big deal just the formatting of the look-and-feel will be difficult

2232251
updating	updates
it works okay in that updating a form instances in a libs will updates the libs columns

2232262
onchange	onkeyup
used onkeyup and onchange

2232266
triggers	insert
.when a triggers exists on a table being insert or updatess the return-value include the numbers of rows-affected by both the insert or updates operation and the numbers of rows-affected by the triggers or triggerss

2232268
tomahawk	trinidad
tomahawk trinidad and or tobago all from apache

2232271
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
after enumerating and adding object to a dictionary the dictionary got added to an arrays before loops went to the next recording

2232271
dictionary	arrays
.so after 5 time through the arrays had 5 object one dictionary per recording with value from each

2232271
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
each time through loops the dictionary changed like it was supposed to but .when i insert it into the arrays the other object in the arrays changed to match

2232288
digits	zero
you then loops through that trying to find characters that are classified as alphabetical or digits -- which will never happen because a zero byte 0 not 0 is never either one

2232291
exponent	modulo
we now just need to compute the coefficients of its sixth power take the exponent modulo 20 and add them up

2232291
multiplication	polynomials
fast polynomials multiplication algorithms like fft can be used here

2232295
configuration	environment
before my tests are run in the beforesuite i initializer a bunch of environment object these object get created based on my environment configuration file

2232330
contains	any
they only store a reference to the object they contains and retain them .so any changes in the original object will be reflected if you retrieve them from the arrays because they are the same object

2232330
dictionary	arrays
if you change the dictionary contents these changes will be reflected in both dictionary the original one and the copy-paste one you have added to the arrays

2232351
.net	wcf
we are a .net shop currently developing a iphone .app that required the .app to call a wcf web service

2232363
database-table	mysql
the first input allows the user to selected a person from a mysql database-table

i construct a simple sample following his basic architecture using properties injection and the dependency attributes to inject viewmodel into the views

2232374
updating	updates
updates he s changed the list of call in the question .so i m updating to match

2232383
authentication	impersonation
alternatively stop using forms-authentication and use windows integrated authentication where you definitely can use impersonation server-side

2232394
union-all	union
but why use union-all and not just union

2232400
msbuild	nant
i know this can be done in nant and msbuild but i need to make hudson do it eg plugins or something

2232402
hidden-field	checkbox
use ajax to populate your main form by insert a hidden-field or potentially a visible checkbox elements with the appropriate unique_key .when the subform finishes

2232431
keyboard	mouse
while typing this i see that there may be a solution for both keyboard pasting and mouse pasting using ranges

2232439
keyboard	mouse
for instances sending mouse events to mouselistener keyboard events to keyboard listener etc

2232440
margins	padding
i think a textarea with no border margins padding with a div wrap might work with the div styled to work as borders for the textarea

2232449
msbuild	nant
add another nant msbuild step that does the deploy

2232454
display	width
that said you can always specifiy a width by using display block

2232454

i have an instances of my object let s assume its classname is menucontroller inherited from nsobject and supports 2 from nsmenudelegate methods

2232476
click	mouse
.so for call .some items i don t wanna go to windows mysubmenu myitem to click it by mouse i wanna press just one shortcut like cmd-3 to call the item

2232494
websphere	ibm
if possible see if you can use open ssl on ibm websphere everyplace micro environment jvm as well

2232498
entity-framework	ado.net
the entity-framework works only with ado.net providers that support it

2232502
double-quotes	single-quotes
also i replace the double-quotes with single-quotes yet the same problem is happening

2232528
double-quotes	single-quotes
you should use single-quotes instead of double-quotes ie

2232529
hide	show
for other scenarios where you need to hide show find windows and send keystrokes i would recommend autohotkey .

2232551
value	field
what s this database-design and it is display three rows of id in namedd in product and three rows of prices and three row of each field .when i am looking for to display the named variety and price in one row then the next row display another different set of field value different than the first row

2232563
python	ruby
there are a lot of wrapper for toolkits like qt cocoa or wxwidgets for d python ruby and other languages

2232572
constructor	object
the issue is quite obvious since all the inherited constructor need to be called at the initializer of the object any missing arguments will fail this to happen

2232572
extends	super
super wheel - extends class

2232572
arguments	default
try this in your base-class add default value to all the arguments in the constructor

2232602
properties-file	jar	configuration-files	properties-file
i have some configuration-files - a properties-file and a spring configuration file and my log4 props file - that i would like to have external to the jar

2232618
hash	md5
i m making a md5 hash of a response and then signing it with a shared secret

2232618
hash	md5
for most call this works but strangely fails generator a md5 hash different from the client on the only two call that bring a lot of content in the body

2232623
touch-event	ontouch
it turns out that i was prematurely consuming the touch-event in my ontouch implementation

2232675
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	button	textbox	button
i have in a windows a grid that contains a radio-button a textbox and a button each in column 0 1 2 respectively

2232675
textbox	button
then in another part of the windows i have another grid with a labels a textbox and a button in columns 0 1 and 2

2232695
highlight	cell
i made an application that uses a flextable and each cell of the table was to be highlight

2232701
order	join
just a join with a count and then an order by the count should do it

2232702
subclipse	m2e
may be the m2e scm handler does not find or is not compatible with the subclipse you are trying to install

2232702
subclipse	m2e
in any case you need to install or complete the installation of subclipse first before installing m2e

2232702
subclipse	m2e
see the relevant subclipse updates site and then try to complete the m2e installation

2232702
subclipse	m2e
see a full subclipse then m2e installation process there

2232703
controllers	routes
i know it s lacking the controllers named in there i have routes to give me these paths.

2232707
rvm	gem
you can also use the rvm gem

2232707
rvm	gem
each install of ruby under rvm has it s own set of gem

2232707
rvm	gem
i believe you can also have sets of gem for the same ruby versioning with rvm too

2232718
order	join
you can use a join and order by the count

2232720
checkbox	button
i m getting some strange behavior in firefox whenever i put checkbox inside a list ol ul dl and then dynamically insert button above the list

2232720
checkbox	button
but i need both button and the checkbox have to be in a list for what i m trying to building

2232725
hash	md5
anyway here s the correct way to create an md5 hash in java

2232725
hash	md5
keeping in mind that you will need to unencode it later before using it as an md5 hash

2232727
directx	gdi
from greg schechter s redirecting gdi directx and wpf applications

2232733
attributes	properties
i am not aware of any way to do this - the messagebodymember attributes has no properties or means to specify that it s a required part and thus should have minoccurs 1 in the wsdl

2232750
any	set
just set the parent properties to any framework elements in the parent windows it ll find the windows to block it with the mask and set the content to whatever you want to be popped up and call the show methods .when you want it to be show of course

2232750
button	popup
you ll have to come up with the popup wrapper something with a border and a close button that call the close methods on your own but it shouldn t be difficult and obviously remove the placeholder button in the constructor it s just there to show you how it it will look

2232750
silverlight	wpf
the only problem with this is it will only work on windowss that have their content the thing that is named layoutroot in silverlight is a grid the default .when you create a new wpf silverlight windows page

2232763
hash	md5
it is actually the md5 hash that are being damaged

2232772
instances	self
in your case f is an instances methods has a self parameter .so its called on a particular instances

2232773
any	set
is there a way to compute this for any set of points i want to connect

2232775
value	field
my guess is that this is firefox s memorize form field value mechanism going awry - how and why i don t know though

2232793
arrays	loops
loops over this arrays and generator a html structures you need

2232800
textarea	textbox
what you are seeing is the different default fonts that are applied to the textarea multiline textbox verse textbox input

2232800
textarea	textbox
if you apply a styles that sets the fontfamily to be the same for both the textbox and the textarea then your paste text will match

2232820
callback	methods
i am hoping to use the after_create callback methods to assign the role to the user

2232823
silverlight	wpf
the datasource pattern is used commonly in other user-interface frameworks such as qt in the model-view framework where the model is analogous to the datasource and wpf silverlight where the datasource might be more closely analogous to the viewmodel

2232828
deep-copy	object
deep-copy if you need an exact replica of an object and don t want to go to the trouble of writing your own specialized clone class simply serializing the object to a byte arrays and then de-serializing it to another object achieves this goal

2232838
safari	opera
it allows multiple decimal points in safari and opera and you can t types backspace arrow key or several other control-characters in opera

2232856
json	xml
the action methods would take that value use it to lookup the corresponding information based on that value and return a json xml format of the list of items

2232866
getter	setter
i have used synthesize to create getter setter and can use kvc to change properties

2232866
selected	cell
selected the cell of the labels and go to inspector

2232866
selected	cell
selected the cell of the labels and go to inspector

2232896
checkbox	button
but that s obviously a guess since really the button would be two elements before the checkbox anyway

2232903
cross-compiling	toolchain
you can use the open toolchain and cross-compiling or even compile on the iphone whatever apps you want and sell them through either the cydia or rockyourphone stores

2232910
click	mouse
it show i am suppose to click where the right triangle appears beside the mouse arrow and then snap

2232983
double	int
it may seem simple at first but as the code evolves and grows reliability suffers was that a list of int then double or vice versa

2232990
subtraction	multiplying
al.so you might say that as a shortcut a 1.5 discount is the same as saying that we charge 98.5 of regular price .so we should just be able to multiplying the original price by 98.5 and not have to do an extra subtraction

2232993
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
an example of bad design in the old user-interface is in the file menu you have the exit close which does not make sense as with the windows-xp taskbar start button that contains the shut down notice how windows-vista 7 has the windows logo instead of the start words

2233006
stderr	stdout
where do stdout and stderr go .when ncurses is active

2233023
arguments	default
as with most of the rest of ruby-on-rails activerecord will use sensible default derived from the first arguments to generator the methods that manage the associations

2233023
arguments	default
providing additional arguments to belongs_to just overrides those default

2233023
associations	model
have a read through the belongs_to section of the associations reference to get a better idea of the methods provided .when a model belongs to another and how the options to belongs_to are used

2233036
getdate	dateadd
edit if you want to go by days use dateadd d -740 getdate

2233055
revision	svn
i think the rev counter does not reflect the actual revision numbers but the revision since svn propset was invoked

2233067
create-table	declare
you can either declare the temp table as a separate create-table statement or declare it as part of your selected as i do below

2233073

2233091
base-class	inherited
is there a way to bind a collections such that i can have a within photoshoot without extraction a base-class and using the table-per-hierarchy inherited pattern

2233092
user-input	output
as for how to protect yourself the key is to never output user-input

2233097
google-chrome	firefox
click the move button changes the parent of the iframe and reload its contents in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2233114
put	get
in that methods put the stuff that happens .when you d get the notification

2233115
value	field
therefore .when you change a ref int parameter to a different int value you ll also change the local variables or field whose reference was passed as the parameter

2233128
primitive	int
the datatypes int is a primitive data types and hence a value-types as opposed to a reference-types

2233133
row	col
minors returns a matrix where each elements is the determinant with the i j row col deleted and diagonal returns a list of the diagonal elementss of a matrix

2233149
put	get
and i read here that i should put definition of inline-functions in header file because it won t work if i ll put them in cpp file and want to call them from other cpp file .when i do it i get undefined-reference during linking

see is there a perl or python libs for id3 metadata

2234123
getter	setter

postback	ajax
it can serve in a standards postback model .app or more likely an ajax .application

2234429
put	get
no if you really must have the create-table in there you could put it in an execute-immediate wrapped in a pl sql block with an exception-handling handler that only swallows the exception-handling-handling you expect to get - .so your scripting should handle all expected errors gracefully

2234434
configuration	logging
for example via your configuration you may use one types of logging in a console .app and another in a web .app

i m implements login and registration for multiple domains that talk to a single database - we ll call them i.domain-a.com and i.domain-b.com

2236965
registration	login
to implements completely separate login systemd for both of them that utilise the same php functions i have written to handle registration should i do something with session_name based on

2236978
constructor	object
now the the object that i m calling in the factory has one constructor which takes in another object by reference through constructor-injection

2236978
constructor	object
.when i call the proxy from the c# code the correct target object is returned from the proxy but the items inside it that should be set to something through the initital constructor call are empty

2237009
crypt	salt
now the crypt function appears to be capable of taking a salt of any length less than or equals to its maximum and silently handling any inconsistencies in the base64 by discarding any data that doesn t make up another full byte

2237009
crypt	salt
the crypt function will fail completely if you pass it characters in the salt that are not part of its base64 alphabet which just confirm this theory of its operation

2237009
crypt	salt	crypt	hash
the actual salt used by crypt to calculate the hash will in fact be identical

2237057
getter	setter
note that my solution doesn t need a setter and a getter as long as you always use path_finder and

2237058
priority-queue	queue
make that queue a priority-queue and you can arrange to .post jobs on that queue to tell the background threads to stop after they complete their current downloading

2237070
getter	setter
xmlserializer only serialization public properties that have a getter and a setter

2237073
buildpath	libs
you should rather have integrated the server in the same ide and configure the ide project to reference as.sociate the server in question .so that the ide will automagically take its libs in the project s buildpath

2237121
any	set
i saw the __dopostback function always set the __eventargument hidden-field to nothing for any postback caused by controls with even autopostback to true or a control like linkbutton

2237143
arguments	default
for most controls there are no specialized event argumentss and since event argumentss are different for every control null is passed to represent a default arguments should be created during the event sequences

2237145
httphandler	httpcontext
i was reading walkthrough creating an asynchronous httphandler and noticed they pass the httpcontext from the handler thread and use it in a waitcallback which runs on a background-thread

2237164
contains	elements
basically youâ ll have to use a repeat background-image on the parent elements contains both boxes

2237185
associations	model
the model for one will updates the associations

2237189
webserver	nginx
i have my main website and wordpress in different directory on my server on which i use nginx as the webserver

2237204
contains	elements
selected the properties elementss that contains descendant programs elementss that contains a child program elements who s value is 1

2237210
bluetooth	usb
gps devices typically provide their data in nmea format which is text and the data is transmitted over a serial-port and the serial-port is possibly transported over a usb or bluetooth connection

2237231
haskell	lisp
learn both lisp and haskell on your own

2237231
haskell	lisp
well lisp and haskell are good candidates since fun is all they are going to be used for no paid jobs there

2237238
constructor	private
basically the same way just make a normals final class with a private constructor prevents being able to do new and add static-members only

2237262
selected	checkbox
you have selected the newsletter checkbox are you sure you would like to receive our newsletter

2237265
selected	button
i want to set the default state of the button to be selected

2237277
xsd	xml
we have an xsd which validation an xml document with a namespace declare but we would like to use it on a document without one

2237291
any	set
but inorder to use this templates in php i have to replace some string in that file before printing out to webpage sys info hostname host_name sys info location location ip set ip the strings inbetween could be any other characters should be replace with _post host_name _post location _post ip etc

2237311
png	gif	bmp	png	bmp	gif
must be able to read jpg gif png and bmp and convert between them

2237315
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml	yaml	ini
consider using csv ini xml json or yaml and use appropriate apis to read and write them

2237321
factors	digits
to determine how many digits there are after the decimal you can either format as a string then count them or more efficiently call decimal.getbits the result-of which is an arrays of four int that contains the scaling factors in bits 16-23 of the fourth int

2237371
player	movie
i ve few doubts regarding movie player .app

2237371
player	movie
i want only video or movie to be played only to half the screens and i want to add custom-controls button to the remaining half of movie player

2237371
player	movie
2.in movie player example overlay view is there but how to change the named of the button and labels in that and i m unable to do that

2237387
implements	final
for simplicity i ve made my example immutable but you could always implements add to append to the final list stored within the composite object

2237413
contains	any
more brownie points for any hints on how to best force a spring .app to shut down in this case as the default listener contains will catch any runtime exception-handling and keep running

2237421
environment	building
personally i would only use use wspbuildinger to building deployment package that need to be deployed to live environment if i can be sure its not adding extra bits that may become a problem

2237455
response	timeout
there is the response.buffer option that you can use to tell it to delay returning the response until the page has completed process .so you could perhaps combine that with .some kind of timeout in the scripting but it would not be especially elegant especially as vbscripting doesn t really offer you a way of asking threads to sleep .so you can end up thrashing the cpu

2237460
directory	folder
i have an application written in c# that has to be able to write delete files folder in its root directory write delete files elsewhere on the disk write modify value in systemd registry local machine and start stop other applications and service

2237460
deployment	install
i have a deployment project in visual-studio 2008 that install everything and writes the necessary startup data in registry

2237460
required	checked
every now and again it will checked some files at this points i will required to be able to write to disk and read the registry readonly is fine at this points however since it s a temporary folder it wouldn t matter where i d put it

2237486
google-chrome	opera
that sounds suspiciously like the caching under global settings...try that...i have experienced that problem before under the admin back-end the menus wouldn t work..then again i got best results under opera in google-chrome it doesn t work properly...weird.

2237495
contains	any
in other words if i develop a templates control using the itemplates interface is there a way to wire it up like the updatepanel seems to .so that any controls contains within declarative can be accessed from the contains page al.so

2237497
preventdefault	keydown
i ve solved the first part of the problem by calling preventdefault on the event object on keydown and now the div doesn t lose the focus but i don t know why i can t insert the character

2237499
updating	updates
i have a two users tables users_v1 and users_v2 .when a user is updates with one of the v1 .app it activate a triggers updating it in users_v2 as well

2237514
webserver	nginx
in a production situation you will want your media to be served from your front end webserver apache nginx or the like to avoid extra load on the django python process

2237521
cargo	maven
what you can do from maven is what you are currently doing starting and stoping cargo during the pre-integration-test and post-integration-test phases respectively

2237523
triggers	insert
in each triggers just checked if the row you wish to insert already exists

2237534
sequences	subset
boosts concept checked libs gives you a clean way to do that but the containers checkeded classes it provides don t help you here because boost.array only supports a certain subset of the sequences requirements

2237543
annotations	mapping
i really suggest to use annotations for the mapping

2237558
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the above will work in google-chrome safari firefox

2237575
entity-framework	ado.net
linq-to-sql and ado.net entity-framework are two distinct product and they implements two separate api s that do not match meaning you can t just swap one out for the other

2237575
entity-framework	ado.net
.net 4 will also add some improvements to both more improvements slated to ado.net entity-framework

2237589
.net	wcf
since you re using .net communication between the components is probably easiest done using wcf

2237597
execute	declare
.when i declare a nsoperationqueue member in a uiview subclassing operations send to it won t execute

2237597
execute	declare
.when the queue is declare in the appdelegate however the same operations are execute

2237654
decrement	lvalue
the .post decrement operators modifies an lvalue

2237654
decrement	increment
section 5.2.6 increment and decrement

2237682
dictionary	arrays
if they are variables and you have only one arrays for each types you could use a generics dictionary of enumshipunittypes shipunit

2237692
getter	setter
i m omitted the getter and setter for ref1 and ref2

2237696
administration	account
my service is running as a user administration account and not as a localsystem account therefore i can t use the wtsqueryusertoken function

2237708
any	set
to be honest i can t think of any time you would want viewstate set to true for labels controls

2237714
subclassing	inherited
inherited from ship and create subclassing like battleship cruiser etc for the different ships

2237725
click	mouse
in google-maps if we click two time we do zoom but if we click one time and while pressed we move the mouse we move around the map

2237731
button	popup
i want to display uipickerview in the same spot where keyboard popup but the problem is that .when i do that tab bar button are above picker and only half of it is beign display

2237745
hash	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	crypt	md5	salt	md5
in your own answer you note that crypt is using the freebsd md5 which al.so does .some interesting transformation on the salt before running the hash .so the result-of what i m about to give you will never quite match up with the results of a call to md5

2237745
hash	md5
first you need something to convert the base64 with custom alphabet into a raw 16-byte md5 hash

2237751
internet-explorer	firefox
i already have a com application that works with internet-explorer but haven t been able to find something similar for an external application to work with firefox

2237758
entity-framework	nhibernate
is it possible using nhibernate or entity-framework or whatever to generator the sql necessary to insert or updates an object i ve mapped to a table

2237774
databound	gridview
you need to do this after the gridview has been databound

2237778
show	next
but that will make effect next time listview required a view to show let say after scrolling list

2237819
derived-class	base-class
in c++ base-class pointsers can points to derived-class object

2237849
derived-class	base-class
the interface required three slots the base-class provides more and the new methods of the derived-class provide two more

2237862
any	set
how do i express a set of capture that can occur in the input in any order

2237879
scheme	lisp
i learned all of them to a diffeent degree and would advise starting with scheme a lisp dialect - simply because it is easiest to learn

2237879
haskell	scheme
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life project but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2237894
margins	padding
this way the table takes up the parent div 100 and #barwrap is used to add borders margins padding to the #bar table

2237896
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the final variant which stops unnecessary data from being downloading by ie and works in ie8 firefox opera safari and google-chrome looks like this

2237905
checkbox	listbox
i have a listbox contains checkbox

2237905
contains	set
to clarify a bit i have set datacontext of the windows to customer object which among others contains observablecollection of contacttypes and i would like to bind these contacttypes to ischecked properties .so that checkbox would be properties checked

2237906
stdin	eof
i would keep reading until ctrl d was read from stdin which would represent the eof

2237909
directory	folder
i want the program to go into each one of these folder drop the sandbox chnage back to the root directory and delete all the old directory

2237909
directory	folder
also this function worked .when i had the directory deleted by the string date stored in the folder named

2237911
decimal-point	digits
decimal-point and two digits to the

2237911
decimal-point	digits
decimal-point and two digits to the

2237911
decimal-point	digits
decimal-point and four digits to the

2237931
boost-variant	boost-any
in addition to manuel s boost-variant suggestion take a look at boost-any has similar purpose as boost-variant but different tradeoffs and functionality

2237931
boost-variant	boost-any
boost-any is unbounded can hold any types while boost-variant is bounded supported typess is encode in variant types .so it can hold only value of these typess

2237978
arguments	default
for the parameter-passing aspects - all argumentss are pass-by-value by default but in the case of reference-type the arguments is a reference not the object

2237993
getchar	fgets
to read the data in use either fgets with stdin or getchar in a loops - or see if your libs has a getline

2237995
subclassing	inherited
it must be possible to convert the a b and c to a footype typically through simple inherited though i won t get into the difference between subclassing vs subtyping

2237995
value	field
you could create a class or struct c++ which has fields-for each different types of possible return and use some flag field to indicate which field is the actual returned value

2238018
emacs	vim
please spare me the post about how i don t really need to use intellisense and i should use vim or emacs

2238034
numeric	digits
if it was numeric copy its digits to the result by making them char

2238041
temporary	copy
it will automatically grab a file provided that you give emacs something like ssh yourusername yourserverhosts yourfile put it to a temporary file at your computer then copy it back to the hosts .when you save it

2238063
strtol	atoi
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

2238092
contains	elements
i have a subclassing of uitableviewcell which contains several elements - uiimageviews labels etc

2238095
strtol	atoi
strtol a more robust versioning of atoi

2238100
radtreeview	radgrid
i have a radtreeview that sits inside a radgrid

2238102
raytracing	phong
i don t make out the difference between raytracing and shading technique like phong or gouraud

2238105
scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala
2 some functional languages haskell ocaml scala f# provide nice built-in variants that are called algebraic-data-types article has good samples

2238115
put	get
what i would like to do is to join to the languages table to get the language description and put it in the language properties of the customer entity

2238117
silverlight	wpf
this is a must in silverlight and wpf

2238158
signals	sigpipe
what you can do is catch the signals sigpipe and then deal with the reconnecting by closing the fd and going back to your step 1

2238188
postgresql	mysql
i m more a mysql person but i have to do a db in postgresql and the following create-table keeps generator syntax errors.

2238216
.doc	xls
then the deliver_excel_.doc.php pull in the data from the excel .doc but does .something with headers .so the excel .doc is not caching and then output as xls .so the file will be downloading or rendering inside excel

2238231
getter	setter
once you do this write your getter setter to read write the settings in the web-config

2238231
getter	setter
the ctor opens the file from a path and the getter setter pull the data out of the returned configuration object finally it has a save methods that writes it out

2238231
show	next
you should have something like webconfigsettingsbindingsource at the bottom of the designer show in the next pic

2238241
updating	updates
we can still push out updates to the rest of the application written in c# via clickonce but updating the components install by the msi required manual intervention

2238277
uploadify	.post
should i .post the default code i got from uploadify plugin.

2238281
virtual-machine	virtualbox
you can use a virtual-machine such as virtualbox to run the malware safely

2238283
scriptaculous	jquery
will a javascript libs like prototype scriptaculous or jquery help me create a dynamic form on a webpage where i can show a different set of checkbox based on the value chosen in a combobox

2238295
uploadify	.post
pass the session_id as a .post variables with uploadify using scriptdata

2238298
postback	ajax
this wil generator a partials postback via ajax .so only the content inside my updatepanel gets updates

2238333
any	set
this change handler will get called whenever the underlying dependency properties is changed be that via the setvalue call in the properties set methods or by binding or any other means

2238337
hide	show
you can easily show hide the desired checkbox-s in onchanged event of the combo box

2238350
dynamic-dispatch	overrides
you probably expect field to be overrides like methods with dynamic-dispatch based on the runtime types of the object

2238359
base-class	inherited
although member variables are inherited from a base-class they are not invoked polymorphically i.e dynamic invocation does not apply to member variables

2238359
derived-class	base-class
.so a.s will refer to the member in the base-class and not the derived-class

2238359
protected	public
the members of a class need to be private protected not public or default depending on the business use case and you need to provide public methods to get and set the value of the member

2238421
scheme	lisp
scheme is one of the two main dialects of the programming language lisp

2238421
haskell	lisp
my first question is if someone knows xslt 2.0 very well how much of a real functional-programming language such as f# lisp or haskell does the person already know before learning f# lisp or haskell

2238421
haskell	lisp
the second question is are there parts of xslt 2.0 xpath 2.0 i should make sure i understand very well to make learning f# lisp haskell easier

2238421
haskell	lisp
third are there parts of xslt that are best ignore if one plans to eventually learn f# lisp haskell etc

2238456
defined	declare
this seems to mean that the named of the functions declare in the .h file aren t mangled even .when they re defined in the presumably mangled .c file

2238468
openssl	gnupg
since this is a file and i m guessing a reasonable small file you can use more standards and higher level libs using standardss such as ssl openssl and others or openpgp gnupg etc. to do the necessary encryption decryption

2238468
cryptography	security
for an well known historic example and a recommendation of security cryptography expert former cto and co-founder of pgp corp.

2238470
lookup	any
each giant list of components has a map to lookup the component if any exists that corresponds to an entity id

2238483
16-bit	8bit
you can assume words is a 16-bit unsigned and arrays is an 8bit byte arrays

2238492
profiling	debugging
you say there is no way to debugging can you checked sql profiling

2238518
arrays	loops
you could try converting the bitmap to a byte arrays and then loops through the bytes anding them together

2238538
echo	die
unless you re echo ing ok someplace else before the die or it s in a destructor shutdown function

2238538
shutdown	exit
shutdown functions and object destructor will always be execute even if exit is called

2238547
meta-inf	jar
basically the service jar must simply contains a text file called meta-inf service some.package.interfacename which containss a list of classes which implements the specified interface

2238548
markup	xhtml
for example embedding svg markup within an xhtml document

2238553
.when	ready
the event.complete handler that lets you know .when data is ready

2238553
.when	ready
i would initializer it .when the data is ready

2238566
export	report
the problem i have found with excel export is that even a basic report winds up merging some cell and that messes up sorting

2238568
ontouchevent	ondraw
you can create class extends view and overrides ondraw and ontouchevent methods

2238572
droppable	draggable
i get the images to come accross but don t get the draggable and droppable effects to apply to these product

2238594
logout	login
i m writing a simple auth systemd to login and logout users

2238601
order	add
in that case in your sql selected statement you can add the clause order by column_name asc where column_name is the column you want to order by

2238610
textbox	button
with the absolute positioning of my submit button .when i tab on the last textbox it jumps over the button

2238610
textbox	button
is it possible to intercept the tab event and place focus on my submit button .when my last textbox loses focus

2238611
database-table	mysql
i m using mysql s load data local infile sql statement to load data from a csv file into an existing database-table

2238620
buffering	streaming
but in my experience the easiest fastest and most flexible methods of creating a binary structure like this is to use a memorystreaming class to hold a buffering of byes then use a binarywriter around it to actually write the binary-data into the streaming

2238627
selected	button
on the add button of the add exising item dialog click the down arrow and selected add as link

2238642
subclassing	base-class
particularly inheriting from a base-class implicit creates a polymorphism relationship between that class and its subclassing

2238642
subclassing	superclass
in the majority of cases however the implementation details of a superclass subtly conflict with the requirements of a subclassing

2238642
subclassing	inherited
in these cases the implementation re-use offered by inherited is purchased with the added effort of verifying state changes and execution paths across cascading levels of code the complete flattened implementation details of the subclassing are spread between multiple classes which usually means multiple-files of which only portions apply to the subclassing in question

2238642
superclass	inherited
looking through that hierarchy is absolutely necessary .when dealing with inherited because without looking at the code of the superclass there is no way to know what un-overidden details are monkeying with your state or diverting your execution

2238683
updating	updates
the concept is simple .when updating a row copy it to the same table via an insert with the old value then updates the current row...but actually doing that i have yet to find a simpler way

2238684
hide	show
nb you can show hide views in a region by calling the activate deactivate methods on the iregion like .so

2238705
hide	show
or create it outside of the click and just show hide it on the click event

2238719
standard-library	boost
i think boost type_traits are making it into the standard-library in c++0x and in such a case it would be reasonable to expect an is_pod that actually works.

2238719
arguments	default
this uses a default boolean arguments which you probably shouldn t ever specify yourself

2238726
ubuntu	linux
it should also be cross-platform windows-xp 7 mac os x and ubuntu linux

2238735
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited
inherited is characterized by the fact that a base-class can call a methods that is overrides in a subclassing

2238746
contains	any
any advice or pointers to other sites contains a simple tutorial

2238754
rar	zip
we have found that the binary representation of floating-point value results in very poor compression rates with common compression programs zip rar 7-zip etc

2238757
any	set
running the above against any of your sample sequences you ll get 3 matches each of which will have one of its three grouping set

2238781
protected	public
access modifiers is the official term for private protected and public whereas the term access-specifier does not occur at all in the java language specifications and is afaik not something that is widely used

2238781
protected	public
access modifiers is the official term for private protected and public used in the java language specifications

2238802
highlight	cell
i m not bothered how they are highlight - be it the backround changed the fonts colour changed or just making it bold - i just want that particular cell to be different to the others

2238813
arrays	loops
then you can just loops through that one arrays

2238838
.when	ready
longer term we ll solve this by just creating a page that looks for the completed report periodically and loads it up .when it s ready

2238845
strong-typing	types
however this defeats the strong-typing of the anonymous types

2238849
key-value	key
let s say i have a multidimensional hash and in one of the subhashes i have a key-value pair which i need to retrieve by key

2238860
csv	xml
i m building a table scripting and one of the functionalities is to convert xml csv data to html and vice-versa

2238860
csv	xml
i found some similar scripting on the web that converts csv to html and vice-versa but didn t find for xml

2238873
json	xml
you will probably be querying some web-services files or databases run some local algorithms on the data gathered from different sources and produce some tabular or structured output format xml json etc

2238873
crystal-reports	jasper-reports	business-objects	crystal-reports
this allows you to plugins powerful report tools like business-objects crystal-reports jasper-reports or whatever report solution available out there and show data to your users in a better shape than a spreadsheet or a csv file

2238875
defined	declare
which will allow methoda to be declare defined but it will be optimized away if you turn optimizations on

2238903
value	field
you should not store multiple value in a single field

2238925
credentials	ntlm
you are trying to replay your local credentials in a remote session to a third location and falling foul of the ntlm double hop limitation

2238926
callback	methods
what s worked for me in multithreading wpf apps is to have the errant thread invoke a callback methods that passes the exception-handling and other info back to the ui-thread

2238930
google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

2238967
any	set
on windows set the bind address by starting jboss using run.bat -b 0.0.0.0 to allow access from any machine

2238967
linux	unix
on unix linux use run.sh -b 0.0.0.0

2238967
ip-address	hostname
in a production-environment you will want to set the bind address to an actual hostname or ip-address rather than 0.0.0.0

2238975
directory	folder
this scenario works for me my plugins directly is totally separate to my .application directory its a web .app and dynamically loaded dlls find their referenced dlls in the same folder

2238984
build-process	msbuild
i have been tasked with automating our build-process with msbuild

2238992
silverlight	wpf
i d consider going over some of the basic ria architectures like silverlight wpf flash and javafx for one idea of what can be done within a browser

2239006
derived-class	subclassing
virtual function methods is simply a function whose behavior can be overrides within a subclassing or in c++ terms a derived-class by redefining how the function works using the same signature

sftp	ssh
you want to connect via ssh or sftp which is the application layer using a methods that makes connections via ttp tls udp which is the transport layer

2241546

.so really what you want i think is to create an ssl or tls connection using the pf.sockopen function and then use that connection to pass data via the ssh sftp protocols

2241546
sftp	ssh
.so my best guess is that you set your hostname to start with ssl and then use the ssh or sftp ports as the ports .so ports 22 or ports 989

2241585
boolean	int
only scalar data boolean int float and string can be contains in constants

2241589

2241627
malloc	free
it is not a general memory manager or properly free store implementation such as malloc which might be what you are asking for

2241632
constructor	object
okay .so from what i can see constructing the class using the closure case construct new function-object for each methods defined within the constructor while the prototype assignment way creates a central function that is shared by all instances of the object

2241639
value	field
.so you want the controllers to remember the non-editable value of your domain-object not just ids but all disallowed field between request .so that it can send all the correct value to the service-layer or other business-logic

2241649
32-bit	x86
if you run this code on 32-bit windows value will be either x86 or empty

2241649
64bit	x86
on 64bit windows i assume it will be set to anything but x86

2241650
value	field
unfortunately the entity-framework simply does not support computed-properties that is to say a properties that returns a computed value rather than a reference to a backing field but it may be supported at a future date

2241653
python	java
languages like java c# and python support it

2241654

2241884
derived-class	base-class
because a copy assignment-operator is implicit declare for a class if not declare by the user a base-class copy assignment-operator is always hidden by the copy assignment-operator of a derived-class 13.5.3

2242092
g++	gcc
i much prefer using makefile s or gcc g++ than ide s like xcode or eclipse

2242094

swing	awt
there are no displayable awt or swing components

2242206
children	nodes
you can just push restored nodes onto a stack and the children to be linked to the parent would always be the topmost entries of stack

2242206
children	nodes
you would only need one pass as well as long as you recorded with each nodes which children were saved .so you knew what to pop off stack and which children to assign

2242225
key-events	keyrelease
the auto generator key-events occur at the exact same time .so it s nearly impossible that .something happens between the fake keyrelease and keypressed events

2242227

i had already rewrote and tested the original tcp client in perl .so i switched it to sctp and was able to connect although piping a file on stdin didn t completely work hung about 2 3 s of the way through receiving the echo s back

2243411
sctp	tcp
it seems like unp is implying that porting tcp applications to sctp to take advantage of multi-homing is trivial yet based this simple attempt that doesn t really seem to be the case

2243411
sctp	tcp
can anyone points me to a good tutorial or give good advice on any gotcha s to watch out for .when porting tcp apps to one-to-one-style sctp to take advantage of multi-homing

2243586
difference	datediff
or you can use datediff in mysql to get the difference

2243594
dictionary	arrays
dictionary and arrays contains pointers to object but the internal implementation of these classes is not important

2243594
dictionary	arrays
nsarrays and nsdictionary retain their members .so once you ve added an object to an arrays or dictionary you can safely release it the object won t be deallocated until the arrays itself removes the object or is deallocated itself

2243594
constructor	object
to make it easier for yourself you can use the convenience constructor which return autoreleased object

2243607

2243935
margins	padding
margins is the margins to the parent conatiner while padding just to the preceeding elements

2243958
mousedown	mouseup
it does a lot of integration with the os to do these things natively which over comes a lot of the selenium 1 issues like is it firing a click or mouseup or mousedown

2243972
derived-class	base-class
this means of course that myproperties of the types derived-class has nothing to do with myproperties of the types base-class it s a branding new properties that just happens to have the same named thus hiding the one from the base-class

2244489
executable	jar
if your jar is external to the executable someone can reverse engineer your code like a regular java application

2244489
executable	jar

2244542
credentials	security
programmatically under c# there would be a lot of pinvokes to acquire security credentials and to allow your program to swipe the file from another process using process injection to lift the process s own dead fingers off the file - which comes back to this - why would you want to do that to another process anyway

2244987
environment	building
as to your question about which environment better fosters tdd and such my two cents is that the building management systemd matters much less than what s in the building file itself

2244987
teamcity	msbuild
that means it doesn t matter if tfs is calling your msbuild file or if cruisecontrol.net is or if teamcity is

2244987

csv	xml
i d be preferring this approach over the xml or csv parsing approach

2245071

2245674
instance-variables	accessor
initially i was looking at the way pickerdata is set and thinking i wonder why you can t just assign it directly as in method_002 but then i stated thinking that i should really be using the accessor methods i defined and not setting the instance-variables directly

2245685
msbuild	nant
while msbuild 3.5 and later natively supports parallels building on the same machine nant does not its java sibling ant does however

2245826
strtol	scanf
can i still use strtol if i am no longer using scanf

2245840
callback	methods
if you are building a small application let s say you only have 10-15 different service methods in total it will probably make sense to have one single class responsible for calling your web service handling errors and making the asynch callback to the various vms

2245859
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net can create and write xls and xlsx workbooks from c# and supports conditional formats which can be used to color cell based on the value in cell

2245893
swing	gwt
from my personal experiences with web front-end prototyping gwt is awesome but that s probably just because i m used to swing programming

2245893
spring	jsf
if you ve never done any types of java programming before stick to something jsp based like struts jsf with icefaces if you want some out-of-the-box components spring stripes...i think you catch my drift

data-access	nhibernate
my project uses nhibernate for data-access spring .net for dependency-injection and rhino-mocks for unit-testing

2245930
order	add

python	php	python	c++
i m new to python w o wsgi but i have a c++ and php background

2245987
configuration	environment
i m not sure i understand you requirements entirely but for the variance of environment dev qa staging prod i would use chris o brien s configuration store feature

2246044
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
the sieve-of-eratosthenes is a classic algorithm that is pretty efficient but the sieve of atkin is one of the most advanced algorithms for finding primes

the easiest way to develop php is to upload the scripting to a webserver that has php install and then test in your browser in the same fashion that you d test an html page

2246130
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
the following test page should behave like opera safari and google-chrome

2246141
logfile	tail
i need to go to logfile and tail that

2246141
output	mode
i would ideally like to use rails.logger.info and in development mode inside the rake-task the output from logger should also be sent to console

2246147
oscommerce	magento
cubecart is quite simplistic and easy to use there s also oscommerce and magento if your looking for a more advanced e-commerce systemd

2246157
firefox	gecko
the support for that is new in gecko 1.9.3 alpha which will be include in the versioning of firefox after 3.6.x

2246185
logfile	tail
just open up a new console and tail -f the logfile it ll do the trick

2246189
grouping	sorting
then we try to recover the original grouping of colors we do this by sorting in the hsv colorspace according to the hue and value

2246193
handler	service
viewmodel s cmd s handler will fire an asynchronous request to a web service and subscribe a listener that will handle a response

2246201
virtual-machine	vmware
for instances you can setup a virtual-machine like vmware to execute the nasty code and then you can just revert the changes or boot up a fresh systemd

2246207
.net	wcf
i need to create a .net web service wcf is out of the question that should receive xml and return xml

2246210
sql-server	oracle
sql-server takes care of automagically updating the view .when there is a data change which in its opinion would change the contents of the view .so in this respect it s less flexible than oracle materialize

2246218
domain-object	repository
i have a base domain-object with a constructor dependency on a repository with a generics parameter

2246220
wait	hang
the wait time between the hang and the dialog is significant

2246224
arrays	loops
i am doing an ajax request with jquery and php what i am doing is loopsing through an arrays and producing a table each loops a new is created and an id is given to it .when they click the read me link the ajax and .some more content is returned on click read more i want the as.sociated tablerow to be removed from the table is this possible you can see my attempt .so far below

2246231
contains	elements
a valid xml document must contains a root elements

2246242

json	xml
it s automatically configure to provide xml +rest json +rest soap 1.1 1.2 endpoint for all your web-services

2246267
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
quote from scottgu himself the microsoft ajax cdn enables you to significantly improve the performance of asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc applications that use asp.net-ajax or jquery

2246279
any	set
i would imagine there aren t any environment variables set in the context of your call

2246284
git-rebase	amend
if you want to modify only the first commit you may try git-rebase and amend the commit which is similar to this .post

2246300
fault-tolerance	scalability
make your controllers stateless - this is more of a web performance scalability suggestion as opposed to micro machine level performance and a major design decision that would affect your applications future - especially in case it becomes popular or if you need some fault-tolerance for example

2246305
textbox	button
i want to be able to have my user push a button and add another instances of the second user-controls with the two textbox to my original user-controls .so that the user has 4 textbox display on the screens for the first user-controls

2246305
textbox	button
the problem i am seeing now is that .when i clone the control in jquery and then submit my page with the submit button the 2 controls have the same id and .so are combined i think by http into one asp textbox controls contains both value with a comma delimiter - 40 20

2246313
base-class	inherited
why not inherited from a non-template base-class

2246322
webforms	asp.net
what you can do however is use asp.net webforms controls and create a custom one

2246322
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
...but this is not asp.net-mvc way - it is the old asp.net webforms way

2246329
factors	primes
one of these will be the largest primes factors

2246334
worksheet	excel
i can embed the excel file using an iframe which works but i am utterly stuck .when it comes to jumping to a particular named worksheet in that document

just stay with your two directory in your project folder but join them .when creating your .war file

2246349
associations	model
updates thanks for the help till now i m using just standards linq associations and modelbinding to validation the model i hope this can help somehow

2246354
32-bit	64bit
if you only have a few different systemdd not all linux 32-bit vs 64bit perl 5.6 vs perl 5.10 etc. it is tractable to make a separate package for each systemd

2246354
configuration	installation
there is some install-time configuration in inline java including specifying the default java installation to use

2246354
configuration	environment
but this and other default configuration can always be overrides with environment variables like perl_inline_java_j2sdk see the inline java perldoc for the complete list

2246360

2246429
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript that i have works fine in ie firefox but fails in google-chrome

2246436
administration	credentials
normally if you re performing programmatic administration on a remote-server you d pass the credentials to the api

2246443
xsd	xml
.when you add an xml schema to a document like i understand that the xmlns is not actually the location of the xsd file

2246447
innodb	myisam
you can convert from myisam to innodb if you need to

2246450

2246483
json	csv
i suggested yaml vs json vs csv in the title but is there yet a better alternative

2246484
aspect-ratio	scale
addendum one advantage of affinetransformop is control over rotation interpolation scale and aspect-ratio

2246493
arrays	loops
but nested foreach loops works if you know the numbers of arrays

2246551
uitableview	uilabel	assign	add
i then assign ypos to my uilabel and add it as a subviews of self.contentview within my uitableview subclassing

2246559
xsd	xml
where my.xsd is the location of the xsd file by default relative to the xml document s location

2246577
executable-jar	uberjar
you can make a very simple project.clj file for your project with main points to your main file s namespace and then you could do lein uberjar on the command-line and it would stick all your dependencies in a single executable-jar file

2246587
implements	abstract
if i change the methods s signature to public overrides appointment read guid id then the compiler says that i ve not implements the abstract methods in the child class

2246607
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
.when i ve include quicktime links before the player that actually show to users is quite bland and across browsers really differs from what it looks like in safari google-chrome ie firefox

2246627
stderr	stdout
subp subprocess.popen python stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.pipe

2246628
profiling	debugging
run your site in release-mode not debugging mode .when in production and also during performance profiling

textbox	button
hit the page from instances of your browser windows put some test text into the textbox and hit the put to caching button

2246687
pylons	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	pylons
i ve done project now in django turbogears 1 turbogears 2 pylons and dabbled in pure zope3

2246692
implements	abstract
if that s an option for you this will also reduce in slightly less-cluttered code as you can get rid of the abstract and public keyword in the interface declaration and omit the overrides in the implements classes

2246710
python-idle	pyscripter
i ve been runnign my python-idle in a black background and now find the default white of pyscripter to be blinding

2246715
python	c++
by the way i m rather experienced in python not c++ .so this issues are really strange to me

2246728
constructor	object
by including the new constraint it ensures that any types provided .when creating the itemfactory class must have a public parameterless constructor which means you can create new object inside the class

2246732
midl	idl
we opted for an idl - midl - tlb - tlibimp _tlb.pas workflow

2246734
opera-mobile	opera-mini
i have a simple webforms targeted for opera-mini and opera-mobile

2246746
ruby-on-rails	rspec
it seems rspec controllers api for ruby-on-rails 2.x is not really using rack on the controllers call .so this is not possible to do

2246749
any	set
all of the jdk bin executable run fine on other solaris 10 systemd i have and none of them have any java_home variables set or jdk bin on the path

2246787

2246794
value	field
non-breaking spaces to a field value querying oracle server

2246806
checkbox	button
assuming your select_all button is inside the same td as the checkbox just do this

2246821
arrays	loops
int are value-type .so in each iterator of loops all that would be achieved is that s would be initializer to a value from an elements the arrays and then s overwrite by ct

2246851
click	mouse
in your case have a class defined in css to have dotted border and set it using javascript .when mouse click is detected

2246884
json	csv
without knowing more i would go with either csv for the import to excel stuff or json for the portability reason

2246891
jquery	.post
you are using jquery or any other ajax request mechanism but you want the request to be a get not a .post

2246893
any	set
i use firebug but i cannot set any breakpoints.please reveal better debuggers and eventually editor for javascript

2246907
shared-objects	.so
i m talking as a windows programmer .so i don t what really is going on on linux but judging from the named .so shared-objects are same thing like dlls

2246943
twitter	tweets
.so assuming that a twitter username has a 20 character limit and wanting to al.so capture a retweets a field to hold a full tweets would need to be a nvarchar of size 280 + 40 for the username + 8 for the initial rt before a retweets +4 for the +space after a retweets username 330

2246958
textbox	button
with acceptsreturn true the enter key will enter a newline in the textbox instead of activating the ok button click event

2246975
any	set
you can set scanner.usedelimeter d+ which will mean skip any non-digit characters and then call scanner.nextint to get next int from the string

2246982
hash	md5
.when an entry is posted into your database md5 hash the contents into another field

2246982
hash	md5
then .when you poll for an updates compare the md5 from the database to a hash of the file on the server

2246982
hash	md5
whenever i can i make the filename on the server the md5 hash .so i have to do even less server work--i just compare the filename to the db hash

2246984
implements	extends
i do not know how to implements this using regular expression and mod_rewrite but you can extends zend_controller_router_route like this and use it instead standards router

2247000
revision	svn
if you want to know the revision numbers of what this tag points to you need to use svn log which provides data in the format

2247000
revision	svn
run svn log both with and without the --stop-on-copy option and the entry beneath the last one show .when run with the option will show the revision the tag ultimately points to

2247002
managed-code	unmanaged
this technic allows access from .net c# managed-code to the unmanaged c++ code but not in the other directions

2247012
annotations	mapping
you could have each application provide it s own orm.xml file with the appropriate table mapping there and use jpa annotations for everything else

2247019
firefox	safari
this works in ie and firefox but not in safari 4 tried osx and windows versioning neither seem to work

2247019
linux	osx	firefox	safari
again this works fine in firefox and ie in windows osx and linux but in safari the samplefunction will get passed a null parameter

2247045
contains	elements
and i want to turn that into a vector with each elements contains two letters

2247055
show	next
now even though i have 10 sets in total i am only suppose to show 5 this is where the random comes in play i m supposed to make it choose between the complement and original randomely .so let s say in one set is gonna show the first complement and then ask me if my numbers is in that said i said no then the next set of numbers show this time is the original of the second set

2247063
binary-search-tree	nodes	binary-search-tree	binary-tree	binary-tree	nodes
i am trying to trace the path of a nodes in a binary-tree not a binary-search-tree

2247084
hidden	reset
.so it would seem to be possible to unhide the file open it then reset it to hidden even while you ve got it open

2247093
selected	checkbox
it seems that .when i selected my checkbox and hit submit there are no value passed on the first click but .when i click it again they appear

2247118
getter	setter	protected	public
it s certainly possible to building a workaround by buildinging own getter and setter functions and keeping a table of which properties is private public protected but it s hardly worth the effort anymore is it

2247124
ubuntu	linux
by saying tired of systemd freezes in ubuntu i do not intend to say that linux is bad

2247125
radrails	rubymine
netbeans radrails and rubymine come to mind

2247126
getter	setter
you can still write getter and setter for that variables but there is no way to make a function private in php 4

2247128
g++	gcc
to do this separation it is important to know the difference between the languages - to this end i pass .c through gcc and .cpp through g++

2247129
setcontentview	oncreate
i began by simply attempting to pass my graphics data to my glsurfaceview in my activity s oncreate methods shortly after the setcontentview methods

2247136
boost	stl
boost uses hpp extension qt uses .h extension stl do not have extension

2247154
delphi	c++
you might find this article interesting developing tcp ip-based server applications using indy components 1 it show examples in delphi but converting to c++ should be trivial

2247154
delphi	c++
besides the delphi in depth 2 book is a good resource and contains samples in c++ as well

2247179
linux	osx
i use mac osx some of my coworkers use linux and some of them use windows

2247179
shell	bash
the only thing i really required for development work is a access to a bash shell as i am used to the command-line

2247180
macvim	vim
both have vim gvim macvim

2247180
freebsd	osx
mac osx is based on freebsd which is a nix derivate

2247193
any	set
ideally i probably wouldn t care if users were able to set focus to the textbox or even edit the contents but i just wouldn t want any changes to persistent

2247198
hashtable	sorted
you could speed up some process not just during merge by maintaining a sorted list of edges both horizontal and parallels and maybe some hashtable

2247203
scala	java	erlang	prolog	erlang	scala
prolog erlang scala java ruby all of those also come up on the web

2247259
shell	bash	bash	zsh
this can be potentially handled via histignore histcontrol on bash but there are other shell in use with differing and less flexible history control zsh

2247264
global-assembly-cache	gac
2 are you using any assemblies from adp that are install in the global-assembly-cache gac

2247265
order	join
with that we join the two sequences order them by their new indic and then map back to the elements

2247273
linux	unix
i hear it is also somewhat common for unix and linux programmers to use .hh and .cc as opposed to .cpp and .h

2247276
atom-editor	nano
computing power via nano or atom-editor processor does not distinct dramatically from that on nokia n900 at least in mhz however i wonder if 256+768 virtual-memory on nokia will be enough for my work i have 3 gb now on the netbook

2247277
configuration	environment
setting a web service to accept basic-authentication depends not only on your project configuration but also on your hosting environment

2247303
virtual-method	destructor
one scenario this could happen in is if you tried to call a pure virtual-method in a destructor or constructor

2247305
code-coverage	ncover
i believe you are confusing the term code-coverage a little bit usually what is meant by it is the percentage of code that is covered by test cases automated unit tests and this can be easily determined with many tools ncover or ms test coverage in some versioning of visual-studio

2247309
udp	tcp
for udp implementation where this is not a problem or tcp dual stack sockets can save a lot of time .when ipv -enabling your systemd

2247309
linux	bsd
one must be careful to not rely entirely on dual-stack where it s not absolutely necessary as there are no shortage of reasonable platform old linux bsd windows 2003 deployed with ipv6 stack not capable of dual stack sockets

2247340
contains	any
6 variables log messages does not contains any useful information before or during the time of the crash

2247340
native-code	jvm-crash
right now i m running the test without apache just in case the jvm-crash relates to the mod_jk native-code which connect to jvm tomcat connector

2247352
apache	squid
in a situation where apache is sitting behind a reverse-proxy such as squid the cgi environment variables remote_addr gets the address of the proxy rather than the client

2247352
ip-address	proxy	contains	set
however the proxy will set a header called x-forwarded-for to contains the original ip-address of the client .so that apache can see it

2247357
contains	set
each time you encounter a character that differs from the previous one checked if the set contains it

2247364
text-editor	editor
using a text-editor or xml-file editor edit each project s .rptproj file to change the text of the project.datasources.projectitem.fullpath elements from my shared datasource.rds to .. datasource my shared datasource.rds

2247390
contains	any
for example in microsoft internet-explorer pressing ctrl+w closes the browser windows before any contains swf file dispatcher a keyboard event

2247396
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.when you think of partial-views in asp.net-mvc they re probably closer to php s include than to webforms custom-controls

2247402
overlapping	floating
how would you go about to implements a docking toolbox windows systemd as seen in expression-blend where you can dock toolbox windows in a lot of ways beneat each other overlapping as tabs or as floating top level windows

2247402
dockpanel	dock
i like how the docking behavior in the dockpanel just by defining the order of the children and the dock attached properties

2247403
rubinius	jruby
community - some people care about this some people don t but engineyard sponsors 2 full time ruby-on-rails contributors a three person jruby team and the next gen ruby viewmodel rubinius

2247438
moss	wss
the setup is i have one wss 3.0 site which connect via soap to the lists service of another wss moss site

2247438
credentials	account
with me manually specifying the domain credentials of the full access account on the server

2247438
credentials	account
to lesson the burden on the release process i would like to be able to explicit set the credentials for the service and not rely on the infrastructure official having to give his .app pool account read web service access to a remote wss instances

2247447
numeric	nan
i was thinking of using nan as a missing value in some numeric calculation code i m working on and i was hoping that using signals nan would allow me to catch a floating-point exception-handling in the cases where i don t want to proceed with missing values. conversely i would use quiet nan to allow the missing value to propagate through a computation

2247447
contains	set
for some operations i do not want to allow the vector to contains a missing value. perhaps i want to take a different course of action if a missing value is present in the set -- perhaps performing a different operation thus this is not an invalid state to be in

2247453
spring	grails
i have a several grails service that are invoked from flex code using spring blazeds integration

2247486
contains	elements
and whenever the containers was resize you would redraw the contains elements

2247490
click	mouse
have you tried using a gui debugger like ddd which will allow you to selected the thing you want to printing by click with the mouse

2247495
selected	checkbox
on the edit view for the pages controllers i want the user to be able to updates the title and body as well as selected any of the tags from the tags table in the form of a list of checkbox

2247499
export	report
.so we re trying to figure out how to run the .close and .dispose methods on the report object but we re finding that the code never gets run after the export occurs

2247506
relocation	linker
if the libs in question doesn t have a lot of position-independent code then there will be a startup cost while the dynamic linker performs relocation on the libs .when it s requested

2247511
value	field
it uses the low 4 bits of this field for the seconds for which value of 0-29 are valid and are multiplied by 2 to get the final value

2247513
header-only	boost
i can t comment on glib but keep in mind that a lot of the code in boost is header-only and given the c++ principles of the user only paying for what they re using the libs are pretty efficient

2247541
order	join
.so i want to join two tables together but for each row in the first table i only want to join it to the top 8 matching rows in the other table order by one of the columns in that table

2247571
header-only	boost
occupy more memory if it has a runtime binary most parts of boost don t required runtime binaries they re header-only

2247590
xsd	xml
the xmlns properties on the root nodes from the xml exported from ms-project does not match the xsd schema

2247604
aggregate	grouping
grouping is easy with sqlâ s aggregate

2247627
environment	building
however this may cause issues in a continuous-integration environment since a locked file would required the building to fail

2247633
createfile	drive
otherwise you have to fallback to win32 api call like createfile for drive g for example use . g as file named parameter

2247636
export	report
if you haven t already solved your problem the best way to do this would be to write an ssrs report that then export to pdf

2247639
common-lisp	lisp
practical common-lisp aims to reach experienced programmers and surely is one of the best lisp books available -- one of the few which explicit try to explain real world usage

2247641
windows-server	windows-vista
for more information see changes to the filesystems and to the storage stack to restrict direct disk access and direct volume access in windows-vista and in windows-server 2008 in the help and support knowledge base at

2247645
maven-resources-plugin	maven-antrun-plugin
that s weird and it sounds like a bug in the maven-resources-plugin because this properties is correctly interpolation during the process-resources phase as i ll demonstrate in the workaround i m suggesting below based on the maven-antrun-plugin and the replace task

2247649
hide	show
embed the header in a panels and show hide the panels depending on login status which occurs in code

2247659
logout	login
for logged in and anonymous users with appropriate login logout button user information etc

2247663
twitter	tweets
let s say i m collecting tweets from twitter based on a variety of criterion and storing these tweets in a local mysql database

2247667
value	field
etc however the id can represent one of two value 0 which means it is a new field or -1 which means it is related to the last new field

2247679
triggers	insert
i d like to set up a triggers on the aspnet_users table that insert the user_id and the user_name of the new row into another table

2247691
triggers	insert
.when you are in the context of a triggers you have access to the logical table insert which contains all the rows that have just been insert to the table

2247692
stringtokenizer	parseint
for a quick and dirty soluiton i would use stringtokenizer and try parseint catch numberformatexception

2247697
lgpl	gpl
2 algorithm should be either easy to implements myself or it should be available in libs with source code that allows static-linking with proprietary application which means that gpl lgpl viral licenses cannot be used

2247703
constructor	object
class running in a worker non-gui has object passed to it in constructor which would be used for updating gui .so i don t need to put gui stuff in a non-gui class but rather pass object for updating gui to that class

2247719
triggers	insert
you use an insert triggers - inside the triggers insert row items will be exposed as a logical table insert which has the same column layout as the table the triggers is defined on

2247719
triggers	insert
updates triggers have access to both an insert table that contains the updatess value and a deleted table that contains the value to be updatess

2247721
triggers	insert
in a sql-server triggers you have available two psdeuotables called insert and deleted

2247728
versioning	migrate
al.so i keep separate systemd directory by codeigniter versioning .so i can migrate my website independently if necessary--this central libs file would be attached to a specodeigniterfic versioning to reduce possible break

2247732
jprogressbar	progress
an example would be to pass the current progress of a process to a jprogressbar

2247745
onmousedown	onmouseup
500ms after ontouchend same as onclientclick onmousedown and onmouseup

2247751
populate	row
i read of many examples where the date is populate in one column for each entry but i haven t found any cases where the months are the column named and the year is in the row

2247755
python	c++	deployment	install
we building a mix of c++ python package and other various deployment tasks install 7z files archive etc

2247765
execution	restart
is there any way to stop the execution of the code partway save the local-variables and restart it from the same spot later

2247776
matplotlib	scipy
i don t know if it will do what you wantâ but it might be worth looking at numpy scipy matplotlib

2247830
instance-variables	nsobject	subclassing	nsobject
if you really want to add new instance-variables you will have to subclassing nsobject

2247832
any	set
the problem with it i can t set a fixed width for the link for truncation the image as the link s text would be ignore that width - any ideas

2247850
arrays	loops
i would like to see how many references are in the arrays .so that i can loops through them but i am having a hard time doing that

2247867
centering	fixed
none of the above made any difference but going into the trust centering and disabling all application add-ins fixed the problem for me

2247878
centering	fixed
try going into the trust centering and disabling all application add-ins - if that fixed it then you can work out which is going wrong by a process of elimination

2247882
updating	updates
updating a session variables for the current user should updates the session file and should not create a new session file right

2247899
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist

2247965
notepad++	jedit
load into jedit or notepad++ or some other editor that can search replace via regex

2247970
javascript	dom
the important overall points is that your choice to use yui is totally unrelated to what technologies you decide to use to building your web application .so my answer would be the same if you said it was a webapp in a different language as yui purely works on the client side at the browser level javascript css dom

2247998
buildpath	libs
i m having a problem trying to run an android .app which up until adding a second external libs to its buildpath was working fine

imagine if you defined a variables as a long but in the extern definition it was declare as a short

2248041
virtualbox	vmware
if you do find that the hosts is not actually stressed and vmware server is actually just lousy which it could well be i ve never used it on a linux platform then you might want to try one of the alternatives like virtualbox before you jump onto esxi

2248046
ruby-on-rails	django
if you were developing a web .app i would suggest a scaffold-enabled site like ruby-on-rails django or asp.net-mvc dynamic data

2248046
silverlight	wpf
if its a windows .app nothing beats the productivity and features of wpf silverlight if .so consider using ormlite a poco-driven lightweight orm providing a set of useful extension methods around the common ado.net idbconnection and idbcommand interfaces

2248136
binary-search-tree	map	binary-search-tree	tree
set is a binary-search-tree map is a self-balancing binary-search-tree such as red-black tree

2248142
variables	boolean
this uses very little extra spaces just the spaces for notfound which could be made a boolean and the index variables and should be quite fast

2248145
google-chrome	firefox
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

2248171
template-method-pattern	strategy-pattern
specifically circular dependence is a strong hint that you should use the template-method-pattern instead of the strategy-pattern

2248186

2248288
contains	set
the set 0 15 inclusive contains 16 numbers

2248289
arguments	default
if a class has more than one initializer the methods should be chaining together .so that only one of them is doing all the work and the others should simply provide default value for the missing arguments

2248289
instances	self
the docs al.so recommend checked for nil before performing any further initialization that s because if the call to returns nil self would already have been deallocated by the time the call returns .so there would no longer be an instances to initializer

2248291
designated-initializer	initializer
the designated-initializer should be well documented anyone who subclassing your code needs to know which initializer they need to call using

2248291
designated-initializer	initializer
the designated-initializer is usually the initializer with the most arguments.

2248291
designated-initializer	initializer
only invoke from within the designated-initializer all other init methods should somehow call that initializer

2248301
enumerator	any
the example above does work but only for the first enumerator not any others

2248328
put	get
if generator by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2248503
extends	super
producer extends consumer super

2248503
put	get
to clarify a little more on get put produce consume

2248598
json	xml
i do not attempt it as it relies on your server-side technology and preferences between html xml json for the ajax call returns

2248599
variables	boolean
my guess is you re getting a mysqli_result object from somewhere assign it to a boolean variables then passing that variables in to the constructor.

2248608
hide	show
.so all you need is to create an templates field with an hyperlink and use eval to show hide the icons like the example bellow

2248610
any	set
it looks like you have your custom actions set up correctly .so there shouldn t be any issue with the commit methods getting called you do have commit include in the custom actions right

2248615
configuration	environment	environment	execution
class libs don t have their own configurationuration - they pull their configuration from the execution environment

2248616

2248687
subclassing	inherited
.so given that file s owner is a myviewcontroller and as such a subclassing of uiviewcontroller supposedly inheriteding everything you get by using a uiviewcontroller from ib s palette then i should inherited all the functionality of it s superclass.

2248697
mongodb	couchdb

key-value	key
it s always a single key-value pair from the source arrays it s just giving you two different avenues of accessing the actual key and actual value

2248774
value	field
if a field has validation on djangoâ s admin site will allow entry of an empty value

2248774
boolean	int
only use for non-string field such as int boolean and dates

2248774
value	field
for both types of field you will also need to set if you wish to permit empty value in forms as the null parameter only affects database storage see blank

2248774
value	field
but you also have to set for non- string field if you really want to allow empty value in the database as no value or empty means null in the database for non-string field-for string field an empty value is just the empty string which is different from null

2248781
selection	highlight
on this site the navigation uses a javascript that highlight the selection as you mouseover them

2248807
required	checked
however it s more common practice to return an empty sequences as it doesn t required the consumer to have to checked the return-value

2248808
value	field
it means that you don t have to enter a value for the field in a form

2248808
value	field
it s different from null because might mean that .when you don t enter a value the default-value for example 0 is used but indicates that you can also store none in the field

2248825
health-monitoring	perfmon
4 monitor application restart using perfmon health-monitoring tracking in global-asax application_end etc

2248843
subtract	add	subtract	time	multiplying	subtract
the strategy to reduce loss of precision is to re-order calculations .so that you multiplying large quantities time small quantities and add subtract similiar sized quantities without changing the nature of the calculation obviously

2248857
arrays	loops
since adoor1 is an arrays i have use a foreach loops to list each item but then it will only printing the words arrays instead of the actual value of the arrays variables adoor1

2248858
webserver	security
while studying some security things there was a question that one can guess the generator of some sequences for rand timestamp running in webserver

2248970
value	field
.when the job runs will i see the value of the greeting field as it was .when the job was created or as it is .when it is execution

2248986

another option would be to edit dispform.aspx and add dataviews for other lists along with appropriate add button and add javascript to the new customer form that sets the value of a connecting lookup field

2249021
contains	elements
well an iframe elements shouldn t contains anything it s targeting another document

2249021
script-tag	iframe
.so using a script-tag inside an iframe doesn t make alot of sense

2249031
constructor	object
there are two ways of defining regular expression in javascript â one through an object constructor and one through a literals

2249066
constructor	object
where sayhello s constructor just printing hello and saygoodbye s printing goodbye and greet s main methods just creates those two object

2249066
directory	folder
in the greeter folder i was able to compile both java files but if i go to the current directory the directory that holds com and do javac -cp com.david.greeter

2249085
attributes	properties
setting the named attributes on a frame or iframe sets the named properties of the frame s global windows object to that string

2249128

2249155
xilinx	fpga
board with a small fpga xilinx spartan 3 to run your designs on

2249179
contains	elements
left part computed with takewhile contains leftmost elements not satisfying the predicates

2249179
haskell	scala
haskell programmers might use list.break or list.span to combine call to takewhile and dropwhile but i m not sure if scala has these things

2249180
finite-state-machine	dfa
a regular expression describe a dfsm deterministic finite-state-machine or dfa deterministic finite automaton

2249180
parsing	comma
basically you accept some edges conditional like repeated value split the string by comma and then parsing or you re just using the wrong tool for the job

2249191
rar	zip
self-extracting .exe files are usually archive files zip rar tar etc concatenation together with a small program that does the extraction then execute the program that was extraction from the archive

2249211
multiplication	multiplying
vector multiplication with a scalar is done by multiplying each component with the scalar.

2249215
mousemove	keydown	keydown	keyup
you can use keydown and keyup to tracking if the spaces bar is pressed or not and look at that state in your mousemove event handler

2249217
keydown	keyup
you will probably have to be watching for the keydown event checked to see that it s the spacebars set a variables saying it s down unset it .when the keyup event is seen

2249226
set-intersection	unique
note that coolly enough if the problem is generalized .so that n-1 elementss are shared and there is one unique elements in both arrays this is an o n algorithm whereas set-intersection and or union based algorithms in general are o n log n

2249232
cosine	sine
assuming this is a 2d game you should then use sine cosine to break the total distance up into the x and y components for a given angle

2249247
jruby	mri
similar to this question except in jruby it works in mri ruby

2249259
printf	atof
but frankly if you re using standards c libs libc atof and printf i don t see why not using fabs is desirable

2249273
cos	exp	cos	pow	exp	pow
math libs functions like cos exp and pow involving logs

2249289
culture	locale

i think the best way to handle this is to unpivot it first then handle the correct pivot level second

2249299
order	add
if you add a column that formats the date exactly how you like then you can order by the mo column but use the new expression as the column labels

2249307
value	field
add javascript to set form field to initial value

2249353
worksheet	excel
the best illustration of this is the excel renderinging - the excel renderinging renderinging the entire report onto a single worksheet in most cases for report with groupinging and page break set on the grouping footer it will rendering each grouping on its own worksheet

2249353
worksheet	excel
you wouldn t want the excel rendering to artificially create worksheet to try to paginate your report

2249353
attributes	properties
the web rendering page length is determined by the interactiveheight attributes of the report in the interactivesize properties in the properties panels for the report but the interactive height is an approximation rather than a fixed page break setting and your page break may still not conform to the printing versioning even though the interactiveheight is set to the same length as your target page length

2249382
widget	button
for example maybe i don t want the process widget button to be enabled unless the user currently has a widget project open in the application

2249382
widget	button
or the cancel process button only becomes enabled .when the widget process is running

click	mouse
as a last resort i guess i could run something that simulates the mouse click for me

2249560
linux	unix
chances are your file is on a linux unix machine where a directory can be named with a

2249574
callback	methods
.when you start the request the object will spawn a new thread and only updates your main one via the callback delegation methods

2249589
silverlight	wpf
it is a sweet upgrade especially if you are working with wpf silverlight or asp.net-mvc

2249594
delphi	c++
i ve used it in a c++ program before and it looks like it has an api for delphi too

2249617

but for this specific tab i have a uisegmentedcontrol in the navigation bar that switches between two different uitableview

2249621
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
going from ruby-on-rails to asp.net-mvc is an obvious first choice avoid the asp.net webforms side initially as the culture shock of drag-n-drop controls with viewstates and a little magic may be a bit much to start with

in the actual html there will be a field called productid_d and even though it may have the value you want if you access it from the crmform.all collections just use the attributes named

2249663
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
in my .app i try to use the ttphotoview .so in a viewcontroller i push the ttphotoview with my navigationcontroller like this

2249667
constructor	object
the difference is mainly that in your second example you are using the function expression as a constructor the new-operator will cause the function to be automatically execute and the this value inside that function will refer to a newly created object

2249667
private-members	object
privileged methods can also be used in your second example a common pattern is use an immediately invoked function expression creating a closure where the private-members are accessible then you can return an object that contains your public api

2249693
contains	elements
how to count the total numbers of div elements that are contains in another div using javascript

2249699
traversal	parent
i prefer not to use the visualtreehelper as you have to traversal through each parent child item individually

i would like to get a grid s actual width or height and display it in a textbox but the width height should be live .when i resize the windows i would like to see the new sizes

2252025
json	xml
rather you should keep the schema in versioning-control and if you need to keep data too serialization it to xml json yaml... and versioning that too

2252049
directory	folder
if you place an alias to the directory in your domain folder and apache is configure to follow alias you should be fine

2252113
any	set
-- bool owner_events .when i set it to true i got events only .when i was inside the windows but worse .when i set it to false i didn t get any events - .so i set it to true the better option -

2252113
any	set
and now .when i run it on linux it although grabs the pointers and .when i click somewhere outside the windows it doesn t react thus my windows stays always at the top which is what i want but the problem is that that the application doesn t catch any events or catches it only .when i am inside the windows .when i set owner_events to true

2252129
any	set
now how do i actually set any item to this state

2252131
updating	updates
if you have the same field in multiple tables contains the same information you have a denormalization schema which may be good for performance but required you to make extra effort to manually updates all copies of a field .when updating it

2252148
relational-database	schema
how can i implements a large relational-database schema on a key-value-store

2252175

with this function you can only work with strings because if the user insert a numbers as arguments the length properties is undefined because the numbers object doesn t have that properties .so you must cast the variables

2252256
checkbox	button
how to place an error messages for a grouping of checkbox an grouping of radio button

2252270
youtube	vimeo
unless this is for fun experience just use youtube vimeo insertexistingvideohostingsitehere

2252270
video-encoding	flv
there are many video-encoding streaming techniques available but a good start would be to to look at encoding video using the flash-video encoder to encode to the flv format and then flash itself to play the flv files flash has many built-in player controls etc

2252272
dictionary	arrays
what about tuples lists strings bytes arrays dictionary and all the other built-in types in python

2252293
keyboard	mouse
this class is a movable popuppanels and has a constructor arguments to create it as non modal meaning if set to non modal mouse keyboard events outside the panels are not ignore but passed to the underlying widget

2252301
selected	button
i have a website and want to display search results dynamically meaning that as the user interacts with controls and selected options the search results are populate in realtime - the user doesnt need to click the search button

2252302
groovy	java
the proxy class is not actually of the myjavaclass types but is a proxy and groovy s duck-typing can handle that while java cannot

2252310
display	width
keep in mind that in html you don t have below or above tags elementss to achieve that you either use a display block css properties with no width specified .so the elements takes all the available spaces or include a linebreak at the beginning of string you are insert

2252341
logout	login
sessions are normally lost .when you logout of a web .app .so it s expected to get a new one .when you login again

2252341

fancybox looks nice uses jquery and is highly configurable with various show hide effects

2252359
maven-antrun-plugin	maven-plugin
i understand how to run single maven-plugin goals for example mvn maven-antrun-plugin run

2252363
temporary	copy
15.2.4 the memory for the temporary copy of the exception-handling being throw is

2252377
contains	set	contains	elements
it isn t contains in a list or set elements

2252377
hashtable	set
elsewhere where it does show a java object that uses a collections a set implements as a hashtable in the example it has a mapping file that looks like this

2252378

i have defined an objective-c protocols that declare a methods that is tagged with ibaction

2252379
for-loop	arrays
is there a methods for declare and use an arrays in a for-loop like this

2252382
64bit	x86
it there a different syntax which would allow the x86 to read the 64bit registry

2252400

going back to unix days and still in linux windows etc etc you program does not just run alone - it gets called from somewhere another program the shell bash etc dos prompt etc and they might want to know if it succeeded or not.

2252401
parsing	comma
it is much easier to just pass an nvarchar that is really a list that is comma delimited and then parsing it .when you get into the stored proc and insert the value into a temp table

2252425
contains	any
i need a scripting that could ran and pull information from any drive on a windows operating systemd server 2003 listing all files and folder which contains the following field

2252429
void	main
the return-type of main must be int not void

2252431
callback	methods
you could use the callback methods onselected which usually takes place .when the nodes is click even though you can also selected it by scripting

2252433
selected	listbox
either add a class and selected that or id listbox to find the id that contains the id you specified

2252442
defined	declare
your first example doesn t defined main it just declare it hence the linker-error

2252448
submitchanges	datacontext
be sure to call submitchanges on your datacontext -derived class

2252452
getter	setter
both getter and setter functions are guarded with locks

2252457
constructor	object	initializer	setter
it s very easy to write unit tests for your code because it depends on nothing else than the object it accepts in its constructor setter and you can easily initializer them with the right object in isolation

2252495
attributes	properties
to serialization the object in an attributes of the control you have to defined an appropriate typesconverter and apply a typesconverterattributes to the properties types

2252497
getter	setter
but if it is just an int and you are sure that int is an atomicity types the processor will not have to do two separate memory reads to load the int into a register and you have benchmarking the performance and determined you need better performance then you may consider dropping the lock from both the getter and the setter

2252497
getter	setter
if you need to do something like that the mutex protection has to be outside the setter getter functions

2252503
entity-framework	ado.net
either use an orm like linq-to-sql or ado.net entity-framework or strongly-typed dataset

2252510
iframe	popup
i am trying to popup an iframe from a bookmark whose contents are from my test .app

2252513
callback	methods
if i use a sleep methods commented in the code as below the callback gets execute on subsequent call also

2252545
sql-server	oracle
also the test code is redistributable without the requirement of someone else to be running an instances of oracle sql-server etc

2252550
value	field
the last_modified field is updates automatically every time the row is modified using any technique supported by your dbms. if the is_deleted bit flag is true then the last_modified value implies the time .when the row was deleted

2252558
google-chrome	safari
it should work fine in safari and google-chrome out of the box

2252564
json	xml
you can use manage.py s loaddata function to load data in a appropriate format json xml yaml ...

2252573
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

2252573
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

2252585
direct2d	direct3d
if your going for graphics eg for a game rather than a fully functional gui thing you might also look at things like direct2d direct3d opengl sdl etc

2252601
callback	methods
.when supplying a callback to the attr methods the first parameter is the index and the second parameter is the original attributes value

2252601
callback	methods
don t get this methods confused with the new batch-file of methodss that accept callback introduced in jquery 1.4

2252604
getter	setter
a classic example is one of coordinates - if you have a coordinate represented via cartesian-coordinates and switching the internal representation to polar if you used getter and setter your program would still work even though the x and y field are gone

2252611
macros	vba
see sum an hours and minutes time column in excel for a vba macros that almost does that

2252617
getter	setter
if you make a field private and set up a getter and a setter to access it then all other code has to go through those methods to get at that data

2252617
initializer	getter
you can initializer the object only .when needed .when the getter is first called

2252617
getter	setter
you get these same benefits within the class too if you strictly use the getter and setter to access the field

2252617
getter	setter
getter and setter initially don t look .so great because they seem like a lot of extra typing

2252617
getter	setter
but ides like eclipse can automatically make getter and setter for you if you like

2252617
getter	setter
c# can wrap getter and setter in properties which are used in code just like field but under the hood it call the getter and setter that you write

2252617
getter	setter
.so there are a lot of rea.sons to use getter and setter and many facilities to make it less painful

2252623
inspector	webkit
webkit inspector

2252627
double-quotes	single-quotes
to use associativity arrays in the double-quotes skip the single-quotes

2252628

2252633
python	ruby
there are parsing like beautifulsoup in python hpricot in ruby libxml2.

2252635
exception-handling	error-handling
needless to say you may substitute the exception-handling for any error-handling methods of your choosing

2252656
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
oracle postgresql and mysql have it

2252661
python	java	python	c++
in python each member function methods of a class should have a variables called self which is pretty much the this-pointer reference in c++ java c#

2252665
required	checked
file_exists would work with checked if the required file exists .when it is relative to the current working directory as it works fine with relative paths

2252670
highlight	selected
i am trying to get itunes to selected a particular tracking in the music libs list highlight one particular line and only that line

2252670
switching	screens
i thought it would a switching to the music libs screens in itunes if itunes was at a different screens such as an album detail screens in the itunes-store b scroll the music tracking list display to bring the given item into view and c highlight the given tracking line in the list

2252722
any	set
this doesn t sound like a problem with spring-dm rather you have set yourself up for this deadlock a depends on b b depends on a thus no-one can get any work done

2252740
value	field
i was thinking there might be a way to grab field value and put them in attributes .so .something like this

2252743
callback	methods
i have a fairly nasty workaround - i can overrides the tag_ids methods in my model to instead populate an instances variables and actually save the related model in a before_save callback

2252766
attributes	properties
with the new asp.net-mvc-2-validation features we can decorator the properties of our domain model object with data-annotations attributes that describe criterion for valid value

2252767
windows-vista	windows-xp
i am trying to create a single executable of a simple win32 application that has to be able to run on both windows-xp and windows-vista 2008

2252778
google-chrome	firefox
my page has no external resources and everything is being served from the same server using http firefox and google-chrome is not complaining it and only ie6 and ie7 are complaining

2252787
printf	scanf	cout	cin
the one i would use is switching to using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout

2252789
implements	abstract
i m trying to create an abstract-class defining an abstract methods that is to be derived from other classes that implements some specific behavior in the abstract methods

2252793
priority-queue	heap
any clean implementation of a double ended priority-queue would also be of interest as an alternative however this question is mainly about a minmax heap implementation

2252831
any	set
failing that create your own textbox class that listens to the keyup event and intercepts the key press if the readonly or locked properties is set to true preventing it being added to the text. then you can use any styles you like

2252857
value	field
maybe i can use another methods to store these value like input hidden field or caching

2252894
getter	setter
edit as requested the getter and setter code

2252908
defined	declare
if your function is called from the same translation unit as where it s defined which static functions are obviously required to be compilers can already easily inline such call whether the function is declare static or not

2252914
getter	setter
is there a way to generator all getter and setter in an entire package in eclipse

2252927
any	set
are there any gem or plugins that offer a nested set but with a weight also

2252927
nested	order
i want to be able to create a nested set and order each subset by its weight

2252931
asp.net-mvc	webforms
for webforms or asp.net-mvc

2252937
entity-framework	nhibernate
i ve never used nhibernate but if it s anything like entity-framework it will have a problem if you compose a query expression against pocos which weren t generator by the framework

2252949
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop walks through the grouping arrays until returns a falsely value

2252951
set	bag
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and required fewer database columns

2252984
webforms	asp.net
for webforms the standards validation provide a good base if you use jquery you can replicate the asp.net validation checked quite easily and react accordingly ie replace and provide better feedback to the user than the validation summary control

2253021
any	set
ideally i d like to set the format during the .save but can t find any information on this

2253030
expression	evaluation
another approach that i thought of is to search all ancestry of the context nodes to discover which prefix namespace combinations are in effect for that nodes prior to evaluation my xpath expression and i think this would work if i can guarantee that all xpath expression are execute serially and not in parallels

2253040
postgresql	mysql
commonly supported in the order by clause some databases mysql 3.23+ postgresql 8.0+ support the syntax for the grouping by clause as well

2253051
deployment	install
i am attempting to install a c# windows service project using a visualstudio.net deployment project

2253051
deployment	install
to run the deployment project i right-click and selected install from the context menu the install wizard runs and eventually prompt me with a set service login dialog which asks for username passwd

2253087
versioning	downgrade
i downgrade to vss client versioning 6.0 from the 2005 8.0 versioning and unlike 8.0 it identifies the actual file named in the filesystems it was trying to access .when an error occurs

2253095
mouseleave	mouseenter
does anyone know how to open close a dojo dropdown menu with the mouseenter mouseleave events

2253098
activation	account
i m using authlogic to generator a perishable token and send it on to the user for activation of his account and send the mail later in a delayed-job

2253157
calayer	uiview
use hittest to dispatcher touches you receive on you uiview to the calayer instances that needs to receive it

2253157
uiresponder	uiview
if you need more of the uiresponder behavior touchesbegan etc. you might want to go with subviews instead of sublayers as that would allow you to handle the events directly in the object rather than having to dispatcher them from a central responder your main uiview

2253158
google-chrome	opera
opera and google-chrome don t seem to have the memory leak but google-chrome doesn t rendering the controls right either

2253171
groovy	java
i have been checked out groovy a bit and i feel that moving a java program to groovy little by little -- grabbing a class and making it a groovy class then converting the methods guts a bit at a time -- might be a relatively sane way to take advantage of some of the groovy language-features

2253171
groovy	java
what kinds of things would you not do in groovy but prefer java instead

2253194
order	add
as you can see i have tried to make user to iuser order to work .when i want to add data but without success

2253211
derived-class	base-class
you could create a standards base-class with this information and operators to do the runtime inspector on that base-class then any derived-class would inform the base-class of its place in the class hierarchy and any instances of those classes would be runtime-castable via your operations

2253256
groovy	java
in the java language but groovy is

2253256
groovy	java
are required in java .so groovy code

2253256
groovy	java
groovy learning curve for java

2253274
digits	short
note that a byte is two hex digits .so a 16-bit short has a total of 4 hex digits

2253284
unsigned	short
c++ makes no guarantee as to the numbers of bytes in an unsigned short int

2253305
stderr	stdout
it s seldom that you have code from multiple threads writing to stdout stderr at the same time .so it s not usually an issue

2253314
groovy	java
for example in groovy call the equals methods but in java it checked whether 2 references refer to the same object

2253314
groovy	java
a final example is that .when an overloaded methods is called groovy uses the runtime types of the parameters .when choosing which methods to invoke whereas java uses the compile-time parameter typess

2253314
groovy	java
what kinds of things would you not do in groovy but prefer java instead

2253314
groovy	java
i write everything in groovy because i m much more productive with groovy than java and i enjoy groovy programming a lot more

2253314
groovy	java
there may also be socio-political reasons to use java some code needs to be maintained by many people some of which don t know groovy and don t want to learn it

2253317
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i ve been programming c++ for 20 years but i m new to objective-c and coco and have some questions about the performance of nsmutablearray and nsarray

2253319
put	get
note also that if you don t put the right after the l you will get a spaces after every line

2253335
background-image	transparency
in this case you create a transparency png one that has an alpha-transparency of 0 .so that everything will show through it to the dimension of your first image then assign the background-image styles of the png which we will call clear.png here and give an id of clear01 to the .source url of the #link-test-img

2253357
triggers	insert
is it possible to do this via postgresql rules or should i simply do the 2nd insert into lastlogin myself or use a row triggers

2253360
value	field
the value is entered using a textbox and the generator sql trys to insert-into this field if no value is given

2253372
server-side-includes	include
how can i use the server-side-includes module in iis to include and process a coldfusion file from a .htm file

2253406
contains	any
the result-of a left outer-join as in your example will contains all recordinging of the left categorytable even if the join-condition does not find any matching recording in the right usermenutable

2253406
right-join	union
as a1ex07 suggested in another answer it may look like you need a full-outer-join which in mysql can be emulated with a union between a left join and a right-join

2253431
right-join	union
i think you need full join mysql doesn t have that syntax but you can achieve desired result by union + left + right-join

2253441
jtextfield	jlabel
i want the jlabel and jtextfield to use their normals height and the jscrollpane to use the rest

2253450
any	set
the client has a set of links that need to open in a pop-up windows - if you click on any of the links it should reuse the same pop-up windows

2253454
exception-handling	error-handling
sqlexception-handling seams to be a broader error-handling mechanism that may suit my needs but i wonder if this is somewhat analogous to catching exception-handling in c# with respect to the potential to catch things that i really shouldn t

2253465
organization	naming
obviously the overall complexity of the site but also things like naming semantics css performance css file organization and testability acceptability

2253470
jtextfield	jlabel
put the jlabel and jtextfield in that vertically

2253475
subclassing	base-class
i have come up with the following an abstract discount base-class with subclassing making up the concrete discounts

2253483
any	set
which is working flawlessly however as far as i can tell it doesn t give me any way to set id s for these new stylesheets which is causing the stylesheet to be loaded multiple time as the user navigates around the site

2253486
contains	any
the foundation collections classes like nsmutablearray aren t guaranteed to use any specific implementation and in fact i believe they will actually change their data structure to optimize speed for the numbers of items they contains

2253488
order	add
i ll add that i prefer to have the map namedd this way because key and value appear in that order in the named

2253488
put	get	key-value	key
you put key-value or get key that gives a value

2253510
antivirus	security
it turned out that the issue was with an aggressive antivirus program and he had checked the option to secure my privacy part of that security was to delete new cookies

2253516
hardware	monitor
the windows sdk osd sample is a much simpler example of monitor the hardware volume than the one i .posted on the blog you don t need all the metering junk in that .post

2253522
onbeforeunload	onload
in ie i get notified in flash with the onload messages but not onbeforeunload

2253532
dictionary	arrays
i don t specify this .so i wonder what would happen if there were more than one dictionary or maybe a dictionary and a mutable arrays

2253532
dictionary	arrays
since data updates and insert are written to the db from the dictionary s arrays .when the .app closes this means that the new item really was added to one of the arrays

2253540
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
if you go to the work section of my site the pager i used a background gif for the a and active state function works in safari google-chrome firefox and opera but disappears in internet-explorer

2253551
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
however my preferences would be to throw a runtimeexception illegalstateexception if the accessor is called but the data has not yet been lazily loaded

2253555
python	c++
i d like to know if it is possible to use ctypes to access c++ dlls from python and run functions or class methods from them.if not is there another way to do this

2253558
http	ssl
i currently have a webhttp binding wcf restful service it works great over http i can make .post of large sizes due to my web-config settings now i am trying to use it over http ssl now my gets work fine but my .post dont it doesnt work .when the file size is over a certain amount i was wondering why this could be since my web-config specifies a larger size and it works good over http here is my relevant web-config

2253602
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
it doesn t have the magic functions of cakephp ruby-on-rails but it automatically comes with a good asp.net-mvc setup and a good basic libs for forms activerecord implementation dealing with postdata sanitization and other nice things that i just don t prefer to deal with every project

2253605
value	field
in javascript intercept the form submission populate a second form with only hidden field with the value you want and submit that form instead

2253618
contains	any
one for the silverlight clients clientsettings one for server-side settings only serversettings and one that contains any shared settings commonsettings

2253619
value	field
if you want the value of the image field retrieve it on a case-by-case basis

2253627
directory	folder
now create a grouping in xcode for every of those folder and drag each of the new settings.bundle directory to the corresponding grouping

2253637
any	set
i ve been trying to return data from a table after already having accessed two before it but in this case it get s into the while statement but does not assign any value as everything is set to null

otherwise you might as well use the easy scrolledtext widget from tkinter.scrolledtext and skip the horizontal scrollbar

2253645
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt	pygtk	pyqt
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standards is a nice feature

2253646
private-members	constructor
private-members at the top of the class constructor next etc

2253650
constructor	object
one obvious exception-handling is a constructor that aggregate a numbers of other items into an object an address object that takes a street named numbers city country postal-code etc. as input

2253650
default-value	default
given c++ s default parameter capability it s generally best to sort in ascending order of likelihood to use a default-value

2253650
javadoc	doxygen
while you do have something of a points my experience still indicates that documentation produced with doxygen and similar such as javadoc is almost universally useless

2253664
put	get
using a hash would just make you put the addresses in buckets in my opinion and then you d get to the right bucket quickly and then have to search through the bucket

2253682
directory	folder
i already include the aspnet_client folder in my virtual directory in iis

2253689
row	col
multiplying the value in each row col diagonal

2253718
contains	elements
the allchoices function takes a list of lists and returns each possible list contains a single elements from each

2253721
python	c++
the file-format it uses for export is xbel an xml based format which was originally designed for a python bookmarks management program and which you might probably be able to use in your c++ program

2253721
export	csv
or if it s a one shot program you can try sqlite browser to open such a file and export the tables to csv

2253794
zend-framework	kohana
well personally i have tried symphony zend-framework and kohana

2253803
for-loop	arrays
inside this right_container_mc i have other other movieclip called execisebox that get added in the correct positioning on the stage from an arrays with a for-loop

2253803
arrays	loops
what i want to do is .when this close_btn is click remove the specific exercisebox movieclip from the arrays and from the stage then loops through the arrays again .so all of the exercise box movieclip updates their positioning on the stage

2253803
arrays	loops
also is should i be removing all of the current instances of the exercisebox movieclip before the arrays loops runs each time

2253809
postorder	inorder
we know that the last elements in postorder is the root .so we locate the root at the inorder sequences and subdivide like this

2253809
python	java	python	c++
c java c++ or python .

2253811
versioning	upgrade
.when people upgrade from the free versioning to the paid versioning i d like the free database to be copy-paste to the pro database location

2253812
jquery-slider	slider
is it possible to just use sizzle 4kb + the jquery-slider 4kb control to have a working slider without the need for jquery core 29kb

2253823
jquery-plugins	jquery
unfortunately most jquery-plugins like slider will need jquery core itself

2253854
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the following works in google-chrome 4.0 firefox 3.5.7 safari 4.0.4 ie 7 and ie 8

2253875
vb.net	vb6
i am having problems .when using a vb.net dll in a vb6 program

2253902
any	set
are there any drawbacks if you use setlayout null for say jframe and use setbounds methods to set the positioning of components in that jframe

2253907
compatibility	platform
.when doing a modal popup using jquery.fancybox-1.2.6.js it works on every platform i have tried except ie8 .when set to compatibility mode

2253913
filtering	sorting
it seems storing the derived status for the main item would be wrong but sorting and filtering for this information can be troublesome as well

2253931
jquery-plugins	jquery
what is better to use jquery user-interface widget or jquery-plugins for similar things

2253982
display	height
i increased the height of the row.still 3 words are display in my cell.how summary should fit properly inside the cell and full content should be display.please help me out.thanks

2253986
32-bit	16-bit
one way to do it would be to use a 32-bit int for the id doling out a 16-bit block at a time

2254007
xsd	xml
if you control the definition of the xml i.e the xsd than actually writing classes that represent xml is a good idea these are called dto s

2254007
xsd	xml
alternatively if there is no xsd available then i recommend you take a look at xlinq for another easy way to parsing the xml

2254015
python	perl
personally if it s logfile manipulation i d use perl or python

2254015
perl	awk	python	perl
if the change some recording is simple enough you can probably combine the first two step into a perl python awk or even sed pipe

2254018
strncpy	strcpy
you d better use strcpy or strncpy if you are not absolutely sure what are you doing by using shared-memory

2254047
attributes	properties
coredata at this time does not support uniqueness of attributes and i can t use objectid properties to ensure this kind of thing

2254057
temporary	copy
what this will do is create a temporary vector which is a copy of the original vector but with the minimum necessary capacity and then swap the internal buffering of the two vectors

2254057
temporary	copy
now because creating that temporary copy is a relatively expensive operation it takes a lot more processor time than normals reads insert deletions you don t want to do it every time you erase an elements

2254071
put	get
i am not sure about iis6 but i created a new website in iis7 i could not get things to work under a virtual directory but that is probably my lack of iis knowledge i put my .svc file in the root directory and in service

2254077
.when	ready
it would have to be execute at the bottom of the page or on a page-load ready event to ensure the target existed .when it was first called

2254092
uibinder	gwt
in gwt + uibinder you can catch click like this

2254095
associations	model
if you want to do an easy associations without passing a raw pointers put the shared-memory in a containers and pass the id value for that containers elements into the model index

2254098
google-chrome	safari
i tested in ie5.5 6 7 8 ff3.6 google-chrome 4.0.249.89 and safari 4.0.4 on windows-xp

2254102
implements	extends
am i forced to use and or extends implements the zend_db methods interfaces inorder to have zend_auth integrated in a website web application

2254115
value	field
the reasoning is that as you suggest in your question only approximately 10 of your customers need these updates and therefore approximately 90 of the recording from the customers table will have a field always contains a null value if you do it as an additional field on the same customers table

2254130
value	field
i ve seen approach #1 grow out of control - with each new configurationuration value being added as a new field to the points where each user has many empty configuration value that apply to only a handful of the population

2254138
boolean	int
int works just fine as a boolean types

2254140
32-bit	64bit
with the 64bit versioning of office there s now a 64bit versioning of ace .so jet ace can now be used in 64bit applications without needing to compile as 32-bit only

2254143
directory	folder
is there any way to click on something that adds whole project to scm subversion and also makes it a working directory by adding .svn folder

2254143
directory	folder
any way to click on something that adds whole project to scm subersion and also makes it a working directory by adding .svn folder

2254144
traffic	packets
due to network congestion traffic load balancing or other unpredictable network behavior ip packets can be

2254158
dsa	rsa
rsa or dsa key .so it returns either

2254205
entity-framework	ado.net
recently i started porting ado.net .app to entity-framework

2254206
firefox	gecko
this is how mootools detection gecko firefox engine i m paraphrasing slightly

2254217
entitymanager	entities
as ruggs said if you are managing the entitymanager lifecycle yourself as opposed to having cmp containers managed persistent done by a j2ee then you need to close the entitymanager yourself or at least call entitymanager.clear to detach entities

2254217
entitymanager	entities
all the entities that load persistent through an entitymanager stay in memory until you explicit detach the entities from it via entitymanager.detach or entitymanager.clear or entitymanager.close

2254217
entitymanager	entities
if you persistent 1000000 entities via the same entitymanager without detaching them after you will get a out-of-memory doesn t matter if you persistent each entity in it s own entitytransaction

2254220
hash	md5
what is the best way to generator an md5 or any other hash of a multi-dimensional arrays

2254220
arrays	loops
i could easily write a loops which would traversal through each level of the arrays concatenation each value into a string and simply performing the md5 on the string

2254222
32-bit	64bit
what are the points that should be kept in mind while writing code that should be portable on both 32-bit and 64bit machines

2254227
expression	brackets
all you need to do is add a + after your brackets expression to eliminate runs of multiple underscore.js

2254233
value	field
lots of field have null value in the majority of cases but that doesn t mean you should necessarily create a second table to hold them

2254244
32-bit	64bit
things get murkier .when you have some components which are 32-bit and some 64bit

2254251
execute	prepare
i use a prepare statement and then execute it with parameters

2254253
pointers	stack
pushing pointers onto stack takes up twice as much spaces

2254253
32-bit	64bit
stack size may not change between os versioning though causing code that runs fine in 32-bit to mysteriously fail .when compiled and run unchanged on 64bit

2254274
populate	row
one puzzling aspects is that it uses objectatindex row to access an item even though the whole user-interface needs populating all the rows does this then mean that this gets called for each row seems funny that it does not take a nsarray nd populate the picker user-interface in one shot

2254278
silverlight	wpf
i am creating an iron ruby project that needs to support several environment more specifically wpf silverlight and winforms - but that s not as important

2254291
debian	rpm
if not on debian use alien to convert to rpm

2254303
boost	stl
most implementation of the stl and most of boost of course takes advantage of this to the fullest

2254335
connection-pooling	pool
i was thinking of connection-pooling but understand that the connection is made from a pool keyed on user named and passwd .so it shouldn t confuse users

2254345
include	ssi
you can t use ssi to include a cfm files into a static htm file

2254368
scala	java
i know a lot of java people have started looking at scala since it runs on the jvm and a lot of people in the microsoft world are looking at f# but what does ruby have as a natural functional successor

2254369
configuration	environment
just some extra info on .net environment based configuration files without using your above implementation specifically

2254384
contains	set	contains	elements
partials .solution set a contains div to contenteditable false then true again on an inner elements like .so

2254404
derived-class	base-class
loosely speaking liskov substitution principles states that a derived-class can be substitute in-place of the base-class without affecting the user

2254404
abstract-class	base-class	abstract-class	derived-class	base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
in the case-when the base-class is an abstract-class which means no user is using an instances of the base-class does the liskov inherited restrictions still apply to the derived-class

2254416
shell	bash
the difference between the two cases is that bash -i does not give you a login shell but just running ssh does

2254416
shell	bash
you can man bash for details of what a login shell is but the main thing is that it runs etc .profile and your .bash_.profile

2254419
scala	java
java people are using a language on the jvm and want a more functional one compatible with their runtime .so they go to scala

2254419
rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	jruby	mri
ruby people are using a language that s already pretty functional and they re using it on a numbers of underlying runtime jruby ironruby mri macruby rubinius etc...

2254451
getter	setter
second if you want to add any custom logic to your getter and setter you have no choice

2254457
primitive	int
in java int is a primitive types and it is not considered an object

2254457
primitive	int
this behavior is different from some more purely object oriented languages like ruby where even primitive things like int are considered object

2254462
getter	setter
c# 2.0 does not support this and required the private variables with the explicit getter and setter

2254462
getter	setter
therefore a lot of older code or backwards compatible code will use the explicit getter and setter

2254464
python	java	python	c++
if you don t have the luxury of using an object-oriented programming language like c++ java c# python etc. both colin s and nick d s answers might help although i d try to have the switching statement in one place say one big game_update function to allow adding new states by making a change in one place

2254472
derived-class	base-class
in fact this is one primary rea.son why you would want to have an abstract-base-class for a collections of classes that have .some common behavior -- .so you can defined operations in terms of the base-class interface and not care about which derived-class that you are actually operating on

2254473
python	ruby
i would use a different programming language since python has already been mentioned i would add ruby it is great at this kind of jobs also

2254481
backslash	regex
but .when you transcribe the regex into a java c# string you would have to double them as you would be performing two escapes first escaping the backslash from java c# string mechanism and then second for the actual regex character escape mechanism

2254496
contains	set
.so i added a jframe to contains all of them and although i set its setresizable

2254501
entity-framework	nhibernate
ritesh rao implements it over nhibernate entity-framework and linq-to-sql in his ncommon framework

2254550
binary-tree	tree
a simple case is to make an order binary-tree red-black tree avr tree etc. indexed by the starting address .so that insert allocation removal deallocation and searching are all o log n

2254563
selected	cell
for example if you see code generator by the macros that looks like activesheet.range c2 selecteded you might ask i see how to selected a single cell

2254573
any	set
.when trying to set usedefaultwebproxy to true it still won t use any credentials

2254576
revision	updates
updates will updates your checked out versioning to the latest versioning or a specified other revision in repository

2254590
udp	tcp
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp

2254607
versioning	upgrade
due to complicated office policy reasons i must not upgrade or modify my versioning of ajaxcontroltoolkit but for anyone else who has this error it was apparently fixed as of last june

2254621
.when	ready
in the multi-tenant model you can set up mirroring for just their database and then switching the primary .when you re ready

2254622
contains	any
but this still returns me back farma because it contains a goat but i don t want it to return back any farms that have pigs

2254627
directory	folder
is there a program that i can use to compare two folder and have it mark which files are modified and export those files to a new directory

2254680
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
al.so though this isn t mentioned above i d suspect that there s .some level of dynamic-sql involved in the applications that use this many database model because you ve got to switching between databases based on .something you know .so it can t be hardcode into the application or in a configuration file meaning that either connection strings or actual sql statements have to be generator on-the-fly and that can be a really big security risk read about sql-injection if you re unfamiliar with the potential risks of dynamic-sql

2254685
ggplot2	lattice
now you can use lattice or ggplot2 to make plot

2254689
checkbox	button
for .some rea.son it took two click to bind the form with the checkbox value .so the onchange simulated the first click and the regular button is the second

2254703
subtract	time
once you have this perform all measurements on the server side puzzle returned to user solution received and subtract out the network time based on previous observations

2254718
joomla	drupal
you can look at existing joomla or drupal but they are extremely large compared to the simple .app you are describing

2254718
value	field
.when they submit the form you can loops through the list of field to get the value and store it in another table

2254719
attributes	properties
i don t know exactly which properties is causing it but try changing the width attributes on the parent containers all the way and see .when its fixed use firebug

2254721
boolean	int
it converts the boolean to an int and it works .

2254734
javassist	cglib
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254766
checkbox	button
i m at a bit of a loss on how to proceed without massive rework of the vb6 content to change the options button to checkbox

2254767
mongodb	couchdb
common representatives would be couchdb or mongodb

2254776
value	field
i kept the versioning column for hibernate s locking strategy .so i need to know what value is safe to put in that field .when import the data to those tables

2254786
windows-xp	windows
to display text vertically on windows 2000 and windows-xp enumerate the available fontss as usual and selected a fonts whose fonts face named begins with the at sign

2254809
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t make any sense because i can login with firefox and google-chrome successfully

2254827
python	php
i want to launchd a python scripting similar to this web-crawler wait for it to finish process the data in php then return the results to the user

2254827
python	php
what would you suggest to use to pass an arrays of html data from the python scripting to php

2254835
configuration	environment
i would recommend creating three separate configuration files and setting up a continuous-integration and deployment systemd that handles the naming and roll out of the proper settings file based on environment

2254835
web-config	app-config
the integration server would then create a copy of this file for web-config or app-config based on the environment

2254839
google-chrome	firefox
it is odd that firefox and google-chrome are not throw the yellow screens of death

2254849
httpmodule	isapi
i inherited a very antiquated c++ isapi filtering that secures a classic asp website and was tasked with the job of creating an httpmodule to directly replace it

2254866
background-color	transparency
there is no background-color set on ul#sliding_panels li.p1 - it is set to transparency

2254871
python	php
i suggest a file you can dump structured-data for example to json or yaml both is easily writable and readable in both python and php

2254889
configuration	environment
i m used to work on a single component takings it s environment variables from a configuration file for the diffrerents env

2254950
platform	lgpl
on the .net platform the free open source lgpl edition is all you need

2254952
contentcontrol	textblock
basically what i ve done is added that final textblock and bound it to the same formatteddependentvalue properties that the tooltip uses in its contentcontrol

2254953
execution	exit
does a jvm exit .when a stack overflow exception-handling occurs in one of the execution threads

2254955
keyboard	mouse
how can i determine idle time in python on linux meaning no keyboard or mouse activity for the past few seconds or minutes

2254958
wordpress	blogs
i know for wordpress blogs the admin page is usually the blog url followed by wp-admin

2254966
glut	fltk	glfw	fltk	glfw	glut
a couple of alternatives to glut both apparently in active development are glfw and fltk

2254966
glfw	glut
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts .so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966
glut	fltk
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implements than glut itself

2254966
freeglut	glut
i suppose i should also points out one more alternative to glut freeglut is a free re-implementation of the glut api

2254966
nvidia	ati
edit2 .when if you decide you want to play around with shader both amd ati and nvidia have developer webpage

2254978
binary	hex
try looking at the text file in a binary hex editor - i suspect you ll find that every other byte is 0

2254987
subclassing	base-class
if you for example want to defined a few flags in the base-class then add a few more flags in the subclassing you can t do it this way

2254992
callback	methods
if you re looking to add this behavior to many model but not all model you might want to consider writing a simple plugins to redefine the assigment the methods you need and add the callback in a single class methods call

2254998
callback	methods
the callback methods used in cfhosts asynchronous resolution systemd passes in a cfstreamerror

2255008
groovy	java
i know ruby and java relatively well and i d like to learn groovy

2255018
arrays	loops
the foreach loops looks fine though you ll want to assign to a productname arrays instead of a string .so use productname c

2255024
youtube	flickr
youtube myspace odeo flickr match and facebook - all in one customizable and under your full control

2255026
controllers	routes
is there a way to access the routes information from the templates in other words to get the controllers action information

2255031
parsing	comma
i m trying to parsing in ruby what s effectively the unix passwd file-format comma delimiters with an escape character such that anything escaped should be considered literally

2255034
filesystems	hardlink
cloning with a filesystems path makes hardlink .so use a url

2255038
restrict	shared
all account would shared the single database but each one would need to be able to restrict access to their data

2255050
compile-time	hardcode
you have to hardcode it or at least the variables components package named and database named both of which you already know at compile-time

2255054
mersenne-twister	generator
mt19937 is the mersenne-twister generator which generator the raw random numbers

2255058
append	input
inorder to secure other users i want to to hardcode the domain named www.myspace.com and append the user s sanitized input

2255081
put	get
put the keyword together to get

2255081
put	get
put the keyword together to get

2255098
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
some databases oracle postgresql sql-server i think keep a recording of row count in the systemd tables

2255163
actionscript	mxml
i always thought that separating the user-interface from the logic is the way to go like the use of class files in flash-cs3 cs4 or asp.net-mvc in web-frameworks but recently there are plenty of examples and post using actionscript embedded in mxml

2255165
network-interface	packets
you should have network-interface + packets received discarded for each of your network adaptor for example

2255169
checkbox	button
i m having a problem with getting my radio button laid out and checkbox correctly in ie8

2255169
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
firefox google-chrome opera all working however

2255185
children	nodes
this code will output yay i use a nodes that has children but

2255185
children	nodes
is there any way to get an arrays of children of a particular nodes

2255222
actionscript	mxml
in my experience there s not much of a difference whether you write a component in actionscript + mxml or solely in actionscript

2255237
instances	self
like in php you would use this to refer to the current instances while self refers to the instances s class the objective-c equivalent of this would be self .so what would be the objective-c equivalent of php s self if there is one

2255240
double	int
works only for basic types like int double ulong etc

2255248
callback	methods
methods in javascript .so a webpage can figure out if an ajax request took place without using any intrusive callback

2255249
display	height	display	width
also to make it as efficient as possible don t resize your images using styles tags or inline width height but instead use something like php-gd or imagick to actually make thumbnails in the sizes you need to display

2255254
linux	osx
on windows this mode uses direct3d on osx and linux we are using opengl

2255258
instances	self
if self is an instances of an object you can get the object s class with

2255263
haskell	erlang
erlang is also easy to master for rubyists because it doesn t take purity quite as far as haskell or clean

2255263
haskell	lisp	haskell	scheme	common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	haskell	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
and again clojure is much more pragmatic than both other functional languages like haskell and other lisp like scheme and much simpler and more modern than common-lisp .so it is a natural fit for rubyists

2255263
haskell	scala
however rubyists are also looking at both scala as one of the more pragmatic statically typed fp languages and haskell as one of the more elegant ones

2255263
haskell	scala
then there is project like scuby and hubris which are bridges that let you integrated ruby with scala and haskell respectively

2255269
.when	ready
i m ready to make a db-trip while sorting but how to separate that .when the caching is turned-on

2255269
updatepanel	gridview
fyi i already have an ajax updatepanel in which i ve got this gridview enableviewstate false and ods enablecaching true

2255270
constructor	object
it searches properties somedata in control s data context which is set to this object because code in simpleuc constructor overrides value of datacontext and it is not set to testwindow object anymore as you expected

2255272
instances	self
inside an instances methods self refers to the current instances of that class

2255293
comma	words
by the way i found this class by opening up the documentation and typing the words comma in the index

2255321
filesystems	fat
to install mingw on fat filesystems

2255345
alpha	rgba
google-chrome still rendering a gradient on top of the background-image in the color that you pass to rgba r g b 0.1 but choosing a color that compliments your image and making the alpha 0.1 reduces the effect of this

2255346
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
to debugging use firebug in firefox or web-inspector that built-in in safari and google-chrome

2255363
loading	gif
i want to know the easiest way of showing a loading gif to a specific jquery ajax request

2255363
loading	gif
i just want a specific jquery ajax request to triggers the loading process maybe a gif will be show

2255380
hide	show
just show the image before you start the ajax call and then in your ajax success or complete handler hide it

2255405
signals	sigpipe
your client ignore the restructuredtext and tries to send more data and it s this second send which causes your program to receive the sigpipe signals

2255407
groovy	java
if you know java the best thing you can read is how the metaclass is used in groovy

getter	setter
or should dtos be puredata containers with no additional methods other than getter setter

2255428
font-size	display	background-color	font-size	background-color	display
i need to change font-size and background-color of the list display by more button of the uitabbarcontroller

2255433
getter	setter
dtos should not have behavior they are mere containers for transporting data across process boundries and should consist of setter getter only

2255439
any	set
if you have any experience with sql developer this means that sql developer will only execute that sub-section of a query -- in this case apparently updates table set column value was highlighted.

2255442
hide	show
in beforesend callback you have to show the spinner and in complete you have to hide it

2255455
where-clause	sql
the autocomplete query will need to checked the input string against 4 field in each recording and discrete parameters against the category and effective expiration dates .so if this were a sql query it would have a where-clause that looks .something like

2255459
put	get
go get jstl 1.2 here and drop it in web-inf .lib after removing any old jstl .libs jstl.jar and standard.jar and the eventual extractionion contents some poor tutorials namely suggests that you need to extraction the .tld files and put it in classpath this is wrong

2255468
any	set
if you re getting prompt for a passwd checked that you ve added the public key to the correct file on the far side could be authorized_keys2 now and that the directory permissions are correct .ssh and its contents shouldn t have any grouping or world permissions set

2255483
directory	folder

2255509
ubuntu	linux
edit i m using linux ubuntu 9.10 and python 2.6.2

2255529
unique	words
you could put the 10k text on s3 then create an attributes that has all the unique words of the 10k of text as multiple value

2255553
put	get
the queue itself has a limit of 10 entries and once that limit is reached no more packets will get put onto the queue

2255553
multicast	packets
as an alternative you could route these multicast packets in userspace using by receiving them on a raw socket and then forwarding them out whatever interface you like

2255572
for-loop	arrays
first of all i wouldn t use for-in i d use a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays

2255572
arrays	loops
and then loops through that arrays once after asking for the named and passwd and seeing if they match

2255586
checkbox	button	checkbox	listbox	widget	button
i m trying my best to figure out a succinct straightforward widget using standards user-interface widget available in any toolkit checkbox radio button or listbox that could model a true false null value

2255592
geocoding	geocode
according to the google-maps docs the google-maps api provides a client geocode for geocoding addresses

2255605
checkbox	textbox
forms have a couple grid each and around 20 - 30 additional controls textbox checkbox

2255698
webserver	upload
how can i force it to go get the schema file again after i upload it to the webserver

2255713
server-side-includes	ssi
use server-side-includes ssi

2255713
javascript	dom
search engines cannot as of yet interpreter javascript dom changes properly and won t be able to crawl your pages properly

2255716
oracle	mysql
mysql can certainly match or beat oracle in speed

2255716
innodb	myisam
ok .so i had to use various table types like black hole merge innodb and myisam in just the right laces

2255729
spring	jsf
building a jsf application with spring on tomcat

2255750
expression	evaluation
storing expression in data columns and expecting sql to use them for evaluation queries would be like designing an application around heavy use of eval

2255751
exception-handling	try-catch
apparently google-chrome won t pause on the exception-handling if it s inside a try-catch block though

2255778
directx	gdi
on windows you can use the gdi or directx apis to load images to memory

2255778
tiff	png
boost-gil which apparently has support for jpeg png and tiff files.

2255778
libpng	cairo
or if you ll only be using png you might find libpng or cairo to be more appropriate

2255797
any	set
in any case to answer your question on fminbnd and quad you could set a c t a b xmin and xmax the last two are the range you want to look for the min over and use

2255822
directory	folder
to see if a path is a folder directory use nsfilemanager s -fileexistsatpath isdirectory

2255836
forms-authentication	security
the forms-authentication provider is setup to use the same active-directory as the windows auth based site using the following entries in the application s web-config the entries are in the central administration and security token service web-config files as well

2255872
initializer	setter
the reason is that you re not invoking the synthesized setter methods within your initializer

2255877
populate	row
is there a slick way to get the bottom total column populate with sum of each row in one shot without having to do each column individually using sub-queries

2255898
display	height
currently i have 2 issues the first one is that i didn t find a way to resize the row height to display the full messages and the second one is that .when the list is updates the datagridview doesn t display the modifications

2255898
contains	any
also is there any way to urls contains in the messages to become clickable and be opened in the default browser

2255898
display	height	display	width
if i wasn t clear before i need for the width to be fixed and the cell height that contains the long text to be enlarged and display the text in 2 line

2255919
logout	login
i want to keep tracking of .when users login and logout

2255919
logout	login
right now i change their login status in db .when they login or manually logout

2255937
contains	elements
since the innerhtml properties is exclusive to htmlelements and not other xml elements â s setting innerhtml on tempdiv will do nothing other than adding a custom properties contains the html string

2255937
htmlcollection	nodelist
it should not be used for iterator a sequences such as arrays nodelist or in this case htmlcollection as it doesn t do what you might expect

2255938
implements	extends
you can optional also let your servlet both extends httpservlet and implements servletcontextlistener like follows

2255949
contains	set
if the cookies exist and the value is valid contains a limited set of permitted value then use that value and load the stylesheet file

2255954
gnome	kde
you can look at how nautilus gnome or konqueror kde generator previews for various file types

2255957
constructor	object
dependency-injection is a technique used in object oriented programming where the constructor of an object has arguments for the service object it needs and those service object are passed in by the creator of the instances which could be a factory a test or a dependency-injection framework

2255957
abstract-base-class	abstract-methods
the templates pattern is basically an abstract-base-class with the common part of a repeated code block and abstract-methods to allow for the variation between the instances of those repeated code blocks

2256000
express-checkout	paypal
paypal express-checkout -

2256004
return-type	arguments
many com methods allow for variation in arguments types and return-type by designating the types as object

2256007
delphi	c++
interoperability over platform java javascript c++ delphi etc.

2256025
mersenne-twister	generator
you don t need to ports the basic mersenne-twister generator as java has one in its standard-library only the code that takes numbers form the mersenne-twister and converts it to a beta distribution

2256045
append	input
.so what i m doing is .when that link it click to open the map i call a javascript function that i wrote which takes the ip s creates a form tag with a target attributes which points to the new windows that will be opened append it to the current page then append hidden input s of the ip s to that form

2256048
interpreter	runtime
this monitor object can be accessed at runtime from an ironpython interpreter

2256051
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
another example is integration with dynamically typed or even untyped data such as json csv html schemaless xml schemaless web-services schemaless databases which are after all the new hotness

2256055
put	get
well i don t really get the points just don t put anything in the session if you don t want to use it

2256071
carbon	cocoa
i m from a windows programming background .when writing tools but have been programming using carbon and cocoa for the past year

2256071
splitter	panels
i see docked views with splitter panels but that s about it

2256077
expander	grid
there is a way to make it appear that a single expander has separate layout for its header and content .so they can be in separate grid cell or even totally separate parts of the windows

2256077
contains	set
create another expander with the body you want but set its templates properties to a templates contains just a contentpresenter .so no header will be visible

2256081
show	next
if i start with views 1 and 2 visible and scroll horizontally to the right i want the next page to show items 2 and 3

2256093
contains	set	contains	elements
but a pascal set can only contains up to 256 elements

2256110
background-image	transparency
for that we need to make canvas object transparency .so that background-image is visible

2256113
communication	messages
the other way it just wait for user-input and will send to the server and then i d call the function recievefromserver after the client send a messages to the server which doesn t allow for fluent communication but cannot get it to alternate automatically

2256113
decrement	increment
the server uses a lock .when increment or decrement numbers of clients

2256114
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works perfectly however in ie and google-chrome the button jumps to the top of the page and then animates to positioning instead of animation from where it started from

2256125
virtual-memory	paging
what will happen .when a program is idle for a while is that its virtual-memory pages will get swapped out to the paging file

2256127
invoices	product
product or service information for everything on the invoices

2256127
invoices	product
now you re sending 1200 invoices with the same data being serialization over and over again - same account same product same a r

2256127
invoices	product
all of the invoices with product and account ids only

2256161
repository	entity
wcf service gets entity from repository orm

2256199
value	field
i need to selected recording from table but one field id2 as example replace with value from other table with id id2 from first table

2256200
virtualbox	vmware
i suppose you could run your jvm within a virtualized environment virtualbox vmware instances with one processor allocated but i m not sure that that gets you what you want

2256202
latex	tex
since all latex compilers make use of the underlying tex engine this is never an issue but from a pendant s perspective there is that difference

2256204
alpha-transparency	rgba
to get the alpha-transparency value out of the rgba arrays you have to use bit-shifting like this

2256208
nmake	cmake
the cmake 2.8.1 rc1 as for the time of writing this it s ready to try does bring new generator for nmake which is called nmake makefile jom and it generator nmake with specific settings for jom which is the drop in replacement of nmake

2256213
polynomials	exponent
the key points of my answer is that you can do this in polynomials time even with a small exponent

2256220
calloc	malloc
what is the advantage of zeroing out memory calloc over malloc

2256228
attributes	properties	data-annotations	viewmodel
since the templates helpers rely heavily on model properties and attributes data-annotations i would need to somehow add the attributes to the viewmodel during runtime

2256230
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
i don t recall if we ever found a runaway program but the value corresponding to 0xcc in various value 52 428 unsigned 16-bit -19 660 signed 16-bit -107374176 32-bit float and -9.25596313493e+61 64bit float popped up in a lot of unexpected places

2256245
content-length	content-type
even .when the content-type and content-length is wrong safari just downloading the file

2256257
children	nodes
look at the children of the sixth 5 nodes at this level

2256257
children	nodes
look at the children of the fourth 3 nodes at this level

2256282
calloc	malloc
without telling you my personal preferences 1 if you belong to the first camp you would want to calloc instead of malloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the initializer everything camp you don t calloc but malloc because you are initializing floating-point numbers or pointers and you know that all bits zero doesn t necessarily mean 0 for them

2256286
implements	abstract
the strict definition of regular-language from theoretical computer science may seem abstract with little practical benefit but if youâ re ever faced with the need to implements a state machine to recognize certain input you can save yourself a lot of useless effort and hairpulling if you can prove up front that it canâ t be done

2256319
webserver	security
al.so the traditional approach provides an extra level of security .so that machines in the wild don t have direct access to the database and all the usual webserver security and access controls can be used

2256329
for-loop	loops	compile-time	hardcode
gcc not only figured out we were doing a for-loop but also realized it was to be run a constants numbers of time did loops for us at compile-time chucked out i and sum and hardcode the answer - 55

2256334
display	height
firebug display the correct dimension .so i know there s .some way of calculating the actual display height of the image i just can t figure out what it is

2256334
display	height
how do you get the actual display height of an image if you ve set max-height 100

2256338
keyboard	mouse
it s important to think about workflow how commonly used the control would be whether you can replace it with direct manipulation whether a visible indication of its state is necessary whether it s operable from the keyboard and mouse where appropriate and .so forth

2256339
xsd	xml
i can t think of anything that specifically generator example xml from and xsd file in perl

2256339
xsd	xml
however if i were approaching the task i would start by looking at xml compile and xml pastor which both support some form of xsd - perl marshalling

2256339
xsd	xml
another much less favorable option is to use my own xml toolkit to generator object from the xsd file and use those to building a generator for your document

2256344
perl	php
webserver scripting languages like php asp.net perl and even java all have very good libs to deal with these things

2256346
nsstring	nsurl
use the -stringbyaddingpercentescapesusingencoding methods on nsstring before passing it to nsurl

2256350
sqldatasource	gridview
that way your sqldatasource control will execute the selected .when databinding the existing gridview not the copy

2256374
duplicates	contains
fork creates a duplicates process contains everything the parent does including file handles etc

2256374
difference	zero
the only difference is the return-value of fork the parent sees the pid the child sees zero

2256377
put	get	fflush	stdout
.when you put it at the beginning of the line you end up with stdout not being ffflush .so you get multiple printouts .when the parent and child process both fflush their output buffering

2256379
value	field
.so this field has multiple field value in it and i have no way to take them apart.

2256384
callback	methods
i think that rather than using an event to setup and continue loops i would create an asynchronous delegation with a callback methods

2256392
value	field
but how can i put some value into the field before the first submission

2256400
fadeout	fadein
the normals behavior .when using fadein and fadeout is to use the display properties

2256400
fadeout	fadein
how can i make fadein and fadeout not modify the layout of the page

2256401
database-table	mysql
i am trying to save image urls to a mysql database-table

2256403
pascal	basic
the primary areas of focus are a understanding how int numbers are stored as binary digits and b the basic of data-structures where if a programming language does not provide the desired data structure itself you can use meta or collections structures such as struct in c class in c++ or recording in pascal

2256403
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
i ll ignore long-long for this discussion. let s say for sake of generality that on a given 32-bit platform the sizes are 8bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit respectively

2256416
sql-server	mysql
for my final year project i m making what i call - seequal and it s a one stop interface for accessing 3 of the most famo.us database types - sqlite sql-server and mysql

2256416
authentication	login
inorder to access my databases i will need to login with the sql-server authentication mode aka via the all famo.us login - sa

2256423
hash	md5
i want to truncated an md5 hash to about half size

2256435
put	get
.when i put the arrays value in front of the time variables i get the incorrect time

2256438
composite	visitor
however instead of going to all that trouble you should consider using the composite and visitor patterns in your design

2256443
any	set
i suggest you let postgresql return the set in any arbitrary order especially since it s difficult to do fine-grained sql-level control from a django interface then sort it in the way you wish in python -- should do fine .when theresultset is the arbitrary-order list resulting from the database and yourlistofids is the list whose order you want to preserve

2256454
hash	md5
following the table posted on the above link assuming your digests are 64bit each since a single md5 hash is 128 bits and that md5 have a uniform distribution there is a very low chance that two hash will collider

2256460
directory	folder
in this case the working folder would actually be the lower directory

2256471
lexer	lex
well you can write a c++ lexer using lex yacc or antlr

2256471
midl	idl
midl compiles the idl into .tlb and your application can loads the .tlb file at runtime

2256479
uppercase	tolower
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2256481
assign	add
what s the named of the widget that we use to assign user permission in admin page under the add users option

2256484
configuration	environment
but to simplifying multiple configuration files i use a t4 templates to create the environment specific configuration files

2256484
contains	any
each environment has its own templates file qa.tt production.tt etc that inherited from web.tt and contains any environment specific overrides

2256489
composite	visitor
what you re doing resembles both the composite and visitor patterns

2256501
constructor	private
in your class the reference from the form is passed into the constructor and stored as a private member

2256510
spring	jsf
.so jsf and spring have nothing to do here

2256517
asp.net-mvc	wcf
we are building an extranet loan status checked website using asp.net-mvc with a wcf backend

2256517
asp.net-mvc	wcf
its a pretty standards design with the asp.net-mvc site using a wcf service reference to get customer object

2256548
multiplication	addition
if you work through this sequences of questions you should be able to write a function for each step and re-use those functions to answer the later questions and end up with a very simple and unoptimized long well up to maxdigit digits int package for addition and multiplication of positive numbers

2256551
silverlight	wpf
i was going to move to wpf however i m hearing some people say go silverlight out-of-browser

2256551
silverlight	wpf
wpf or silverlight

2256574
any	set
i ve never heard of a wcf operation taking more than a fractions of a second to set up and teardown excluding any logic inside

2256576
any	set
and is there any format to set the path as string

2256579
value	field
if i .post the form with nothing entered in any of the field i consistently get a value of true for modelstate.isvalid

2256579
value	field
shouldn t it be false since i ve marked those field as required and not entered any value

2256582
silverlight	wpf
al.so note that silverlight doesn t have floating child windows .so if you need them you ll need to go wpf

2256611
atom-feed	feed
once you have all these elements just verify that your call to the youtube-api returns an rss feed because with the standards atom-feed it doesn t work at all and give a try to the following code

2256616
silverlight	wpf
wpf is not built on it silverlight and other ports of wpf to other platform will probably never include it and there are many incompatibilities between the conventions used by system.drawing winforms and those used by system.windows.media wpf

2256616
double	int	pixels	line
for example they use different units of measure pixels versus fixed 96dpi different coordinate types int vs double different rules for line drawing different rotation different brushesm immediate vs retained mode etc

2256616
silverlight	wpf
as long as you are running on wpf and not a clone like silverlight you can still access the old winforms libs

2256622
nsarray	plist
only nsarray and nsdictionary object can be written to plist files

2256622
nsstring	nsdata
those can then contains nsstring object and other object like nsdate and nsdata etc but what you re asking for is not possible

2256625
nsstring	nsdata
touch json parsing nsdata instead of nsstring

2256630
decrement	increment
voting once means you increment or decrement the rating of the item

2256651
jax-rs	cxf
how can i get the principal named session and ideally checked if the principal is authentication with the spring-security context inside a cxf jax-rs webservice methods receiving a call from an android client

2256676
datagridview	propertygrid
you might ask why i am doing this meaning use both datagridview and propertygrid

2256693
webserver	upload
i downloading the kannel software from the .net and upload the software into the webserver

2256702
expression	evaluation
i use immediate evaluation to keep the xpath expression close to where i use them--it seems clearer to me

2256708
itemscontrol	grid
hi have itemscontrol in my main grid and paneltemplate as wrappanel

2256714
code-coverage	cobertura
then make use of a code-coverage tool i like cobertura but there are others to give you a visual of how much of your code is tested

2256739
value	field
.when an object is serialization the value of its transient field are not include in the serial representation while the value of its non-transient field are include

2256739
value	field
it s the value of the field that is ignore sometimes not the field itself

2256745
callback	methods
since you have no callback in your deleteitem methods there is no place for the scripting to go

2256760
variables	boolean
i have always used the second way always putting the variables as the first operands and using whatever boolean operators makes sense but lately i have read code that uses the first methods and after getting over the initial weirdness i am starting to like it a lot more

2256760
variables	boolean
now i have started to write all my boolean expression to only use or even if this means the variables isn t the first operands like the above example

2256770
shell	bash
in a bash shell on linux if i types

2256789
conditional	operators
youâ ve picked the wrong logical operators â if you want to be sure that user picked something else than those characters in the conditional you have to pick logical and is the character different from y and also different from y and etc

2256818
fadeout	fadein
effetcs like slidedown fadein fadeout dont work with ie but works good with google-chrome

2256827
ms-project	mpxj
i m trying to work with ms-project files in an asp.net application and came across the mpxj libs which started out in java and has been converted to a .net versioning as well

2256876
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
a longer answer might have to do with the fact that all modern machines do at least 32-bit native computations and it might actually be harder for some machines to do 8bit and 16-bit operations

2256888
subclassing	superclass
class a contains some properties and then class b extends the class a superclass by adding some additional properties specific to that subclassing

2256903
data-structures	union-find
i just studied the disjoint set data structure and i know that it is also called union-find data-structures union and find are two main operations of this data structure

2256940
firefox	opera	textbox	button
i have a html textbox and a hidden submit button .when user write a text and hit the enter i checked to see if this is the enter key and then submit the messages it is working perfectly in ie but in firefox and opera it show the same messages twice

2256944
selected	checkbox
a user will have the ability to selected all or a few or none of the checkbox and click printing

2256964
glut	sdl
depending on what you re trying to do outside of opengl you may have some luck with glut include with mac os x or sdl as the windows base of your project

2256964
sdl	x11
i believe sdl uses cocoa internally on mac os x and x11 on linux

2256969
content-length	content-type
--myboundary content-type image jpeg content-length 38256 ..

2256973
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp codeigniter for php and ruby-on-rails

2256984
multiplying	subtract
short if adding or subtract shorts dividing a short by any int types multiplying two bytes .

2256991
selected	button
i have 2 gridview and has selected button on it

2256991
selected	button
on selected this button that item goes into the second gridview

2256994
dictionary	arrays
for your requirements the easiest way is to create a new arrays from the key sort that then use the arrays to reference items from the original dictionary

2256998
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	ms-access	ms-access	oracle	ms-access	mysql
almost all rdbms s such ms-access mysql sql-server oracle etc use a cost based optimiser based upon column statistics

2257031
authentication	login
authentication .when the request arrives are the users login details correct

2257066

this methods takes a dictionary as input creates an arrays maintaining the associations then sorts the resultant arrays using arrays.sorton and returns the sorted results back as an arrays

2257310
value	field
key and value field in the arrays in the example below are used for clarity but any field named could be used

2257310
value	field
this example assumes a string object as a key and a numeric object as a value though of course any object types could be used and field parameters adjusted

2257310
value	field
the approach below could also be used for sorting by key instead of value by using key as the sort field for the sorton methods and you could use different sort options than the descending numeric sort i used here as3 sorton documentation code below is intentionally non-generic to simplify it for example purposes

2257320

constructor	private
updates i didn t see the private constructor

2257912
default-value	arguments
a dictionary s get methods will return either the value for a key or a default-value if the key does not exist - normally the default-value is none but in this case we gave the same character as the default-value the second arguments .so that if the key is not found it will just return itself

2257925
hashtable	set
however if you have a much larger set you might be able to combine two data-structures together to make searches more efficient for example you could have a hashtable in addition to stack each time you push something on stack you could also add it to the hashtable

2257949
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
only equals gethashcode gettype referenceequals and tostring appears

2258309
selected	button
after click each button a list of books of that kind is presented and the user can selected the books

2258329
transliteration	translation
if you use the translation methods of unicode object as i recommended in answer to another question of yours everything s done automatically for you exactly as you desire each unicode character c whose codepoints ord c is not in the transliteration dictionary is simply passed unchanged from input to output just as you want

2258333

binary-search-tree	map
i m looking for a java class with the characteristics of c++ std map s usual implementation as i understand it a self-balancing binary-search-tree

2258455
scala	java
.so the general idea is this from the outside in wrap the java collections in a scala equivalent then use map to wrap everything in the next level

2258456
double	int
the closest class to a binary-tree in the standards java libs is java.util.treemap but it doesn t support primitive-types except by boxing int is wrapped as an int double as a double etc

2258466
jquery	.post
you cannot make a cross-domain .post request using jquery or any other javascript technology

2258476

if you required hyphens then using is your best bet but note that this will not work wrap at char in firefox 2.0 mac windows or safari 3.0

2258518
background-position	background-image
note that the recommended way of implements rollover images is the css-sprites technique you use an image that contains all the states use that image as a background-image and adjust the background-position according to hover active states

2258527
transient	entity
nhibernate generator an id .when session.save or session.saveorupdate is called with an transient entity

binary-search-tree	map
a tree-based map always has a runtime worst case average case in the order of o log n the height of the balanced binary-search-tree

2258620
binary-tree	tree	postorder	inorder
if you have an inorder traversal and a postorder traversal for a general binary-tree they don t even defined the tree uniquely if you can have duplicates value the sequences 1 1 1 for both postorder and inorder can be one of the following tree

2258620
postorder	inorder
suppose you have a postorder traversal list x1 x2 ... xn and inorder traversal list y1 ... yk ... yn .so that xn yk

2258620
postorder	inorder
the inorder traversal is 9 3 2 5 6 4 1 and the postorder 9 2 3 4 1 6 5

2258620
postorder	inorder
in the inorder 6 4 1 the left-subtree is-empty and the right is 4 1 .so from the postorder list 4 1 6 you take as the left-subtree and 4 1 as the right subtree

2258624
expression	evaluation
evaluation expression such as user.get params.id again in the display view returns errors such as the following

2258625
contains	set
the simplest methods is simply match the set of longest words contains in your string against a dictionary

2258625
combinations	permutation
of course there could be many words .so you d have to plan for all combinations and permutation

2258629
constructor	object
the problem is the dependency on somehashingclass in the constructor how do i inject it whilst keeping the object immutable

2258644
command-line	cmd
this may cause the rest of the command-line to fail to parsing or it may cause some of the parentheses to get passed to the cmd del myfile.txt

2258704
contains	elements
i generally develop a site with a fluid structure that is kept at some fixed width by the main contains elements

2258704
contains	set	contains	elements
essentially this required that you set the main containers s width in pixels and all of the inner elementss as percentage of that contains elements

2258704
contains	elements
to allow for text resizing leave the height for contains elements undefined .so they can expand as needed .when the text size is changed

within my document .ready but this does not work at all with safari just nothing happens but it works fine with google-chrome firefox and ie

2258786
culture	locale
i d format it using a datetime-format with a culture or locale variables

2258787
formatting	printing	culture	locale
the cultureinfo already knows about month named in different locale -- if you need this info explicit to printing out a list of month named you can get it from the datetimeformatinfo class but for a simple formatting requirement it s easier just to use datetime.tostring with the required culture and a format string

2258810
order	add
let s say i want to add a new customer and a new order and i already know what they bought

2259896
bison	yacc
if you absolutely must have an ll 1 grammar then you obviously will need to press on if you get into a situation like this but if you re allowed to use parsing generator like yacc bison or sablecc then you will in the long run most likely find it a lot easier to go down that route

reflection	runtime
it should only be called through reflection at runtime

2261686
binary-search-tree	tree
however you cannot do some other operations with the same ease as with a simple binary-search-tree like determining if a value is in the tree or not

2261686
binary-tree	tree
you can take a look at splay tree a kind of self-balancing binary-tree that provides improved access time to recently accessed elements

contains	elements
use a boost-variant that can contains all possible elements and then use a

2261800
return-value	arguments
the arguments may also be passed in by value but this is an advanced trick â but the return-value really must be a non-const reference

2261806
selected	cell
i just noticed that if i go to format cell and selected custom format and put say 0000 to the format any numbers that i put in the cell it is is less than 4 digitss it still maintain the 4 digits length with the leading 0 like 0001 0099 0120 9999

2261955
hide	show
i ve got a nested list and the jquery scripting show below to show hide each list separately + - link and to show hide all lists at once show all hide subcategories

2261955
hide	show
.when i use show and hide it works as expected but .when i use animation eg show slow or slidedown i get a strange issue

2261955
hide	show
i might miss something but since this behaves as expected .when using just show and hide i thought that it could be a bug

2261979
any	set
i d hesitate to call this a multiple-inheritance issue because interfaces merely describe well interface--a set of methods an implements class must define--rather than any implementation

2261982

it s great if you re interested in doing cross-platform development on windows and linux unix

2261994
put	get
if you have a need to get an entire recordinging instead of just the user then it is also just right for you to have functions but put it in your recording model - not in your user model

2262005
viewdidload	dealloc
in most cases your dealloc methods is a mirror-image of your init methods and your viewdidunload will be a mirror image of your viewdidload methods

2262005

despite i have setted up the width and height of the a elements to display

2262023
airplane	wifi
i wish to know if android 2.1 sdk support apis for changing network settings such as bluetooth on off wifi on off airplane mode on off

2262040
g++	gcc
if you re creating a shared libs for instances it s possible that you need to specify compilation flags for position-independent code such as -fpic gcc g++

2262059
airplane	wifi
looking at the official api docs it seems that bluetooth and wifi settings are readonly but airplane mode can be set

2262076
margins	padding
edit as for your problem if there is no interference with background different color you can try setting padding instead of margins for ie6

2262086
linked-list	nodes
there is a implementation in the taocp that uses the spare pointers in non-full nodes to complete a double linked-list along the nodes inorder i don t recall the detail right now but i image you have to have a has_child flag for each directions to make it work

2262087
margins	padding
also in some cases you can use padding instead of margins since padding doesn t double

2262106
sql-server	mysql
i never actually used mysql but in sql-server i would do something like this

2262115

the elements is a tr contains in a table elements

2262128
testdriven.net	xunit.net
personally i have found xunit.net testdriven.net and moq to be a very flexible set of test tools

2262139
double	int
perhaps we are checked to see if a string is a keyword .so we have to lookup whether a given string is inside the set int double for foreach class .

2262139
put	get
we could put those in a hash set and get decent performance

2262152
division	modulo
if .so this should work and it should al.so be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

2262155
expression	brackets
you can t escape characters in a brackets expression .when using ereg functions

2262155
expression	brackets
you can understand why it works by reading the part on brackets expression in regex manpage

2262167
variables	boolean
just use two member variables to hold the results or two boolean flags if the result-of either can actually be null

2262173
pthreads	openmp
.so if you want parallelism on your cpu cores you need to use threads such as pthreads or openmp

2262196
value	field
why can i search for a char value insert into an int field

2262196
value	field
i have a field that is of types int but it seems to be able to recording character value how is that possible

2262196
value	field
during the insert mysql failed to insert the character value into an int field .so it replace it with 0

2262232
cout	cin
what does the c mean in the cout cin cerr and clog named

2262238
cout	cin
one thing in favor of that theory that can serve as an indicator is the fact that for each streaming object cin cout cerr etc. there is an equivalent wide-streaming one wcin wcout wcerr etc.

2262243
arcgis	gdal
i work with arcgis and am unfamiliar with intricate setups with libs dependencies as gdal suggests

2262243
arcgis	gdal

use mbunit with gallio nunit mstest or xunit.net

2262332
buffering	streaming
1- the object cin controls input from a streaming buffering associated with

2262337
dictionary	arrays
casting isn t what you need to do but if your arrays actually from your code it looks like a dictionary contains strings then yes you need to convert them to a numeric format

2262343
export	csv
for the export side i m leaning to using jasper-reports to export a dataset to csv excel...is this a good bad idea

2262362
entity-framework	nhibernate
normally these days in the dot .net world we use an orm or similar tool nhibernate linq-to-sql subsonic entity-framework etc

2262367
installation	environment
i m trying to migrate a working expressionengine installation from an apache environment over to an nginx environment on a different box

2262392

2262427
xsd	xml
i m looking for something that reads from a xsd dtd xml and generator

2262432
ruby	php
obviously you can t use php s tokeniser from within ruby

2262451
attributes	properties
one suggestion this might be true is that ib vc object have an attributes you can set that has no direct corresponding properties for a uiviewcontrollers class that i can see .so ib s controllers object may have .some additional functionality that non-ib uiviewcontrollers subclassing can t take advantage of

2262454
deployment	install
half of your problems could be solved if you just created your own ec2 instances install tomcat and managed your own deployment

2262457
double	int
types casting from int to double is a part of c++

2262463
selected	button
i am trying to selected all the input types button elements within forms with id s starting prod with jquery .so i can give them a click function.

2262474
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i guess the target uri needs a clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml file in the root

2262476
pdfsharp	migradoc
the only other option that i ve come across is using migradoc + pdfsharp but you must author the document via migradoc pdfsharp directly it can t be a pre-made printdocument

2262492
mouseleave	mouseenter
it basically just bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave events which you can do with versioning prior to 1.4.1 just as well

2262496
value	field
basically get_.post_meta inside wordpress allows you to obtain custom value from custom field that you have placed in a specific .post

2262506
any	set
is there any way that is as sleek as the predicates function to always set security related field

2262511
mouseleave	mouseenter

2262514
cassini	iis
why not just run the site in iis instead of cassini

2262539
textbox	button
the problem is .when i types something into the textbox and click the button the labels just says hello and not hello namegoeshere

2262561
equals	getter	getter	setter
this equals to your getter setter solution but without the mentioned bloat

2262561
initializer	getter
you do not always need getter and setters. optional if you really need it you may provide a constructor to initializer those in one call as you suggested

2262561
getter	setter
you can have getter setter constructor and .when initialization is omitted default are taken from a singleton factory

2262566
click	mouse
i have a jquery mouse click event handler bounded to a link elements

2262575
any	set
the way i would do it controllers a can be set a delegation and this delegation should implements a protocols in which any updates on the model performed by a is notified to the delegation b

2262575
nsmutablearray	nsarray
controllers b only has a readonly access to the model even if controllers a manipulates a nsmutablearray to change content controllers b only see it as a immutable nsarray this ensure that only controllers a is the real master of this model and that b cannot change its content

2262577
put	get
i used the characters methods to get the text and put it in a dictionary

2262608
font-size	width
better yet set the width using css in em rather than pixels .so as to enable the cell width to scale with the font-size

2262623
javascript	dom
this limits the scoping of your javascript to only your application .so you can t use the dom to get at their friend phone-number email-address etc unless authentication

2262642
font-size	height
if you re going to change it it s still usually best to use a numbers with no units lineheight 1.5 150 the font-size because then the line-height for an elements will be computed from that elements s font-size even if the line height was inherited from an elements with different font-size

2262650
python	c++
finally .when you are translating the c++ exception-handling to a python exception-handling you do .so as follows

2262675
display	height	display	width
if you don t want to do display try changing height width or add remove flow or clear parameters

2262681
javascript	dom
as far as i know javascript worker threads are totally isolated from the main page thread which is why javascript worker threads can t access dom elements

2262686
selected	cell
to selected a range of cell i ve found that extra information after the filename can be useful for example filename abc.xlsx

access-vba	excel-vba
if you re using excel-vba already then it will be quite easy to copy and paste the code into access-vba

2262705
any	set
if the libs you use is x86 you have to set your target-platform to x86 not any cpu assume running on x64

2262718
hide	show
i m not sure why you re against scripting to achieve this especially since you re going to need at least some amount of scripting inorder to show and hide the loader at the right time

2262723
profiling	debugging
for debugging you can use a profiling like yourkit a commercial java profiling

2262723
constructor	object
this will let you modify constructor to register object to your all-my-runtime-object-framework

then they click the downloading button and their browser downloadinging a zipfile contains only the things they selected

2262852
ubuntu	linux
systemd b running django python 2.6 on ubuntu linux over lighttpd maybe nginx later

2262852
reverse-dns	dns
checked that the reverse-dns of the ip is from gae however i don t know what gae s dns entries are if they will change and they may be spoofed

2262872
virtual-machine	vmware
to minimize access to passwd files look into running apache in a sandbox chroot environment where any other files such as passwd are not visible outside of the sandbox chroot environment...have you a spare box lying around to experiment with it or even better use vmware to simulate the identical environment you are using for the apache fedora - try get it to be identical environment and make the httpd server run within vmware and remotely access the virtual-machine to checked if the exploit is still visible

2262888
directory	folder
as python is running in project folder then modules are relative to the working directory

2262916

active-directory	adam
i m wondering if there are security or otherwise advantages of using an adam active-directory application mode store for asp.net membership

2263010
reflection	runtime
but it will damage scala runtime abilities because runtime uses reflection

2263011
configuration	environment
the only things that you re supposed to change between servers is your configuration variables located in config.php which should have default value for the developers to change depending on the environment

2263012
coff	elf
the coff format itself originated on unix although microsoft has extended the format somewhat and the unix seems to have abandoned that format in favor of elf

2263014
32-bit	64bit
i spent a few hours searching for this error already but all i could find were issues relating to installing on 64bit windows and none relating to normals 32-bit that i m using

2263015
itemtemplate	gridview
in the last column itemtemplate of your gridview

2263017
binary	octal
a helpful thing to recall here is that int literals that start with 0 are expressed in octal which means that you can read the binary digits right out of the on-screen representation well with a little practice anyway

2263027
google-chrome	firefox
the function works well with firefox and google-chrome presumbaly it would work with all moz derivative browsers

2263038
linked-list	queue
the queue that you are using appears to be implements as a linked-list .so you can walk the list by hand to non-destructively access the contents

2263051
key-value	key
b since the primary key is used as a foreign key in other tables changing the primary key-value is always a hassle since all the foreign key-values in the other tables need to be modified as well

2263073
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
if you re using sharpdevelop instead of visual-studio set cassini as the startup project

2263076

2263118
.when	ready
.when you have your ide ready you must have source code management

2263120
dictionary	for-loop
.so xstring is a dictionary object types there s not really an iterator object in javascript but you could just go through the items using a for-loop

2263121
radians	sin	radians	cos	cos	sin
i am using simple trigonometry to calculate the relative positioning of holes by converting the angle into radians and using built-in sin cos functions

2263129
python	php
if php is doing it is is able to do .so by virtue that that it is a more constrained and controlled environment than python

2263129
signals	sigint
the only portable way is to have a separate daemons process running which runs ps or uses proc to monitor memory usage of process and then send a sigint signals to those which go over some predefined value

2263134
progress-bar	progress
there is no way to monitor the progress of a single invokation of transferfrom but since you can pass it offset and length parameters you can implements your own loops around it and updates the progress-bar between suitable sized chunks of data

2263147
32-bit	64bit
they have defined 64bit int as struct of two 32-bit int - the higher order int is signed and lower order int is unsigned

2263149
attributes	properties
i d like my model to shared as much as possible ie since they all inherited certain attributes a sharedd form partials on properties _form.html.erb.

2263180
queue	fifo
with queue the items come out on a fifo fifo basis just like people lining up in a physical queue

2263195
children	nodes
a dirty nodes will have its attributes copy-paste but only children with a state will be selected

2263240
order	join
the generics query into which i substitute the required table named is approx 200 line involving a rownumber partition by function multiple join to related tables and some order

2263252
constructor	object
this example uses the new keyword just like you re used to - to construct some known types of object via one of its constructor

2263255
dictionary	arrays
otherwise you would have to work with dictionary arrays etc like in php which is always ugly

2263260
attributes	properties
.when using the required attributes on my viewmodel properties i had specified a resource types and resource named for the error

2263263
reportlab	pypdf
from doing a bit of search it seems that i can use reportlab for creating content and pypdf for merging pdf s together

2263265
decimal-point	digits
i want one function for extractionion the digits before the decimal-point 123 and one function to extraction the digits after the decimal-point 0.456

2263266
custom-controls	listboxitem
depending on what behavior you need from your items you may need to create custom listbox listboxitem derived custom-controls but in a lot of cases the built-in behavior will get you a long way

2263266
selected	listbox
to reuse it as a single unit you could wrap up the listbox with its 24 hour items and customized templates in a user-controls and expose the selection data in whatever form you need as a dependency properties like an ienumerable of the data items representing the selected hours

2263286
put	get
you should not need to subclassing as you will get your viewdidload methods for each of the views you put in your tab bar

2263291
constructor	object
this will make your header simple standards c or objective-c while your implementation file gets constructor destructor of all ivars called without you having to create delete each one as an object on the heap

2263314
value	field
the value of that option is a datetime or date field in the model

2263321
python	java
if python shared java s lack of unsingned int it would need to be something like this

2263991
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup return the value of a single key while ignoring any key combinations

2265488
python	java
you don t say which language you re using .so here s the docs in python and in java

2265526
children	nodes
how would i selected all children of the a nodes that are not a b nodes

2265527
buildpath	libs
does anyone have the list of all the neccessary libs one needs to add to the buildpath manually

2265561
updating	updates
explicit making the updates to y and z and others as part of the business-logic for updating x but this is going to have a big footprint and leaves a lot of room for somebody getting it wrong or missing it .when they have to implements the same in another process

2265567
contains	any
a simple reg ex for any empty line which may contains white spaces is

2265585
constructor	object
you can use reflection for creating a new object without using new keyword but i am not sure whether it call a constructor

2265597
constructor	object
constructor by their definition create new object

2265599
constructor	object
you can set the basic properties of your object in a methods and call that methods in constructor

2265600
constructor	object
you ll want to lookup dependency-injection and the way object should accept their dependencies via the constructor instead of creating them themselves

2265608
value	field
properties with a list of possible value wrap_content or fill_parent are display in a dropdown box directly in the properties field

2265608
ubuntu	linux
new discoveries i found out that it might not even be an android problem but a general eclipse problem that i can see with all versioning ganymede galileo helios on my linux ubuntu systemd

2265608
click	mouse
next to the value does not receive the mouse click

2265629
rollback	commit
indicates that a commit or rollback

2265635
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
you move through 3 uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller

2265668
progress-bar	progress
.when there is progress in file upload it should be reflected in the progress-bar as well

2265671
contains	set
.when this fragment ends ts is set to localtime and d contains 3 hours 54 minutes

2265672
default-value	arguments
parameters with a default-value have to be at the end since it s simpler for the compiler to assume that anything that comes before them is part of the fixed arguments

2265685
instances	destroy
even if you destroy the object after abort the operation it may have altered some state that is global to it and therefore you won t be able to reliably create a new instances without a restart

2265691
optional-arguments	arguments
that said if there are potentially a large numbers of optional-arguments it might be an idea to accept an optional arrays which would contains key-value pairs of the optional arguments to checked for.

2265715
sftp	ftp	sftp	ftps	ftps	ftp
yes edtftpj pro is a commercial java libs that works on android and supports sftp as well as ftp and ftps

2265716
revision	svn
it might be good practice to reference the ticket numbers and original revision in the svn log

2265716
perl	php
one last thing most of our developers use tortoisesvn like you but you can save a lot of time doing these sorts of merge operations with bash scripting or even perl php scripting

2265748
protected	public
remember that a protected member is essentially just a slightly more restrict public member since it can be accessed by client code as long as it s in a descendant class

2265768
protected	public
1st one is fine in your 2nd sample using public protected you just break that.

2265770
getter	setter
second example is an automatic properties and is generally used .when you don t have any logic in getter and setter

2265771
jax-ws	cxf
if you want an apache axis2 -like experience with cxf under eclipse you can install the jax-ws tools project

2265774
getter	setter
for the most part in applications i ve written if the getter and setter aren t more complicated than your examples you probably want to minimize the code as much as possible for reliability .so the shorthand approach is very useful

2265774
getter	setter
on the other hand if you implements more complicated logic in the getter and setter for example validation or parsing of some sort you want to make sure that no user class bypasses your logic

2265774
protected	public
you know the difference between private protected and public and thus you also know what you can and cannot do with your class depending on which one you choose

2265776
execute	prepare
but before the business-logic was execute those controls was either blank or contains dummy-text prepare for translation

2265783
contains	elements
in fpml there is the product.model grouping which simply contains two elements producttype and productid

2265787
contains	any
system.componentmodel.container automatically dispose of any components it contains in its dispose methods

2265791
python	ruby
edit i know this can be done using ruby or even python

2265793
uiscrollview	subviews
put your view as a subviews in uiscrollview and set scrollview s contentsize to fit your large page

2265796
url-encoding	url
in this case the url is .post url-encoding

2265798
sql-server	mysql
sql-server implements this algorithm for its spatial indexes rather than r-tree that mysql uses

2265810
rollback	commit
especially if your service-layer methods call multiple fine-grained repository methods and expect them to either all commit or all rollback

2265826
matplotlib	networkx
i do not think there is such pure python libs the best you can do is use networkx it can draw using matplotlib or pygraphviz

2265826
matplotlib	networkx
maybe you can modify networkx s matplotlib code to draw on server side here is the code

2265828
constructor	object
i have tried to do this but i keep getting the following error implicit reference to object under construction is not valid .when calling another constructor

2265830
export	report
if you want to display the data in excel .so you can do .sorts filtering etc. then you could store the data in access as has been suggested then instead of export a report every time you want to use it link your excel file to access using a database query

2265842
implements	abstract
rather than take a delegation is there any reason not to specify an abstract methods in the base-class and implements it in the concrete class

2265847
subclassing	inherited	shipping	tax
for example if the discount and the tax and the shipping methods all varied depending on the types of item then it s definitely time to consider inherited and subclassing where you d say this subtyping of item has this tax and this discount and this shipping

2265852
databound	formview
currently i have a dropdownlistfor inside a formview databound to an objectdatasource

2265863
constructor	object
you can t pass something belonging to concreteclass because the object is still under construction .when calling the constructor of the base-class

2265866
constructor	object
during the base-class constructor only the base-class parts of the object are complete -- it s really just a base-class object until the concreteclass constructor completes

2265873
button	popup
i am having a button on a modal popup div

2265875
panels	grid
i ve got a panels grid with a richfaces support object and underneath that an action parameter object

2265875
selected	button
the action parameter lets the support tag know which button panelgrid is selected and perform an action on it in the backing bean

2265881
attributes	properties
you could put the data inside the properties attributes which will be stroing your line one after another

2265892
data-annotations	xval
i ve been working on an application that uses xval s server side validation with data-annotations

2265892
required	checked
we recently ran into errors where the validation messages have been unpredictable for field that have multiple validation that could fail if the field is-empty an email-address is required but also fails a validity checked

2265944
tokenize	parsing
what you need is a tokenize and a parsing

2265957
entity-relationship	diagram
supports sequences diagram class entity-relationship usecase etc

2265958
python	perl
the example below is in perl but you can do the same thing in python

2266008
instances	self
instances-variabless begin with a single sign and are accessible whenever self evaluates to the instances that eh instances variables was defined in normally within instances methods

2266008
class-variables	subclassing
class-variables begin with a sign and are acessible whenever inside the class that first defined them or any of its subclassing or any of their instances

2266038
unique	words
if it s not really unique words then i would suggest the next approach

2266039
value	field
also if any of the input is typed against the validation criterion and submitted then the remaining form field value are not cleared at all and proper messages is display

2266063
.when	ready
.when systemd shuts down .when caching is being saved i get the device is not ready

2266071
error-code	hresult
for exception-handling-handling that do not have an associated sql error numbers you may be able to use the windows hresult error-code that will be in the error-code properties of the exception-handling object

2266123
arrays	loops
this can be done in this simple case using to retieve an arrays which you can parsing using two loops

2266134
radio-button	selected
a selected box is different to a radio-button it doesn t have a checked attributes

2266140
postback	ajax
this approach was especially useful .when doing a mixture of standards postback and ajax callback may not be particularly useful to wpf apps though

2266140
error-logging	logging
another thing i should mention is to make sure your error-logging is relatively bulletproof - there is nothing worse than your exception-handling logging process throw an exception-handling and losing all the valuable details of that tricky bug you are trying to tracking down for that irate user

2266150
any	set
is there any specific events where i am sure that deepzoom tile stuff is completed .so that after that only i can set filesystemwatcher stuff

2266163
value	field
field are changed and set to appropriate value

2266163
jquery	.post
these value are obtained from server-side asp.net page using jquery s .post .... methods

2266181
mediarecorder	audiorecord
this is why i use the class audiorecord and not the mediarecorder recording only to file

2266181
subtract	time
not guaranteed and you must subtract a security time inorder not to loose audio

2266212
contains	elements
say you want to printing the 10 first elements of the list if there is 10 or more or what it contains otherwise

2266213
gridview	listview
the listview s view is based on the gridview one of the column contains a checkbox

2266223
reflection	runtime
second i know that with reflection it s possible to change a class in runtime and re-compile back to runtime

2266237
any	set
now in this set up i want to find the teamname that has scored maximum points for any given event eid

2266244
subclassing	base-class
there is a base-class in java one only with protected constructor and optional declare as abstract which will be subclassing in client code

2266244
subclassing	base-class
each templates methods represents a high level operation implements in the base-class itself in terms of the primitive operations which are meant to be implements overrides in each specific subclassing

2266244
implements	abstract
a primitive operation methods which represents a step in the algorithm should be non-public but overridable protected in java and can be of two types a an abstract methods which must be implements in the subclassing

2266244
subclassing	base-class
simply having a base-class with methods that get overrides in a subclassing a much more common situation in my experience is not enough by itself to qualify as an application of the pattern

2266276
spring	guice	wicket	spring
if you like the do-it-all-in-java philosophy that wicket follows then you might prefer guice over spring

2266279
order	join
however if you mix different collations in a join or union the cast order is not guaranteed

2266288
textures	fbo
all the difference in code is the lod level parameter for attaching a textures onto the fbo

2266296
jquery	.post
i have 2 functions .post jquery how to make the 2nd .post carried out only after the loading of the first .post completely finished

2266300
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my .app i have an uitabbarcontroller with uinavigationcontroller initializer like this

2266300
selected	cell
the problem comes now in my newsviewcontroller i have a tableview .when i touch a cell i want to push a uiviewcontroller with the selected news and in the navigation bar to show the title

2266300
hide	show
the navigation item is not null because i can call and it hide the backbutton every time but the title isn t show

2266304
double	int
but as long as the warnings are about things that are handled identically by both compilers such as int double conversions it can be ignore

2266311
contains	sorted
physically the leaf nodes of the b-tree contains all of your table s data in sorted order

2266320
pixels	line
it s slow but at high resolution it may still be faster than count pixels because the cost of count pixels grows quadratically with resolution but the numbers of line segments on the perimeter grows linearly.

2266354
widget	button
the widget is essentially three button laid out horizontally with

2266370
value	field
the reason for this is that .when you deal with object from the database in code it is common to have the identity value stored in an int types field

2266370
value	field
in some programming languages i m speaking with c# and java experience the default-value for uninitialised int field is 0 meaning that if the identity field was not set in code you would get the same value as that of a row in the database with an identity of 0

2266379
contains	set
it should also contains a selected list of available color options with the selecteded value set to the currently selecteded id

2266382
required	checked
now here is the code to checked if a tag already exists or not and entering the tag into the database and the required associations

2266391
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight - prism - resources for beginners

2266408
configuration	environment
i feel like i must be missing a dead-easy setting or configuration file here within either textmate or the r environment it call to run my scripting

2266421
constructor	object
the linkedblockingqueue that is passed to the constructor is actually the very object that you will get back from getqueue

2266423
contains	elements
you would have to add something to distinguish the li elements themselves like a class on all li elements that contains links

2266423
contains	elements
if you can use jquery you could add the class to the li elements that contains anchor tags

2266442
openrasta	wcf
this is purely my ho but i strongly recommend you to try out openrasta instead of added-as-an-afterthought-to-a-rpc-based-framework rest support in wcf

2266460
export	report
export to different formats works great as well except the format i made the report for

2266496
json	xml
it s an open source web service framework that lets your create rest-full json and xml web-services without any endpoint configuration service or operation contracts - using only poco datacontract

2266514
revision	svn
svn export copies all the versioned files from the given directory in the repository at the given revision default head and copies them to your local machine but produces a standards directory hierachy

2266518
compact-framework	.net
this is all with .net the compact-framework i believe c# and windows-mobile professional 6.1 by the way

2266545
groovy	java
the difference between java and groovy are less than the difference between ruby and groovy .so if you know both ruby and java it probably makes more sense to look for a groovy for java programmers book or tutorial

2266551
directory-structure	subdirectories
i m trying to replicate the entire directory-structure with subdirectories intact

2266554
django-forms	django
i m using django-forms to do a filtering faceted search via .post and i would like to django s paginator class to organize the results

2266554
postdata	request
in other words it seems that i lose the postdata as soon as i pass the get request for another page back to my views

2266555
hide	show
simply handle the event and resize hide show your controls

2266574
keyword	lexical
i normally start by providing a meaningful named to my lexical and grammar tokens using the paraphrase keyword

2266575
object-reference	instances
.when i call my action i get an system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object which tells me that forms-authentication object is null and i therefore can not set my authentication ticket

2266579
groovy	java
i evaluated all 3 major java ides for groovy grails development about 6 months ago and intellij-idea was far ahead of the other two

2266592
literals	hardcode
string literalss go in a pool but i wouldn t expect the passwd to be a literals hardcode in the program

2266596
click	mouse
the idea is that you make your labels listen to the mouserightbuttonup event which is fired .when the user release the right mouse button after click to open the context menu

2266636
click	mouse
it ll look like a link and you ll avoid some problems you get with anchor - user will be able to click on it by a mouse wheel and open that link in a new tab windows

2266642
realloc	malloc
after freeing it can i initializer it to null and make it points to some new location using malloc or realloc

2266642
realloc	malloc
the rea.son i used realloc in-place of malloc is because all my realloc call are in a loops .so instead of sizeof nodes in the second arguments it is actually n sizeof nodes where n keeps on incrementing.

2266642
arrays	loops
and the last location in this resultant arrays is written with new data where the memory pointsed to by pointers keeps on increasing until loops ends at which points i do not required the data in the memory pointsed to by pointers .so i think it best to free it

2266649
directory	folder
i need to create a file directory in the common application data folder that will be shared across all account

2266649
directory	folder
if i create the file directory as admin i have no problem but if i create the file directory as a user the file directory goes into the virtualized folder for the user s account

2266653
realloc	malloc
and since realloc acts like malloc .when it s passed a null-pointer it should work just fine

2266656
any	set
i set up gamekit in my application it will successfully search and connect to another device without any problems

2266660
callback	methods
i m also assuming that all of the possible concrete types for sender expose the same set of properties and methodss--as far as your callback methods is concerned

2266660
callback	methods
that would improve the reliability of your callback methods

2266660
callback	methods
again assuming all sender classes are treated the same by your callback you can use system.reflection in your wrapper class to invoke the appropriate methods or access the appropriate properties

2266663
powermockito	jmockit
you could use powermockito or jmockit

2266666
jquery-plugins	jquery
i would however suggest that instead of writing functions that take jquery object as parameters you write those functions as your very own jquery-plugins

2266677
stderr	stdout
here is the stdout and stderr

2266697
sql-server-express	sql-server
you might know .when you install vs2005 2008 with sql-server-express edition the sql-server operates in windows-authentication mode by default

2266704
contains	elements
for a small numbers of elements then a foreach loops with a contains call should do the trick

2266730
configuration	installation
i think you could solve your problem making a silent installation of sql-server-express edition using a configuration file for the install process

2266737
version-control	git
i m in process of integration git version-control systemd into 3ds max to control .max file versioning

2266745
eager-loading	eager
i m eager-loading a logentry and then eager-loading a gamefile for each eager loaded logentry

2266755
widget	button
i am not aware of a button bar widget in the android sdk

2266768
value	field
you have to building an arrays with only the value of the field you want to filtering you next query on

2266784
dependency-injection	singleton
i highly recommend moving away from singleton as a design pattern and using singleton as a scoping dependency-injection

2266784
powermockito	jmockit
if you are testing the dependant item then you can mock the singleton using powermockito and jmockit

2266785
moss	wss
how do i tell if a sharepoint class is specific to wss or moss

2266816
directory	folder
if you set the rights of everything including directory to 644 744 nobody except the owner will be able to browse the directory-structure of particular folder

2266826
children	nodes
i want to search through all the children of a root nodes

2266839

several rdbms i thinks at least mysql ans ms sql-server use the 0xâ â â â notation where you put 0x + your binary bytes in hexadecimal pairs matches id a

2266855
e-commerce	product
if the core search only searches webpage and i want the search to also search product in the e-commerce module how can it add the product search and its contents to the original search methods s return list

2266865
subclassing	accessor
i would like my instances classes to be able to use an accessor named cgi to get the cgi object associated with the current instances of my cgi application subclassing

2266865
subclassing	inherited
this is working as i think it should and i cannot see any problems say if i wanted to inherited from my merhaba subclassing need not know anything about merhaba

2266902
any	set
if any of the email addresses are key in your caching set as the value of that key in your dictionary

2266908
entity-framework	ado.net	entity	poco
i want to manually map my entity classes poco to the database tables usin ado.net entity-framework using the xml mapping file

2266908
entity-framework	ado.net
is it possible to do .so as i have heard there is no poco support in ado.net entity-framework for vs2008 am i right

2266915
haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
i started learning scala a few days ago and .when learning it i am comparing it with other functional-programming languages like haskell erlang which i had some familiarity with

2266917
sql-server	oracle
having used sql-server 2008 change-tracking feature i m looking for a similar solution for oracle

2266921
subclassing	superclass
but if the class is extended i assumed this would return the named of the subclassing but it still returns the named of the superclass which i find kind of odd

2266929
implements	extends
using a jtable the traditional way to create such a table would be to have a class implements tablemodel or extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

2266955
windows-xp	windows
.when windows-xp rendering it it is fine but .when windows 7 rendering it all 4 corners have an odd white border around them

2266961
any	set
a maven repo perhaps managed by a repo manager like nexus not exactly distribute but made to reference precise versioning of any kind of set of files

2267012
configurationsection	web-config
creating class that inherited configurationsection that map the settings in web-config file

2267083
.net	wcf
the system.web.extensions elements enables you to configure asp.net applications that can be used by ajax-enabled clients windows communication foundation wcf clients soap clients and .net clients

2267087
callback	methods
you will get the intent in the onstart callback methods which you would need to overrides

2267095
json	xml
make use of xmlhttprequest in javascript to fire an asynchronous request to a servlet during the onchange event of the 1st dropdown let the servlet get the selected item of the 1st dropdown as request parameter let it obtain the associated value of the 2nd dropdown from the database return it back as xml or json string

2267095
javascript	dom
finally let javascript display the value in the 2nd dropdown through the html dom tree the ajax way as suggested before

2267096
selected	button
function only be called .when the checkedbox is checkeded on off by a click or keypress what i want or if i progromatically checked unchecked a lot of checkedbox with a selected unselected alll button will it then call the onchange function for all of the checkedbox what i don t want

2267129
xsd	xml
then run the tool again on this xsd schema file with the correct options sorry don t have visual-studio on this machine to checked right now and it will create either a typed dataset c# class file or vb.net class file that you can use to deserialize your xml data

2267140
selected	button
.when a button is selected the set methods would be called to set the package variables of selected to that instances

2267142
mouseleave	mousemove
turns out after mouseleave mousemove is called again therefore the result im experiencing

2267149
datamatrix	barcode
the various barcode formats pdf417 aztec datamatrix specify a way to encode data be it numerical alphabetic or binary.

2267170
selected	button
then i loops through the button .when the event is received and set selected if the event.target is the same as the current button in loopss

2267190
sequences	unique
your .solution isn t unique because things can happen .so fast in the systemd that two process either running in sequences or concurrently can get the same tick value

2267195
sql-server	oracle	value	field
in sql-server this would be an identity field and in oracle it would be a field that uses a sequences to generator a new value

2267200
numeric	digits
can anyone suggest compression algorithms to operate on numeric strings of 20-30 digits

2267217
mp3	wma
i see i can get mp3 tags ogg mp4 wma etc

2267227
directory	folder
stat.h is available under the sys folder try to #include it from there or add it to the list of include directory

2267234
factors	primes
it s quicker to get the primes factorisation then calculate the sum of all factors from that than it is to loops all the way up to sqrt n for every numbers

2267248
contains	any
you don t want users to know that foo s implementation contains a bar and you don t want users to be able to create their own bar and pass it through foo s constructor any other methods or a configuration file

2267266
sql-server	ms-access
i am working on replacing an old ms-access systemd with an sql-server one with a c# front end

2267266
sql-server	ms-access
unfortunately i have some die hard ms-access users who will be accessing the sql-server tables from ms-access but to them it should essentially look the same

2267266
sql-server	ms-access
i have tried replicating the relationships in sql-server with ones in ms-access but it had no effect

2267272
32-bit	64bit
i would definitely go for the easiest solution and just store them as int of a suitable size be it 32-bit 64bit or 128bit depending on needs

2267280
postgresql	mysql
most sql databases mysql postgresql etc. operate via a client-server architecture .so you re not embedding or linking to the database code in your program and thus you don t have to use a license compatible with those database systemd

2267285
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in google-chrome firefox and opera the onchange handler occurs immediately after the user changes the checked state

2267299
instances	private	protected	public
to get all properties public + private protected internal static + instances of a given types sometypes maybe using gettypes to get sometypes

2267317
selected	checkbox
if you want to apply this to all forums click the checkbox that says selected all

2267349
linux	bsd
you can even cross-compiling your windows-installer on linux bsd or mac os x.

2267356
json	xml
i would start with a strongly-typed dto class first preferably a datacontract that way you get the choice to serialization it to any format you want json xml protobuf etc

2267382
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
.so you would use any simple sieve an augmented versioning of the sieve-of-eratosthenes to find the primes up to n and in the process the factorisation of all numbers up to n

2267382
factors	primes
for example as you do your sieve store the smallest primes factors of each n

2267392
constructor	private	instances	private
having a static-class means you know there are no instances but back in 1.1 having a private constructor sufficed

2267398

2267676
positioning	slider	toggle	slider
i m creating a custom on off toggle switching for the iphone similar to the standards switching and i m at the points where i m setting the mask of the slider but calling sets the positioning of the mask layer relative to the layer it s masking not relative to the containers layer of the mask layer

2267676
positioning	slider	contains	set	toggle	slider
for this particular scenario the positioning of the mask layer needs to be set relative to it s contains layer because the toggle slider will move underneath the mask and the mask should stay stationary

2267732
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
that example page should work in firefox and google-chrome and i think safari and it half-works in ie8 only half because of course we couldn t have expected microsoft to get -ms-border-box to work properly

2267744
buffering	streaming
i have used streaming as it should be efficient and should not be buffering in memory of server

2267744
webserver	upload
1 i am having doubts that the entire file is upload to the webserver and then it is transfer to wcf service server...if this is true then i am not getting advantage of streaming as well as iis and webserver will be down very soon if user upload large file or multiple user are upload files con currently

any string containss in any positioning other than at the beginning of the string which is not a redirection is a variable-assignment while any string that is not a redirection and does not contains is a cmd

2268125
linux	unix
on many unix linux systemd if my memory serves you could use the co checkout cmd straight from the cmd-line

2268125
revision	rcs
or you could take advantage of the fact that cvs and rcs store the latest versioning of the file on head near the top of the file and any other revision are created by applying diff internally

2268133
.when	ready
i recall that .when vs2008 was release r# wasn t quite ready and there was griping among the .net community about it

2268551
python	lua
have you considered embedding a scripting-language such as lua or python into your .app

2268594
default-value	arguments
personally i would use explicit arguments unless i had a strong sane default-value that tons of functions used that i planned to very rarely or never rebind

2268603
exception-handling	try-catch	rollback	commit
a common pattern is to have an autocommit false the default scopedsession in a module and wrap any business-logic execution in a try-catch clause that rollback in case of exception-handling and commit if the methods succeeded then finally call session.remove

2268609
executable	upx
technically it is possible to embed some other executable files in your exe some packers like upx do it

2268618
value	field
i would like to access all the value of a table tr id field

2268642
value	field
i would suggest that if you want to provide an initial value for a field you do .so in your subclassing form s definition

2268650
controllers	routes
you have controllers variables in the routes and then you say that controllers should be bound to recipes

2268665

you could also implements the row expander ux on the grid which behaves like a tree sort of for each row

2268668
subclassing	superclass
and .when i need it pull up that is make a methods on a subclassing be a methods on the superclass instead is really nice to have

i was wondering what is the quickest way of storing a with an int index in java without using maps treemap arraylist etc

2268738
expression	evaluation
conversion as if by assignment to the types of the function is required if the return expression has a different types than the function but not if the return expression has a wider value only because of wide evaluation

2268746
profiling	debugging
see for information on debugging disabling apparmor profiling

2268756
decimal-point	digits
to get three digits of fractions i might say convert x and then insert the decimal-point as a string operation

if the program declare or defined an

2268781
constructor	object
convenience constructor like +objectwithâ return autoreleased object

2268782
subclassing	superclass
li superclass must use super if their subclassing do

2268793
json	xml	controllers	routes
the other option i m thinking about is using asp.net-mvc adding some custom routes add a few controllers actions and using different views to push out json xml and other return types

2268807
asp.net-mvc	wcf
normally i would say wcf for any kind of hosted serice but in the specific case for restful service using json as a serialization mechanism i prefer asp.net-mvc which i will refer to as asp.net for the remainder of this answer

2268814
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve seen other questions such as is it possible to read the clipboard contents in firefox safari and google-chrome using javascript

2268910
asp.net-mvc	wcf
the implementor of originally implements the atompub specifications in wcf and then rewrote the entire service using asp.net-mvc

2268914
postgresql	mysql
assuming that the queries are as simple as you have indicated a simple sql db postgresql mysql possibly h2 would be perfect for this

2268940
handler	service
if they do not required the analytics code block as a conditional of service then you may be able to block their snippet from running by altering the tag s event handler via jquery that they use to fire their code

2268957
windows-server	windows	compatibility	platform
you haven t mentioned what your windows platform limitations are but if you don t need compatibility with older versioning than windows-server 2003 or vista on the client side you can use the interlockedexchange64 function to exchange a 64bit value

2268957
32-bit	64bit
by packing two 32-bit pointers into a 64bit pair structure you can effectively swap two pointers

2268974
dictionary	arrays
you re doing an o 1 lookup for each dictionary in the arrays

2268974
contains	set
if you have a huge numbers of dictionary this might get expensive .so you could consider depending very much on the semantics of your data keeping a separate lookaside nsset that contains the set of string object comprising all the value in the dictionary

2268980
fflush	gets
you should try using them as show in the spring nhibernate sample and activate logging to really see if the session gets fflush

2268983
any	set
i ve been running this for over 8 months on an application that gets a moderate numbers of asynchronous postback per hour 1000 and i haven t run into any problems with asyncpostbacktimeout set to 300 seconds

2268987
base-class	inherited
it s not instantly obvious as we re all used to the idea that if any two object inherited from the same base-class then their implementation are the same and they will behave in exactly the same way assuming no customisation in the inheriteding class

2268987
attributes	properties
for example you can set a resize view from nib attributes in ib s view controllers object - but i can find no equivalent properties or methods in the uiviewcontrollers reference docs

2268995
background-image	width
if the width is going to be fixed why not use a single background-image for each of the three rows

2269003

edit to clarify i want to create a video dvd to play movie on a dvd player

2269014
checkbox	textbox
it has a textbox and a checkbox in the item templates

2269014
selected	checkbox
is there a way i can access the checkbox and enable disable it on selected index changed

2269016
value	field
and then you ll add some code to your javascript function to set the value of the corresponding mytimestamp field

2269032
value	field
it makes sense to do this as i expect all the field in aa types object to be copy-paste to the newly created bb types object and the extravariable in the bb types object i would will just assign a value to it later after the copy on my own time

2269078
derived-class	base-class
is it possible to assign a base-class object to a derived-class reference with an explicit typecast in c#

2269094
put	get
with put .post or get it works great

2269098
mstest	nunit
in most cases using some kind of unit-testing framework mstest nunit etc as others have mentioned will give you better return on your time investment

2269116

there s no way anyone can give good advice without knowing something about the allocation runtime environment execution characteristics etc. etc

2269119
innodb	myisam
converting table from myisam to innodb

2269120
getter	setter
the user table is tied through hibernate to a domain-object in my application class user which has the following attributes and corresponding getter and setter which correspond to columns in the user table except for the collections which is explained later

2269128
jquery	.post
i can t find anything in the rfc but it stands to rea.son that there is no way to pass parameters using the delete methods - only in get and .post .so either jquery or the browser correctly filtering out the parameters

2269137
swfupload	plupload
though it s only a single file upload some other project like swfupload and plupload aim to provide multiple file upload but are much larger project and i feel too bulky and take too long to setup on top of the fact that they really aren t that seamless you ll be jumping through hoops on the backend

2269144
attributes	properties
in other words i can t just compose each viewmodel with a model--i need my viewmodel to have only the properties and attributes that should be consumed by the view and the view can t burrow into sub-properties to get at the value

2269144
attributes	properties
note that in my example above the displayname attributes for the category properties would need to be written twice because the data types of the properties is different between the display and edit viewmodel

2269144
attributes	properties
this isn t going to be a big deal on a small scale but as the size and complexity of a project scale up imagine a lot more properties more attributes per properties more views per model there is still the potentially for repeat yourself a fair amount

2269155
innodb	myisam
andrew there are lots of difference between myisam and innodb the least of which is the fact that they are controlled by different configuration options in the mysql conf

2269155
innodb	myisam
there is also the fact that innodb is acid compliant unlike myisam

2269156
postgresql	oracle
i have two selected statements that i am trying to ports from oracle to postgresql

2269210
button	popup
.so i am trying to make it .so a user click a button to email me a javascript alert box popup with a messages and then after they click ok it goes forwarding with the email link

2269229
multiplication	addition
i usually use a combinations of addition of a small fixed amount and multiplication by 1.5 because it is efficent to implements and leads to reasonable step widths which are bigger at first and more memory sensible .when the buffering grows

2269230
textmate	vim
what i m looking for are some suggestions of vim resources and plugins if that s the right terminology to closely emulate the features i am unwilling to give up in textmate

2269236
asp.net-mvc	wcf
here is a a thought that may help you make the decision between asp.net-mvc and wcf

2269236
asp.net-mvc	wcf
you can do rest in asp.net-mvc and you can do it in wcf but with those solutions you will not fall into the pit of success

2269242
32-bit	64bit
it doesn t work if the user is running a 32-bit jvm on a 64bit systemd

2269242
solaris	linux
for other operating systemd like linux or solaris or mac we may see this problem as well

2269242
solaris	linux
but linux and solaris etc

2269242
32-bit	64bit
they may still use a 32-bit jvm on their 64bit systemd

2269264
textmate	vim
i m currently in a similar positioning to you moving from textmate to vim

2269271
assign	add
the setqueryhelperpanels methods does not work because it removes the existing panels from the collections of children of this via the remove methods but then does not use add to add the new panels - assign it to the instances variables does not cause it to become a child

2269303
numeric	digits
i can get the numeric reference 3 digits like this

2269308
updating	updates
the problem with this is that you are updating the structure on the server side but it doesn t equate an updates on the client

2269313
haskell	ocaml
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libs are avaliable via hackage .so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factors

2269318
jquery	.post
you are going to have to expose and endpoint url in your systemd which will accept the .post request from the ajax call in jquery

2269318
json	xml
then .when process that url from php you would call your function and return the result in the appropriate format json most likely or xml if you prefer

2269342
microsoft-ui-automation	white
i m aware of but haven t tried yet the open source white project for .net however that of course only works on windows since it has a dependency on the microsoft-ui-automation framework

i basically want a function that can map from a pair of placename address latitude-longitude tuples to 0 1 confidence that they refer to the same real-world location

2269438
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i want every new versioning of the install to be a major upgrade full uninstall then new install as we don t want different upgrade and clean install versioninging

2269443
value	field
the weird part is that .when i debugging this line of code it always has the same value in the field even .when the resulting image is different

2269449
any	set
.so if you building a custom coverflowcontainer component and measuredwidth measuredheight aren t set because measure was not overrides then if you don t specify any sizing on coverflowcontainer it would be 0 width 0 height

2269454
contains	any
if not are there any other compressed formats that don t contains these empty headers

2269477
gzip	zip
since you are doing gzip and not zip you need only ionic.zlib.dll not ionic.zip.dll

2269489
default	reset
both call have a try-catch that place some default value but the value need to be able to reset from our application

2269511
traffic	packets
the reason is to reduce network traffic by limiting the numbers of packets that are sent

2269515
haskell	python
i actually think haskell has quite a different feel from python overall but that is primarily because of the extremely powerful static types systemd

2269520
average	min	average	max
within that site the most useful tidbit is that you can do sum count min max avg average stdev statistical standards deviation and variables

2269523
deployment	install
as far as i remember the express edition do not provide tools for deployment but still there are many free install that can do the trick

2269523
inno-setup	nsis
you may want to try nsis or inno-setup for example

2269531

one can then use in the .m file to automatically create the setter getter

2269542
.when	ready
i need to know .when this iframe is ready .so i can manipulate its dom

2269547
scala	java
one of the great things about scala is that you can leverage off existing java libs

2269557
hash	md5
after i d met the performance troubles i tried to add index on arguments column but found that i must to specify length .so to avoid this limitation i added a new int column contains hash value md5 or else of arguments column value

2269560
superclass	inherited
keep in mind though that modifiers do play a role here private declare methods in a superclass won t get overrides as they aren t inherited by extending-classes

2269570
put	get
right now you would have to make a much more specific regular expression to get the value of each key-value pairs and put them into the replace

2269578
attributes	properties
i have a methods attributes which expects several properties to be inject by ninject 2 but usersession and jobrepository are coming up as null

2269578
attributes	properties
that doesn t help me much for attributes though that need to use properties injection

2269579

the android-emulator is working perfectly adb can see it i can even logcat from it but it can t push or pull anything from it

2269585
textbox	button
inside the updatepanel is a textbox and a button

2269585
textbox	button
.when i enter something in the textbox and click the button i am unable to retrieve the text in the textbox

2269587
spaces	output
in that case you ll have to fool with xmodmap or write your own usr shared x11 xkb files to tell x to output something different .when you press ctrl - spaces

2269587
spaces	output
.so you could tell urxvt to output 033i_typed_control_spaces_dammit .when you press ctrl - spaces

2269612
associations	model
in associations between different model one can avoid setting foreign key ids directly by using fixtures named as in this answer

2269615

to set field value with an expression

2269616
directory	folder
also if i try to delete the folder i used to upload to windows tells me cannot remove foldoer the directory is not empty

2269640
textbox	button
or on a button click if you want to display a modal windows with this textbox and a button you can try something like this

2269648
arguments	default
here you re passing the function only one arguments â an arrayâ .so the second parameter in foo default to 0

2269655
text-classification	scoring
as to a sequences being well-written some work has been done on automatically evaluation reliability cohesion and coherence the articles by miltsakaki evaluation of text coherence for electronics essay scoring systemd and real-time web text-classification and analysis of reading difficulty or higgins evaluation multiple aspects of coherence in student essays

output	mode
i d like to have this information dumped to the output windows of visual-studio 2008 while in debugging mode and ignore if not in debugging mode

2269663
design-time	designer
it will give you a design-time experience for configurationuration sections in your application generator the class code for you from the designer as well as templates for putting them in your configuration file as well

2269685
output	mode
also because you are making the call to the debugging class .when you are not in debugging mode the output wont be output because of the conditional attributes on the methods of the debugging class

2269709
selected	button
note in the add existing item dialog the add button has a small drop down image drop it down and then selected add as link

2269712
selected	cell
selected a range of cell and then click cell on the format menu

2269712
selected	cell
this methods allows you to types data in the selected cell as text

2269714
for-loop	arrays
a previous for-loop using the i variables to populate the arrays was written the same way and execute as expected

2269720
constructor	object
my question is can i somehow instruct the inversion-of-control containers to look at a certain runtime value the organizationid of the logged on user in this case to determine which implementation of the iworkorderprocessor to inject into the constructor of the object that needs it

2269725
for-loop	arrays
a different for-loop to populate the arrays was written the same way and execute as expected

2269729
temporary	copy
to achieve what you want you just need to create a temporary copy of i increment it using the prefix ++ and then use the resultant value to initializer j

2269736
xsd	xml
i find oxygen xml editor very useful for everything xml xslt xsd related

2269736
xsd	xml
it can generator xml structure from both xslt and xsd and have a good attempt at building xslt and xsd from an xml document

2269753
arrays	loops
it building a stdclass object or associativity arrays from json which you can them loops over to your hearts content

2269781
json	xml
if you leave out the format json part it will get returned as xml

2269790
selected	cell
i believe all you need to do is set .value on the cell and it will automatically set the selected item

2269790
selected	cell
you could loops over all the cell and set them to their previously selected value

2269797
textbox	button
within the updatepanel i have a textbox and a button that submit the content back to the server

2269797
textbox	button
however .when the button s click event is fired the value for the textbox is consistently empty even if text was entered

2269802
any	set
but you could set it to any url you please

2269804
selected	cell
basically you have to add the selected value to the the items collections of the cell and then set the value to the added value

2269804
selection	cell
that is how to handle setting the value of the cell based on the selection

2269804
selected	cell
if you handle the editingcontrolshowing event of the datagridview you can get access to the combobox control .when it is click and set the selected item to the current value of the cell before it is draw for the user

2269810
factorization	primes
i already have primes factorization for int but now i want to implements it for gaussian int but how should i do it

question how does the .app know whether it s ok to send messages to the user since .app engine does communication anything to .app about the user s response to the invitation

2269820
interface-builder	iboutlet
if it s not doing anything at all then almost certainly productsearchbar is an iboutlet and you ve forgotten to actually tie it to the uisearchbar in interface-builder

2269824
put	get
the 3 depend on the order that i put the items in while in this order item1 item3 item5 get left which leads me to believe that its the remove that is messed up

2269829
while-loop	loops
for loops are merely syntaxic sugar for the while-loop below

2269836
decimal	hex
you seem to be mixing decimal representations of int and hex representations of int .so it s not entirely clear what you need

2269838
invoices	product
the database holds all the invoices customer and product information

2269853
contains	elements
parent elements are never to expand to contains floated children

2269853
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure google-chrome is doing anything wrong though firefox is different but i don t have time to look at it further right now

2269854
communication	messages
.so the .app does communication with the user on the other end it just doesn t relay the messages only that i m interested in being chat-buddies

2269856
children	nodes
children arrays of child nodes

2269867
jquery	.post

silverlight	wpf
program manager wpf silverlight designer team visual-studio

2269877
contains	elements
updatedraw will of course contains zero elements at this points

2269880
associations	model
although i think you could setup associations to accomplish this i think the easiest way to do it would be to add a methods to your user model that allows you to checked for each user this way it would fit in loops you have provided

2269889
enumerate	next
then move onto the next left subtree enumerate through the right subtrees and .so on

2269890
gtk2hs	gtk
i am attempting to fix the size of a widget in gtk specifically using gtk2hs with haskell

silverlight	wpf
program manager wpf silverlight designer visual-studio

2269910
contains	lookup
a third way which is more in keeping with steve mcconnell s observation that it s easier to debugging data than code is to defined a lookup table that contains predicates to use for testing sequences rows

2269918
libjpeg	libpng	libjpeg	cimg	libpng	cimg
i al.so don t want to use a libs except if it is very very lightweight i used cimg for a while but i wasn t very happy with its speed .so i ended up writing the important functions myself and just using libjpeg and libpng directly

2269919
put	get
it will printing 3.432 just like i want but if i try to put that same value dec into a json object what i get in the json is decimal 3.432

2269923

2269933
lighttpd	apache
i can use apache lighttpd or nginx servers

2269955

you could compute the count .when needed by walking from the tail to the head or just store the count separately increment it .whenever you add a value to the head and decrement it .whenever you advance the tail

2269991
redmine	trac
take a look at redmine very good project-management application built-in ruby-on-rails you ve also got trac which is built-in python

2269993
haskell	ocaml
ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random-access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

2269993
haskell	ocaml
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy-evaluation

2269995
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome etc you need npapi

2269998
sql-server	mysql
like say php and mysql shared 50 articles or whatever the main content being tagged is while php and sql-server might have 3 and php and apache have 25

2269998
sql-server	mysql
.so given php you d want to return mysql and apache in that order possibly letting sql-server fall to the wayside

2269999
json	xml
if i were trying to building some sort of dynamic javascripty documentation systemd i could well imagine choosing to use json as the way to get documentation from the backend out to the client in a manageable format if for some reason html or xml didn t seem like the better option

2270011
exception-handling	try-catch
there is no exception-handling as this part is within try-catch

2270018
configuration	installation
just wanted to add that the above will skip iis configuration on uninstaller regardless of installation state

2270024
python	ruby
with that you could write an os-dependent yet fairly simple scripting shell ruby python etc. that recursively checked some directory for .air files by named and if they weren t found your startup .app could say sorry we haven t found these two .apps x and y

2270025

low-level	hardware
rim dosen t allow low-level access to their hardware for security reason

2270071
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
to do something like what you re describing i would create a ruby php python scripting or whatever send a restful get http-request to that scripting say get shared_folders and have that search the os for what it needs and return it as xml

2270077
if-statement	loops
in the if-statement inside the while-loops to display the information from page2.php that required from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loops don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while-loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detection weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2270166
directory	folder	folder	dir
seeing my .app hasnt changed and the dir being printed out hasnt changed and my .app is currently ignoring passed strings why is the folder now being created in a new directory

2270170
ftpwebrequest	ftp
i have tried using ftpwebrequest and my experience of using that was negative...slow timeout because quite naturally the ftpwebrequest works through ports 80 instead of the native ports 21 ...the situation changed quite dramatically .when i used this ftp component more versatile and powerful.

2270222
invoices	product
for example given what you ve describe you might have an invoices schema a customer schema and a product schema

2270222
invoices	product
all invoices related object would go into the invoices schema all customer related object would go into the customer schema and the same for product

2270229

i d put the calculations into ssis but leave the queries as stored-procedures

2270248
append	input
append the the original input

2270253
gridview	formview
.when i was getting started with formview and gridview i manually added the primary key-value using a hidden-field and had the datakeynames attributes sent and i think that caused the value to be sent to the stored procedure twice instead of once

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
the problem occurs within the setinterval settimeout javascript functions

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
after sending the email or tapping cancel the timer is left paused and the settimeout setinterval functions will not fire

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
this will break any thing that relies on settimeout setinterval such as jquery animation and any async ajax call since jquery uses setinterval to poll until the request returns i ve hit this problem myself

2270303
arrays	map
what is the best way to map value of an arrays to a function

2270314
put	get
i understand that if you put a response.redirect inside a try-catch that you re going to get this error unless you specify the 2nd param of the redirect as false

gnome	kde
for linux you have to deal with different windows managers gnome kde all with different ways of managing the clipboard

2270348
anonymous-function	function-call
if you need to pass the second parameter you need to wrap the function-call in another function an anonymous-function

2270354
children	nodes
any nodes can have any numbers of children

2270363
children	nodes
what happens .when you encounter a nodes that has no children and also is not the nodes you re looking for

2270365
children	nodes
you only recursively search the first nodes that has children

2270366
gnome	kde
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.

2270366
gnome	kde
just be aware that for a truly cross-platform job you have to take into account of the different gui s such as under linux x is the main windows manager interface and either gnome kde sits on top of it..i am not singling out other gui s such as fluxbox windowsmaker to named but a few and that there will be a lot of platform dependant code and also in conjunction you will be dealing with windowss clipboard as well..all in all a big integrated code.

2270366
gnome	kde
maybe that might be better as i would imagine gnome kde etc are using the x s api to do the clipboard work...if that is confirmed then the work would be cut out and be independant of the major gui interfaces... i hope that would be the case as it would make life easier for your project

2270366
gnome	kde
perhaps using compile-time switches for each platform...win kde gnome mac or use the one that is already pre-defined

2270367
utility	gnu
there s a gnu linux utility called strings that printing the printable characters in any file binary or non-binary try using that and look for a versioning numbers like pattern

2270384
highlight	selected
i would like the control to show on the form with no selected value however .when the user click focuses on it - i would like to have what appears to the user as the expanded list showing on items 20-40 with say item 30 being selected or highlight

2270385
formatting	import
one easy way is to import locale and do the formatting in your view function

2270392
checkbox	button
the form that include the submit button and the checkbox needs to include a hidden input that gives the current value of the ncurrentpage variables

2270416
subclassing	inherited
i would probably add another tree of inherited .so a libs is an abstract subclassing of hashset

2270416
subclassing	inherited
but i hope you get the picture - subclassing to inherited the functions you need instead of creating them again

2270417
callback	methods
the pattern that i usually use in a situation like this is to create a wrapper around the async web service proxy methods that accepts a callback methods

2270417
callback	methods
the callback methods then gets passed to the retrievefirstleveloptionsasync methods like .so

2270430
flash-builder	air
i m developing a adobe air application using flash-builder 4

2270448
xsd	xml
you re hardcoding your request as xml and i assume your custom namespace doesn t have a prefix .so it s conflicting with the default namespace for xsd declare in your header

2270454
ruby	php
i personally am an experienced java programmer and would certainly never even consider asp ever but would certainly consider apache with php or ruby

2270500

if you truly want a valid way to do it make your main page the nojavascript.htm page and use javascript to hide all content before it s show to the user and immediately redirect to the real main page using javascript

2270517
hide	show
i ve tried changing the opacity to all sorts of levels using show and hide setvisiblecore bool on the windows but nothing lowers the flicker to an acceptable level

2270520
ruby	php
if your .app does not required complex transactional and multithreading synchronized overcomplicated interfaces you might be good with php or ruby

2270520
ruby	php
personally i think php have easier learning curve for java developer comparing to ruby and gives you first results faster

tokenize	parsing
a good place to start would be investigating how to building a command-line parsing something that can tokenize and interpreter the input

2270581
any	set
the actual timeout of the web service was set high enough and never getting hit but it was throw this exception-handling because it was not giving any updates to stay alive non-pumping

2270584
tcp-ip	udp
a good starting points for tcp-ip is here and for udp here

2270610
delayed-job	worker
the beauty of having a background systemd to process these kinds of jobs is that you can scale quickly you can spin-up any numbers of worker process which all pull jobs from a master queue or db in the case of delayed-job

arrays	loops
.when using foreach on arrayss the compiler will expand to a loops which accesses the items by index assuming you are working with an arrays instances directly not the enumerator approach above

2270630
any	set	enumerator	any
by projecting your database rows into new trip object you can set properties that are not populate by linq-to-sql without any additional enumerator required

2270665
any	set
.so what i have done is while rendering any row in the list i read the file in an inputstream get the byte arrays decode it to obtain a bitmap and set it in an imageview

2270696
any	set
most unit tests work correctly but any tests that required writing to the filesystems i have a class that uses tarfiles for example can t find the tmp directory i have set up for intermediate process my teardown methods remove any files under the relative tmp directory

2270724
restart	exit
my application will have a small numbers of properties between 10 and 20 that i wish to store .when i exit the application and restore .when i restart

2270740
value	field
are you saying that either value tag1 or tag2 could be in either field tag1 or tag2

2270740
value	field
can either of the field have other value besides tag1 tag2 null

2270778
populate	row
--- populate the arrays row by row ---

2270778
arrays	loops
--- now create a loops to output the arrays contents ---

2270780
any	set	enumerator	any
also if you are trying to see if two sets are equals as represented by then your best bet is to checked use the except extension methods on the enumerator class and make sure that the result set doesn t have any entries and that both implementation have the same numbers of entries since except can return an empty sequences even with different length sequencess passed to it which you can do with the count extension methods

2270788
contains	elements
checkout this answer it provides a methods that determines whether two sequences contains the same elements

2270790
constructor	object
you can use a closure in the object s constructor to capture the correct reference to your object

2270796
attributes	properties
instead of making a readonlycollection you can change the properties in your class myobjects to readonly or add attributes system.componentmodel.readonly true to your properties example

2270809
directdraw	gdi
right now it works correctly by drawing the text in the onpaint using gdi and the video on a directdraw overlay

2270833
directory	folder
.so if you move your website from a windows to a unix-server .when you change web hosts for instances you risk getting a certain amount of page not found -errors 404 errors because directory and other website linking to yours .sometimes get the cases wrong typically writing the first letter of folder named in uppercase etc.

2270835
registration	login
i need to display a couple of view controllers eg login screens registration screens etc

2270836
malloc	free
if your c code malloc s and free s every other line of code you re thrashing the heap

2270836
malloc	free
for heap thrashing that s malloc free being your #1 #2 most used functions

2270842
imagebutton	imageview
i have a small project in which i downloading images from internet in the form of drawable and use them in imageview for which i have provided functionality similar to an imagebutton but without the gray edges

2270863

2270915
httpconnection	downloading
it downloading the file from a httpconnection and listens locally for connections and serves up the video

2270921
xhtml	tidy

2270959
double-quotes	spaces
just like on the command-line the spaces need to be inside double-quotes

2270968
sqldatasource	gridview
is dropping a gridview on a web form and binding it to a linkdatasource or sqldatasource considered bad

2270982
value	field
hi i got a search filtering page and i have a field that s a multi-select .so it s value is an arrays

2270990
union-all	union
i stile think that for reliability you should use the union union-all and only try to create a single query if the performance is bad after you had a look at indexes

2270999
contains	elements
first query to get all xml nodes that contains a text inside the elements that looks like orange

2271008
android-emulator	adb
.when i types adb devices it show me only my android-emulator and not my phone

2271017
expression	evaluation
edit please bear in mind that the expression must not be modified just the evaluation technique

2271033
32-bit	64bit
.when printf d process that it grabs only 32-bit or 64bit if it s a 64bit cpu for conversion and those are the signed value -1

2271033
32-bit	64bit
if the printf conversion had been u instead it would show either 4294967295 32-bit or 18446744073709551615 64bit

2271046
constructor	object
i mean here the constructor and destructor do exactly the same thing as the calling code but they are allowed to change the object and the caller is not allowed - he runs into undefined-behavior

2271055
constructor	object
the standards explicit allows constructor and destructor to deal with const object

2271055
constructor	object
a constructor can be invoked for a const volatile or const volatile object

2271055
constructor	object
such semantics only come into effect once the constructor for the most derived object 1.8 ends

2271055
constructor	object
to ensure that some but not all const object could be placed readonly memory rom i adopted the rules that any object that has a constructor that is required runtime initialization can t be place in rom but other const object can

2271055
constructor	object
an object declare const is considered immutable from the completion of the constructor until the start of its destructor

2271055
constructor	object
.when originally designing const i remember arguing that the ideal const would be an object that is writable until the constructor had run then becomes readonly by some hardware magic and finally upon the entry into the destructor becomes writable again

2271078
g++	gcc
is there a way in gcc g++ 4

2271099
expression	evaluation
if it s just the possibility of programmer-error you want to preclude eagerly evaluation expression won t do much

2271099
pyflakes	pylint
perhaps you re actually looking for tools like pylint pyflakes or pychecker

2271108
decrement	increment
therefore i am keeping tracking of the numbers of process by increment a variables each time one is created and then pausing if there s too many and then decrement it in a signals handler

2271110
bind-variables	procedure
a good reason for using a stored procedure rather than a view might be if you want to extends the applicability of the query by using bind-variables or dynamic-sql in the body of the query

2271115
implements	extends
and yes both docor and customer patient are likely to implements or extends person

2271117
any	set
now you can have a common methods which takes any set of object which implements comparable and call comparable1.compareto comparable2 because you know they can perform comparison - it s denoted by their interface

2271124
base-class	inherited
class suggests that object that inherited base-class is some kind of this class

2271126
subclassing	inherited
class inherited will give relation between two common subclassing

2271129
arrays	loops
however i know that this arrays will have only one key and want to avoid a foreach loops

2271144
uitableview	uilabel
i have a uilabel in uitableview

2271159
defined	declare
i can t statically declare the sender object someview in relatedclass because that seems to cause a recursion problem as someview is defined with relatedclass as a member.

2271171
constructor	object
you should use the prototype properties only on constructor functions not in object instances for example

2271171
constructor	object
the prototype properties of constructor functions is used by the new-operator .when it creates our new object instances

2271183
packets	lan

longjmp	lua-api
even though the lua-api reference says that longjmp is used for error-handling the longjmp buffering is not exposed through the api at all

2271224
getter	setter
shadow can be useful in simple code such as constructor getter setter and anything of the sort

2271242
any	set
is there any option available for restoring a column which is set unused by alter-table cmd

2271262
line-endings	newline
building of x11 used the c-preprocessor to generator makefile but imake program used a special technique of indicating line-endings with symbols at the ends of line and then post-processed the output of the preprocessor to replace the symbols with newline

2271274
selected	cell
the image setting for selected cell works but not for an unselected cell

2271282
any	set
the problem is that we can either set the ie to open every url passed from the erp system.in a new windows or to reuse any one of the existing ie windowss same problem with tabs

2271291
pagespeed	yslow
if you are technically minded install yslow or pagespeed and look at the score

2271309
jvisualvm	jdk1.6
i d recommend using something like jconsole jdk 1.5+ or jvisualvm jdk1.6

2271311
notepad++	vim
my personal pick are vim eclipse or notepad++ if you re using windows

2271346
object-reference	instances
.when doing it this way i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2271362
32-bit	64bit
on win32 both pointers and int are 32-bit long on win64 pointers is likely to be 64bit long and int is probably only 32-bit long

2271405
enterprise	platform
boring details the platform is mssql 2000 enterprise v8 sp4 aka critatious period edition

2271435
tcp-ip	tcp
since it s a forced tcp-ip connection close i would look for communication with the server that end with tcp restructuredtext packets that forces the connection to close

2271443
put	get
one methods not the most elegant and simple methods i thought of is to put all the codes into one set of header source files but that s a lot of work and can get quite tricky.

2271464
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve tried adding a hidden submit button which gives me the desired behavior in safari firefox and google-chrome but the form is still not submitted in ie

2271467
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
.when you re doing a small project or a prototype go with the linqdatasource or sqldatasource

2271497
google-chrome	firefox
now .when i implements this is seems to work fine on my computer in firefox and google-chrome

2271559
order	add
if there are where clauses either add the column you are order by to the index being used for that table as well and see if it gets rid of the filesort or if its not currently using one for that table which i doubt is the case with that many recording then just create a new one

2271559
subtract	add	order	add	value	field
eg if you have an int field that you want to order by desc add a field where you store the int value subtract from 1000000000 or some other large numbers index it and order by that field ascending

2271565
shell	bash
i have a bash shell scripting which call some python scriptinging

create list contains elements of seq discarding duplicates

2271600
elasticsearch	whoosh
i saw elasticsearch recently and played with whoosh a python implementation of a search-engine

2271611
error-handling	try-catch	execution	exit
add tsql to write to an audit table at the start and end of execution adding try-catch error-handling to make sure an early exit doesn t occur

2271616
haskell	lisp
it s not a pure functional language like haskell but then again neither is lisp and nobody really argues that lisp isn t functional

2271622
profiling	debugging
if this is not something you want to leave in permanently it s just for debugging performance analysis purposes then your best bet is to use sql profiling and monitor the sp stmtcompleted event which will recording the stats for each statement within a sproc

2271622
.when	ready
6 .when you re ready just click run

2271632
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
my site is loading up perfectly in firefox google-chrome and other browsers like safari albeit a bit slow

2271645
factors	primes
some of them act as units 1 -1 i and -i some as primes 1 + i and the rest composite that can be decomposed as a product of primes and units that is unique aside from the order of factors and the presence of a set of units whose product is 1

2271645
factors	primes
you can find its norm n and then factors that into primes int

2271645
factors	primes
we work our way down this list peeling off primes factors p of n that correspond

2271645
factors	primes
to primes gaussian factors q of our original numbers g

2271645
factors	primes
primes with norm p and one of them will be the factors we re looking for

2271645
factors	primes
calculate norm g then factors norm g into primes p 1 p 2 .

2271655
swing	swt
also coding user-interface in java is not difficult - if you read some guser-interfacedes before and use some frameworks as swing application framework or swt framework

2271662
arrays	loops
from what i can find it appears that the only way to get down into a multi-dimensional arrays in smarty is with loops

2271674
put	get
i am looking for a ready-to-run software module that i can take and put in either the keyword or links to news feed and get it to work.

2271681
silverlight	wpf
yeah for a pure cross platform application java can t be beat but if you can manage it silverlight is a subset of wpf and a pretty compelling cross-platform proposition on its own

2271687
constructor	object
the object s lifetime begins only after the constructor has finished

2271706
any	set
the concat methods is absolutely thread safe because it doesn t set any variables

2271731
directory	folder
my problem is that i am reading folder named from some specific directory

2271760
textmate	vim	nerdtree	netrw
whereas the nerdtree feels as though it tries to emulate the behavior of other ides and textmate s project drawer i feel that the netrw plugins does things the vim way

2271760
textmate	vim
my background is with textmate but i ve been using vim fulltime for a while now

2271761
implements	extends
tell your ordernodelist class to extends then you ll get this enumerator in for you and probably much of the logic you ve created manually to manage the collections will now be implements for you.

2271762
global-assembly-cache	gac
install the assembly in the global-assembly-cache gac

2271767
order	join
as i understand it the forceplan option forces the sql-server to process the join in the order indicated and to take any hints into consideration

2271776
default-value	arguments
for optional-argumentss i wanted to add a methods that returns the arguments or null if it doesn t exist .so that the calling code can provide a default-value using the null-coalescing-operator

2271793
jqgrid	.post
i would also take a look at phil haack s .post on jqgrid

2271798
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate entity-framework activerecord or linq2sql

2271804
return-type	arguments
the reason this doesn t work is because you cannot have two methods with the same named and same arguments types the return-type is not taken into account for method-overloading

2271804
reference-type	generics
instead you could defined a single methods without the generics constraint which will work for both value and reference-type

2271807
firefox	safari
my datepicker is working as expected with ie8 firefox and safari

2271811
for-loop	loops
a semicolon on its own is the empty statement -- that is nothing happens in loops body just the s++ on the for-loop line

2271815
default-value	return-value
the return-value is an indicator of whether the get was successful where the out parameter contains the value requested on success or a suitable default-value on failure

2271830
callback	methods
the down side to this methods is you will likely need a means of specifying a callback methods to run from the java side

2271880
contains	any
the documentation does not seem to contains any information regarding how the passwd is created but the source code is available for you to have a look

2271892

2272042
data-structures	tree
an algorithm operates on recursive data-structures like a tree

2272061
delphi	c++
in addition to what mghie has said you also have a problem with mismatched definitions between delphi and c++

2272061
delphi	c++
1 if you want the delphi code to work as a function then make it safecall and adjust the c++ to match

2272061
delphi	c++
2 fix the delphi to match the existing c++ defn

2272081
contains	any

2272116
plugins	add-on
anyone has a plugins add-on

2272144
directory	folder
subversion basically treats everything like a directory-structure - a tag is simply another folder in the structure that happens to be within a tags directory

2272144
directory	folder
thus technically you could checkout the tags directory copy one tag folder to a new folder svn add that new folder and commit it - which would essentially create a new tag based off of the old files

2272246
handler	service
you should probably have it in a web service or in a .ashx handler or something if you want to use ajax

2272255
git-repo	repo
i need to verify git-repo properties ssh key repo url in ruby

2272256
daemons	systemd
well you can not sending a signals is just setting up some operating systemd primitive it has nothing to do with setting up a communication path between your daemons on one hand and the tool used to generator the signals on the other hand

2272257
order	add	key-value	key
.when i add a new wine named into the winedetails table the new wine named primary key is 2001 in the database but .when i am display the wine namedd in alphabetic order changes i get the primary key-value of another wine named instead of 2001

2272407
design-patterns	anti-patterns
all books contains examples and such but i would suggest that you do not look for problems for which you can apply design-patterns as that by itself is considered an anti-patterns and only results in over-engineered programs

2272411
virtual-machine	vmware
we recently migrate our .app to linux red-hat and currently each employee is building his own .app is his own virtual-machine using vmware

choose the active sdk for the debugging tab located just below the close minimize button of windows selected device - 3.1.2 or other sdk building you have

2272484
textbox	button
give both the textbox and the submit button the same validation grouping

2272494
base-class	inherited
machine.config file is basically a base-class of your web application configuration that is inherited by the web-config file

2272499
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have an issue using telerik radeditor with ie not firefox not google-chrome and not safari

2272508
google-chrome	firefox
my website www.zerozaku.com is compatible with google-chrome and firefox but ie has an issue with my mini-chat overflowing out of the box

2272508
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it on ie8 firefox google-chrome

2272531
firefox	opera
multiple backgrounds are only supported starting from firefox 3.6 and opera 10.5

2272531
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari already support them which i presume you mean with all other browsers .

2272548
mouseover	mousedown
in particular how would i make a custom play pause button with mouseover and mousedown states

2272551
datagrid	listbox
e.g i display in a user-controls 3 entities customer listbox order datagrid product datagrid

2272551
textbox	button
each of those data areas has add+remove button and textbox to enter data

2272551
user-controls	tabcontrol
3. .when this one user-controls is inside a tabcontrol s tabpage where do i load the 3 entities related data

2272558
conditional	operators
there are operators in the conditional for less than less than or equals .

2272612
.when	ready
.when you are ready to use it again you can unserialize or json_decode the string again

2272621
contains	set	contains	elements
.so .when this methods is called with a given old view that should be re-used all contains elements will have to be set according the elements data

2272639
windows-xp	windows
on an existing application currently windows only we use â œ programdataâ on vista windows 7 and â œ document and settings all usersâ œ on windows-xp both obtained using system.getenv allusersprofile which does not work on mac or linux

2272641
margins	padding	margins	insets
is there any way to apply .some kind of margins or padding all around the textinput area of the nstextview .so that it is more insets and away from the rounded edges

2272642
contains	any
c and this contains should have methods let s say get_ramdom_member which will help me get an item randomly from the containsers c without providing any key

2272669
any	set
.so should the httpservletrequest use utf-8 to decode the request param which clearly it s not or is this simply a browser error because the browser does not set any character encoding header which again doesn t make much sense because it s not doing a .post request

2272669
google-chrome	firefox
both in google-chrome and firefox

2272696
pecl	pear
a function once given a named can not be reversed as it has been used in thousands of project and the language core as well as pear and pecl

filtering	grouping
.when the user enters the site he can choose in a dropdown which grouping he wants to see .so the complete site filtering content related to that grouping

2272747
directory	folder
xml or php driven for those that don t like to use xml you could even generator the structure based off the folder structure in your directory using php

2272747
account	api
you could even use a the flickr flash api to request sets from your flickr account and load in dynamically i love this approach as it allows you to use flickr as a content-management-system of sorts

2272749
spacing	layout
in words this can be adjusted through the page layout paragraph spacing where the initial value is 10pt

2272758
lazy-evaluation	maybe
on the other hand if the methods are throw checked-exceptions just because the programmer was lazy-evaluation in treating with them and just wanted to pass the buck maybe you are looking at this from the wrong angle

2272782
authentication	login
your login link send the user to their openid provider for authentication but it s not the user logging in to their google-account that s the important bit it s logging in to your website by providing credentials via openid

2272782
logout	login
similarly the logout link on your site should log the user out of your site only returning them to the same state as before they click the login button

2272795
input-field	textbox
i need a textbox with a bottom-line such like input-field used in forms

2272809
authentication	login
if using something like openid the first time they login a customer object will be created and linked to their openid username hence the reason for separating what an authentication user is from a customer

2272827
callback	methods
i would create a seperate thread to run your sendmessages in and then have a callback methods to your main thread .when you get a messages back from the other process

2272840

scala	java
see scala for java refugees part 4 pattern-matching and exception-handling

2273023
contains	lookup
for example if atable contains only 1 row while teamtable contains all of the ids in my_table then sql-server has to choose compromise between doing a lookup best if using atable and a table scan best if using teamtable - whatever it ends up doing it s not possible for sql-server to execute both queries using the optimal exception-handling plan unless both execution plans happen to be the same

2273040
directory	folder
i made a java .application.and bundled all classes in jar file..wen i run the project from netbeans my .app is running successfully..but wen i place my .jar file at another place and run from there..i am not getting the icons used by my .application..in the code i get my icons from images directory present in project folder

2273046
key-value	key
the key-value store should support order the key and ranged access to the key

2273081
javascript	dom
if you want to generator html using javascript then you either need to use innerhtml or dom

2273095
silverlight	wpf
i m going to assume this has nothing to do with wpf this is a silverlight question

it can be set on any versioned directory and its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories relative to the versioned directory on which the properties is set and fully qualified absolute subversion repository urls

2273154
python	c++
there is a class wx.pypanels that is a versioning of panels intended to be subclassing from python and allows you to overrides c++ virtual methods

2273155
ethernet	packets
there ethernet frame will carry ip packets typically with a destination ip-address which is already something which will not be on your hosts and if it is this implies that you will have duplicates ip-addresses on your network causing problems as well

2273170
getter	setter
i often find myself with a dilemma .when writing javadoc for properties members of a simple pojo class holding only properties and getter and setter dto-style ..

2273176
getter	setter
alternatively if you do not want to generator the javadoc for all private-members you can have a conventions to document all getter and use link on setter

2273180
value	field
now .when i enter some value in form 1 through autocomplete i want the second form field to fetch the autocomplete value using text entered in field1 as one of the parameters

2273180
onchange	keyup
which is the best event triggers keypress keyup or onchange which i should use to achieve this seamlessly without any time lags or sync issues

2273181
value	field
really you re following dr s points about keeping value out of the gui in a sense you re using a storage field in each labels instead

2273185
32-bit	64bit
you can code muldiv yourself it just multiplies two 32-bit value and then divides the 64bit result by a third 32-bit value

2273187
base-class	inherited
however the destructor can and should be virtual .when you use inherited inorder to allow destructor of object being used by way of polymorphism as a base-class

2273187
malloc	free
however i made a small test program with the code above just malloc free in the new delete operators and printing statement in delete and compiled it using g++

2273208
.when	ready
the polling would take the form of a url that will respond with some sort of ready indicator .when the file is ready

2273208
.when	ready
.when the server says it s ready your javascript handler will make the button visible and no further polling will be necessary

2273209
instance-variables	accessor
basically all the stuff going on in finders that touches columns works with the attributes hash not with the instance-variables that your accessor declare

2273238
configuration	environment
in the configuration environment production.rb

2273243

and now my list thislist as it were has a new view that has all the same properties as the default view except now it grouping by a column dlcategory and filtering out anything whose dlpriority is not 2

2273269
.when	ready
you could use some types of messaging on the server that tells the client .when the file is ready we us a table for all report request and the server writes the status into the table and the client is then asking for the status of the report job with an ajax call every few seconds

2273270
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
uinavigationcontroller has an is-a relationship with uiviewcontroller .so you should be able to change its class types in interface-builder with no additional changes

2273275
any	set
note that you will need to manage any cookies needed manually which may be a little tricky if the cookies are set as part of a response to request that use browserhttp

2273276
internet-explorer	firefox
it works fine in firefox but internet-explorer ain t .so nice.

2273281
binary	hex
the numbers itself is not stored in hex it s binary like everything else in your computer

2273283
any	set
any ideas as to why doesn t work would be appreciated but in the mean time i just move the declaration of the locationalert out of the function .so it is global set it in the initial locate me function and use the following the first time it is called

2273290
selected	listbox	selected	button
if the user selected a single item on the first listbox a cmdright button enables but cmdright2 is still disabled if the user selected multiple items on the first listbox a cmdright2 button enables but cmdright is disabled

2273290
selected	listbox	selected	button
i ve got the move button to work but the problem i m having is after moving multiple items with the cmdright2 button the cmdright button enables which it shouldn t it should only enable after selected a single item in the listbox

2273292
value	field
the best way would be to double checked the value you get from the cookies and with the one that s been transported to the server by some other means - as part of the request header a custom field etc

2273296
mta	sta
just an idea though if your com object should always run in an sta and only gets called from clients running in other apartments mta maybe you could read up on custom marshalling warning not for the faint of heart

2273308
dialog	pop-up
.so in case of ajax call if an already existing dialog is initiated you will get the pop-up more than once as many time it was reinitialized

2273320
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
it makes the public or protected facilities of the base-class available directly in the derived-class .so it simply isn t want you want

2273320
instances	private
instead make the derived-class implements the relevant interface and if necessary forwarding the methods on to a private instances of the underlying class

2273332
arrays	loops
and you call this in a loops which iterates through all contenteditable divs using an arrays i will call cedivs like this

2273343
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
we are working on our implementation of linq to oracle mysql postgresql sqlite and this implementation is actively developed

2273346
base-class	inherited
there is 2 solutions to hide methods inherited from a base-class

2273346
base-class	inherited
or you can simply create these methods in the base-class not inherited from any interface and mark them as private

2273348
contains	any
i end up with a typevariableimpl object accessed via reflection which does not seem to contains any useful data

2273358
content-management	sitecore
this second approach has the advantage of using sitecore for all non-product content-management while keeping the live application in aspdnsf

2273379
double	int
for example i want to be able to use both int double and my own defined types complex

2273386
value	field
look at the results and compare them to the data types of the object you reload is the query mapping an empty value to a non-nullable field

2273393
if-statement	loops
in the if-statement inside the while-loops to display the information from page2.php that required from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loops don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while-loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detection weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2273418
return-type	arguments
from the definition of tryhandler it follows that return-type of the fromexception should be the same as arguments of handlearith

2273430
value	field
sure just add a new field in your selected statement called something like source with a different constants value for each source

2273438
getter	setter
in my opinion this templating makes it a lot easier in the long run to not only remind yourself what the properties means through repetition but also it makes it easier to add additional comments to the getter and setter if you want to add side-effects such as not allowing null properties turning strings to uppercase etc

2273461
value	field
this is implements with inputtext field on the page points at a value object with primitive float types

2273461
value	field
now as a new requirement sees some of the field be nullable i wanted to change the value object to use float object rather than primitive-types

2273476
duplicates	contains
the problem with testing against real data is that it contains lots of duplicates value and not enough edges cases

2273479
subnet	ping
apart from asking the dhcp-server i guess you could do a broadcasting ping on the subnet and collect the response from all computers and simply sort the ip-addresses to find the next one

2273508
value	field	placeholder	required
this worked but another problem arose if the form client-side validation failed because of the required or pattern attributes then the field aren t re-given their placeholder value

2273508
placeholder	required
test case open this with a browser that supports required pattern but not placeholder only opera at this time

2273521
value	field
while that does get called the setproperty call for country has an empty value even though the form has posted a field called billing.address.country

2273521
value	field
orderaddress and address.bindproperties setproperties are called for some things and sometimes setproperties value arguments is-empty .when it was clearly posted in a named that matches the other field properties mapping

2273531
abstract-class	base-class
.when you wish to give some base-class functionality to derived classes but .when this functionality is not sufficient to initializer a usable class then go for abstract-class

2273531
any	set
with interfaces you required derived classes to implements a set of functions and you do not pass along any implementsation

2273531
any	set
.when you do not wish to enforce any public contract a set of methods properties defined by an interface

2273546
environment	building
this how we building clickonce applications with teambuilding for multiple environment

2273546
configuration	environment
for every environment or configuration change you want you use this

2273551
arrays	loops
to find all the children you d have to loops through the arrays

2273570
configuration	environment
the only difference between the test .app and the running .app should be the configuration environment

is it possible to disable lazy-loading in a total application by just adding something to app-config or web-config

2273647
sql-server	sqlcommand
sqlcommand and sqlconnection are specific to sql-server and can take advantage of its features

2273654
subclassing	superclass

2273665
value	field
if field value haven t changed from their default xmlencoder doesn t store anything

2273694
protected	public
in those spi-s in bc sources made required methods public instead of protected

contains	any
of course all of the above assumes that all of the rest of the data you re sending does not contains any other nulls

2273700
decimal-point	digits
i am trying to parsing the digits to store in a variables from a string in vb.net would like to also include the decimal-point

2273701
export	report
whenever i export my ssrs report to excel the recording gets extraction to multiple-columns instead of one column which makes harder to do much stuff in excel

2273721
getter	setter
then create a properties currentcustomer in the bean with getter and setter

2273724
tabpanel	tabs
internally the tabcontrol uses a tabpanel to layout the tabs

2273747
export	report
however in my experience inorder to achieve a useful excel export from an ssrs report it is best to keep the layout of the report as simple as possible

2273758
haskell	scala
algebraic-data-types from haskell are idiomatically translation into sealed class hierarchies in scala

2273775
value	field
you are implicit converting data into the wrong datatype an alpha string value is being insert into a numeric field

2273775
value	field
a null value is being insert into a field that does not allow nulls

2273775
value	field
you have exceeded the max length of the field with a value

2273782
sequences	unique
say you have a need to find the nth row of one table on a specific datetime sequences and insert a value from it into another table if its unique identifier is not already in the other table

2273782
row	col
this is useful to find the nth row in one table and insert it in as the nth col in another table

2273793
directory	folder
obviously write permissions on the directory the file is unzipped to write on the folder your web-service saves the zipfile to .when it s upload and read on the zipfile that s been saved to unzip it

2273821
pointers	stack
if you return by reference or pointers a variables which is local construct on stack you invite trouble because the object is destructed upon return .so you have a dangling reference as a result

2273836
aptitude	dpkg
is there a way of getting dpkg apt-get or aptitude to produce a list of the package which need to be install on a second machine to duplicates the package install on a first

2273850
getter	setter
my business rules must be implements only within service with anemic domain classes only with getter and setter or must exist a consensus putting domain business rules in domain classes and service

2273851
value	field
you ll get exactly the same behavior if value were a field

2273851
value	field
the expression contains the field access is to the left of the value being assign and therefore is calculated first

2273860
value	field
as for maintaining state if you want to do that without rewriting the url in other words .when they go to search you want the previous results you can either store the form field in a cookies and populate it from the cookies or the value in the url or use a database of some kind to store the preferences

2273862
callback	methods
setup the interrupt callback and then use this pause and resume methods appropriately in the callback

2273865
environment	restart
the problem is that the c++ program does not updates this variables or its environment block in general automatically .so that i am still working with the old value unless i restart the program which is not really good

2273868
conditional	operators
possibly adds performance if several operators after if conditional

2273870
worksheet	excel
.so is there a way to form a hyperlink or perhaps .some javascript that will open an excel workbook with a particular worksheet and cell active

2273886
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
even though uinavigationcontroller is a subclassing of uiviewcontroller it s task is the management of other view controllers not the management of views themselves

2273887
32-bit	x86
currently we have to building our .net applications targeting x86 to be able to use the vfpoledb provider that only runs in 32-bit

2273895
webserver	security

2273934
remote-debugging	debugging
updates after some more fiddling i have discovered a few more kernal hooks a lot of them are used to nullify data returned by systemd information call such as the remote-debugging ports i also managed to find out the what ever is doing this is using madchook.dll by madshi to do this this dll is also inject into every running process these seem to be some anti debugging code

2273937
innodb	myisam
after several weeks development i wanted to make it available to the public and found out the database server provided by my web hosts does not support innodb only myisam

2273937

what can i do to force the listitem or the listbox to redraw itself and updates the styles

2273957
haskell	ocaml
both haskell and ocaml provide the lovely benefits of using an ml-family language but for most programmers ocaml is likely to offer a gentler learning curve and better immediate results

2273965
account	userid
think unix styles where the root account userid 0 is special rather than a particular grouping

2273967
javascript	dom	document-ready	ready
updates i d wrap all the javascript in the document-ready function .so that it delay execution until the dom is ready

2273979
markup	xhtml
i looked at this again and changed the markup a bit also made it valid xhtml

2273997
alignment	layout
in general you should only care about alignment if you re either reading writing struct directly and depending on them having the same layout which is usually a bad idea or you expect to have lots of instances and memory is at a premium

2274017
versioning	upgrade
i understand that an upgrade to the iphone os upgrade the opengl-es versioning support from 1.1 to 2.0

2274035

2274083
installation	building
the problem is not related to a particular building of the installation

2274084
put	get
you don t have to use page.ispostback most ajax request are just get s .so if you put in your page_load

2274093
value	field
basically the first third and fourth field in the subset file should match the first 3 field of the master file the rest can be any randomly generator value

2274094
json	xml
your best bet would be to create a handler file .ashx that would process the incoming request and return the properly formatted json xml to the javascript

2274097
perl	php
although i have said that i am using c# i am willing to write this in another language java perl php etc i just need to come up with something that will help with my problem

2274155
callback	methods
next i register my callback methodss in the page_load methods in my aspx.cs -

2274155
callback	methods
this registers the server functions with the page and hooks them up to the client callback methods - these callback methods are basic placeholder that do nothing but give the server somewhere to return its string to

2274159
onmousedown	onmouseup
also it s rather tricky you d have to detection both onmousedown and onmouseup for the entire document and recording the state of the mouse button

2274159
button	popup
for instances in my example there i have an alert windows that popup with the real button state

2274159
mousedown	mouseup
likewise any mouseup or mousedown events on other elements that stoppropagation up to the documentelement s event handler would cause it to break

2274159
click	mouse
if you want my advice display a messages on a combo mouse click guess at the correct mouse button or ignore them all together

2274170
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i would also keep the major browsers opera google-chrome firefox safari and ie7 8 opened in parallels to one-another for constants testing

2274176
json	xml
also mind you that .when returning content in the form of xml or json which is typical for ajax call with json being pretty dominant now it s important to change the content-types properties of the response to the appropriate mime types text xml for xml application json for json

2274176
asp.net-mvc	webforms
note that asp.net-asp.net-mvc makes this all much much easier and you might want to look into using that instead of the webforms model as asp.net-mvc is built from the ground up to handle many of these scenarios much easier

2274193
32-bit	64bit
i need to convert java long datatype 64bit data into legacy c++ .app unsigned int 32-bit datatype

2274194
export	csv
if they re pure numbers in one sheet export them into a csv or tab-separated text file

2274211
innodb	myisam
there are many web-hosting providers that support innodb these days .so it would be waste of your time to recode much of your application to work with myisam

2274212
value	field
i got it pretty much working but the issue that i am having is that .when i edit my story model stories 1 edit the tags field appears blank i guess the plugins makes a branding new text entry and hide the original textfield that has my initial value

twitter	tweets
there should be a way to query the encoding of the tweets .when read from twitter

2274236
unsigned-integer	int
based upon your comments you want an unsigned int although you say unsigned-integer .so maybe you want an integral value not necessarily an unsigned int

2274281
value	field
is it possible to store decimal value in int field or does it have to be float

2274292
callback	methods
virtually any kind of recursive code could be classified as reentrancy you can callback into the same methods without having finished it but this is used in particular .when talking about locks mutex semaphores etc

2274295
sql-server	oracle
anty database which supports partioning of data such as oracle or sql-server would work fine

2274295
postgresql	mysql

a mouse click or any other event starts at the first topmost elements it fires on and then works its way backup the chaining of elementss unless propagation is stopped

2274384
contains	elements
if you tried to stop it at the contains document it will have already fired on the relevant elements of the child document

2274388
triggers	insert
a multiple recording insert or updates will have multiple recordinging in insert and the triggers must account for that please without using a triggers

2274388
triggers	insert
triggers should under no circumstances be written to handle only one-record insert updates or deletes

2274388
triggers	insert
example to insert the value from insert to another table where the triggers is on table1

2274392
contains	set
simply a grouping that is not supposed to be contains in the set of valid users used by your application

2274400
textbox	button
is it possible to updates a gridview .when you change a date in a textbox using calendarextender without having a button

2274427
contact	submit
the only real solution i can think to this problem is to hosts your own contact page providing a small form that the user can submit

2274437
getter	setter
cake will read your db schema and automagically provide model- field and some auto getter setter like findallbyid or findbyname

if you can change the value of what the field points to then it s not really readonly any more

2274529
value	field
there s really no functional difference between assign the value of all members of some object a to some object b represented by a field or simply assign a to that field .when they are of the same types however only one of them is valid .when the field is declare readonly but since you can effectively chage the value of what s being represented by the field it is as already stated not really readonly

i have once done a linked-list just for fun which needed a sentinel nodes not meant to hold any data and i had the following structure

2274971
parentheses	operators
in the first snippet though one has to resolve both ternary operators in your head and additionally think about associativity i d think about that automatically because parentheses are missing

2274974
complement	exponent
assuming that if it was 2 s complement instead of biased value and assuming that the 0x00 and 0xff value would still be special value then the biased exponent allow for 2x bigger numbers than the 2 s complement exponent

abstract-class	subclassing
take a look at the templates-method-pattern it might help here the abstract-class with the validation would be the templates and your specific actions would be the subclassing

2275034
subclassing	superclass
if the private-members are truly needed in the subclassing then your problem indicates poor design of the superclass

2275038

i didn t really find that changing the params default-value to seeemed like a good way of doing it .so hinted by your .post i tried to change all my page elements stored in my database to use a route named default unless they explicit was meant to use a custom route and had the params defined for it

2275092
any	set
as a last ditch effort you can set your content-type to application octet-stream and any browser should offer to downloading it and then most browsers will let you open it after it s downloadinging based on the extension

is it better to put the onclientclick properties in the html or use javascript dom to attach a callback to the button click

2275433
double-quotes	single-quotes
seeing as you re using double-quotes as you indeed should there is no need to escape single-quotes

2275449
button	popup
.so in the detail view i am using a custom header the custom header has a textfield for the named of the purchase a button to activate the amountpicker and a labels for the amount .when the amount button is pressed then the amountpicker class popup and the user enters the amount and presses the done button now this is where i need to change the logic for the donebutton instead of using a variables in the appdelegate

2275625
user-controls	ascx
how can i use a user-controls that has code in the ascx and in the code-behind dynamically

2275642
constructor	object
will always give you a user object even though it s constructor which probably looks up in the database may conclude that the object doesn t exist

2275642
exception-handling	try-catch
you can throw an exception-handling in the constructor for invalid s and use a try-catch construct instead of your isset test or set a properties in the constructor of users that do exist and checked for that in your test

2275657
bazaar	cvs	version-control	cvs	version-control	bazaar	perforce	cvs	perforce	bazaar	fossil	darcs	gitorious	launchpad	launchpad	fossil	launchpad	darcs
.so you can have .something exactly like github or gitorious codaset for mercurial bitbucket darcs patch-tag bazaar launchpad codeville arch arx monotone fossil but not for subversion or cvs perforce visual .sourcesafe team foundation server vault because centralized version-control systemd simply are not capable of supporting the required features

order	join
the optimizer will usually compare all join order and try to selected the optimal order regardless of the order you wrote the query however in some complicated queries there are simply too many options to consider note that the numbers of possible join order increases to the factorial of the numbers of tables joined

2275732
order	join
in this case the optimizer will not consider all options but will definitely consider the order you wrote the join in the query and therefor may effect execution plan and execution-time

2275744
delphi	c++
in delphi you can use pointers like in c++ but usually you try to avoid it

create your own console panels or windows which attaches to the stdin stdout and stderr of the interpreter executable

2277617
click	mouse
if you really want to figure out which option was click .when listening for click on the selected box itself you can look at the offsety properties of the event object which will be the vertical offset of the mouse cur.sor relative to the top of the first option in the selected box -- .so it include the selected box s scroll offset and divide that by your pre-determined option size which will depend on the font-size of the selected box

2277662
communication	messages
the problem is not all of our communication fits publish-subscribe and using callbackcontracts means we have to include .source details in returned result messages .so clients can work out what the returned results were originally for...again clients have a switching statements to work out what to do with messages arriving from service based on the messagetype and other embedded details

2277662
communication	messages
to make matters more complex one of the systemd requirements is that service or nodes do not need to be directly registered with one another inorder to send messages to one another but can communication via indirect links

2277664

linked-list	nodes
.so if i understand this right you just want to run through your linked-list until you get to the last nodes in the linked-list and return the pointers to it

you need to add a non-floated elements below the floated parts to force the containss div.box to expand to contains the floats

2278160
contains	any
as well the overflow auto will not have any effect on your .box styles because it does not specify any height or width - it will naturally just expand to contains whatever content you put in there

2278164
dictionary	arrays
if i understood your question correctly and you have int ids for the words and corpora then you can gain some performance by switching from a dictionary to a list or even better a numpy arrays

2278164
dictionary	arrays
then you can load one and create a smaller dictionary or arrays that only corresponds to the first 10 of words corpus pairs

2278164
dictionary	arrays
if you chose your previous chunks based on what would fit in memory then you will have to arbitrarily break your old dictionaryionary in half .so that you can hold one in memory while al.so holding the result dictionary arrays

pointers	stack
this case is unlikely because compilers usually warn about returning pointers or references to object stored on a stack

2278522
copy-constructor	constructor
if datamapreader getmapfromfile returns datamap by value and datamap has no explicit defined copy-constructor and or copy assignment-operator or it has incorrect implementation for those constructor and or-operator which improperly handles copying of pointers and or references to members owned by the datamap or other members stored by value have the same problem recursively

2278522
instances	destroy
in this case referenced members can be destroy in datamap destructor called for the instances stored on a stack before returning from the datamapreader getmapfromfile which leads to undefined-behavior

2278522
pointers	stack
datamap.initdatacollections shouldn t store pointers to the collections instances because the lifetime of the collections instances created on a stack is less than the lifetime of the datamap instances

2278522
instances	destroy
collections instances will be destroy before returning from the collectionsfactory createfrommap

2278528

the documentation from sun and other forums suggests extends the custom editor to control the value of the field but it doesn t take into account the relationship of that value with other members of the underlying datamodel

2279290
any	set
if you don t have any content to downloading you could use that methods to set a flag in your .app

2279320

2279321
fadeout	fadein
i rewrited the fadein and fadeout methods

to sum just the elements that contains numbers

2279378
pascal	delphi
even though i program mostly in delphi which has a with keyword since delphi is a pascal derivative i don t use with

2279388
postgresql	mysql
but postgresql isn t much harder to install than mysql if harder at all

2279388
postgresql	mysql
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from versioning to versioning they re still playing catchup to the sql standards and probably always will

2279388
postgresql	mysql
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy-evaluation proactiveness .

2279389
invocationtargetexception	runtimeexception
as far as i can tell the invocationtargetexception means there was a runtimeexception and i can treat it like that

2279391
toolchain	platform
languages or toolchain platform don t start out as self-hosting - they start off life having been built on an existing platform at a certain points they become functional enough to allow programs to be written which understand the syntax which it itself happens to be written in

2279393
initializer	setter
for such cases you can simpley have a variables of types e that could be initializer through a setter function

2279396
margins	padding
i ve tried changing the margins padding and various border properties on the table and tr and td

2279405

your pattern checked only if the given string contains any non-special character

2279497
keyword	synonym
the foreach keyword is actually a synonym for the for keyword .so you can use foreach for reliability or for for brevity

2279617
arrays	loops
how do i manipulate this arrays .so that .when i loops through it the order is by the amount similar to aka

2279634
show	next
.so i wanna restrict it with 5 recording..when query return i wanna count it if its higher than 5 then jtable show up only first 5 recording .when user click forwarding button it will show up next 5 recording..when user click back button it will show previous 5 recording

2279640
contains	any
your outlook rules would then look out for mails contains that subject and move them into the sent folder or any other folder for that matter

2279649
communication	messages
the php-mail -function will just send out email communication with the server without storing it anywhere .so to have your send messages stored anywhere you ll have to create your own mail-client which handles mails and folder

2279662
protected	public
what is better practise and why accessing base class-variables through a protected field or a public getter on the private field

2279665
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

2279665
getter	setter
but .when we use getter setter these attributes can be easily accessed modified from outside

2279665
getter	setter
if we are going to use setter getter later on to modify

2279673
put	get
for example you can get a list of all tables columns and foreign key references which is enough to put together a schema diagram

2279685
getter	setter
you can add some logic into setter getter in future

2279685
getter	setter
sometimes getter setter can operate with abstract things.

2279689
getter	setter	protected	public
use public or protected setter and getter

2279689
protected	public
the getter need not be public - if you wan to hide the data from outsiders but give the data to subclassing use protected

2279692
subclassing	superclass
i regard the relationship between a superclass and a subclassing as similar to that of a caller and callee - changes to the underlying implementation shouldn t break subclassinging any more than they should break callers

2279699
implements	abstract
error line 75 the types new asynccallback must implements the inherited abstract methods asynccallback .onsuccess set

2279701
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can allways add validation checked etc later on

2281296
instances	private
one easy way to do this is to add a private member to the form1 class to store the instances

2281313

2281330

hide	show
this should then hide and show the icons everytime the timer ticks at least then you can see if it s working

2281460
hide	show
maybe only run the timer 10 time and then it ends that way the scripting should hide and show the icons 10 time by which time the systemd should be ready

2281477
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie all support the complete properties which was finally standardised in html5

2281507
template-method-pattern	strategy-pattern
i would suggest either the strategy-pattern or the template-method-pattern

2281531
required	checked
the paths may or may not exist and the user may or may not have permissions to the path - i d prefer a fast robust methods that doesn t required any i o .so no permission checked but if there s .something built-in i d be happy with anything good enough too.

2281532
defined	declare
i have confirmed that all symbols are defined and that all declare functions have a corresponding definition

2281543
primitive	int
this is because we have things like primitive int long etc their primitive-wrappers int long etc autoboxing from int to int .when you required this is from jdk 1.5

2281554
coalesce	isnull
all the suggestions here about using coalesce or isnull will work - effectively doing this

2281560
.when	ready
creation of uiview is fairly expensive and you should avoid as much as possible doing that on the viewwillappear methods becuase .when this gets called it means that the iphone is already ready to show the uiview to the user and anything heavy you do here will impact performance in a very visible manner like animation being delayed etc

2281560
viewdidappear	viewdidload
in that case i would add the labels to the form in the viewdidload but with a frame outside of the view area and then in the viewdidappear i would do the animation to fly it back into view

2281586
flash-cs4	swc
it appears you can use the flex sdk that ships with flash-cs4 to assets within your flash application and then export as a swc file

2281589
strtok	strdup
you could also use strtok and strdup

2281589
strtok	strdup
see example of using strtok and strdup

2281589
strtok	strdup
strtok would then be used to extraction the individual tokens - strdup to allocate spaces an copy them

2281613
plugins	add-on
however the versioning information does appear in the plugins tab .when viewing firefox add-on

2281618
textbox	button	user-input	output
i have a very basic wpf form with a textbox for user-input a textblock for output and a button to write the input to the serial-port

2281620
perl	php
xampp is an easy to install apache distribution contains mysql php and perl

2281623
jtextfield	jlabel
you should nest your jtextfield in a jpanel or jlabel and put the border on the jpanel or jlabel

2281665
derived-class	base-class
but no matter what i do named description and link are always the first three field in create show edit due to the base-class even .when i try to force them to the end in the derived-class constraints

2281678
boost	stl
you cannot store polymorphism types in stl containers use boost ptr_map instead if it is your wish

2281678
boost	stl
the nice thing about boost pointers containers is that it s been meant for polymorphism types with exception-handling safety and all and yet mimics the behavior interface of the stl .so that you are not lost

2281687
internet-explorer	firefox
this works for internet-explorer but not for firefox

2281690
sigint	exit
if sigint is detected then it tells the main thread to stop creating threads .so eventually all the threads end and the program can exit

2281691
ip-address	proxy
however on mobile-devices many devices will go via a proxy web service such that many devices have the same ip-address

2281691
ip-address	proxy
they al.so flag certain ip-address as proxy servers .so they don t count towards the limits

2281725
controllers	routes
i want to send many named routes to one action on one controllers i m making sure url s left over from an old site redirect to the correct pages

2281742
click	mouse
we can detection .when a mouse is in the region and then trap a click but we d like to know if there is a specific event

2281751
mouseleave	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mousemove
the solution spans 3 mouse events mouseenter mousemove mouseleave

2281752
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m quite sure that all of these options will work however i have only a basic familiarity with asp.net-mvc having developed exclusively in webforms until now

2281754
execute	prepare
my db- query sql value call nothing else then pdo- prepare sql - execute value with extra error-handling ofcourse

2281756
linux	unix
beej s guide to unix ipc is good for getting started with linux unix ipc

2281775
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
in c# a superclass s static-members are inherited into the subclassing scoping

2281775
static-classes	inherited	subclassing	inherited
now you can t inherited static-classes and the only place i can imagine that static inheriteded might matter ignore it entirely although you can make a generics constraint that required a type-parameter t to be a subclassing of a you still cannot call t.m which probably simplifies things for the viewmodel let alone write a different m implementation in a subclassing and use that

2281779
xcopy	cmd
i was getting the 9009 error due to a xcopy post-build event cmd in visual-studio 2008

2281784
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following scripting that works well in firefox and google-chrome not sure about other browsers but it doesn t work at all in ie

2281804
debugging	trace
compile with debugging symbols run the program under gdb and generator stack trace

2281807
compatibility	legacy
stringtokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code

2281808
method-signature	signature
.when i remove the parameter from the method-signature it does hit the breakpoints inside .so it s either the signature needing attributes of .some kind or the messages isn t built properly i believe

2281811
simpletest	phpunit
features include running phpunit and simpletest unit tests including test result and coverage report file transformation token replacement xslt transformation smarty templates transformation filesystems operations interactive building support sql execution cvs svn operations tools for creating pear package and much more

2281824
arrays	loops
i know i could explode the string and loops through the arrays but trying to do this in just the one expression as it seems a pretty easy one but can t quite figure it out

2281838
haskell	python
while i like haskell this just doesn t seem to fit in python

2281840
order	add
for example if looking at order i want to add in a rules that customers can only view their own companys order

2281872
selected	checkbox
you do that by adding a custom wizard page that has checkbox and execute the code for all selected checkbox .when the user click next on that page

2281883
bug-tracking	fogbugz
use fogbugz for feature and bug-tracking

2281893
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
i would use a dictionary associativity arrays and have a simple loops to iterate over

2281896
contains	set
the delims arguments contains the set of characters that are considered as delimiters in the string

2281896
implements	extends
you could also use as delimiters and implements of minimalist html parsing suiting your needs but this will probably lead to bugs headaches and more bugs once your minimal needs extends

2281911
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
one shortcoming i have noted is that python lacks a handy-dandy module for sessions as a libs built-in despite it being available in php and as cgi session in perl

2281914
subclassing	superclass
an example of use would be say a counter value that would keep a live count of all instances of a superclass s subclassinging each subclassing increment the static count value on construction

2281922
lookup	any
a more robust solution is to have some kind of lookup table in a database that is checked before serving any content or 404-type pages

2281937
jtextfield	jlabel
i would really want it to look like a jlabel - but i still need it to be a jtextfield because i want people to be able highlight it

2281943
authentication	login
i need to allow users to login to spree using a non-standard authentication service

2281972
attributes	properties
i have a types t and i would like to get a list of the public properties that have the attributes myattributes

2281998
typedef	struct
class is like typedef and struct

2282021
macros	vba
i m writing a vba macros in excel that is supposed to open fileb.xls and then close immediately after it opens

2282035
python	c++
opencv for c++ also has python binding would be a good place to start

2282043
constructor	object
in this methods we initializer a win object and as a consequence the constructor of the class will be execute

2282081
textbox	button
after insert button is click entry is added to db and textbox are cleared

2282094
any	set
you can set various properties of the textarea any time you like

2282127
any	set
using meiomask plugins is there any way to set up a mask .so it will accept valid us date up to today s date

2282135
directory	folder
go to the appropriate temporary asp.net files directory and delete the folder for your application

2282143
contains	set
before the executereader methods is run i have a breakpoints set .so i can confirm the cmd object does contains the parameters being set which is true

2282148
32-bit	64bit
you didn t specify whether you re talking 32-bit or 64bit here and the difficulties outlined by you and the other posters mainly apply to 32-bit code

2282179
attributes	properties
checked the isforeignkey and canbenull attributes for the associations properties these can prevent null from being insert

2282180
contains	elements
i have three scripting i m trying to use on the same page a lavalamp-style menu an area with draggable divs and a content slider contains both elements that will allow me to scroll between content areas

2282191
revision	svn
.when a developer wants to commit a new revision on svn he needs to change_script.sql by adding

2282198
calling-convention	dllimport
i always try to explicit set the calling-convention .when using dllimport

2282200
archive	backup
--- system.data.sqlclient.sqlexception cannot open backup device c program files state manager archive capture 20100217152147 product databases database database .bak

2282206
dialog	pop-up
i could - either by setting the cursor or physically disabling all the buttions etc etc but realistically i d prefer to be able to simply wrap the call in some object methods etc which will allow a dialog to pop-up up if and only if the operation is taking long enough to impact on the user

2282209
communication	messages
i have a systemd where some loosely coupled components are communication by exchanging messages over jms

2282229
submitchanges	datacontext
suppose they were allowed to co-mingle - .when you call submitchanges which datacontext is responsible for saving

2282236
perl	awk
those in perl and awk

2282251
value	field
i also need to be able to control the contents of the field value arbitrarily

2282276
ubuntu	linux
the machines this program runs on are typically ubuntu linux boxes

2282277
silverlight	wpf
a wpf silverlight design guru can help you translation your user-interface concepts into actual markup

2282278
getter	setter
i need to use that input in markeroverlay i tried creating a setter and getter but it won t work

2282284
reentrantreadwritelock	reentrantlock
if you go this route use reentrantlock or reentrantreadwritelock and not synchronized on object as that lets you explicit manage the lock as an object and use the extra methods available on it

2282307
value	field
you ll have to use a private field to hold the value of what you want to set but returning in the cancel should do it

2282323
32-bit	64bit
.when i compile and run my application under 32-bit configuration it works fine but .when i compile under 64bit configuration my application fails to create the instances of the adove svg player although i know it is install

2282323
32-bit	64bit
my guess is that probably i have an issue because i have a 64bit hosts my application trying to create a 32-bit instances of an activex dll the svg player

2282344
solaris	linux
by the way virtualbox may be very helpful i debugging open solaris or linux as vbox machines very frequently

2282353
versioning	upgrade
.so if another versioning of .some module is install on a systemd you will get unexpected upgrade downgrades

2282360
compatibility	platform
i will be installing it on multiple friend and family s computers .so since i m sure many many platform would suffice just fine for my .app my highest priority has two parts 1 ease of install for the non-technical user and 2 minimizing compatibility problems

2282360
python	java
i have narrowed it down to python or java

2282360
python	java
and i ve heard a lot of good things about python but i don t know how much more prone to incompatibilities it is vs java

2282360
python	java
.so which would be better for this .app java or python

2282362
getter	setter
i could get around that by always using setter and getter

2282377
defined	declare
unfortunately you cannot declare or defined functions within a namespace like you would do with a class you need to actually wrap them in a namespace block

2282383
account	api
simplicity as you re finding out it s very hard to design a question api that will take every possible data required into account for any question as well as figuring out how to compile that into a dynamic question asking algorithm

2282387
perl	php
just because perl regexes features the same behavior i just checked it and i believe that php s pcres perl compatible regular expression behave the same way too

2282397
process-explorer	ngen
i have complex systemd that we re experimenting with ngen but currently we re running the exe from the folder where all the dll s are located due to a lot of late-binding dependencies looking at process-explorer it looks like the native images are being used but how can i be sure i m getting the full benefit and eliminating the loader verification step

2282401
contains	set
note you should try to limit the numbers of styles sheets used in an application and set the styles sheet only at the top-level document in the application the document that contains the tag

2282429
any	set
the way i read the sql reference and security guide for 11g indicates that password-enabled roles required the use of the set role my_role identified by passwd before any rights granted by that role are effective

2282444
duplicates	elements
by the way the main reason i m using this functions is to use tables as sets ie with no duplicates elements

2282457
show	next
next to a labels showing the value of a slider i want to show the date that corresponds to a start date + the numbers of days in slider value units

2282470
python	java
.net 2.0 has a fairly high likelyhood of being install than either java or python on windows machines

2282470
linux	osx
the catch is that you can t easily install it on osx or linux

2282483
any	set
however you can manually set the numbers format for your particular classes project to pretty much any locale or even imaginary systemd with the decimalformatsymbols class

2282486
g++	gcc
and .so i was just wondering if this is a problem with g++ gcc or if the second one is simply ignore

2282520
32-bit	64bit
since activex components are typically inproc and 64bit apps can t load in 32-bit dlls then you are correct about your guess

2282530
hide	show
keep adding all the field to the same object and db tables but show hide them based on the form versioning

2282530
json	xml
buser-interfacelding form definitions then dynamically buser-interfacelding the user-interface and store the data as some dictionary like format json xml or maybe an document oriented database i think this is going to be too complex for the scoping of this .app especially for the user-interface

2282548
32-bit	64bit
i guess this is because the jnilib file is compiled in 32-bit but the java comes with mac10.6 is 64bit

2282562
lookup	any
sql-server would not have to do any kind of setup for the insert if the exists fails whereas in the first one it might lookup some table and field named and prepare for an insert that never happens

2282577
double-quotes	single-quotes
also try removing the single-quotes and use double-quotes

2282606
jquery	.post
the jquery - rather than use get .post we must use ajax to set the content-type i had assumed the json datatype on the ..post methods sorted this but that s for the return-value

2282612
versioning	upgrade
i do it very similarly but use database extended properties instead of a table to tracking metadata versioning and the upgrade step are defined in application rather than a single scripting

2282615
enumerator	any
a simple solution would be to us an arrays which include module enumerator but i do not want to create an intermediate collections with n items in memory .when it s possible to just provide them lazily and avoid any memory spike at all

2282629
frame	width	height	frame
.when i query the frame of tmpview the width is still as desired and the height is often correct .

2282635
arrays	loops
you can store them in arrays and process them in a loops

2282646
difference	zero
.when there is a difference of greater than zero prefix advance both pointers along by that many positioning copying characters as you go

2282650
javascript	dom
where i would be concerned is javascript functions that you may have that try to traversal the dom

2282653
contains	set
i then put all users in the non-write grouping and then had a triggers set on login which parsing the passwd given to determine if it contains a request to join the grouping with write rights which was set into a p4v scripting and if the remainder of the passed-in passwd was correct assign them to that grouping

2282667
hide	show
however if the choice .when to show each text can be conditionaled you can have two controls with different license texts that is both texts are built into a single msi and show hide them based on the conditional

2282668
python	java
my understanding is that google-app-engine only has python or java apis

2282668
python	perl
catch is i m a perl guy with zero exposure to python

2282680
cursor	row
with compact the situation is similar to the one i referenced as it uses forwarding only cursor by default which do not support row count but there are two other cursor types available as documented in the link below

2282695
expression-blend	designer
you can t recycle your javascript html css unfortunately and will need to rebuild it from scratch most effectively using expression-blend - although for best results you need to hire a designer to convert the graphical assets eg the original .psds into xaml with integration control templates styles and animation - leaving you to worry about the backend and the designer to worry about the layout and look-and-feel

2282695
silverlight	wpf
disclaimer - i am a silverlight wpf designer .so i am biased

2282698
triggers	insert
i think if a triggers run on insert and the insert statement was in transactional an error in the triggers will return to the transactional and i can catch it and rollback

2282711
parsing	comma
you can comma or pipe delimit your input and on the other end just parsing it to keep things simple

2282720
oracle	mysql
most people want to merge recording from a mysql database into a words document or merge recording from an oracle into a pdf document

2282735
directdraw	directx
would it be different using directdraw rather than directx and the sprite rendering methods

2282735
directdraw	directx
since i ve no idea the difference between directdraw and directx i m not 100 what i should be thinking about that

2282753
selected	button
however is it possible such that .when i click on the browse button and selected the file to upload it automatically adds it to a list of files to be upload instead of selecteded the file and having another button to add that selecteded file to the list

2282785
spaces	output
you can use a geometry-shader that will take as an input a segment of your line and output a quad a triangle stripes made of two triangles .so that the width of the quad is constants in screens spaces and matches the desire line thickness

2282785
geometry-shader	vertex-shader
if geometry-shader is not an option a workaround could be to use a vertex-shader but it will required some re-work of your vb

2282785
pixels	line	geometry-shader	shader
.so you just have to compute in the geometry-shader the screen-space horizontal start or vertical start depending the orientation of your line segment and pass this extra infos to the pixels shader

2282785
pixels	line
the situation becomes a bit more complicated since you need to have the knowledge of the numbers of pixels that have been rendering before and this for each line segment

2282799
defined	declare
named defined at global scoping - named declare outside any class function or namedpace - are defined inside the global namedpace

2282800
textblock	viewbox
wrap the textblock inside a viewbox

2282802
windows-mobile	windows-ce
c program files windows-ce tools wce500 windows-mobile 5.0 pocket pc sdk activesync inc

2282813
double-quotes	single-quotes
windows required double-quotes in this situation and you used single-quotes

2282818
onresume	onpause
instead of registering a broadcastreceiver in a class file and in manifest you only create a new broadcastreceiver in your activity and then register it in onresume methods and unregister it in onpause methods sth like this in your activity

2282824
lightbox	jquery
a couple examples of lightbox using jquery are

2282863
web-config	app-config
i ve confirmed that the binding in web-config and app-config are the same .so i can t see why it works in one case and not in the other

2282865
contains	any
there isn t really any need for developers to always run against a representative sampling of data and really you should make sure that you regularly test against the full sampling of data anyay just in case the 95 of the database thats left behind contains the rows that cause problems

2282872
python	php
but i think for someone with already enough php and python experience james bennet s practical django project is a very good assets

2282876
rhino-mocks	mstest
the test project are in mstest and have pex and rhino-mocks in them

2282900
binaries	install
make sure the binaries aren t blocked right click properties unlock button at the bottom right then run the install as admin

2282918
any	set
if i wanted to co-locate the corba service .so that the call are happening across process boundaries but not across machines are there any optimization settings which can be set to let the orb know this is happening

2282920
callback	methods
i was trying to parsing the json in a didreceivedata callback methods which gets called multiple time as data is received

2282921
export	report
is there a way to display export english ssrs report in some other languages

2282928
perl	c++
what got me thinking about the idea was project euler and .some code-snippets i saw on .so in c++ perl and lisp

2282951
constructor	private
each would subclassing jtoolbar and contains the necessary code to building themselves probably in private methods called from the constructor in each case

2282969
bundler	gem
.so i tried to reinstall bundler install pre -versioning but really it has versioning numbers lower then i install by gem install bundler

2282970
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
use the autoresetevent and manualresetevent classes

2282971
firefox	safari
the fonts rendering in firefox and safari fine hover nothing is display in the explorers

2282978
application-pool	was
one of the changes was the user account set as the identity for the application-pool had to explicit be given permission to read write the event-log

2282991
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms if that makes a difference

2282996
contains	any
i like to have one public enums file named e contains each seperate enum then any enum can be accessed with e.

2283011
authentication	login
i would like to be able to use the restful login functionality of the older .app to authentication users for the new .app

2283034
perl	c++
i am an experienced perl developer with some degree of experience and or familiarity with other languages working experience with c++ school experience with java and scheme and passing familiarity with many others

2283034
python	perl
as such i d like to ask .so overmind for good references on how to best learn python for .someone who s coming from perl background the emphasis would be on difference between the two and how to translation perl idiomatics into python idiomatics as opposed to generics python references

2283042
qtreewidget	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidget
if you didn t it sounds like you want a custom sorting algorithm which would required creating a derived qtreewidget if you are doing that you might as well just use qtreeview and a custom qabstractitemmodel

2283044
protected	public
we are talking public vs private and i am not including protected for a reason

2283061
virtualbox	vmware	virtualization	virtualbox	virtualization	vmware
this is especially easy to do nowadays given that there are several free virtualization product now virtualbox and vmware server to named two

2283065
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php
i ve done this before in ruby and php but i m having trouble tracking down what i m looking for in the perl documentation.

2283094
enumerator	any
if the enumerator is public it should be treated like any other public types

2283095
git-rebase	git-merge
the solution is to use git-merge --no-ff instead of git-rebase

2283104
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just debugged some of my code that upload files to asp.net-mvc and i get the exact mime string from the httppostedfilebase in firefox as i do in google-chrome image jpeg and image gif respectively

2283106
punctuation	words
python tries to avoid using punctuation .when english words will do especially .when the special characters don t have widely-known meaning

2283107
python	java	python	c++
i mean c++ doesn t map 1 1 to java or python and they are all oo in nature

2283130
triggers	insert
there s a triggers that .when a row changes it basically does a selected from tblmain and insert the changed row into tblhistory

2283134
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the feature works fine with safari google-chrome and firefox

2283143
selected	listbox
.when i start my application the listbox s first item is selected but the focus is elsewhere

2283152
menuitem	button
problem in trying to implements the pause and stop feature.any button or menuitem doesnt get click .when the code reads something

2283160
cherrypy	pylons
python has many to choose from with zope cherrypy pylons and werkzeug all having good reputations

2283215
value	field
the idea is to create a webpage with the required form field map those to the input cell on the sheet and then map the results to the calculated value on the sheet

2283217
triggers	insert
now the timestamp columns are indeed non-writable - .so basically in your triggers you need to do an insert statement which lists all columns that you want to write - and omit the timestamp

2283226
callback	methods
on click stay logged in it makes a callback to an empty methods which resets the session timer i believe because each http-request causes a call to resetitemtimeout

2283228
triggers	insert
in a triggers you can do this which will only insert the affected rows and is much faster than parsing the original table to find what has changed

2283230
order	join
join will join the on the associations s or sql join fragment given for purposes of complex where order clauses

2283234
python	perl	shell	bash
is there a javascript interpreter available in bash or for that matter any other shell just like there is for perl and python

2283236
fadein	show	show	next
for each one i show it with a fadein and .when the animimation finishes i show the next one - for each one i execute fadein with a callback to the next one somehow.

2283262
getter	setter
this means that the getter is public but the setter is private

2283300
python	perl
for better or worse python has a very different philosophy and way of working than perl and getting used to that can be frustrating

2283300
python	perl
take a look at this handy perl - python phrasebook common tasks side by side in both languages

however it is al.so set to getdate by default .so that the value of a new row would contains the timestamp of .when it was created which basically is .when it was last modified

2284680
attributes	properties
the intent here is to provide those extra column attributes as published properties on the tcollectionitem s themselves

2284680
attributes	properties
just create a descendant of tcollectionitem and publishing the properties that represent the extra attributes you want to be editable

2284686
sql-server	oracle
one drawback is that the transactional will required msdtc which will add some overhead .when targeting ms sql-server and even more .when dealing with oracle

2284697
constructor	private
yes it is good to use them .when you are trying to keep a class cohesive and the classes should never be initializer from outside their context of the outer class make the constructor private and you have really nice cohesive encapsulation

2284709
default-value	default
you might not want to or be able to updates all the code that insert into that table .so you would need to put a default on it to ensure that any legacy code can still insert data assuming the default-value is appropriate for the legacy code of course

2284717
selected	textbox
that way .when the form is show that textbox will be selected

2284725
64bit	x86
but i think it returns the program files x86 folder on a 64bit windows machine

2284738
sql-server	oracle
is there any equivalent to sql-server s auto-generated guid as primary key in oracle

2284751
scala	java
i felt that taking a piece of real java about 30 line and iteratively adding scala features worked pretty well

the button will be selected in the windows but no messagebox will appear--the ischecked properties has not been changed

2284759
64bit	x86
system.environment.getfolderpath system.environment.specialfolder.programfiles returns c program files on a 64bit machine unless the code is building to target x86 in which case it returns c program files x86 .so i guess that would work for you

2284760

i was thinking i could hide it by adding a beginrequest call to hide and a show on end request but it doesn t work

2284796
.net	wcf
.net 1.1 web-services don t have a concept of null .so wcf is generator these extra properties for you

2284801

however it s better to use a new scoping fstream object for each file-access to take advantage of the constructor and destructor behavior

2284815
value	field
i want all field that got a certain value to be changed to a different value

2284836

after much searching and frustration a combo of setting height line height and no padding worked for me .when using a fixed height 24px background-image for a text input-field

2285028
constructor	private
a private no-arg constructor

2285037
selected	button
however if i use the debugger or add a button to use a messagebox to show me selected items the item knows it is selected

2285068
double-quotes	single-quotes
we solved that problem by also allowing the value to be embedded in single-quotes and not allowing single-quotes between double-quotes or double-quotes between single-quotes but then customers wanted to add both single and double-quotes in strings or couldn t generator this file in an easy way anymore because the embracing characters depended on the value

2285080
value	field
this is especially true if you want to use the with value to provide the default value to exisiting recording where the field is null in the alter-table statement that changes the column to not null

2285080
value	field
default value are critical for field that the user-interface typically doesn t deal with

2285087
value	field
encryption is called multiple time on many value and field in a secure database

2285089
concat	where
y li is where all the concat work happens

2285100
sigaction	signals

you may also be interested in embedded systemd such as embedded mysql embedded firebird or sql-server compact

2285176
json	xml
issue numbers three the return-value is xml and not json

2285182
concat	where
where first_name like concat prefixtext

2285192

this pattern will ensure that if the subscriber is offline .when the messages is ready it will be held until the subscriber is back online

2285199
json	xml
json xml unless it is for duplication

2285208
printwriter	writer
called the printwriter writer out boolean autoflush constructor which according to the javadoc has the following behavior

2285208
println	output
autofflush - if true the println printf or format methods will fflush the output buffering

2285227
windows-xp	windows
this has worked for windows-xp and vista however the latest java updates for windows 7 doesn t put the java bin directory in the systemd path

2285232
metaphone	soundex
other possibly useful functions could be soundex similar_text or metaphone

2285238
metaphone	soundex
but functions like soundex or metaphone that calculate some kind of digest can help to reduce the numbers of actual comparisons

2285238
metaphone	soundex
if you store the soundex or metaphone value for each known words in your database you can reduce the numbers of possible matches very quickly

2285247
specifications	w3c
should better read w3c specifications next time

2285259
getter	setter
note the relevant getter and setter i m using within my entity is as follows

2285259
value	field
note that test email.com is the value of the byte arrays that i put into the data field .so it s as if the sql is looking for a column named which is actually the named contents of the byte arrays

2285264
switching	screens
.sometime the reconnect al.so fails to fire .so .when i switching to quartz screens i get a que of a half dozen disconnect dialog i have to click on

2285311
rad-controls	telerik
initially i thought about mdi because that s easy to do in .net but then i got my hands on telerik rad-controls and tdi tabbed document interface is now easy to do too and i m a fan of tdi since i m a programmer and most ides successfully use that

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
i currently use fpdf to create some fairly complicated report and am trying to upgrade to tcpdf but i ve found that my same code running through tcpdf is about twice as slow

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
if anyone has .some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf .so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2285315
attributes	properties
the only solution i can come up with on paper that still works with attributess would be to create another attributes that points to a domain entity s properties that you are mirroring in your viewmodel

2285315
attributes	properties
a framework like xval could possibly be extended to handle this new attributes and run the validation attributess on the dependency class properties but with your viewmodel s properties value

2285323
attributes	properties
the only solution i can come up with on paper that still works with attributess would be to create another attributes that points to a domain entity s properties that you are mirroring in your viewmodel

2285323
attributes	properties
a framework like xval could possibly be extended to handle this new attributes and run the validation attributess on the dependency class properties but with your viewmodel s properties value

gridview	listview
listview or gridview this should be pretty easy

2285343
cos	sin	cos	pow	sin	pow	sine	sin	sine	cos	cosine	sin	cosine	cos	cosine	sine
in the c language the standards c libs include common math functions not include in the language itself pow sin and cos for power sine and cosine respectively

2285343
processor	cpu
now the compiler may optimize the standards c libs function sin provided by libm.so to be replace with an call to a native instruction to your cpu fpu s built-in sin function which exists as an fpu instruction fsin for x86 x87 on newer processor like the core 2 series this is correct pretty much as far back as the i486dx

2285360
contains	set
simply setup your fadein animation using a beginanimations block and set the didstop selector to another methods which contains only the fade out animation block

2285393
verilog	hdl
see resources for learning verilog for some info on the difference between hdl programming and computer programming

2285403
python	perl
my preferred behavior would be that existing scripting continue running with old source code and that new instances use the new code what happens for perl and python programs

2285425
derived-class	base-class
the specialized class is called a derived-class while the more general class is known as a base-class

2285429
test-bench	modelsim
in modelsim you can also create and configure characteristics like frequency of different signals a test-bench to verify using timing diagram your model

2285442
python	perl
incidentally with perl and i assume python the program parsing the entire file before execution any of it exactly as recommended here

2285442
python	perl
which is why you don t usually run into the problem with perl or python

2285452
eclipse-rcp	swt
the main reason to choose swt is if you want to building your application on the eclipse-rcp framework where you get a dockable views editor plugins mechanism automatic updates user-roles

2285454
scheme	tcl
but you can t possibly learn tcl or scheme or ml or diesel because single inherited and dynamic-dispatch just aren t there

2285454
pascal	ada
similarly if you ve only ever seen c or c++ or maybe even pascal ada modula clu nothing can really prepare you for the power and expressiveness of first-class-functions

2285454
ocaml	sml
or change between languages in the ocaml f# sml family

2285471
python	perl
python is a study in the opposite approach whose styles often makes perl hackers cringe at the perception of being forced to conform to a stylistic regime

2285481
background-image	transparency
you could always make your new background-image a 9-patch and put the stretchable areas on the right and bottom in a transparency area

2285482
hash	md5
iâ ve just made an application that send an etag whose value is the md5 hash of the response body

2285482
hash	md5
is using md5 hash of the response body as etag wrong

2285482
hash	md5
this last question is hard to answer unless you are the author .so iâ m trying to find the weak points of using an md5 hash as an etag

2285492
itemscontrol	expander
i want to make an itemscontrol that provides some of its own children and then .when used can add additional children similarly to the built-in expander class

2285493
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari
i have a small issue with jquery-on safari mac osx 10.6 - the page loads fine under firefox mac and internet-explorer win but has to be refreshed to work properly in safari.

2285496
arrays	map
in ruby you can use the map collect methods on an arrays to modify it

2285510
value	field
in the query all the field value are set except the autonumber field

2285539
selected	listbox
.when user selected the recording in a listbox all the details are updates in multiple databound controls on the form

2285540
hash	md5
generator an md5 hash of a webpage costs process power and time on the server

2285549
contains	elements
elements.attributes contains the attributes of the elements itself not its children

2285552
macros	vba
i m trying to write an excel macros using vba to automate import csv text into a spreadsheet but i ve never done it before

2285553
value	field
.so if there is .something in the parameter which means the user entered data for that field it will checked if the field equals that user-entered value

2285553
value	field
if the user didn t enter anything and the parameter is null it will test against the second value which is the field itself - and as the field is always equals to itself this will return all recording - it won t filtering based on this field at all.

2285566
itemscontrol	expander
expander derives from headeredcontentcontrol and this adds in the itemscontrol behavior to that

2285577
shadowbox	lightbox
this is to wire up shadowbox lightbox clone for this actionlink

2285584
hash	md5
if you are using md5 and you can caching store the associations between the resource and the md5 hash then that s a fine solution

2285588
sql-server	mysql
.so far i ve been very pleased with sql-server and mysql which is free

2285591
imageview	textview
using a framelayout contains both the imageview and textview

2285597
priority-queue	heap
why not use a heap based data structure such as a minimum priority-queue

2285600
arrays	loops
after that i turn the query into an arrays with mysql_fetch_arrays then i tried iterator by row through the fetched arrays using a for each loops

2285603
put	get
but what i get is everytime i run a page the instances is null .so the object restart as you can see i put an echo empty

2285604
dependency-injection	repository-pattern
the repository-pattern is based around inversion-of-control and dependency-injection patterns unit test just happen to need inversion-of-control and dependency-injection to make things easier to test

2285604
entity-framework	nhibernate	entity-framework	data-access	entity-framework	ado.net	nhibernate	ado.net	data-access	nhibernate	data-access	ado.net
if your implementation of schoolclassrepository used ado.net sqlconnections sqlcommands... to access data you can later building another schoolclassrepository that uses nhibernate entity-framework or some other data-access methods

2285607
32-bit	64bit
that s the reason you get the error that it is not a valid 32-bit applications it s not it s a 64bit application and 32-bit windows s can t parsing the pe32+ header

2285641
any	set
instead you can set a default in the styles for the user-controls and get an additional benefit of being able to overrides it on any declare instances by just doing what s in your original example

2285652
callback	methods
another way is to use ajax to register a callback methods to an event that the ajax xmlhttprequest object will initiate once notified by the browser i m assuming...

2285658
gearman	worker
of course they are both really the same thing but the way it works out for me is that if you are trying to fan out work to be done and the worker can work independently gearman is the better way to do it

2285672
code-coverage	cobertura
unit tests and code-coverage work great but this messages appears .when drilling into the cobertura coverage report for my files that are not unit tests

2285685
jquery	.post
i am not sure how or why it happened but i found i use jquery and ajax to .post everything then refresh or not if i dont need to

2285694
low-level	hardware
in reality most operating systemdd and hardware make use of interrupts that jump to what we can call a subroutine to perform the low-level data read and then return control back to the operating systemd

2285702
selected	button
selected errors then clear toolbar button

2285705
memory-access	numa
the same reasoning applies to chip that have multiple l2 caching and numa non-uniform memory-access architectures

2285718
derived-class	nested-class
how to use the templates nested-class in the derived-class

2285734
primitive	int
python primitive object int dictionary lists etc are all about as thread-safe as one would like though if you are new to threaded applications they won t protect you from your own ignorance

2285735
json	xml
this is often json xml or yaml but can be any other valid mime types

2285735
put	get
the set of operations supported by the web service using http methods .post get put or delete

2285743
put	get
they use the http verbs get .post put and delete and others sometimes

2285750
solaris	unix	solaris	linux	linux	unix
is size of _posix_path_max is same for all unix flovors linux solaris

2285756
paredit	slime
you ll need to put together a few pieces emacs slime which works perfectly well with clojure -- see swank-clojure swank-clojure the clojure implementation of slime s server counterpart clojure-mode paredit and of course the clojure jar for a start then perhaps some extras among which leiningen would perhaps be the most notable

2285756
paredit	slime
setting up clojure incanter emacs slime swank and paredit .post on the blog of the incanter project

2285764
any	set
unfortunately lvm_getitemposition required that lparam is set to a points struct within the address spaces of the process owning the listview explorer.exe .so inorder to do any of this you need to open the explorer.exe process allocate .some memory within that process calculate the address of that memory relative to the explorer process send the lvm_getitemposition messages with the freshly allocated memory as the lparam and finally read the contents of that memory

2285778
put	get
the http verbs get .post put and delete are typical actions that you can apply against any resource

2285784
versioning	upgrade
heroku made all its apps upgrade to the latest versioning of bundler 0.9.4

2285789
activation	account
simpler i m trying to write activation procedure of anonymous user already registered account

2285789
logout	login
is there any way to hardcode credentials of some user login before some operations then logout

2285793
perl	php
recently programming in php i thought i had a working perl regular expression but .when i checked it against what i wanted it didn t work

2285802
hash	md5
should work a bit better since md5 hash usually are expressed as hexadecimal numbers

2285822
arrays	map
the functions which process arrays take .some time to initializer data .so i thought to caching function functor together with data and store them in map

2285830
selected	textbox
.so ideally i want to combine this with a textbox into which one can start typing at which points .some results will be display and a user can selected the item they want

2285835
active-directory	adam
i m not entirely sure if it will work on xp home but microsoft has adam or active-directory application mode which is sort of a non-server versioning of ad for applications to use.

2285842
selected	textbox
you may use a hidden textbox beside the combobox and show it only if the used selected the custom item

2285863
webforms	asp.net
i m in the process of converting an asp.net webforms into a user-controls and there an event that now says

2285864
g++	gcc
i ran the code in gcc using gettimeofday i ll paste code below and used g++ -o2 file.cpp and got slightly faster results then c#

2285869
textbox	button
like clipping borders button clipped textbox

2285887
dictionary	for-loop
also if you use a for-loop to iterate over a dictionary you are iterator over the key

2285889
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
be aware of sql-injection attacks and i highly recommend reading the curse and blessing of dynamic-sql

2285899
key-value	key
what s happening here is that iterator on word_dict is returning a key only say foo which you re then trying to unpack into the variables key-value

2285924
attributes	properties
i m trying to assign the named attributes for the selected based on a modelmetadata properties

2285968
windows-server	windows
windows-server 2003 and windows

2285968
windows-server	windows
on windows-server 2003 or windows

2285980
radians	sin	radians	cos	cos	sin
your equation is correct if you want to rotate x y about 0 0 by deg but note that often cos and sin functions expect arguments in radians rather than degrees .so you may need to multiplying deg by pi 180 radians per degree

2285980
cos	sin
if you need to find the location of other rectangle vertices besides x y after rotating then you should either store and rotate them along with x y or keep .some information about the rectangle s orientation such as deg .so you can recompute them as x+width cos deg y+height sin deg

2285987
spring	guice
i use spring and guice in equals measures and i ve noticed that these frameworks do use the impl postfix but sparingly

2285995
value	field
.when the field is blank or the value in the field is the same as emptytext the field is considered to be blank

2285995
value	field	hide	show
effectively .when the text value is emptytext hide the passwd field and show a normals textfield

2286007
arrays	loops
though you ll need to probably write a loops or function that can get to the right place in your multi-dimensional arrays perform the merge and also change the relevant key

2286014
contains	any
however c-strings cannot contains the null-character since null is used to terminate c-strings and al.so cannot represent x or z bits .so this is not a format that should be used if you need to distinguish any possible vector value

2286019
children	tree
on a tree of depth 1 a root and some children it hits the python recursion limit already

2286024
sql-server	mysql
we can successfully execute direct statements insert ... selected ... etc using odbc for both sql-server 2008 and mysql

2286024
sql-server	mysql
we have a test program allowing us to use mysql or sql-server direct execution or calling stored-procedures

2286024
sql-server	mysql
the other 3 cases work direct mysql direct sql-server stored proc mysql

2286032
constructor	object
for auto object on stack allocation constructor call and deallocation destructor call basically are transparency as you request

2286035
dictionary	map
i m not sure a switching is the best idea but i m also not sure how to correctly employ a dictionary to map the data retrieval and object creation to a specific types

2286044
constructor	object
and there are object out there without a default-constructor - for these how would you feed constructor arguments to a function

2286069
double	int
first .when casting you need a types double int

2286070
operators	keyword
because the user is allowed to overrides operators new but not the new-operators which is a keyword

2286070
constructor	object
without this dichotomy a user could overrides the operators new function but the compiler would still have to treat this as a special function and call the appropriate constructor s for the object s being created

2286086
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
mention dynamic-sql and you likely will be hounded about sql-injection attacks

2286095
cosine	sine
btw they do use tailor series to calculate sine and cosine

2286112
.net	wcf
the improvements to wcf in .net 4 are definitely making me give is a second look

2286115
selected	checkbox
using checkbox the user selected rows from a display html table

2286143
python	perl
it s lightweight in the sense you mention as is my main ide in the past few years for developing python perl vhdl and sometimes even c code

2286145
perl	awk	perl	tcl
with the first already being familiar from its use in sh bash tcl perl awk .

2286148
contains	elements
in a java ee environment you specify your datasource in a elements in each persistence-unit of the persistence.xml file which can contains several persistence-units and the datasource will be obtained by the entitymanager only .when needed only if a data-access is really needed

2286164
children	nodes
nodes ids are not unique but they are unique within the children of a particular nodes

2286176
ip-address	proxy
you ll want to consider users behind proxy as may return the wrong ip-address in that context

2286177
lookup	any
are you going to be doing any lookup from park to city

2286178
calloc	malloc
new delete are keyword in the c++ language like for and while whereas malloc calloc are function-calls in the standards c libs like printf and sleep

2286187
.when	ready
and later .when you re ready submit it

2286222
python	php
i must say i m impressed most of things happens automatically i m used to write by hand in php and python

2286222
postgresql	firebird
database server will be a decent machine with raid-1 2 hard drive running mysql5.1 or postgresql or firebird open to suggestions

2286222
deployment	install
easy deployment only mysql-connector install

2286238
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
doing such things in modern browsers is trivial but in ie you need to call msxml through javascript and .net stuff inorder to do the same transformation native to other far more modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome opera k-meleon konqueror epiphany flock....you get the idea

2286254
linux	unix
alt text the firebird rdbms is a very good option because is very stable fast runs on linux windows and a variety of unix platform and meet with you requirements

2286256
push	pull
this sort of thing is great for fixing up a mistake in your local repository but since you re changing history make sure you didn t push to someone else or they didn t pull from you the original versioning before you fixed it

2286271
required	checked
error messages i am getting is authentication required error 401 .i checked documentation it say that

2286277
response	timeout
in case of a server or timeout error defined response should be false

2286304
double	int
note if you 15 is the cd price then you should consider using bigdecimal instead of int double or whatever you are using

2286304
double	int
if it was something else then change the bigdecimal for and int double and its corresponding parameter named

2286305
touch	drag
touch drag inside the same as dragging your finger over a piano

2286305
touch	drag
however many people including myself have had trouble with touch drag inside

2286340
put	get
i get the impression that it was removed entirely for a versioning or two and then put back but with warnings and tut-tuts about overrides the default-value 0 which really means 17 which the manual promise is enough to represent any ieee 754 double

2286351
subclassing	base-class
in the case of polymorphism the compiler will generator a single button class but you will now have another base-class to maintain and you will be forced to subclassing it for any new action you add to your collections

2286353
any	set
for example would set the class s static x variables and any access to the x variables will use the last set value from calling foo assuming no other ways to set x

2286353
subclassing	superclass
note that you don t need to cast subclassing to their superclass as the jvm already knows the class heirarchy just like the compiler knows in c++

2286354
.when	ready
i currently have my team working out of branches in svn and merge into trunk then tag .when ready for production

2286361
order	add
i add a separate column into feed called rank to denote the order of the item

2286362
active-directory	adam
like active-directory adam red hat

2286383
toolchain	platform
objective-c is supported by the gcc toolchain on all of its supported platform

2286383
python	ruby
i m a huge objective-c fan but much of what makes objective-c awesome can be found in other modern dynamic-languages such as python or ruby

2286384
value	field
more specifically i have some custom in-place-editor field from my own helpers based on scriptaculous and i would like to updates some partials whenever new value are submitted on the field

2286393
parsing	comma
it s easy enough to parsing those entries via the comma to get 1 and 2 but what s the most efficient way to match a sql recording to the query

2286395
any	set
any one can guide me how to set the date-format for date time picker of vs using c#

2286408
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove	onmousemove	onmouseup
you defined onmousedown onmouseout onmousemove and onmouseup

2286410
put	get
making an application restful usually means among other things to actually use the concept of reacting differently to get .post put or delete request on the same url

2286411
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i don t know for ie and safari but it works on firefox google-chrome and opera

2286416
directory	folder
my flex .application is successfully calling functions in a javascript file through the externalinterface class .when these are in the bin-debug folder and the javascript file is located in the same directory as the flex .app

2286422
implements	extends
if i need a extends b but i also need to have a function that accepts a c and i want to pass a to that function then i must make either b or c an interface rather than a parent class and make it a extends b implements c or vice versa

2286424
www-mechanize	lwp
the de facto methods are with lwp and www-mechanize to pass on the request

2286476
postgresql	mysql	ip-address	hostname
with shared-hosting you may be allowed to open up a ports to a server database my website s hosting server provides both mysql and postgresql and but allows remote access only to mysql and only via hostname ip-address

2286515
rollback	commit
using this you can begin transactional and commit transactional or rollback in the event of an error

2286542
stdin	eof
because of that converter will never get eof on stdin .so will not exit

2286542
fflush	stdout
once you fix the previous error and get the process to close that will fflush stdout

2286542
fflush	puts	fflush	stdout
you can also consider adding fflush stdout after your puts line

2286543

eg if in 64bit a b 32-bit

2286549
linux	bsd
linux bsd if gnome

2286574
parentheses	operators
even a partials solution to the problem flagging extra spaces invalid operators would likely be better than nothing even if i can t solve the parentheses issue

2286578
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework and identity columns short answer is entity-framework plays well with int key but not guid key

2286580
configuration	environment
this tends to include searching the systemd path registry hklm software javasoft java runtime environment for properly install versioninging and common location for jres and picking an appropriate one based on what you ve told the wrapper s configuration is the minimum jre whether to choose latest versioning etc

2286585
shell	bash
is the language powerful enough particularly with string operations to compete with a macros processor like the pthreads shell and particularly bash

scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java
java scala jruby closure and groovy are all powerful languages but java requiredd a lot of boilerplate and the jvm they all required just takes too long to startup

2286585
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
otoh perl python and ruby all startup quickly and have powerful string handling and pretty much everything-else-handling operations .so they tend to occupy the .sometimes-disparaged-but-not-easily-encroached-upon scripting world

2286590
decrement	increment
this is a simple enough syntax that you could hand code a simple parsing which count the parentheses increment and decrement a counter as it goes

2286591
parentheses	operators
you can easily use regex s to match your tokens numbers operators etc but you cannot match balanced parentheses

2286618

i can then look at a building on hud.son and if .so desired grab the changeset id and do a hg updates on my local repo to get that revision of code

2286686
python	perl
being a hardcore perl programmer all i can say is do not buy o reilly s learning python

2286686
python	perl
i ve had the most success taking past perl programs and translating them into python trying to make use of as many new techniques as possible

2286728
selected	button
i m trying to make a button that call it to allow the user to selected a file with the following code

2286770

2286774
synchronous	.when
.when synchronous is full 2 the sqlite engine will pause at critical moments to make sure that data has actually been written to the disk surface before continuing

2286774
synchronous	.when
.when synchronous is normals 1 the sqlite engine will still pause at the most critical moments but less often than in full mode

2286794
communication	messages
it would be fine if i know how to enable two computers to communication in the form of sending and receiving messages using c++ c#

2286821
firefox	opera
css3 supports this there is also a special -moz-border-radius styles atttribute which firefox maybe opera supports

2286837
constructor	object
then i would create only one class of swingworker that takes a timedependant object in the constructor and its doinbackground would call calcupdatetime and done would call drawupdatetime

2286842
beautifulsoup	elementtree
in the past i ve done everything from write my own parsing use regular expression and used various parsing libs like python elementtree and beautifulsoup

2286861
value	field
because you are using the templates field in the grid .so try to debugging and hold the cell then try to find the textbox inside it and then read it s value

2286870
arrays	loops
you use a hashtable to store currently discovered key access o 1 and then loops through the arrays

2286890
put	get
how can i get input from the user if they are to separate their input by whitespace 1 2 3 4 5 and i want to put it in an arrays

2286899
while-loop	infinite
however the above while-loop is infinite the threadcount never changes which means during the join methods no background-thread is running

2286926
gearman	worker
it s really easy to do what gearman does on top of rabbitmq which can certainly fan out messages to independent worker

2286940
put	get	hashtable	set
a simple implementation might be an instances of hashtable in a class with public static-methods to get and set variables by calling the hashtable put and get methods

2286959
contains	any
files can contains any arbitrary pattern of bytes .so there is no digital way to create a file that is corrupt

what s tricky is how to display the selected your language button in a language neutral way

2286999
unicorn	thin
- install unicorn and thin as gem

2287014
contains	any
take a look at this easy explanation and for now ignore all the stuff about ïµ because you don t have any productions which contains the empty-string

google-maps	gps
i would like to know what is the best way to get the gps location off multiple phones on to a google-maps on a website

2287026
extjs	gxt
i m building an application using extjs for gwt gxt

2287033
linked-list	nodes
the f# list types is essentially a linked-list where each nodes has a next

2287036
constructor	private
search for the myimageframe class in the image.cpp file it is nothing more than a class with a private bitmap field a custom constructor to set the bitmap and the windows client size and an event handler for evt_paint

2287051
id3v2	ogg
according to the introduction page here ogg wma and aac uses their own formats separated from id3v2

2287062
swfupload	uploadify
yeah swfupload and uploadify both have ways to get them to work with ruby-on-rails

2287066
32-bit	64bit
built-in int are good until 32-bit on any systemd some systemdd support 64bit value

2287078
default-value	arguments
the default-value will be overrides .when you pass the arguments via the command-line

2287098
linux	unix
nb this is linux unix specific

2287116
radio-button	checkbox
- checkbox radio-button combobox open questions

2287116
hide	show
- conditional questions show hide further questions .when a certain option is chosen

2287155
keyboard	mouse
for the broad masses i would most likely go for solution #2 as it should suit both keyboard and mouse centric users

2287167
implements	extends
my guess is you need to overrides and implements this methods in the widget you create the richtextarea widget in and set the custom styles in the onload methods of that widget or you can extends the richtextarea and implements the onload in this extendsed richtextarea widget

2287173
private-members	private
there s no such things as private properties private methods or private-members in javascript

2287177
version-control	git
i m using git for version-control

2287182
nsscrollview	nsimage
assume i load an nsimage of dimension 2000x2000 and display only a portion of the picture inside an nsscrollview with frame size 500x300

2287213
entity-framework	nhibernate
i have used both nhibernate and entity-framework and both are great

2287229
json	xml
it s free unless you abuse it or volumes get too big and returns json or xml

2287235
directory	folder
then i would rather try to add a linked folder referencing the root directory of those classes and selected that folder .when export the project to a jar

2287236
decimal	hex
use the hex function to convert 48 to a decimal numbers like datageist does in his answer

2287262
double	int
first you need to determine whether it s a whole numbers or not by comparing it cast as both an int and a double

2287266
directory	folder
the folder that represent the path to the package must not be include in the directory include in the classpath only the top directory for the class folder should be there

2287298
contains	any
is the folder contains common.php part of your includes-path by any chance

2287312
enumerator	any
i can t think there s any way to achieve this that doesn t involve enumerating the range at least unless as already mentioned you have other information about how the range will be construct and therefore can infer the desired value without enumerator

2287317
ssms	ssas
we have a analysis service olap-cube ssas 2008 deployed at a test server ms serve 2008 in our domain you can browse the olap-cube via ssms without problem

2287333
getter	setter
implements your own getter and setter

2287333
getter	setter
have the compiler implements getter and setter by properties synchronized

2287346
nvidia	ati
but use perfhud from nvidia or gpuperfstudio from ati or gpa from intel

2287359
listbox	textbox
instead of visualizing it in a textbox you could use a listbox for instances and every time you add a new item to the log you could add a new item to the listbox

2287360
delphi	basic
the first answer pointed to delphi basic which is a really nice site

2287369
vertex-buffer	normals
the easiest way that works for me is to create a vertex-buffer that contains each vertex twice with normals points right or left depending on whether they are the right or left edges of the line

2287373
double	int
this is because the compiler assumed that f returned an int and the assignment converted that int to a double

2287373
defined	declare
the compiler still compiled the code because it couldn t tell that f wasn t defined the way it was implicit declare

2287392
.when	ready
.so if i went to another activity in my application or another application entirely my service could keep running and keep downloading the file .so it would be ready .when i returned to my application

2287393
python	php
as for integration of your .app with that webserver it depends a bit on the load and what kind of experience you have with writing software in php python or other languages supported by your webserver via interpreter of course

2287393
python	php
server with qt and access that from a python or php scripting

2287412
arrays	loops
you can just loops through the arrays and unset any items that are equals to 0

2287431
actionscript	mxml
i want to convert the following code to actionscript mxml works fine

2287451
inline-assembly	assembly
maybe there is an inline-assembly libs that does this for gcc icc supports gcc assembly

2287455
contains	elements
the question ask to create a methods that takes an arrays of int as an argumetn and returns a sortedset contains the elements of the that arrays

2287460
put	get
we don t know what it can handle besides a -- it could be any superclass of a all the way up to object . in this particular case it s probably safe enough but if you consider something like a list we could be in a lot of trouble you can safely put an a into a but if you assume you re only going to get a s out of it you re going to get classcastexception .

2287461
command-line	cmd
and the same cmd you use at the command-line are available to those batch-file you discuss even though there s slight difference such as the use of for for variables inside the batch-file

2287464
silverlight	wpf
i am assuming you are using either wpf or silverlight

2287468
hide	show
1 to hide show you are better just using the hide and show mothods available on a jquery object

2287508
gethashcode	equals
as you can see i have a base-class implements a generics identifier equals gethashcode and

2287508
value	field	gethashcode	equals
providing the field with a guid value for id before adding it to the set will take me to the evil assign ids and if you were to answer to not rely on id for equals gethashcode and to find a natural model-related key...well i don t believe i ve ever found in these properties which provide the immutabilty uniqueness a key deserves

2287532
directory	folder
how to make eclipse treat a directory contains class files as a resource directory and make it copy-paste to the output folder bin

2287556
punctuation	comma
edit thinking about it that won t match punctuation comma apostrophes

2287557
32-bit	64bit
i also believe that the code will break if it s compiled into a 64bit binary but the remote process is 32-bit or the other way round

2287568
maven-assembly-plugin	maven	executable-jar	jar
i would use maven and the maven-assembly-plugin - this makes it really easy to make a jar with dependencies - or even an executable-jar

2287575
postgresql	mysql	contains	any
i do understand that things like postgresql arrays make it impossible to simply attach the mysql interface to any postgresql database but the database was created only through the mysql interface then there would be a guarantee that it did not contains arrays

2287624
getter	setter
i thought this was a good idea until .when i encounter frameworks that required setter and getter methods

2287624
uibinder	gwt
right now i am trying to adapt all of smartgwt into gwt uibinder especially those classes that are not a gwt widget

2287624
protected	public
the annotations framework would then initializer transport machine and guzzler as hidden members of car and expand to break-out the protected public characteristics in the precedence dictated by the project annotations sequences into actual source code or into byte-code

2287624
boolean	int
it would be wonderful too if the annotations plugins framework lets me specify that boolean int or whatever else needs to be converted from string and does the conversion parsing for me too

2287626
createfile	drive
.so call createfile get a handle then call getfinalpathnamebyhandle volume_name_guid this works because network drive don t have volume guids

2287637
gethashcode	equals
the base-class has overrides equals gethashcode methods etc..

2287637
transient	entity	persistent	transient
in my implementation of the equals methods in the base-class i checked whether the entity is transient not yet persistent

2287637
transient	entity
an entity is transient .when the id that has been assign to it is still the default-value

2287637
transient	entity
else .when the entity is transient i call base.gethashcode and store the returned value in oldhashcode

2287642
coalesce	isnull
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is .when checked for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

2287656
coalesce	isnull
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

2287669
required	checked
then checked other places for handle leaks are you using any object that required disposing that aren t being dispose

2287673
coalesce	isnull
to prefer isnull over coalesce .when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
isnull vs coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
isnull vs coalesce speed test

2287680
put	get
i put breakpoints in these functions and they don t even get called

2287684
contains	elements
contains the elements of the that

2287700
alfresco	liferay
there are plenty of commercial tools assisting you on migrating from lotus to sharepoint this seems to be an almost inevitable process unless you prefer to go for liferay alfresco .

2287717
assign	add
just add a couple of directives and the compiler chunks it in pieces and assign each piece of loops to a different processor

2287718
.war	jar
and i also red that you have an option to pack your dependencies jars in your .war or ear but what if i want to pack my application as jar together with all dependencies jars inside output target folder

2287744
latitude-longitude	location
location latitude-longitude

2287765
sql-server	mysql
some jobs are equals on sql-server and some on mysql but the sql-server result is the correct one

2287770
http	ssl
however it also appears that some browsers send a bad_certficate alert to close an http connection .when the server certificate acquired during the ssl handshake has expired is self-signed fails the hostname verification etc

2287772
configuration	logging
for instances if the new configuration value would contains the string update_forced you could force the users to reload the .app by logging them out automatically a little harsh perhaps

2287772
versioning	upgrade
if it contains the string update_recommended just show a little icons at the top right corner saying that there is a new versioning and that they should upgrade in their own time

2287805
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
for laying out component s vertically you should consider using boxlayout or gridbaglayout

2287812
void	main
- void main

2287825
environment	building
running the application locally in the dev environment works correctly however once i try to building a testing or production .war i get the following exception-handling .when the triggers is run

2287855
groovy	java
seems that there are code dependency at quartz-0.4.1 src java org codehaus groovy grails plugins quartz listener sessionbinderjoblistener.java 1

2287866
sql-server	mysql
for example a mysql varchar can hold up to 255 characters whereas a sql-server varchar can hold up to 4000 characters

2287876
any	set
thanks for your comments - hg debuginstall runs fine just report one problem - i didn t set a username in any of the configuration files

2287930
directory	folder
with jar eclipse will flatten your project .so if you have several .source folder all of them will appear in the top directory of the jar

2287931
contains	elements
.so i tried searching for the elements themselves and just hiding them if they contains but its not working either

2287961
json	xml
requirements are fairly vanilla http-get .post for a small numbers of resource types xml and json output needs to live in the same appdomain with a soap asmx web service

2287962
python	c++
could you please help me with how to go about in c++ if its easy or if easier could you suggest some other way through some other programming language may like python perl.

2287977
fadeout	fadein
you have chaining your fadein and fadeout

2287985
fadeout	fadein
.when you use fadein and fadeout you don t just use out on that div s background but on the entire elements including all sub elementss

2287985
background-color	transparency
therefore you need to set the background-color to blue and then aftwards set it to transparency

2288002
any	set
in the sense the words bingo followed by a tab followed by any random set of characters till the eol

2288006
getter	setter
the entities with import getter and setter removed

2288013
formatting	printing
the built-in printing and formatting functions do use the options value as a default

2288013
double	int
the gmp and rcdd package deal with multiple precision arithmetic via an interace to the gmp libs but this is mostly related to big int rather than more decimal places for your double

2288022
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in ie firefox and google-chrome and it seems that .when you disabled cookies the document.cookie object becomes unavailable

2288035
order	join
django can order by columns from other tables eg user.objects.all .order_by -submission__date but you wont get distinct results because of the join

2288041
selected	checkbox
you can toggle selected all of the checkbox or you can click and drag a selectedion to selected multiple checkbox in one go

2288071
exception-handling	try-catch
what does it mean in .net try-catch block without any exception-handling as parameter for catch

2288081
tokenize	parsing
the php tokenize - namely token_get_all - is probably the most reliable tool for this as it uses the same parsing mechanism the php interpreter itself does

2288099
default	reset
another tip is to have a reset-method in global-variables to reset all the static value back to their default in case the user wants to reset the .app from within the .app

2288100
facebook	linkedin
can anyone explain how facebook and linkedin implements the home screens widget for their iphone applications

2288104
testng	junit
if you are using testng or junit 4.7+ since surefire-555 it is possible to run tests in parallels see the parallels and the threadcount optional-parameters but that s not a default

2288106
crossover	mutation
i ve written a basic genetic-algorithm with a binary encoding genes that building a fitness value and evolves through several iterator using tournament selection mutation and crossover

2288106
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
to reiterate my ga performs well and contains what any typical ga would fitness methods get and set population selection crossover etc but now i need to plug it into a gui to get my maze running

2288106
crossover	mutation
the fitness function merely adds together the value of these genes and in the pop class handles selection mutation and crossover of two selected individuals

2288108
jquery	.post
to integrated it with an html page you would use jquery to .post the file to a page that returns only text and set up a data received handler to updates the user-interface as messages come through on the text file

2288109
asp.net-mvc	wcf
if you have more non-structured data both bare-bones wcf with the rest starter kit or asp.net-mvc seem to be quite valuable choices

2288109
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms	silverlight	wpf
.so i guess in your positioning i d checkout wcf-data-services first and use it if it fits the bill - and if not choose between wcf-rest starter kit which al.so works with classic asp.net webforms or winforms or con.sole apps or wpf or silverlight - or checkout asp.net-mvc if you re going that way already in your project

2288110
rollback	commit
mysql reference start transactional commit and rollback syntax

2288117
homescreen	icons
if you mean the launchd styles view that behaves and looks the same as the iphone s homescreen with the .app icons then you can use three20 s ttlaunchdview

2288129
contains	elements
also i notice that .when editing a page the url contains extra elements

2288131
python	c++
i know about boost for c++ but i m interested in c and python

2288155
python	perl
i know it s not python but for a regular expression-based approach to this problem you could take a look at poe filtering ircd which handles irc server protocols see poe filtering irc compat for the client protocols additions parsing for perl s poe component irc framework

2288157
locale	french
i want my .app to support multiple localization english french and i was expecting the abpeoplepickernavigationcontroller to display the correct localised strings .when i changed the phone s locale

2288158
value	field
due to compatibility reasons the example user entity in the database contains field called disabled which is the types of int with value 0 or 1 to be mapped to bool

2288158
getter	setter
in my edmx mapping this field is called disabled and it s getter and setter are internal

2288174
sequences	unique
i m building an application that needs a random unique id for each user not a sequences

2288175
uibinder	gwt
there is a known issue with the uibinder in combinations with internationalization see also this recent thread on the gwt bugtracker

2288191
uibinder	gwt
i had actually have the same problem as you do - after migrating to gwt 2.0 i had a properties-file i wanted to use in my uibinder files

2288191
uibinder	gwt
unfortunately i couldn t get it to work like i wanted to - it seems the gwt devs want people to use the syntax describe in the i18n guide for uibinder - where a messages interface is created during compile for every uibinder templates etc

2288200
stringbuilder	streamreader
i m using a streamreader to read the source file i then make and store the changes to a stringbuilder using appendline

2288200
streamreader	streamwriter
i then create a streamwriter set-up with the same encoding as the streamreader and write the file

2288202
controllers	routes
you would specify this in the router .so multiple routes would points to different controllers

2288207
dictionary	map
2 - use a dictionary that will map the heading to the definition

2288211
elasticsearch	sphinx
what i can refer you is to this thread at sphinx forum which i think proves the superior distribute model of elasticsearch

2288223
richfaces	tomahawk
to use jsf efficiently i also use at least apache orchestra and some components libs like tomahawk or richfaces

2288223
stripes	grails
i m most interested in spring+wicket grails maybe gwt2 stripes

2288228
scala	java
i gave a presentation on re-writing java classes in scala

2288228
scala	java
it has lots of examples of java - scala and hopefully makes the gains obvious

2288236
line-endings	newline
for an interesting read about line-endings checkout the great newline schism

2288241
priority-queue	queue
i need to implements a priority-queue where the priority of an item in the queue can change and the queue adjusts itself .so that items are always removed in the correct order

2288245
droppable	draggable
based on your feedback i pieced together something that makes every item both draggable and droppable and replace the content of the two items on drop

2288282
fwrite	fopen	lan	vpn
if the servers are in same network lan vpn you can use windows shared samba or nfs to mount a remote directory to you local filesystems and simply write to file directly using fopen fwrite functions

2288282
scp	ssh	sftp	scp	sftp	ssh
use ssh via scp or sftp

2288284
seam	jsf
seam jsf + ejb3 jpa

2288284
seam	jsf
seam offers benefits of jsf minus the issues associated with it

2288292
output	mode
use the output for the relevant configuration if building project a in debugging mode then use the debugging versioning of the libs for project b and c

2288308
export	report
then in sql developer data modeller you can open the model you want to report on and export it to this repository via file export to report schema

2288346
version-control	git
btw you are mentioning not to have to scraper my systemd and reinstall everything -- i use git to version-control my dev environment once in a while .so i can checkout the previous snapshot before the trouble got started

2288351
linux	unix
works well for linux mac and unix systemd and puts the ssh parts in one cmd rather than every access

2288356
arrays	loops
i m not sure how to loops the difference function into the arrays and store it into the new arrays i have made

2288370
data-members	instances
a data-members that refers to a classb instances

2288370
data-members	instances
instead of passing a function pointers to class a make an instances of x with its data-members to classb filled in and pass this to class a

2288403
callback	methods
if you don t create a callback methods how do you know .when the send

2288413
openrasta	wcf
building restful service with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience

2288425
verilog	vhdl
afaik you get the whole package verilog systemverilog vhdl e

2288458
callback	methods
the last two are probably callback methods

2288462
data-annotations	xval
this controllers validation the input using xval and data-annotations

2288489
postgresql	mysql
as a result there is no transactional ddl possible in mysql one of the most handy things in postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
using postgresql as an engine in mysql would kill this option

2288489
postgresql	mysql
postgresql also has a much richer sql dictionary that might give problems in mysql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
what is called a database in mysql is sort of a schema in postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
imho it doesn t make sense to create a postgresql-engine in mysql if you want to use postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
i m afraid you would lose the best things of postgresql because of the limitations of mysql

2288491
jprofiler	jvm	jprofiler	yourkit	yourkit	jvm
use jprofiler or yourkit or the jvm s built-in tools to find out what it s doing and reduce the memory usage

2288496
implements	abstract
if the methods is defined as abstract it does not contains an implementation but it needs to be implements by its inheritors

2288496
contains	any
an interface only defined methods signature and any class inheriting from it must implements all methodss contains in the interface

2288498

you have to defined an abstract methods b in the base-class test which makes this class abstract .so you cannot have instances of it to call this methods otherwise the function b is not definedd in this class only in it s subclassing of which the base-class knows nothing and should not have to know anything

2289981
compact-framework	.net
windows forms is not equals to the windows-mobile one since the compact-framework is just a subset of the .net

2290239
memcheck	valgrind
i assume you re using valgrind memcheck tool which is what it is famo.us for

2290239
memcheck	valgrind
since you are using valgrind already you might also try running your program through formerly exp-ptrcheck which is an experimental tool that is designed to catch certain types of errors that memcheck will miss including access checked for stack and global arrays and use of pointsers that happen to points to a valid object but not the object that was intended

2290240
dialog	pop-up
qdialog 1 is set to qt pop-up qdialog 2 was set to qt dialog by default

2290248
constructor	object
no parameterless constructor defined for this object

2290255
selected	button
well you could add a class to your radio button and then selected it easily with jquery

2290263
firefox	safari
in firefox safari etc the modal behaves as it should opening centering centering above all of the existing on-page content

2290263
colorbox	thickbox
i can verify that there is no conflict having both of these modal scripting css files concurrently as the problem still occurs with colorbox even .when thickbox is removed entirely

2290315
decimal	hex
does this mean converting a hex into decimal and then using that as an index for an arrays of words

2290322
contains	elements
li contains elements click .find li contains elements not alt first .prevall li.alt

2290345
json	xml
using a webservice you ll get exactly the information you re looking for in a concise format json or xml based on a simple set of parameters

2290346
compact-framework	.net
as others have mentioned .net compact-framework is the way to go

2290346
compact-framework	.net
a helpful hint to determine if something is supported by the cf there is a little handheld icons on the msdn pages that if you scroll over says supported by .net compact-framework

2290354
haskell	ocaml
while dons is correct that multicore parallelsism at the thread level is better supported in haskell it sounds like you could live with process level parallelsism from your phrase ideally separating out each execution to run in parallels . which is supported quite well in ocaml

2290354
haskell	ocaml
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful types systemd but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module systemd than haskell

2290354
haskell	ocaml
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

2290354
haskell	ocaml
that said learning ocaml is a great stepping-stone towards learning haskell because many of the underlying concepts are very similar .so you could always migrate to haskell later and find a lot of things familiar there

2290374
base-class	inherited
i make all tests touching the database inherited from a base-class the ensures the test is run in a transactionscope that is never committed

2290375
matplotlib	scipy
i install python 2.6.4 and several additional package numpy scipy matplotlib and of course nltk

2290402
contains	elements
in the case of elements the .val methods returns an arrays contains each selected option

2290413
downcasting	constructor
if you can control what s being passed into the othererror constructor you ought to be able to make this work for the errormessage types by downcasting the .obj to a types which is itself structurally comparable

2290426
dotnetnuke	umbraco
umbraco is a bit different than other cmss like sitefinity dotnetnuke or drupal

2290426
sitecore	umbraco
i ve used drupal sitefinity wordpress sitecore and some others and frankly umbraco is my favorite

2290426
put	get
if you aren t really building a site but just want to put pieces together and get something working then it may not be worth your time

2290429
boost	stl
we re looking for a solution based on standards containers stl boost having the best possible time-complexity

2290437
decrement	increment
and each ajax call increment this variables at the start of the call and decrement it .when complete

2290439
javascript	dom
but .when i place the javascript function in a .js file it is failing to execute the methods even though the .js file has been loaded into the dom .so the following fails with an invoke exception-handling

2290453
silverlight	wpf
unfortunately there is no displacementmap filtering neither in silverlight nor in wpf

2290466
hide	show
i know how to show or hide it but can i play it .when showing and stop it .when hidden

2290467
contains	any
.when linus was still running the git project he vehemently opposed adding cherry-pick support to git and to this day he still refuses to merge any branches that contains cherry-pick commits.

2290493
constructor	object
.when you do person you re actually calling the constructor on the person class object which gives you an instances object - namely bob

2290499
dependency-injection	service-locator
in an attempt to get data in at design-time i am using the ninject dependency-injection framework in conjunction with a service-locator much like the example in an article at

2290499
silverlight	wpf
as i m using wpf and not silverlight i checked for design-time properties slightly differently but otherwise i believe it is applicable

2290533
callback	methods
in your particular case because you are using a closure anonymous methods you can take advantage of the fact that a synchronizationcontext is available to you through the static current properties at the invocation site of the thread to provide the mechanism to callback to the ui-thread from your background-thread

2290533
callback	methods
note if you don t care about waiting for the result-of the callback to the ui-thread you can make a call to the .post methods instead which will dispatcher the call to the ui-thread without waiting for that call to complete

2290549
treeview	listview
i ve seen that there are controls out there such as treeview listview combinations controls that can do this

2290556
callback	methods
you can test if this is the issue here by defining for example a test function in your hosts html page and then passing it as the callback in your void doclick string named methods

2290579
getter	setter
you get setter and getter for each of the ivars

2290585
asp.net-mvc	webforms

2290588
python	java	python	php
google spreadsheet has developer apis for .net java php and python

2290595
python	php
i love python but i wish it s import functionality worked more like php s

2290610
asp.net-mvc	wcf
currently i use wcf to communication from the controllers in my asp.net-mvc site to the winform .app

2290612
put	get
also get the jar and put it with your libs

2290633
value	field
is there an easy way to generator some kind of a hashcode for a recording based on several of its field value

2290635
ruby	php
i also speak ruby php and basic variants but that seems to be besides the points

2290641
attributes	properties
unless your planet object is declare as a properties within some other class using the retain copy attributes you can t release it this way

2290648
contains	elements
we need to create a data structure for contains elements whose key are real numbers

2290657
required	checked
there s no tricks the only one i can think of in relation to detection if stdout is redirected to elsewhere is to do this like in a simple c function as show here isredirected other than that the onus rests with you to ensure the messages are kept secure...the other thing is using procfs trickery required root privileges to access certain procfs features...so ensure that you put a checked in there to ensure it is not running as root.

2290679
teamcity	msbuild	build-process	teamcity	build-process	msbuild
we used to write custom msbuild scripting to run from the command-line but after we discovered teamcity we move our entire build-process over to it

2290679
mstest	nunit
their support for svn source control is excellent and we like the fact that they support both mstest and nunit for unit-testing

2290679
configuration	upgrade
we haven t hit the numbers of project configuration 20 that would required us to upgrade to the enterprise edition

2290692
cassini	iis
you will need to install iis or cassini to hosts the asp.net-mvc website

2290721
mstest	nunit
yes checkout this links nunit mstest dual testing

2290723
exception-handling	try-catch
this is a try-catch to get more infomraion on the exception-handling

2290733
data-members	constructor
is it possible to use the initialization list of a child class constructor to initializer data-members declare as protected in the parent class

2290735
getter	setter
if you done your encapsulation correctly and only access members with const getter and non-const setter this should be good enough for you

2290736
unity-container	structuremap
all examples are mostly based on unity-container can you points me to the link example for structuremap and entlib 5 configuration

2290742
for-loop	arrays
if we take a look at jquery function itself it has a for-loop to iterate over an object that has a length properties falsely believing it s an arrays

2290746
attributes	properties
i found half of the answer here to my question .when searching what is the attributes to set the default-value of a user-controls properties in the designer where you change it and it bolds

2290747
implements	extends
i can t decide if i should extends membershipuser and implements the appropriate interfaces or completely roll my own

2290752
mstest	nunit
although in fact as sergey mentions nunit and mstest frameworks are similar enough that you can with care write common tests that can work with both frameworks

2290764
protected	public
it doesn t matter whether they are protected public or anything else

2290793
updating	updates
i would like to modify the textbox binding to use .so that the viewmodel only gets updates .when the user explicit click save configuration rather than updating as value are modified

2290799
selected	checkbox
.so far the only thing that s not working is that the user can selected any or all checkbox

2290820
textbox	onblur
i am having two textbox and a labels in a gridview control i am adding a javascript function to the second textbox onblur event attributes and display the result in the labels the function works fine and result is display in the labels but .when i am saving the grid data into the database the labels is returned 0 or empty but i am able to see the value how to overcome this

2290829
mouseenter	mousemove
i tried to triggers events like mousemove mouseenter hover etc but anyone works

2290832
attributes	properties
onclientclick is the named of the properties of a server control that eventually rendering to an onclientclick attributes

2290841
buildpath	libs
i have import the libs and it appears in the buildpath the application compiles fine but .when it gets to the points where the libs is required i get the following error

2290842
debugging	trace
i had some scripting in python to help me debugging with gdb that used the function gdb.parse_and_eval still documented to get the inferior value from the arguments passed to a scripted cmd and now the module doesn t seem to have any trace of that function

2290846
quirks-mode	doctype
if it isn t you have an incorrect doctype that s causing the browsers to rendering the page in quirks-mode basically ending any hope you might have of it working across browsers

2290851
textblock	expander
if you want to do the bolding in a styles i think your best bet would be to break your string up and use textblock within a stackpanel within an expander

2290853
hashtable	sorted
well you can use a hashtable to calculate the numbers of occurrences of distinct real numberss in o 1 amortized time and then use a standards heap where the items are pairs real numbers numbers of occurrences and the heap is sorted according to the numbers of occurrences field

2290853
decrement	increment
.when you insert a key or delete a key you increment or decrement the numbers of occurrences field by one or in the extreme cases add or remove a heap elements

2290858
selected	checkbox
selected item in a checkbox

2290865
comma	words
i would like to have a textbox that supports autocomplete and lets users types multiple wordss separated by a comma or semicolon offering suggestions for each words

2290867
classnotfoundexception	classpath
this just means that the particular class is missing in the runtime classpath while it was available in the compile-time classpath that s the difference with classnotfoundexception

2290872
put	get
you can get and set it and that s exactly what you need to store in the db and put the text back after retrieving it

2290873
udp	tcp
i understand tcp udp are the popular ones

2290873
udp	tcp
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implements my own fault-handling codes

2290873
udp	tcp
is that possible to find one protocols or use tcp udp to send receive 1kb data below this 300ms latency

2290921
udp	tcp
with a good broadband connection tcp should be fine and will make life easier since you have guarantees about delivery that are otherwise missing from udp

2290924
sftp	ssh
it s doable but doing automated ssh sftp is tricky lots trickier than rsh rcp used to be

2290930
contains	elements
binary heap holds tuples that contains elements value frequence of elements heap is building on frequencies .so it s give us ability to find mode in o 1

2290930
contains	elements
red-black-tree contains a tuples that hold elements value pointers to same elements value in heap

2290931
udp	tcp
a tcp header is 32 bytes while a udp header is only 16 bytes

2290931
icmp	udp
an icmp packets has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

2290938
value	field
.when the application insert a new recording id value is not provided explicit for .some rea.son it decides that the next autonumber field value is 950 and not 1001 as it should be - .so a primary key violation error occurs

2290940
scp	ssh
ssh and scp can be used to do such a thing but then you need to configure key etc

2290973
arrays	map
typically in these cases we map straight from sqlentitychild to domainchild as lists arrays and such are automatically supported

2290974
any	set
you should just be able to set the form s cancelbutton properties to your cancel button and then you won t need any code

2291006
python	perl
if you happen to be a fan of the perl cookbook you might be interested in checked out pleac the programming language examples alike cookbook specifically the section that show the perl cookbook code translation into python

2291025
json	xml
keep the external input output simple if you need something more complex than string use xml or json for structured-data but try to avoid too much complexity - if you have 2 things to pass two query parameters might be much better than one structure with 2 field

2291034
python	c++
can i do the same using xpcom and c++ python

2291034
javascript	dom
i ve thought about creating a xul application that exposes the dom functionality through a tcp server written in xul javascript

2291037
updating	updates
as you can see the depositlabel automatically updates with the selected row however the value is not updating to the correct value

2291049
annotations	mapping
edit i unaccepted the answer temporary because i can t seem to figure out how to do the mapping in my web.xml i am using annotations as describe in axtavt s answer below

2291061
any	set
another short q is there any short piece of code to get all divs on a page which have the visibility set to block or inline

2291065
primitive	boolean
initially i had used the primitive boolean in the program but since i dont want to create copies i used the wrapper boolean class which is a java object as opposed to primitive

2291071
concatenation	comma
in my model i will take value from these boxes and concatenation them together as comma separated value and store them in the db

2291114
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind memcheck can t detection overflows on arrays allocated on stack

2291115
checkbox	button
i d also like to be able to add controls other than menu items to this context menu checkbox lists button etc...

2291117
reflection	runtime
suppose i have a factory-method which wants to construct an instances of a types chosen at runtime via reflection

2291119
vertex-shader	shader
if you used cuda to compute a positioning and rotation into 2 3 component float texturess and then fired an index along with each vertex and increment by 1 per geometry instances then you could write a shader that loads the texturess and then uses vertex-shader textures lookup to selected the relevant pixels from the 2 texturess and building a transformation matrix

2291121
arrays	loops
your problem is with loops to change the value of the arrays

2291135
arrays	loops
.so you have an arrays of references to boolean it s always references and in your for each loops you create a reference that points to the same boolean as a member of that arrays

2291141
json	xml
it send html from the server instead of xml and or json and replacing them clientside meaning higher messages understandable

2291143
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
for the following sample order list markup and css ie7 is rendering the numbers alongside the bottom of the list item whereas firefox safari and google-chrome are behaving as desired with the numbers aligned alongside the top of the list item

2291144
input-field	textarea	fckeditor	wysiwyg
i ve created a form that is made up of 2 input-field and a wysiwyg textarea fckeditor

2291157
push	pull
you can either use ajax to poll the server for updates on a regular basis pull model or use the juggernaut plugins or similar to enable the server to send updates to the client push model

2291160
haskell	python
note that the syntax you desire is impossible because python like most languages excepting haskell is eager -- arguments are entirely computed before a call is performed .so the self.doa would run to completion before the call methods has any chance to do anything about it

2291164
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited
i have a base-class with properties that exist for each subclassing that other classes inherited from

2291164
put	get
i get an error querying saying could not format discriminator value to sql string of entity ns.core.model.basemessage .so i put a discriminator value on this class too althout it should never return the base-class

2291164
base-class	inherited
i would like to query the table and get back a list of different pocos that all inherited from the base-class

2291166
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen
of course you can also use a combinaison of fopen flock fwrite and fclose

2291173
jquery	.post
if you are issuing a .post for the form which it seems you are i highly recommend you take a look at the jquery form plugins as it simplifies the process of submission forms through ajax call a great deal for you and uses all the same parameters a call to ajax does

2291182
autocompletetextview	spinner
the list_item.xml layout wrap to 2 line if used with a spinner but not with the autocompletetextview

2291208
if-statement	loops
loops and multi-select case statements where the file is loaded into a string buffering and while looping through each line see if it matches one of the header subheader key line append the appropriate xml tag to a xml string variables and then add the child nodes to the xml based on if-statement regarding which key named is most recent which seems time-consuming and error-prone esp

2291210
erlang	prolog
as there could be a large amount of backtracking involved it may be wise to consider a prolog or erlang implementation as a basis for developing the c++ one

2291235
powerpc	arm
platform stack global checked won t work properly on powerpc arm

2291235
required	checked
stack and global checked required tracking function-calls and exit

2291236
http-redirect	request
.when an unauthenticated client request a url that required a non-anonymous access level as defined in security-config.xml spring-security send an http-redirect to our login page login

2291241
springboard	simulator
.so .when i hit the button it does the printing and then the simulator crash to the springboard

2291264
silverlight	wpf
once the export is complete the service will then need to pass the export back to the presentation layer which would either be a wpf .app or a silverlight .app as a streaming object

2291285
controllers	routes
now i want to use this controllers with two different routes

2291286
average	min	average	max
i d like to get the average min and max of data from all machines and of a specific datatype within a 4 hour period going back for 28 days

2291286
increment	average
.so far i have only been able to grouping the average by 1 hour increment but i could probably deal with that if the alternatives are overly messy

2291289
.when	ready
you ll have to decide if they are typing some known string and give the suggestions in some sort of selectable manner append the selected change if they click it catch .when they types a delimiter and append the currently selected suggestion and ready yourself for them to add more text and start the process again

2291296
scala	java
probably some time in the future the java viewmodel will have tail-call-optimization because the functional-programming languages which run on jviewmodel scala clojure etc. would benefit from it right now at least the scala compiler does its own tail-call-optimization for direct recursion but afaik not for indirect recursion

2291320
arrays	loops
for optimal efficiency you should assemble pieces of html in an arrays of strings using a loops then write

2291364
updating	updates
updates i notice mention of transaction-related things in the release notes for versioninging 1.0.61-65 here .so perhaps updating sub.sonic to work with the latest versioning of the .net data provider would .solve .some of these issues.

2291372
logout	login
the unit test would be calling the logout function and verifying that the expected results occurred user login recording ended for example

2291377
configuration	upgrade
in some cases additional proxy-server configuration may be required and certain proxy-servers may need to be upgrade to support websocket

2291383
mstest	nunit
generally a unit-testing framework such as nunit or mstest for .net stuff would be used

2291383
web-applications	webserver
web-applications are notoriously hard to unit test because of all the contextual information generally required for the execution of server code on a webserver

2291383
nunit	moq
a loose example is an asp.net-mvc types test using nunit and moq

2291387
any	set
a sustained note of a musical instrumentation is a periodic signals and our friend fourier the second f in fft tells us that any periodic signals can be construct by adding a set of sine waves generally with different amplitudes frequencies and phases

2291387
lookup	any
lookup fft on wikipedia if you don t understand the relationship between the sampling frequency and the resultant frequency bins or if you don t understand the detriment of having too low a sampling frequency. this will probably meet your needs because the fundamental component usually has greater energy than any other component

2291389
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
tdd is much harder in asp.net webforms than asp.net-mvc because it s very difficult to mockups the http environment in webforms to get the expected state of session application viewstate etc

2291396
callback	methods
what s worked well for me is to store each thread s managedthreadid in a dictionary as i launchd it and then have each thread pass its id back through a callback methods .when it completes

2291396
callback	methods
the callback methods deletes the id from the dictionary and checked the dictionary s count properties

2291398
selected	cell
to selected the last cell

2291413
jquery	.post
i basically want .so .when you .post a comment i use a javascript jquery scripting to send string to insert.php which insert to the database you will receive 2+ points

2291426
binaries	objdump
you could log the addresses and then pull the corresponding named from the symbols table using something like objdump --syms or nm assuming of course the symbolss haven t been stripped from the binaries in question

2291433
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	mysql
we cannot deny the power that can be had by using a rdbms mysql postgresql ms sql-server etc they have been in development for more than 30 years and many issues have been thought through and addressed

2291433
mongodb	couchdb
we also need to consider that the nosql docdbms movement mongodb couchdb etc has its own strengths especially in the manner in which data is stored related and replicated

2291437
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine in the versioning of firefox safari and google-chrome that i ve tested but i get some duplication of text in ie8

2291449
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you would test the logout functionality on your authenticationservice that is called by your eventhandler in webforms or the controllers actions in asp.net-mvc

2291450
hide	show
what i am going to do is show and hide the content1 div elements

2291450
hide	next
the next line #content1 hide

2291450
hide	show
inside that div that is being show and hidden there is another text link that will hide the div

2291450
put	get
just put it all together to get it how you want it

2291472
selected	textbox
on the selected index changed event of the combo box i d rewrite the information in the textbox based off of the filtering selected

2291490
protected	public
i think your points is since everything derives from java.lang.object and consequently accesses its protected members it wouldn t make any difference for it or any methods in java.lang.object for that matter to be public as opposed to protected

2291494
selected	textbox
i m using jquery to try to selected the textbox on a form that are not disabled

2291535
getter	setter
what are getter and setter in php5

2291548
sql-server	oracle
data aside if you want to sell this systemd then you may have to target an rdbms like sql-server or oracle to ensure it s supportable on your customer s infrastructure

2291552
hide	show
then instead of using hide and show use toggle

2291554
getter	setter
the methods that read and return an attributes value are called getter and those that write attributess are called setter

2291559
getter	setter
for example if you want to have a certain properties in your class let s say amount and give the client of you class the option to change or extraction its value you should make your variables amount private not visible for those who use your class and generator two methods a getter and a setter that manipulates your value that are public

2291560
value	field
note i will be creating an indexed view on each of the 6 different value for this field

2291565
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
sorting filtering grouping is really will be easy with using ria service datafilter control for silverlight

2291581
authentication	login
if you re able to understand what i m talking about where we set access authentication info during the login process and then use this session based information to authentication a user to access a page based on the page-class vs using the built-in asp.net role provider methodology i d appreciate your thoughts on this matter

2291582
contains	any
the wsdl does not contains any info about logic in methods and therefor you can not

2291584
hide	show
as far as i know the accordion hide the elements that are not show and this might interfere with the loading of the page into the iframe

2291601
perl	php
my experience is web programming such as php and perl and i m not really used to a lot of the new xcode desktopy-app stuff like static-libraries and linking and such

2291618
sniffing	packets
2.- set up a totally different process sniffing the request and offer the clients to downloading the packets capture or process and present them yourself. this is arguably more work but separates the request saving from your application

2291626
defined	declare
.when is not defined then it has not been declare in the current scoping

2291641
innodb	myisam
i have a database called av2web which contains 130 myisam tables and 20 innodb tables

2291641
innodb	myisam
i wanna take mysqldump of these 20 innodb tables and export it to another database as myisam tables

2291655
selected	button
the viewmodel has a single properties selectedbutton which uses a listbuttons enum to show which button is selected

2291655
selected	button
in my production .app the selectedbutton setter will call a service class methods that will take the action required .when a button is selected

2291668
32-bit	64bit	double	int
this generally assumes that your fpu operates with the same endianness as the int part of your cpu and that â less guaranteed for double and indeed the trick is harder to make portable for 32-bit machines with 64bit fpus

2291673
hide	show
if .so then you can create a sprite and show or hide it based on an event

2291735
jquery	.post
using jquery ajax .post how would i show a messages with what data is about to be .posted

administration	account
my application will have account and each account will have administration had to use administration vs user for name-clash purposes

2291762
arguments	default
systemd while not only fork s and then execute s it doesn t execute your process it runs the default shell passing your program as an arguments

2291766
python	perl
i don t want to bring out the big guns python perl etc and it seems like sed is pretty powerful in itself some people have written the dc calculator in it for example

2291768
updating	updates
you might try making this only a single updates and only updating the rows that need it

2291776
put	get
then i would go through each itinerary and if the destination wans t in the map i would create an entry with put destination 1 otherwise i would increment the count that was there with put destination get destination +1

2291800
contains	any
finalize should not contains much code as any exception-handling throw by finalize may kill the finalize thread of the gc

2291807
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work just fine with jquery 1.4.2 firefox ie google-chrome

2291811
mobile-safari	safari
i personally know a safari engineer and he knows some of the mobile-safari people and he is going to ask them about it or at least bring it to their attention

2291819
order	join
the db engine looks at what your are joining to not the order of the join

2291830
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
edit the headers appear to be fine but that bug might be the culprit...what can i use in ie google-chrome safari to test for the http request to see if it is only firefox

2291840
getline	istream
the standard-library does not provide iterator to do this although you can implements something like that on your own but you can simply use the getline function not the istream methods to read a whole line from an inputstream to a c++ string

2291858
sql-server	ms-access
anydac supports ms sql-server ms-access and much more

2291882
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
if you re looking to perform user-interface automation uia to simulate mouse click keyboard presses etc

2291885
order	join
the order in which you join doesn t matter the database will building a result set of every combinations of rows in all tables limited by the on clause

2291899
any	set
if any mysql guru can see any problems with such a set up

2291908
directory	folder
and then an directory was created with properties folder and assemblyinfo file only

2291921
directory	folder
the security settings for the folder where the directory is being created has everyone given full permissions

2291945
children	nodes
i am assuming you dynamically allocate the nodes because you obviously do not know how many children you are going to need

2291953
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox the cookiess are being set correctly but safari is only setting the location cookies

2291964
constructor	private
imo you should only do it if you want to change the visibility level of your constructor make it private or package protected

2291974
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you have access to touchesmoved touchesbegan and touchesended

2291989
children	nodes
the children of the nodes are just pointerss to other nodess and are only taking up the size of the pointers inside each nodes

2291997
binary-tree	nodes	children	nodes
i m a having a little trouble thinking how the hell do i fix the appropriate pointers .when trying to delete a nodes from a binary-tree where that nodes has 2 children

2291997
children	nodes
.so basically my delete function is mostly done and every case is already working as far as my extensive testing go everything worked ok i m only missing the case nodes with 2 children

2291999
selected	listbox
on the selected index changed event of the combo box i d add the items to your listbox based off of the filtering selected from your combobox

2292003
compact-framework	.net
i am working in c# using the .net compact-framework but if you know of something written in another language that may be helpful

2292011
children	nodes
you want to delete a nodes a which has two children

2292011
children	tree
updates extractmin to cover the case-when tree has no children

2292012
talend	ssis
question .so i am wondering if this can be accomplished with ssis or .some open .source tool like talend and if .so what would be your general approach

2292012
cursor	row
use a cursor to read through the initial table and for each row insert a blank recording with only the primary key into the datatyped table then use a single updates statement for each column such that if that updates fails i can insert a very specific error messages specific to that column in the error messagess table

2292016
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox google-chrome and most windows-based interfaces that i ve used the tab key can be used to navigate from one form field or hyperlink to the next actionable items note i have not tested on other operating systemd

2292016
safari	opera
however safari and opera skip all hyperlink in a webpage .when tabbing

2292016
safari	opera
is there a workaround hack to make safari and or opera navigate through these links

2292024
contains	elements
you want to change your content-type to multipart form-data and then the body of the http-request becomes a series of mime blocks with each block contains a different elements of the data you re passing

2292024
specifications	w3c
here s the w3c specifications for formatting the multipart form-data

2292036
selected	listbox
get the selected extension from the comboboxto and use it to order listbox datasource file

2292047
lightbox	thickbox
probably looks something like a lightbox thickbox .showing some text html instead of images

2292063
multicast	packets
i need to determine the ip of a machine that has sent me a multicast packets .so that i can respond to it via unicast

2292063
multicast	packets
i m using the following csharp .net 3.5 code to receive the packets over a multicast connection code has been edited for brevity with error checked and irrelevant options removed

2292100

2292108
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
java c# vb.net php perl python and many many more

2292117
subtract	add	subtract	time
part of the need for this is to allow calculation of time .post typing for example subtract two time value to get a timepan or add several timepan to get a total

2292123
formatting	printing
an unnecessary newline appears between them .when trying to printing them with printingf and s formatting

2292135
user-controls	ascx
.when i call renderaction i make sure that i am calling a controllers action that returns ascx view user-controls

2292135
user-controls	ascx
.so i think you should make it view user-controls ascx and put it either in shared or in controllers s view folder

2292147
execution	restart
each time computer restart apache2 starts .so my server is working but i have to restart celery manually going to my project directory and execution python manage.py celeryd

2292161
implements	extends
however from looking at tutorials object must extends implements threads runnable however if the object is in a thread making a methods call to that object seems to happen sequentially anyway

2292162
z-index	overlay
you can set up this kind of pop-up by having javascript on the onload event create an overlay div that has height 100 and a higher z-index than the content and also a div for the pop-up with positioning fixed and an even higher z-index

2292170
web-services	api
i used wcf to setup web-services a simple api within my web application

2292171
subclassing	base-class
all of your messages subclassing have properties body .so move it to the base-class mapping

2292180
basic	vba
i ve done some vba visual basic for applications code in the past but i think you should checkout this video on the microsoft site

2292192
savepoints	rollback
create a savepoints before you iterate through the cursor and then use a partials rollback .when you find there are 2 recording returned

2292228
arrays	loops
bear in mind it is a dynamic arrays i m not sure how many entries it will have .so i don t see how i can loops through every entry and give it an initial value

2292235
contains	any
my question is in this simple case why my tx and z do not contains the same value eventhough i did not introduce any noise yet

2292292
pycairo	cairo
it seems like given the information in stroke_extents and the translation x y and scale x y functions i should be able to take any arbitrary cairo i m using pycairo path and best fit it

2292292
canvas	scale
before drawing the path i have scale the canvas such that the origin is the lower left corner up is y+ right is x+ and the height and width are both 1

2292298
triggers	insert
enforce a triggers which upon updates insert in employees validation the uniqueness

2292298
triggers	insert
the triggers solution may be what i want but it may become complicated especially if a multiple insert updates need to be performed in a single statement and i m not sure about the performance vs

2292303
buffering	streaming
you will need to reset positioning in the streaming after writing the buffering into the streaming

2292308
contains	any
also in this case i d like dosomething to work with any list contains typesas of any generics types

2292323
imageview	textview
containss in the tabwidget are relative layout for each of your tabs which each contains an imageview and a textview

2292340
version-control	git
version-control with git powerful tools and techniques for collaborative software development

2292346
value	field
i m trying to layout field labels and value like this

2292346
value	field
i verified that this only happens .when the value of the items field is-empty

2292353
handler	service
implements a basic service and handle the key-press events in your main loops event handler

2292355
assign	add
now for simple apps to add some more labels or images i could drag them into my nib assign them named in that elements s inspector windows and then immediately access them inside code without the stuttering hassle of adding them in the .h file

2292358
credentials	account
i d assume that you d want to get the credentials of one of the existing account and simply modify the data

2292372
assign	add
in this example i would add a keyup listener to the input elements identified by itext and assign it to the function updatetext event the event object will be passed on to this function

2292372
firefox	opera
tested in firefox 3.5 opera 10.10 ie 6 ie 8 working everywhere

2292379
sftp	ftp
for example one customer required a flat-file to be sent via sftp while the other customer required an xml file to be sent via ftp

2292384
value	field
one thing i know for sure it makes the server side process of the page easier as i just need to load value from one .post field called player_id

2292391
compact-framework	.net
.net controls has the nifty drawtobitmap function but it does not exist in .net compact-framework

2292403
push	pull
in git he ll find out .when he tries to pull changes into his local repository or push his changes to the master

2292417
silverlight	wpf
the generator classes implements inotifypropertychanged which is extremely useful .when databinding in silverlight wpf

2292457
put	get
if you can t get rid of the horizontal scrollbar you should at least try to put the more important columns first .so that your users don t have to scroll to the right very often

2292463
selected	button
again think of bunch of radio button where users can selected gender etc

2292479
base-class	inherited
still it is a good practice to always have a virtual-destructor in a base-class that is supposed to be inherited from

2292484
cvs	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git
1 assuming there is a central repository which is the case of svn and cvs but not necessarily git bazaar mercurial etc. and person a commit and then push the commit which just transfer the diff and commit messages to the central repository person b should updates it s copy manually

2292487
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
or you can make the most of the fact that some very clever people worked out database theory read up normalize for the skinny and then and this is real important all the other clever folks who ve gone ahead and built relational databases like mysql postgresql sql-server access oracle etc etc based everything they ve done on all that database theory

2292527
silverlight	wpf
if you have the ability to use expression studio from microsoft i believe it s part of the blend product there s a prototyping tool for silverlight wpf that could get you going pretty well

2292530
updating	updates
.so if nodoby else needs to use this data while you are updating then sure do all the updates in one transactional

2292560
expression-blend	silverlight
if you want to do better gui prototyping use silverlight and expression-blend

2292562
any	set
now developing any significant set of features through a custom handler is a very tedious process

2292568
contains	any
that way dosomething accepts every list contains any typeas

2292606
silverlight	wpf
i ve recently been considering this and one way to decide between wpf and silverlight is to look at the non-gui functionality you need

2292606
silverlight	wpf
as far as controls and gui features go i think there s a huge push to converging wpf and silverlight .so if things aren t there now they are likely to be in future

2292606
silverlight	wpf
the official wpf compatibility page for silverlight 3 has not yet been matched by one for sl 4 .so you have to read it with the what s new in sl 4 page

2292606
silverlight	wpf
cleartype was added to improve text-rendering in sl 3 but is arguably still better in winforms than either wpf or silverlight - see this great visual comparison

2292621
haskell	python
preferred languages for examples python smalltalk haskell

2292623
rollback	commit
the locks will be present for the duration of the transactional ie until you do a commit or rollback irrespective of .when or whether you close the cursor

2292623
savepoints	rollback
if that is a worry at the end do another checked on c_1 rowcount and if that problem was experienced you d need to rollback to a savepoints

2292624
clearinterval	setinterval
using plain old javascript these are the setinterval and clearinterval methods

2292628
vbscript	jscript
in that thread chris nielsen has a creative idea of using a javascript libs on the server side as asp supports jscript as well as vbscript

2292642
value	field
al.so should the field be readonly if .so this should be a class and you should have a constructor which takes all the value

2292642
value	field
if the status field is readonly consider exposing it as an ienumerable instead of an arrays as it will give you much more flexibility in assign the value as opposed to forcing the contiguous memory that arrayss demand also you will protect from setting elements in the arrays since the reference to the arrays is readonly not the elements in the arrays themselves

2292643
versioning	upgrade
i used an older grails versioning latest that was out in november 2009 and upgrade to 1.2.1 now

2292651
version-control	git
git or mercurial are recent version-control systemd and may indeed be better suited than svn for this

2292651
revision	updates
the workflow is very similar add the files you want to versioning commit .whenever you reach a milestone and updates checkout .when you want to go back to an early revision

2292651
push	pull
mercurial repositories are also much easier to backup and restore you can always simply copy them but you can use push and pull to make incremental transfer to your backup location

2292654
default	reset
i did reset by click the checkbox apply settings to the current user and default user... in the advanced tab and reboot the server

2292694
simulator	platform
i m trying to setup a libs for simulator or device building and everywhere i see explains that sdkroot should expand to a developer platform sdks where is filled in by your project settings

2292701
g++	gcc
i have a c++ codebase and i am porting from visual-studio to g++ which should i set in visual-studio .so that building errors in gcc are reduced

2292723
python	java	python	ruby
the hosts language environment could be c# ruby python java anything but c

2292723
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
but the scripting-language could equally be something obscure such as javascript python ruby perl etc

2292723
arrays	loops
what i want is a way of execution scripting with traditional programming construct conditional loops date manipulation arrays etc

2292730
rollback	commit
the rows are unlocked .when you commit or rollback the transactional

2292743
haskell	scheme
haskell is a little different with its lazy-evaluation model effectively automatically producing the effect of closures in many cases but in scheme you end up using lambda for control flow a lot

2292750
constructor	private
the constructor should save the reference in a private readonly field

2292766
constructor	object
note that to copy the object without knowing whether they are base or derived we need to use the virtual constructor idiom

2292776
uibinder	gwt
i m using the uibinder .approach to layout an .app somewhat in the styles of the gwt mail sample

2292790
observers	listener	publish-subscribe	messaging
i d investigate the observers design pattern as it addresses the publish-subscribe problem which is a good way to look at an instant messaging application particularly if you want multiple listener to one talker

2292790
observer-pattern	messaging
this link discusses observer-pattern and mentions instant messaging

2292797
cassini	iis
quoting from what are the dis advantages of using cassini instead of iis

2292801
execution	exit
.so per.sonally i prefer putting lots of checked and assert in the beginning and during the execution of the function and exit the function at the first sign of trouble

2292822
any	set
you could do it with .net vb c# any language via code-access-security - set the policy on the machine to not allow access to any framework classes you like

2292826
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you re upgrading and need to test on both versioning during the upgrade

2292826
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you want to upgrade your internal apps but you re using a software package that is only certified on an older versioning

2292837
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
though urls are case-sensitive if you want to make your routes case-insensitive there is a dirty hack you can do

2292844
ref	out
currency will always be assign because tryparsing sets the out currency ref to the default-value if it fails to parsing

2292846
javascript	dom
i m worried that by unveiling this information people who are a lot smarter than i am figure out a way to manipulate the dom inorder to influence javascript functions they now know the site uses possibly bypassing backend checked that i implements and thus wrongly assuming they were good enough

2292863
linux	bsd
it can be done but using these frameworks under linux bsd is much much easier and enjoyable

2292881
google-chrome	safari
in lighting of the cookies-handling bugs affecting safari and google-chrome see this thread and pylons implementation of redirect_to as an exception-handling is it possible to reliably set a tracking cookies and redirect at the same time

2292892
click	mouse
the transparency area can listen for any mouse click and just swallow them which will prevent them being picked up by stuff further back in the display list

2292913
methodology	waterfall
of these given that a statistical analysis can be a discovery process one that can t be fully planned up front it would make sense to follow .something like an agile methodology much more .so that .something like the waterfall methodology

2292916
constructor	object
as describe in another answer you can also create one or more constructor messages to create and autorelease the object with optional-parameters

2292919
httpd.conf	.htaccess
in both .htaccess and httpd.conf but that doesn t work

2292929
children	tree	children	nodes
.so let s say i m building a tree using javax.swing.tree.defaultmutabletreenodes and i add n children to a particular nodes

2292929
children	tree
i want the children to be in a particular order based on comparable a custom comparator like a search tree even if i insert them out of order like this

2292949
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
works fine for me in safari google-chrome and firefox 3.5

2292949
firefox	safari
inspector the elements in safari or web developer firefox plugins does not reveal anything unusual either

2292953
return-value	arguments
the python-facing function s job is to parsing out the arguments call the appropriate c function and building the return-value if any

2292967
firefox	opera
a quick comparison between opera 10.10 ie 6 and firefox 3.6 all on winxp sp3 - opera and ie show slightly larger fonts

2292967
gentoo	linux	firefox	opera
updates under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

2292980
associations	model
the relationship should be model as an associations - owns a relationship

2293005
arrays	loops
this will create a transactional that loops through each elements of the arrays and call elements.save on it

2293011
stderr	stdout
with this you will be redirecting the stderr which is descriptor 2 to the file-descriptor 1 which is the the stdout

2293011
stderr	stdout
combining the two cmd will result in redirecting both stderr and stdout to sample.s

2293036
contains	elements
as other answers have noted using cell-array is probably the most straightforward approach which will result in your variables named being a cell-array where each cell elements contains a string

2293042
puts	gets
third postrunnable does not take effect immediately but rather puts things on a message-queue for the main application thread to process .when it gets a chance

2293056
return-value	arguments
you also aren t returning the size of the list from lcreate -- you should probably return this via the return-value or a pointers arguments

2293067
any	set
if you ve set an id for any dom elements for widget i use somewidget.getelements .setid id usually in combinations with dom.createuniqueid you can get it via gwt.get string id

2293067
communication	messages
exception-handling or worse .so i d recommend sticking with mvp see the first points and communication via the messages bus

2293069
csv	xml
data can be excel .axf csv xml

2293071
web-services	webserver
the webserver hands the client an string which ids the database entry and gets passed to the other web-services

2293090
haskell	ocaml
as an examples of haskell and ocaml in machine learning see stuff at hal daume and lloyd allison homepages

2293090
haskell	ocaml
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++-like performance in ocaml than in haskell

2293097
decrement	increment
methods to increment decrement and compare-and-swap value .when using code that needs to be multi-thread-aware

2293123
macros	vba
i d say your best bet is to investigate the vsto or vba macros to accomplish this

2293178
profiling	trace
question - is this case proven to be the result-of lock escalation if you trace with profiling for lock escalation events is that definitely what is happening to cause the blocking

2293183
expression-blend	designer	expression-blend	silverlight
i had a very talented and smart graphic designer working for me at one stage and convinced her to use expression-blend .so she could stylise my silverlight apps

2293226
relational-database	schema
you lose some of the features of a relational-database especially if you have an existing schema but you gain a lot of features the main one being quiet mapping between the data-store and your object-model

2293226
mongodb	couchdb
it supports several of the current crop of nosql celebrities including couchdb and mongodb

2293248
silverlight	wpf
i m currently working in vs2008 and using winforms .so i m not really across wpf silverlight etc

2293255
exponent	modulo
then i can get modulo and exponent of the rsa public key in byte

2293255
exponent	modulo
but it seems like rsapublic.modulo and rsapublic.exponent are not in this format there are many not-digits in the byte of the modulo and exponent

2293256
environment	building
i could assume that stetting up your environment as multi-project building should provide you the abstraction you are looking for

2293261
silverlight	wpf
you ll have difficulty with the database requirement using silverlight and wpf will not work at all

2293268
profiling	trace
i d like to create a single trace file using sql profiling that spans several days .so i can run it through dta to get .some advice on indexes

2293281
getter	setter
a semantic can be a setter getter other properties or add-on removeon or fire event p317

2293282
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it looks fine in google-chrome and safari but not the latest versioning of firefox 3.6 on the pc

2293285
profiling	trace
in profiling use the scripting trace option and then create the trace on the server

2293303
javascript	dom
that appears to be the standards javascript dom event object

2293313
factors	numeric
3 rd and 4 th column are factors and the last one is purely numeric

2293316
exponent	modulo
it looks like you can get the byte arrays by getting an rsaparameters object via rsacryptoserviceprovider.exportparameters and then extraction from this the exponent and modulo field

2293320
value	field
im trying to insert a value into this field but i keep getting an error

2293333
postgresql	mysql
edit i created an empty django project - default django configuration plus django.contrib.admin and fresh empty database tried both with mysql and postgresql

2293359
setinterval	settimeout
i ve looked at settimeout and setinterval and these appear to just delay the execution of a scripting whereas i want to literally timeout a long running process

2293378
google-chrome	safari
except for webkit the rendering engine in safari and google-chrome which has a totally custom made-up-by-dave-hyatt not-even-in-css-3 properties value -webkit-background-clip text

2293378
google-chrome	safari
no other browser other than safari and google-chrome supports it

2293379
constructor	object
i donâ t know what is happening in the constructor of blog but i imagine you are filling up your object with information from a database

2293390
key-value	key
i see suggestions around key-value pairs but as you can see in my example below i have child elementss with the same named key and there can be an arbitrary numbers of these for each store elements

2293390
duplicates	elements
if key-value pairs are the way to go please points me to a methods where i can account for the duplicates elements

2293395
dlopen	dlsym
dlfcn.h dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

2293396
linux	bsd	opensolaris	linux	opensolaris	bsd
if you want to know and understand this technology just create a virtual single machine install bsd linux opensolaris etc

2293396
environment	building
you have a single but powerful machine in the organization and you would like to give each team a complete dev building environment .so they have full control over their own environment but al.so do not interference with each other

2293400
digits	base
my suggestion would be to convert the id to and from a base 62 10 digits 26 uppercase letters 26 lowercase letters 62 or possibly 64 add _ and -

2293401
callback	methods
jquery also supports a timeout properties for its ajax methods which will execute the error callback after the timeout limit has been reached

2293422
glassfish	resin	glassfish	weblogic	weblogic	resin
you can pay for a java ee .app server weblogic websphere or use an open source one jboss glassfish and openejb and activemq or you can stick to spring and deploy on tomcat jetty resin or any other servlet jsp engine

2293430
loading	gif
i am currently using blockui to block the page and show a loading gif .when an ajax function is being performed

2293448
key-value	key
i ve read apple s key-value programming guide but am still a little confused about how certain kvc methods search for key

32-bit	64bit
i actually have no idea how to properly tell if windows is natively 32 or 64bit but if you have a 32-bit process you could call iswow64process to see if you re running on a 64bit os

2293541
bison	yacc
you should never access yylval directly in the yacc bison file as its not reliable

2293541
bison	yacc
to make this work for non-terminals you need to use types declarations for them in the yacc bison file and the rules for those non terminals need to set eg

2293557
value	field
i need to checked whether the trailer total charge value is equals to my calculated value of amount and quantity field

2293560
hash	md5
interoperability as has already been mentioned is very much in ldap s favour with .some types of server .software although much of the .software that integrated with ldap required a specific schema .so it s not necessarily as simple as just installing and configuring an ldap service and off you go - you might need to add new elements in the schema for each .app you want to interact with and each .application might have different limitations with regard to authentication for example plain text passwd field passwd field as md5 or sha hash etc

2293571
smartgwt	extjs
not as good looking as smartgwt or extjs but a lot quicker

if you know sql you could take a look at using hive ql to query the hdfs

2293581
linux	unix
a prof once told us in class that windows linux os x and unix scale on threads and not process .so threads would likely benefit your application even on a single proces.sor because your application would be getting more time on the cpu

if you aren t going to make them order by the id then don t make them auto_increment just add a column onto the end of the table for order and enjoy the added flexibility it gives you

2293640
communication	messages
another option is to use interprocess communication to pass messages between parent and child process

2293643

2293703
double	int
it has a int double and string constructor .so you can simply have

2293708
hide	show
.so the problem is this .when i hide the qtextedit and show the other button the windows won t resize

2293719

2293777
python	php
edit if it is about seconds i think that php python or somethink really easy and fast is good part on server side

2293780
decimal-point	digits
allow 0 or more digits on either side of the decimal-point

2293781
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to a newer versioning of ruby easily it should give you that methods on the range

2293785
callback	methods
once you have decided how you want to store the json data you will need to write some javascript to request the json and in the callback feed it into the gpolyline.fromencoded methods

2293793
decimal-point	digits
edit there might in fact be no digits left of the decimal-point in which case i imagine there must be the decimal-point and 1+ digits after it

2293801
python	ruby
alternatively since you most likely using some popular scripting-language most of them have classes for rational arithmetic built-in python and ruby have them for sure

2293802
integrated-security	connection-string
and your other connection-string uses integrated-security true

2293810

2293947
32-bit	64bit
it seems that .net needs all assemblies to be the same 32-bit or 64bit and won t let you mix and match

2293947
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
.so if you .app was working in 32-bit you should try setting the compiler-options in the project properties to explicit produce an x86 32-bit .app which should run on both 32-bit and 64bit

2293947
32-bit	64bit
note that the default compiler option seems to be any which will run the .net-assembly as 64bit .when on a 64bit os and 32-bit on 32-bit oss

2293959
attributes	properties
i d also think seriously about whether the attributes need to be full-blown entities or just properties of the store

2293961
pure-virtual	base-class
.when having a base-class with pure-virtual methods this makes it .so that the class can not be initializer

lan	wan
in a lan wan situation you need to make sure nothing is connecting them to the outside world except through the proxy

2293983
any	set
using qwebview.load to set the initial page at startup seems to work fine and click any link on the custom error page will result in the destination page loading fine

2293998
any	set
this is unconditionally creating a new lecturer object trampling over the old one in the lecturers dictionary if any .so of course the previous set gets tossed away

2294012
javascript	dom
i don t know if this is your scenario since it is a bit ambiguous but i had an ie page being generator by javascript using the dom and found in some cases that javascript or ie s dom was adding break after every append or some such where it wasn t supposed to

hide	show
this is a great tutorial on getting started with jquery which covers show hide effects which is what you want to look at to achieve the functionality you ve described.

2294084
required	checked
generally rabin-karp is used .when you are searching for multiple target strings because the second checked it required for actual equality rather than just hash equality is well worth it to be able to examine the source string only once

2294084
required	checked
there is also a more naive solution which is o n 2 and required checked for the target string at every positioning in the source string

2294097
put	get
if .someone wants to steal .software and willing to put in the time and effort to do .so they will be able to get it - no matter how good it is

2294206
copy-constructor	constructor
you re missing a constructor that isn t a copy-constructor

2294211

i suspect they cost more than youâ re willing to pay but both coverity and klocwork do serious checked for memory-leaks along with lots of other things

2294238
geocoding	geocode
assuming you are asking whether you should do your geocoding with javascript or a server side language like php best practice is to caching whatever geocoding you can into some sort of persistent layaer xml db whatever and minimize the numbers of client side geocode request because of the delay it will introduce

2294244
python	java	python	c++
it is also unnecessary to defined methods that are never called such as do_something in parentclass -- this is something you see in programmers that come to python from c++ java c#

2294246
version-control	git
if you really must have that file under version-control use a git attributes filter-driver see also gitpro book

2294252
constructor	object
yes it is possible .when your constructor function execute the this value has already the internal properties points to the validatefields.prototype object

2294252
constructor	private
if you need to keep this variables private and only allow the createerrorlist methods to access it you can defined it as a privileged methods within the constructor

2294272
hide	show
the way i ve built it and have done this before on a smaller scale with no problem is to imagemap the main image of the usa give each area an id then use jquery to show hide an absolutely positioning div overtop of the map

2294285
expression	evaluation
deferred evaluation is .when an expression isn t evaluated until it s needed

2294301
versioning	migrate
in real world you ll have to change database versioning and migrate changes in onupgrade ..

2294305
callback	methods
you could for example have the callback on the animation add an invisible elements to the dom and then use the waitforelements methods to detection that

2294314
memcached	apc
if the boost is not .so significant i m going to replace apc with memcached

2294331
row	col
first create regexp that replace all comments with equally numbers of spaces and linefeed .so that row and col positioning won t change

2294334
quicksort	mergesort
you could present the questions through the algorithms of quicksort or mergesort

2294337
deployment	install
overall i feel it has made our building and deployment more robust and repeatable catching errors faster and also speeding up many tasks it can install slaves for itself via ssh and distribute jobs or run them concurrently

2294339
nested	order
right now i ve got nested bundles where the category bundles are pretty much just an info.plist with the category s named and the order of its sub-bundles

2294347

2294500
arrays	loops
you should also use an arrays and loops or at least a function to make this code shorter and simpler

2294519
implements	extends
why hashmap extends abstractmap and implements map

2294519
implements	extends
is extends abstractmap not sufficient because abstractmap implements map

2294534
variables	boolean
i am not sure how the compiler optimizes that statement and i know that micro-optimization is the mother of all evil but you could use a boolean variables to control your state

2294541
pointers	stack
in this code a call to ioctl fd ioctl_make_timer ... passes setup_timer a pointers to an arrays located on the kernel stack then returns

2294543
pure-virtual	subclassing
since output isn t pure-virtual it can be called from subclassing that don t overrides it

2294554
if-statement	while-loop
it seems very unlikely that all the threads will actually stop although i should points out that to avoid false wake-ups you should probably have a while-loop instead of an if-statement

2294582
any	set
rather than having your device checked to see if there are any new items at set intervals the central hosts of updates will phone you .when you have updates

2294602
row	col
that creates an arrays of object each with an col and row properties that tells you where the thing s in thearrays are such that

2294602

.when i open the forms using administration login everything works fine but .when i login using normals user account the fallowing error is display

2294678
defined	declare
you need to defined the constructor and destructor you just declare them

2294724
splitter	panels
the problem is that the user can take the splitter between abcdef and g and move it to left .so it reach panels ab and cover panels cde

2294745
put	get
i could not get your question fully but i assume you want the vehicle facility to be selected after form is submitted you put javascript to use for that

2294747
implements	abstract
you can make the implementss class abstract and implements two of the 4 methods from the interface

2294754
contains	elements
this implies two things a the command-line required com.sun.test.commander and b the classpath must contains an entry for the directory which containss com inorder to resolve this class since a class named x.y.myclass must be in x y relative to some classpath elements

2294796
value	field
this means that if you don t overrides this field on per item level the standards value will be used

2294803

pellet	jena
pellet uses jena api or swrl to defined rules

2294840
pellet	jess
i have not use sweetrules reasoner before but it seems that it supports both swrl and jess rules therefore this reasoner can be helpfull in crossing between jess and pellet

2295155
colorbox	jquery
from my own knowledge the best javascript gallery is built on top of jquery and called colorbox

2295160
any	set
if you wish to support anything lower than 3.0 you can set the deployment-target to 2.x but then you need to remember to conditional use any newer api functionality by checked if function named exist by comparing them with null and using the methods

2295161
attributes	properties	reflection	runtime
attributes allow us to add descriptions to classes properties and methods at design-time that can then be examined at runtime via reflection

2295170
communication	messages
because any application can broadcasting these messages value and some do because they re written by idiots you should always use registered messagess for private communication

2295171
attributes	properties
attributes can target classes methods properties delegation enum event field.

2295171
reflection	runtime
to resolve the attributes at runtime you must use reflection

2297170
ternary-search-tree	trie
you could store your information in a trie of some sort perhaps a ternary-search-tree

2297193
getter	setter
also make sure to use immutable object where appropriate instead of always using some stupid javabeans class with all public getter and setter

2297205
updating	updates
well you are calling updates but not actually updating anything

2297220
forms-authentication	credentials
code - as users login verify credentials against existing users table and insert-into forms-authentication tables using membership.createuser

2297231
highlight	selected
i need to persistent the highlight of the selected item after the ondoubleclick handler has done its thing

2297239
any	set
any user needing to access a database needs to either have their own login or you can create a login for a windows security grouping and grant access that way to a whole set of users

2297250
expression	evaluation
there are other reasons including that they can easily cause the expanded form to produce bad or unexpected expression if you don t properly use parens around macros parameters or by evaluation a macros parameter that has side-effects more than once

2297266
value	field
what has the same value in what field

2297269
google-chrome	firefox
well your code worked for me running google-chrome 5.0.307.9 and firefox 3.5.8 on ubuntu 9.10 though i switched

2297287
mocking	stubs
i d like to advise to take this on very pragmatically if you need mock object a lot consider learning a mocking framework this also comes with a price of course otherwise use stubs object or your occasional hand-written mock object

2297306
principles	srp
now that the class is huge and that getdescription also sets a description are not a direct violation of the srp but of different principles

2297308
logout	login
the following is an example i have used for login logout sessions

2297311
tcp-ip	udp
what is the nature of the communication over the multicast sockets and how sensitive are you to data loss udp does not garuntee arrival like tcp-ip

2297317
exponent	modulo
there is a rsa modulo n and the two usual rsa exponent d and e such that ed 1 modulo p-1 and q-1 where n pq

2297317
exponent	modulo
this means that trusted webserver will need to compute things with a big modulo and a big exponent and without knowing the modulo factors

2297317
ecdsa	rsa	ecdsa	dsa	dsa	rsa
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signature typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
from the central authority points of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signature per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signature per second with a 1024-bit key

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
the ecdsa signature consist in two 192-bit int 384 bits to encode while the rsa signature are 1024-bit long

2297321
menuitem	button
i m trying to create a cmd used by a menuitem and also a button which can be accessed through a keyboard shortcut but which sits inside a class in a separate assembly

2297346
void	main
static void main string arguments

2297346
void	main
static void main string arguments

2297353
rhino-mocks	moq
i m not sure if rhino-mocks has the same capability but with moq you can get what you need from an object hierarchy without actually having to create it

2297362
keydown	keyup
note that they start their timer on keydown not keyup

2297377
any	set
however if i grant someone the built-in auth | user | can change user permission they gain the ability to set the is_superuser flag on any account including their own

2297417
value	field
go to raw value and copy the whole rendering string then paste it in the renderings field on the items where it needs to be set

2297421
ip-address	hostname
if no servername is specified then the server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse lookup on the ip-address

2297439
environment	building
have staging-repo in a separate building environment from main-repo

2297444
internationalization	localization
what you re looking for is django s internationalization and localization feature

2297444
culture	locale
note i take that by culture you meant locale

2297446
webserver	security
it can however al.so be manipulated from outside under certain conditional related to how your webserver is set up see this this .so question that deals with the security aspects of both variations

2297454
versioning	downgrade
downgrade activesync to versioning 3.8 and give the service permission to interact with desktop use systemd service applet for this

2297458
overlapping	margins
that s because overlapping vertical margins are collapse

2297458
margins	padding
in this specifications the expression collapsing marginss means that adjoining marginss no non-empty content padding or border areas or clearance separate them of two or more boxes which may be next to one another or nested combine to form a single margins

2297458
overlap	margins
in your case because #preamble s margins-bottom and #container s margins-top overlap they get collapse .so the effective margins is the bigger one in this case 100px

2297458
margins	padding
if background-color is not an issue you can use padding instead of margins

2297483
malloc	free
b pass a malloc -ed memory and free it in animationdidstop

2297492
selected	textbox
another issue is that in the one show the textbox of the form was display but i can t selected any

2297502
linqdatasource	gridview
the users of my web .app need to filtering a long list of items in a gridview accessed via a linqdatasource

2297518
build-process	msbuild	toolchain	cmake
i m busy porting my build-process from msbuild to cmake to better be able to deal with the gcc toolchain which generator much faster code for some of the numeric stuff i m doing

2297528
append	input
the input text appears to be ibm437 encoding whereas my string i m append starts as us-ascii

2297528
append	input
nothing i ve tried with respect to forcing encoding on the input strings or the append string seems to change the resultant output

2297541
worksheet	excel
how do i add put a border around every 2 line in an excel worksheet using vba

2297543
base-class	inherited
you want that data functionality separate and should not inherited from any common base-class that you have made

2297552
stderr	stdout
redirects stdout 2 1 redirects stderr to the same place as stdout

2297563
stderr	stdout
the compiler-warnings happen on stderr not stdout which is why you don t see them .when you just redirect make somewhere else

2297563
stderr	stdout
the means redirect stdout and stderr to this location

2297569
emacs	vim
familiar with vim ed emacs etc

2297578
defined	declare
if you need to declare but not defined things in your header use forward-declaration instead of #include s

2297580
silverlight	wpf
first of all if you are using silverlight based sketch you have a datagrid available otherwise if you are working with wpf you could use wpf toolkit which include one

2297601
onresume	onpause
the problem because i intercept onpause onresume to save restore the last state i got a methods that sets these two spinner selected item programmatically like in here

2297601
variables	boolean
a stupid direct approach for this would be to have a boolean variables disabling whatever the listener does inside setting it before setting the selected items and resetting it afterwards

2297619
double	int
the c# types alias bool byte char decimal double float int long object sbyte short string uint ulong ushort aren t part of the bcl systemd namespace they re actually part of the c# language

2297626
javascript	dom
initial question if i store all the necessary dom elements references in a javascript arrays a 10 000-elements arrays one elements for each cell and manipulate the css on a per-elements basis does this have a prayer of being as quick as it would be .when the dom has say 200-500 elementss

2297628
directory-structure	filesystems
the problem is that the data is organized on the filesystems in a somewhat complex directory-structure not my fault

2297633
mapping	unique
your mapping layer maps this into the appropriate unique object and is responsible for creating the right 1-many aggregation for your object

2297633
attributes	properties
in addition you could cater for shallow loading for display properties to save unnecessary amounts of data to be transfer where you only need a few attributes per object

2297635
private-members	private
you do not explicit access private-members you provide public properties that return the private variables from your report class

2297635
private-members	private
but never expose member variables as public they should be private within report but you should include public properties to access those private-members

2297639
directory	folder
if it s really just one folder and you re running on windows you can set up security to prevent everyone from creating folder in that directory

2297643
javascript	dom
i know i could achieve the same result by adding to the dom using javascript but if i d prefer to do this with x html if possible

2297652
python	php
php python asp.net are a few that come to mind

2297652
pylons	django
sense you already know python from your .profile you can use a python cgi scripting to do this or use one of the many frameworks for python zope django pylons ...

2297676
png	gif
you can load any supported image file types jpg gif png etc using image.fromfile image.fromstream etc

2297689
directory-structure	filesystems
i would defined a set of interfaces that mimick the filesystems such as idirectory and ifile and then use test double to create a representation of the directory-structure in memory

2297709
void	main
public static void main string a

2297710
firefox	opera
.so only firefox and not ie opera or webkit will execute the top block in

2297717
font-size	display	font-size	width	display	width	pixels	line
given a width in pixels and a maximum numbers of line to display the headlinetextfield alters the font-size to make the text fit the field

2297730
value	field
i will give it a bad input value for that field and then validation that the job failed

2297731
sql-server	oracle
this isn t a problem for sql-server which is case-insensitive but obviously is for oracle

2297736
canvas	scale
ability to centering on a canvas and scale to fit any arbitrary size

2297736
pycairo	cairo
i m open to suggestions of how to make gdi+ or cairo preferably pycairo work and i m also open to any other libs preferably c# or python

2297745
json	xml
it can be serialization to a numbers of formats such as xml json and ini

2297778
callback	methods
the callback methods would be something along the line of

2297794
associations	model
there is a link between the model and the tag associations table and then from the tag associations table to the tags table

2297794
value	field
this score could be stored in lucene.net but inorder to sort the results on this field it would rely on the value being stored in the field caching which is something i really really want to avoid

2297797
implements	extends
create a class that extends uiview and implements the drawrect methods

2297803
shell	bash
improve bash shell scripting using dialog

2297806
value	field
if a user writes only 1 value the form should still appear with any previously filled out field still there

2297806
value	field
if a user writes value in all of the field the congratulations should appear

2297808
portrait	screens
first state of screens is portrait

2297848
protected	public
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

2297848
defined	declare
methods declare without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public

2297854
url-encoding	url
you ll have pain dealing with url-encoding decoding and people can get an idea of your data-structures and possibly hack the json string in the url

2297861
value	field
the normalize way would be to use a table with basically key and value field with a foreign link to the event recording

2297875
instances	self
if there is no instances of derived involved then there s no suitable self for derived.virtual and .so of course it s impossible to call it

2297877
variables	boolean
this sets a cuda_have_gpu boolean variables in cmake that can subsequently be used to triggers conditional operations

2297882
arrays	loops
you can loops through your arrays and building the clob as you go

2297882
arrays	loops
if you don t use l_contract for anything else you can building the clob directly from the cursor loops without the arrays step it will save memory and will probably be faster

2297889
python	lua	python	ruby
i ve looked at lua python ruby .so far and really enjoyed all of them .so far but still found them a little low-level for my target users

2297889
expression	evaluation
would i need to somehow write my own parsing + interpreter to support a language with a minimum of support for looping simple arithmatic logical expression evaluation or is there another recommendation any of you may have

2297903
value	field
.so no matter what the field named are sent in the j.son i can access named and value that have been sent to me

2297906
administration	account
in the definition of this service during clearcase installation the clearcase administration must specify the named of this privileged account the passwd the windows domain and the windows grouping for this account

2297919
foundation	cocoa	cocoa	uikit
cocoa is commonly referred to as the combinations of the foundation and appkit frameworks while cocoa-touch is the combinations of the foundation and uikit frameworks

2297919
foundation	cocoa
there are also some difference between the foundation frameworks in cocoa and cocoa-touch most commonly missing classes eg cocoa has nshost and cocoa-touch doesn t

2297920
solaris	linux
we have recently been migrating a numbers of applications from running under redhat linux jdk1.6.0_03 to solaris 10u8 jdk1.6.0_16 much higher specifications machines and we have noticed what seems to be a rather pressing problem under certain loads our jvms get themselves into a death spiral and eventually go out-of-memory

2297920
32-bit	64bit
this is not us moving to a 64bit viewmodel - we are still running 32-bit

2297920
scala	java
this is affecting applications written in java as well as scala

2297941
key-value	key
key-value pairs are a lot faster particularly if you put a clustered index on the event key

2297945
constructor	object
if you are using constructor-injection i find adding a parameter which is your configuration object to the constructor is the best way

2297945
constructor	object
by adding it to the constructor anyone using this object knows explicit that this configuration must be there

2297948
getter	setter
the dot syntax is designed to be an exactly precise synonym for methods invocations to methodss that play the setter getter role

2297948
defined	declare
you need to either defined methods to access mystring or declare a properties and synthesize the methods

2297955
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
right now postgresql mysql and oracle

2297965
google-chrome	firefox
also since it s javascript it should now also work on firefox google-chrome etc

2297968
configuration	logging
my main problem is with the logging configuration file

2297968
configuration	logging
and i normally use this to locate the logging configuration file

2297970
any	set	onitemselectedlistener	spinner
add the onitemselectedlistener for each spinner after you have set any previous value in onresume

2297975
vb.net	vb6
works with vb6 and vb.net

2297994
python	lua	python	ruby
ruby python and lua all have their various quirks regarding syntax and to a degree some of these can be massaged with clever function definitions

2297998
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover usually takes two parameters first is mouseenter second is mouseleave try

2297999
semantics	keyword
but the semantics are always preserve .so that it still acts as if it was eval receiving a list structure contains the symbols println and the keyword a

2298011
arrays	loops
i have a function which is called within a foreach loops and takes in two parameters an int representing the numbers of time loopss has run and an arrays of no fixed size

2298014
value	field
not a full answer but i do recall cck having some oddities .when accessing value of the field directly

2298014
value	field
i remember having to access the field value like this

2298014
value	field
depending on the types of field value might be nid or something similar

2298014
value	field
if the field value is embedded in the form you may have to use the cck styles accessor to get at the form value that is actually a cck field

2298038
expression	evaluation
yet all you need is a minimum of support for looping simple arithmatic logical expression evaluation

2298064
python	ruby
however you and any end users with a knack for it -- your super-users -- can still leverage the full power of ruby or python or whatever

2298077
implements	abstract
a good strategy is to take time to understand how regex algorithms themselves function at a more abstract level then implements any particular syntax becomes much easier

2298080
arrays	loops
you are essentially calling func once yourself and passing the resulting arrays to the foreach construct which can loops over it

2298091
thread-dump	jvisualvm
you can connect through the jvisualvm and get a thread-dump

2298130
subclassing	base-class
i have several j2ee project using servlets each of which extends from a base-class that handles the main doget and dopost methods and call more specific methods on the subclassing

2298130
.war	jar
rather than have that base-class as a class in each .war file i want to move it to its own jar that each of the other project can reference

2298132
sftp	ftp
for example you have the transportsfile thing that either send using the sftp ports or the ftp

2298145
order	add
probably not the best solution because gtkfixed has no way of controlling the z-ordering other than the order in which you add the widget to it

2298162
perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl
i can use any of java ruby python perl .net

2298175
difference	count
count the black pixels in the difference bitmap

2298177
subclassing	superclass
superclass receive this messages before their subclassing

2298188
implements	abstract
the same reason you would implements interfaces for other applications...to abstract the implementsation away from the usage

2298218
buildpath	libs
ensure that you added it by java buildpath libs add libs server runtime selected the server in question and thus not copy-paste or import else the classpath may collider with those of the real used server

2298229
sql-server	mysql
use limit if you have mysql or top if you have sql-server

2298237
openlayers	mapserver	mapserver	mapnik
widely used in many open-source geo libs openlayers mapserver mapnik etc and definitely way better than mysql s spatial extensions

2298237
python	perl
writing procedure in different languages c python perl etc makes your life easir to code if you re a developer and not a db-admin

2298254
order	add
and add desc to order descent

2298255
illegalargumentexception	illegalstateexception
in-place of the comment -- if this was the fault of the caller of your class throw illegalargumentexception or illegalstateexception as appropriate

2298264
stderr	stdout
in this case to pipe stderr you d want to do something like this which merges stderr with stdout before piping

2298267
callback	methods
a callback is a methods that is passed into a routine and called at some points by the routine to which it is passed

2298268
any	set
they gain the ability to set the is_superuser flag on any account including their own

2298275
constructor	object
the problem is that tbase.bicdata is an object and the prototype properties should be used on constructor functions

2298278
function-pointers	virtual-functions
function-pointers are not the only way to implements a callback - you can also use functor and even garden variety virtual-functions

2298278
callback	methods
for example the .net documentation for iformatprovider says that getformat is a callback methods even though it is just a run-of-the-mill interface methods

2298278
callback	methods
what makes getformat a callback methods is not the mechanics of how it is passed or invoked but the semantics of the caller picking which object s getformat methods will be called

2298278
callback	methods
visual basic has its handles clause which explicit declare a methods to be a callback while abstracting away the concept of delegation or function-pointers

2298278
semantics	keyword
what it does not have is keyword and features whose semantics are specific to callback such as raise emit handles event + etc

2298306
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista and windows 7 automatically fix old poorly behaving programs by redirecting this write to the user s local data folder

2298329
strdup	free
i used strdup free since it was the easiest way to copy the string

2298329
malloc	free
in the question you were leaking memory since you d malloc with no matching free

2298390
any	set
are there any algorithms that will return the equation of a straight line from a set of 3d data points

2298396
ubuntu	linux
if not how should i construct the path either with slashes or back-slashes .so that it is acceptable on all major operating systemd eg windows linux ubuntu

2298417
value	field
i would suggest that instead of using the non-updateable field value from the page s input you retrieve the original object from the db and copy them from there

2298424
hazelcast	jcs	terracotta	jcs	terracotta	hazelcast
i am evaluation various java object distribution libs terracotta jcs jboss hazelcast ... for an application-server and i m having trouble understanding their behavior on various axes

2298444
database-table	mysql
im trying to create a dropdownlistfor menu of users from mysql database-table

before your function code you should create stack for that function saving all caller-saved registers return address and global pointers registers .when neccesary

2298495
cassini	iis
i had to switching from cassini to my local iis due to working with ssl etc

2298495
debugging	trace
.when i set my test project as the startup project and debugging visual-studio doesn t attach to iis and i cannot trace the server side it never attachs to iis

2298495
debugging	trace
the only way i can trace is to first start a new debugging instances of server project then start my test project

2298511
arrays	map
the translation arrays would have to contains the full sequences then and map these to the other languages

2298523
jquery	.post
i am using jquery form plugins to submit .post a webforms

2298535
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
google-chrome safari ie8 and firefox all support queryselectorall .so it seems more appropriate to use that if it s available

2298547
append	input
i do the same thing append hidden input elements and it upload them just fine

2298576
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	mysql
all major databases including sql-server mysql and postgresql support this keyword

2298580
switching	screens
my .app has 5 different relative layout that it can switching between by using a set of button that is at the bottom of the screens

2298580
imageview	textview
3 of the layout contains only textview and imageview

2298594
proximity	distance
sql-server zipcode latitude-longitude proximity distance search

2298609
httpwebrequest	webclient
then in your code you would create an httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or webclient and then fetch the url and get the contents

2298609
sequences	unique
just make sure you have a fairly unique identifier for your field prefix and suffix which you can guarantee will never be used or you can at least write an escape sequences for it and you could easily use the match methods to do the replace

2298612
firefox	safari
tested in firefox linux firefox winxp ie winxp safari winxp

2298612
hide	show
or show and hide with animation effects

2298616
.when	ready
something to search for that is relevant to your question .when you are ready is session-per-request

2298621
dictionary	arrays
.so i m guessing you have an arrays of dictionary

2298621
arrays	loops
if not you ll either need to loops through the arrays and parsing the dates beforehand or use the initwithkey ascending selector methods of nssortdescriptor which allows you to defined a custom comparison methods

2298628
any	set
using in with a subquery is functionally equivalent to using any and returns true if a match is found in the set returned by the subquery.

2298634
instances	destroy
for instances if mymonitor were for some reason in the stateless scoping seam might destroy it before ctx.proceed returns leaving you with a reference to a broken proxy

2298637
xsd	xml
i have the following as an example xml file and xsd

2298654
pointers	stack
never mind that they are pointers - they are copies on the function s stack .so your changes are not visible outside the function

2298669
any	set
it s purpose is to simplify the logic are any fail bits set

2298695
aggregate	grouping
unlike aggregate analytics don t required a grouping by to be defined

2298704
xsd	xml
how to validation a xml in java given a xsd schema

2298725

defined	declare
all functions are declare defined and documented but none show up in the generator html

2298740
compression	streaming
what i would like to do is instead of compression the file waiting for it to finish then starting the upload i would like to compress to a temporary file or streaming then while it is being compressed upload the completed portions

2298740
compression	streaming
the methods i have been thinking about is running the compression in a thread queuing up 5-10mb in a memory streaming then send the info to the ftp in the other thread

2298744
nsurlconnection	uiwebview
uiwebview is built on webkit and they re not using nsurlconnection internally they are at a much low-level and use cfnetwork directly

2298752
any	set
i want my nn on given words a return its closest associations or any set wordss and their probabilities

2298774
value	field
if n a and blank are truly different value you need to support i would say to create the field as a nullable field in which case the null would represent the blank value and then include a second bit field for fieldname notavailable or fieldname specified

2298774
value	field
granted you would be using two separate field to represent a single logical concept trying to force it all into one field causes two concepts to be stored in the same field the field is interpreter one way unless there is some magical value then it means something else

2298785
dialog	pop-up
if any part of your .app needs explanatory text you should incorporate it into the user-interface directly either alongside the relevant user-interface elements or in pop-up dialog that .appear the first time you visit that section of your .app

2298793
linux	unix
take a look at samba for linux or install windows-services for unix and have the client box act as a nfs server

2298804
javascript	dom
you can set breakpoints and explore the javascript object itself as well as dom elements from the plugins windows

2298817
put	get
i have everything set up perfectly .when i tell the service to toast .when it is started and destroy but as soon as i put the media play-in in there instead it starts fine and starts playing the music but as soon as a click a button to stop the service i get an error and a force close

2298824
json	xml
the service should return json preferable or xml data

2298835
web-config	app-config
