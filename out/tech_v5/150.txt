1500777
put	get
no matter what protections you put in-place they will find a way to get around them

1500788
deep-copy	object
a deep-copy construct a new compound object and then recursively insert copies into it of the object found in the original

1500816
json	xml
the advantage of the path is that it is more readily expressive of the hierarchical structure implicit to xml json as opposed to sql which required using various join to help it get out of its rectangular tabular prison

1500819
decrement	increment
then go on to more complex programs like increment decrement

1500837
callback	methods
if you want to have custom code to handle the rotation events you should overrides - didrotatefrominterfaceorientation or one of the other similar callback methods depending on your needs

1500843
json	xml
one simple way to get what you re looking for would be to overrides the tostring methods of your component class and have it return json or xml whatever you like

1500843
json	xml
to complement the tostring methods you would probably need a static methods in your component class to deserialize the json xml representation back into an object

1500843
extends	super
finally each extends class should call the super methods to get the serialization properties of the base-class

1500850

to keep the submenu visible while the mouse is on it add mouseleave and mouseenter handler for div.submenu div as well

1500962
margins	padding
if this bunches up the text too much you can add padding in lieu of margins

1500973
pylons	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	pylons
rather the difference between django and grok - or pylons or turbogears - is really one of approach

1500974

if you are you can overrides the onactionexecuted methods by extends the abstract actionfilterattribute class

1500978
pycairo	cairo
downloading the latest source versioning of pixman cairo pycairo

1500982
web-services	api
i m writing an api to expose potentially dozens of methods as web-services .so the decorator .sounds like a great idea

1500999
credentials	security
as a note for all readers informed or otherwise i just bought an 800 page 2008 copyright book on the subject from a major - in the preface the author does a hey wait a minute .. in which it is noted in detail that more than one security professional with heavy credentials and field experience had been ahem rendering moot .

1501030
any	set
you can explicit set it in code the same way you would any other user default

1501061
credentials	account
the service works .when run as localsystem albeit with a database connection-string contains credentials and running the console application as my limited account using runas also works

1501061

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
which works swimmingly in firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1501085
subclassing	base-class
the problem is that inorder to use the base-classes s constructor and most of them have more than one i need to declare an identical constructor in each of the subclassing and simply pass the parameters over to the constructor of the base-class 99 of the time i have nothing else to do upon construction

1501105
hide	show
i m not married to this javascript solution in fact i tried a few other methods of my own using simple javascript show hide methods

1501131

any ooxml-document is going to contains the used namespaces in the top of document.xml within the package

1501139
entity-framework	ado.net
being able to defined my entities without an external configuration file ala ado.net entity-framework outside of my entity class is also something that i want to avoid

1501189

under .net 3.5 sp1 specificly sp1 you can use the serialization from wcf to deserialize object without specificly marking the class up with datacontract or serialization attributes

1501195
union-all	union
raj s suggestion is good but you will probably want to do a union-all and not a union

1501213
javascript	dom
here s a plain javascript dom one that allows a regexp pattern to match

1501228
binaries	install
in most cases where you ship dynamically linked binaries you will need to include them for example if you compile with msvc++ you will link against whatever is install on your building machine if you install the dynamically linked binary on a fresh windows install you are likely to run into problems unless you ensure the libs are include as part of the installpack see documentation about visual-studio redistributables

1501236
perl	php
now for this personally i d probably go perl over the others though php would be a closer option

1501248
contains	any
since php 5.2.5 the dl function can not contains any path information and .so the libs must be install by a systemd administration in the global php extensions directory

1501256
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash sha1 md5 or any other one-way hash methods unfortunately

1501266
children	nodes
then it uses xslt copy to make a copy of the nodes but not attributes or children

1501275
button	popup
if you want an actual popup button for the toolbar item set an nspopupbutton as the toolbar item s view

1501275
button	popup
in interface-builder 3.2.1 i don t know .when this ability was actually introduced you can drill down to the toolbar in the hierarchical list of object in the nib windows and drag a popup button from the libs palette into the toolbar in the list

1501290
delphi	c++
in fact delphi s variables call by reference is quite often usable as an exact functional equivalent of c++ s passing of pointers

1501300
document-ready	.when
.so .when should i use a document-ready function and .when not

1501305
vbscript	jscript
the best option i ve heard for that is apache asp although it does have limitations such as not handling vbscript or jscript without 3rd party commercial tools

1501316
groovy	java
however since you are using java i might recommend a java-based scripting-language such as groovy jruby or jython

1501316
python	java
there is a scripting project hosted by sun in which you various scripting languages including python and awk have been integrated with the new java 6 scripting engine

1501327
callback	methods	instances	self
i have a thing that uses a systemsoundid to play a sound and then repeat with a c function being used as the sound completion callback and the function is passed since it has to be a void pointers and then i want to play the sound again if the alarmplaying bool ivar of self is true otherwise remove the sound completion and dispose the ssid providing an instances methods to set alarmplaying to no

1501329
python	java
if you re familiar with python have a look at jython which is a python interpreter written in java and allows you to call python code from java and vice-versa

1501334
vb.net	vb6
here an example of custom windowss-messages vb.net vb6 and c# interprocess communication via windows messaging

everyone i talk to either says learn python or learn c++

1501340
latex	tex
i m curious as to whether a native .net rendering for tex latex exists

1501340
miktex	tex
my current thoughts are to use miktex along with dvipng to compile the tex source and rendering the generator dvi as a png but i m still worrying this may incur an unacceptable amount of overhead not to mention the need to bundle miktex with the given program

1501350
python	java
it s quite a different world from more modern garbage collected languages like c# java or python

1501369
google-code	bitbucket
there s also a ton of django project on google-code github and bitbucket

1501381
onmousedown	onmouseup

1501389
subclassing	accessor
goalnavigationcontroller should be a properties or an accessor in your uiviewcontroller subclassing

1501392
any	set	output	mode
.when run in this mode it s a good idea to set up proper logging or at least redirect your output streaming if you rely on the console for any debugging

1501399
python	ruby	python	c++
c++ code written by other people tends not to have more beneficial nor recognizable patterns like software written in python ruby or lisp

1501416
pointers	stack
that doesn t mean you need to become an expert in either but having a working knowledge of things like pointers registers memory-management stack and heap un-gc-ed string buffering leaks etc

1501416
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
instead i m simply making the case that c++ skills will benefit you regardless of whether you continue writing most of your code in c# or java or python or ruby or...

1501423
user-interface	flicker
i ve seen other questions asked about the user-interface flicker in firefox but they didn t quser-interfacete seem to fit my situation

1501430
user-controls	ascx
ive been searching throughout msdn but i dont know what i should be searching for exactly...how do i access the child elements of a user-controls i do not wish to create a new custom control that rendering its own html the html output is a simple repeater in an ascx file it looks like this

1501449
attributes	properties
if you were super keen you would put attributes on your model properties and then somehow have them parsing .when you rendering the page but i have no idea where you would start if you wanted to go this way

1501459
json	xml
one common performance problem is that parsing xml in browsers is one of the slowest methods - you may be better off using json

1501483
user-controls	tabcontrol	design-time	designer
.so do we have a user-controls that behaves similar to tabcontrol .so that all the user-controls can be organized visually in designer during design-time

database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table called userdegree .when i try to import back to php using doctrine it generator a model named userdegree is there a way to solve this

1501505
double	int
.so you should be able to implicit convert any float into a double but not the other way around just like you can convert any short int -32 768 to +32769 into a long - 2 billion to + 2 billion bit not the other way around

1501506
children	nodes
i don t know whether root nodes and child nodes are the same class a child nodes might be a subclassing of root nodes because both types of nodes have children but only child nodess have a parent nodes

1501514
click	mouse
detection mouse click how would i go about this

1501518
selection	cell
you need to add a keylistener and set the selection or focus to the next cell

click	mouse
what you can do ist to detection the shape selected by the mouse click and draw this shape in a different color

1501560
contains	set
silences will then contains a list of time .so i can hook up .some way to let the user jump around through the various silence s and then set the currenttime to a chosen value and play it

copy-constructor	deep-copy
.so either write your own copy-constructor to do a deep-copy or defined an private copy-constructor which implements a no-op

1501586
maven-plugin	cargo
another option would be to use the cargo maven-plugin

1501588
silverlight	wpf	expression-blend	silverlight	expression-blend	wpf
for me the open in expression-blend is only available in silverlight project for wpf project the option does not exist

1501590
show	next
but if you wanted to show the waveforms to the user then javascript and canvas can be used for this but then see the next paragraph for the streaming

1501602
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
but if you wanted it to work on ff3 opera safari and google-chrome then you can implements it but it would have to be done by hand as i don t know of any javascript libs to do something like this

1501616
entity-framework	ado.net
domainmodel c# libs with ado.net entity-framework

1501620
any	set
you can and should set up audit trails and make sure the user knows you have logged on as them but in any small company i m assuming you don t work for google it s probable that most of the devs will ultimately have access to the database and could remove or modify these audit if they really wanted to

1501622
vbulletin	phpbb
thus they go after popular package like phpbb and vbulletin because getting into those will get them into a lot of sites

1501632
display	height
in ie the grid appears with a much larger height in the .ui-jqgrid-view div but the data itself stays at a smaller size and display at the bottom of the containers div .ui-jqgrid-view

1501646
put	get
then while i was trying to wedge all those actions into a consistent url-scheme i found myself wanting to put some information into the get request that seemed a tad sensitive

1501646
web-services	security
i ll admit that my original .post wasn t .so much a question as it was a commentary on the potential security issues raised by restful web-services particularly crud endpoint used in this context

1501653
sql-server	oracle
we are migrating over to oracle from sql-server side

1501678
having	union
having said that you can try a union of the following approaches

1501681
selected	cell
using scripting attached to mouse events dynamically set the class attributes of table cell to make it seem selected using the css rules

1501691
sql-server	oracle
perhaps the translation from sql-server to oracle was flawed and accidentally introduced this circular definition

1501714
object-reference	instances
the compiler is always complaining about object-reference not set to an instances of an object. .so hopefully there is an easy way to checked whether this is the case before i try doing .something that would cause it.

1501722
contains	set
however if this is set on your div it will make sure that the div is always large enough to contains its inner contents

1501731
for-loop	arrays
if this is a dynamic arrays have your for-loop go from 0 to high data

1501756
any	set

at first i tried the ado.net excel connection-string approach but it was fraught with nasty hacks -- for instances if second row contains a numbers it will return int for all field in the column below and quietly drop any data that doesn t fit

1501801
security	owasp
the owasp open web application security project have a convenient list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities

1502645
contains	any
one pm may spend half a day putting together a risk log and mitigation plan which contains 20 risks another may spend 2 days putting together one which only has 5 risks but none of those numbers are any more useful as a metrics than lines-of-code

1502653
webforms	asp.net
it s relatively easy to adopt asp.net webforms if you come from different technologies because it doesn t required a strict methodology to be effective and because it supports multiple-languages

1502653
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in this case it will lead to a disadvantage in construction time which is pretty much the main strength of webforms .so if you want a testable systemd it doesn t make sense to use webforms because then you can better use asp.net-mvc or .something like that

1503392
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling should not be used for ordinary error-handling

1503432

also giving to you simple methods to execute simple tasks as login logout and publishing feed

1503588
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
it is as simple as getting data through http and parsing it it can return json kml xml csv

1503594
json	xml
personally i m not aware of something called streaming api but supposing that they have an api you still need to pull the results provided by it xml json .... parsing them and present them back to the user

1503596
arrays	loops
you somehow have to loops through your arrays and filtering each elements by your conditional

1503596
arrays	loops
loops through your arrays with any loops you want may it be while for or foreach

1503597
duplicates	contains
the advantage of this methods is memory efficiency if your arrays contains big value - they are not duplicates

1503598
for-loop	arrays
use enumerate in the for-loop instead of len .. and arrays lookup for neater code

1503619
aggregate	grouping
then you grouping by t1.locid and use the count aggregate to give you a numbers that effectively count from 1 for each row

1503627

modeladmin.list_display is defined as a subset of the available field .so not every attributes field properties is display in the change list table

1503724
aggregate	grouping
of course it makes most sense if there s .some kind of logical grouping of dependencies .so the compound is more than an arbitrary aggregate and it makes most sense if there are multiple dependents for a single compound dependency - but the parameter block pattern has been around for a long time and most of those that i ve seen have been pretty arbitrary

1503725
shell	bash	bash	zsh
this function works in bash korn shell and zsh but it required a date cmd such as gnu date that has the -d option

1503725

value	field
it is not possible to store complex types in like the one you re using in database columns .so you can not use complex types for the value field in a datagridviewcomboboxcolumn

1503743
value	field
to create the datagridviewcomboboxcolumn you need to assign a list of possible value to the column and tell the column the field in the datagridview s datasource it stores the selected value to which field is used as a display value and which field is used as the value that is stored in the underlying datasource s column

1503747
value	field
you can use a formula instead of a field value for grouping

1503767
contains	any
by the way your sample regex contains an error the . is use for any character al.so w only matches one words character .so i guess you meant to write

1503770
callback	methods
i was of thinking of some form of callback initially to retry the failed task but each function has totally different parameters and the code has already been written and tested and just needs a re-queuing methods

1503776
windows-xp	windows	windows-xp	windows-nt	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp
as per the win32_diskdrive class description the serial-number and firmwarerevision properties aren t available on windows-server 2003 windows-xp windows 2000 and windows-nt 4.0

1503799
value	field
but i would like to .apply same behavior .when the .app is running cause some other field are enabled with binding only if the value of myobj is nil

1503816
protected	public
why not defined a protected virtual-method that creates the excrement and keep the public properties that returns the excrement non virtual

1503824
32-bit	64bit
and .when comiple it with x64 platform with 32-bit operating systemd its compiling but .when we move that thing into production-environment which is 64bit operating systemd then its giviing error that one of assambly is not able to load

1503843
internet-explorer	doctype	internet-explorer	quirks-mode	quirks-mode	doctype
i would like to ask if internet-explorer in quirks-mode has a different javascript implementation than ie in a normals mode .when doctype is correctly defined

1503852
silverlight	wpf
in wpf and silverlight you can make a viewmodel object and set it into the datacontext of a control .when the control is construct at runtime

1503860
worksheet	excel
which is called as a user-defined function from within the excel worksheet

1503870
linux	unix
on linux unix i d use the program head not head to see the headers its returning. and then you need to figure out if your browser is using a fonts that supports utf8

1503878
msbuild-task	nant
i my experience i would not recommed using the nant msbuild-task instead the easiest way is creating and task create a .bat file that the task execute

1503895
javascript	dom
however the dom object that javascript operates on may have different behavior

1503918
getter	setter
generally .net stuff such as auto-implemented properties don t need unit tests making sure that the getter and setter work

1503941
contains	any
ok .so each layout_frame can contains any content .so they will be of differing height but i want the height to be equals within the row

1503946
put	get
.so i d like to have a data structure where i can put in any event in any time in the future and where i can get and by doing .so remove all due events .

1503947
blacklist	whitelist
i m aware that it s better to to whitelist validation and not blacklist validation m specifically looking for that

1503964
put	get
if we just put the file in cvs and updates the other machines from there the encrypted passwd on each machine would get overwrite

1503970
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
are the client side javascript extensions microsoftajax.js the same in both asp.net-ajax for asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc

1503996
instrumentation	debugging	performance-testing	instrumentation
.so without being able to start the .app from xcode or instrumentation i have no chance of debugging performance-testing

1503997
sorted	lookup
if your events can stretch out indefinitely into the future then your own idea of using a hashmap from offset to list of events is the best one with a twisted - have a sorted list however you wish to implements it of known offset that way you will have very efficient lookup you won t have to loops over every key ion the map

1503997
hashmap	arrays
you don t need to delete anything from the list of known offset .so no issues with re-balancing - you merely delete from the arrays that hashmap points to

1503997
hashmap	arrays
but the reference to .when the event should happen should all be absolute in relation to some starting points if it s a hashmap with unbounded range you can use epoch seconds and if events have bounds like in the first arrays solution i listed you should instead use # of seconds since beginning of range - from start of day yesterday

1504017
unix	bsd
another interesting example of this is the bug found in i believe bsd unix

1504024
stateless	stateful
advice it does not makes sense call a stateful inside a stateless

1504035
implements	extends
then i d extends the textbox control to create a new spellcheckedtextbox which implements ispellcheckable

1504043
any	set
unfortunately for me i cannot seem to figure out how to pass or set the passwd before i manipulate the database and all the searching i ve done .so far have not yielded any fruitful results

1504056
triggers	insert
i tried to insert the following in the code as well to see if any of it would triggers the debugger none of it works

1504064
any	set
is there any other setting i need to set or is this a known bug

1504071
png	gif
the compression of images at least for gif and png images are based on repetition .so if you make the image larger by repeat it the extra image-size will add very little to the file size

1504096
delphi	c++
over at rudy s delphi corner he has an excellent article about the pitfalls of converting c++ to delphi

1504096
delphi	c++
he also wrote a conversion helpers package that install into the delphi-ide which aids in converting c++ code to delphi

1504096
delphi	c++
using c++ object in delphi

1504104
attributes	properties
once you have defined these you then would need to tell the designer which properties should use your editor by applying the editor attributes to the affected properties

1504109
invoices	product
this is an invoicing report where i want to pull in the serial numbers of product invoices

1504109
value	field
perhaps use a subquery to concatenation the lotc.fcuseinlot field inorder to return one corresponding value per recording

1504129
substitution	replace
the basic idea is to use a for-loop to go through each line of an input file and then to use string substitution provided by the set cmd to replace your characters

1504135
system-shutdown	process
it looks like your main issue at this points is that your process isn t running with the privileges required to perform a system-shutdown

1504139
javascript	dom
if you go for a javascript libs like jquery you can easily bind any javascript code to the dom ready event and avoid issues of this kind

1504140
value	field
if i have an edittext component on my screens that i have specified for a numeric decimal field what is the best way to convert it to an decimal value in the application code

1504141
javascript	dom
as others have said some javascript frameworks have a nice methods of running javascript as the dom loads

1504145
jsonp	ajax
i was initially going for a jsonp approach as suggested by google inorder to do cross-site ajax call in javascript but ended up with too many hacks that i had to incorporate into the asp.net web service inorder for it to work

1504192
contains	any
it is actually pulling rows from the table where the value in any column contains the letter a

1504217
directory-structure	subdirectories
the directory-structure of my project is pretty common under subdirectories there are 2 child directory one represents source package root another - resources root

1504218
traversal	parent
.so i m looking for a better way other than traversal the parent child containment tree using nhibernate

1504224
constructor	object
you are looking for constructor of object

1504243
firefox	opera
optional you may also wish to stripes out all the firefox ie opera etc menus leaving you with just image

1504247
value	field
you might want to verify this by hardcoding the column field named in the query and just replacing the comparison value via parameter.

1504252
void	main
and if you want to use static int entrancemain main void as your program s entry-point then one way to do it is to tell that to your linker give it a full decorated named of that function

1504256
32-bit	64bit
how is linux simultaneously 32-bit and 64bit

1504256
32-bit	64bit
although i building things for 64bit and 32-bit

1504256
32-bit	64bit
if libc handles it is it kind of like a android-emulator that says i ll link with 32-bit apps but speak 64bit to the kernel

1504260
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave

1504260
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout have subtle difference to mouseenter and mouseleave

1504267
directory	folder
there is an option for locating the building directory in other places than project folder

1504271
anonymous-class	local-class
an anonymous-class is a local-class

1504283
contains	any
typing in 255 128 64 works because the properties windows contains code that tries to turn whatever is typed into a systemd color a named web color or else an rgb-specified color and show the blah blah blah is not a valid value for int32. messages for any text that it can t convert thusly like mycolors.darkgreen

1504285
contains	elements
if yes checked the page on each postback for a hidden elements contains a string

1504286
account	api
this will be an api for our partners to use to access our customer service functions such as creating new account making payment and other account management functionality

1504300
32-bit	64bit
nothing is stopping the cpu from switching from 64bit to 32-bit

1504300
32-bit	64bit
you can have a 64bit kernel and run 32-bit apps

1504300
32-bit	64bit
you can even have a 32-bit kernel and run 64bit apps mac os x

1504300
32-bit	64bit
however you need the libs they use to also be 32-bit or or 64bit which is why you might see files called lib64 or lib32 on linux for the 64bit or 32-bit libs

1504302
exception-handling	try-catch
the only exception-handling throw in the try-catch are my own

1504314
expression	evaluation
it might also happen if you re using immediate evaluation instead of deferred evaluation in your el expression - instead of

1504316
udp	tcp
there are certain issues if you are dealing with a severely high traffic environment one is the choice of filesystems reiserfs performs 5-10x better than ext3 because of some internal caching of the fs tree it does not have udp support tcp keepalive is quite an overhead if you use sharedance only memcached has udp thanks to the facebook team and scaling is usually done on your aplication by sharding data across multiple-instances of sharedance servers

1504319
32-bit	x86
because x86_64 processor are designed over x86 technology they are still able to support 32-bit programs without any hardware emulation like what you would need to run x86 programs in a powerpc or sparc environment

1504328
contains	set
contains another containers div that set to float

1504345
32-bit	64bit
the only limitation is that you cannot link 32-bit programs against 64bit libs .so you must have both 32 and 64bit versioning of libc etc

1504370
value	field
but now properties field not showing any of this value even after adding repeat in calendar.it is not visible in properties list of lotus-notes calendar and showing black entry for above code

the trouble is that i need to edit the value in the related todo field and if they re all named todo then i can t refer to one specifically.

1504500
audio	ogg
as to ogg and other formats we will continue to work with mpeg audio collections and see what can be done with this libs looks a bit old since last release was 5

1504533
children	nodes	children	tree
the solution i m hoping to avoid is to eliminate the children associations that comes along with tree and defining and manually loading a children arrays defined on each tree nodes

1504534
lookup	any
.so you want a multi-index dictionary supports lookup based on any key and supports extensions to multiple key

1504548
required	checked
of course this means every lookup required two checked for the data but never more even if you have 50 key for the same value

1504550
webforms	asp.net
i am using an html not the server control on my asp.net webforms which i bound using asp.net-ajax via a webservice call

1504555
attributes	properties
i still wouldn t recommend using it because future browsers may introduce new properties on htmldocument and htmlformelement as browsers have regularly done in the past especially on htmldocument whose namedd may clash with your named attributes

1504563
show	next
i ve got a asp.net webpage which has a bound datagrid on it it was having trouble with showing vertical and horizontal scrollbar .when it got over 14 items in it .so i decided to move the datagrid to paging which works fine .when it first loads it show the first 14 items and places the correct numbers of next page links at the bottom however .when i click on one of these the page postback to itself but stays page one

1504576

i want to overrides the behavior of a mouse click in the datagridview header column cell top left cell

1504620
selected	cell
that cell causes all rows to be selected

1504623
json	xml
you should instead have you webservice return json or xml data with just the info you need just the store name. and then use javascript to dynamically create and add the options to the dropdown

1504628
contains	elements
in the first case the xmlelements would only contains the rank attributes while in the second it would contains the complete listing elements hence allowing the title output

1504631
children	tree
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

1504637
value	field
hey presto a field that access treats as having a value of credtypeid but display with credtype

1504652
value	field
given that you have a zend_form with the appropriate field created_on bug_description and bug_status and provided that you have the right filtering and validation in-place adding a new row with value given in the form is as easy as

1504682
getter	setter
the setter methods created is named setfido and the getter methods is just named fido

1504682
getter	setter
.when you specify readonly i believe that simply tells the compiler not to create the setter methods but only the getter

1504683
firefox	safari
this just doesnt work in firefox or safari

1504686
extends	final
also consider making these inner-classes private or final unless you need to extends them

1504730
comma-operator	operands
as it is it uses the comma-operator which means evaluate all operands and use the last c as the result

1504730
toupper	tolower
also the tolower or toupper function in might help you

1504733
cout	cin
use std cout or std cin or std cin.getline .. instead of what you are using

1504757
getter	setter
the setter and getter for the datasource is not the appropriate place for that code

1504767
arrays	loops
if i understand your question - id each cell numerically and reference them in an arrays climb the arrays to loops through them

1504782
function-call	inline
that doesn t apply here because the variables is modified in the call to the function and there s a sequences points at the start of any function-call even if the compiler inline it

1504787
itextsharp	itext
you can use the itext java versioning documentation or the itextsharp documentation the methods and classes are the same maybe capitalization is different but you should be able to figure it out.

1504799
profiling	trace
sql profiling is essentially a gui wrapped around the trace routines. it is of course possible to configure a specific setup implementation to do well anything and perhaps that s what someone is thinking of

1504801
keydown	keyup
note that keycode is part of the arguments passed for keydown and keyup but not for keypress

1504803
contains	any
i would lookaround on www.gamedev.net it contains some excellent tutorials for beginners and in the forums you ll find a great deal of information on any subject related to games programming

1504812
gridview	datalist
from what i know the datalist control does not contains a built-in paging mechanism like the gridview control however there are a few ways round it

1504813

python does this .so does java and .so do c and c++ .when compiling in optimized modes

1504835
32-bit	x86
i converted it from an any cpu to an x86 project because i need to use sqlite reliably across different platform .so i need to include the 32-bit system.data.sqlite.dll and let everything reference that

1504838
key-value	key
in the win32 application programming interface api a key-value has two halves with the high-order bits contains the key code which is the same as a windows virtual key code and the low-order bits representing key modifiers such as the shift control and alt key

1504838
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter key do raise the keydown and keyup events

1504865
salt	md5
i had a similar situation recently- an old application of mine used a salt md5 and i very much wanted to upgrade without affecting my users

1504865

linux	osx
here s an example of a makefile that runs an extra cmd on osx and which works on osx and linux

1504936
global-assembly-cache	gac
i think it is a strongly-named assembly .so it can be added to the gac global-assembly-cache on the machine running the iis

1504967
instrumentation	profiling
i ve seen this cause incorrect results in instrumentation memory profiling since those instances will hang around

1504998
value	field
will return rows where field value is any of the following

1505001
double-quotes	single-quotes
the only syntax problem was double-quotes instead of single-quotes

1505003
instances	private
since the executable for your process could potentially be shared with another process two instancess of your program could be run that s not counted as part of the private memory even if as is often the case there s only one instances of it running

1505012
contains	elements
one possibility is that your matched elementss are contains by an elements that handles the click event and stops propagation of the click event

1505017
jeditable	jquery
there is also jeditable a jquery plugins to edit text in-place

1505021
virtualbox	vmware
now an iso seems to work with virtualbox because i can tell it to mount a cd dvd drive and use the iso instead of a physical drive but the vmdk and vmx files are always listed as being for use with vmware virtualbox

iframe	popup
i have a feedback popup tickbox that loads a cross-domain iframe and .when submission the form it loads the thanks for.... page

1505057
contains	elements
systemd contains elements such as

1505065
protected	public
alternately you could create a protected or public even get function

1505073
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

1505079
response	timeout
the internal timeout period on the search appliance before a 500 504 error is throw can vary depending on the state of the response

1505085
actionmethod	url.action
they can even read the current routedata url.action and controllercontext parameters model cause you are dealing with ambient value in these object - and execution a full actionmethod request

1505085
contains	any
you can pass your viewmodel into the renderingaction or just rendering anything like a footer or header area - and let the logic be contains within those actions where you can just fire and forget write the renderingaction and forget about any concern of what it does for a header or footer

1505104
contains	elements
if your xml file can contains large lists say tens of thousands of elements you should definitely be using xmlreader

1505115
launchd	daemons
i have my own launchd daemons starting an .app launchdd .when the install starts

1505117
abstract-class	subclassing
i m trying to execute a fetch request against a managed object context with a predicates that tests against a keypath that exists in some subclassing of an abstract-class

1505119
decimal-point	digits
the numbers of digits to appear after the decimal-point

1505124
decimal-point	digits
if you know the decimal-point will always represent a stable value regardless of the length of digits on either side of that decimal-point you are in luck

1505131
wxpython	pyqt
the different solutions that popped in my head were to use a gui libs like wxpython or pyqt or maybe even a pdf generator like reportlab

1505136
object-reference	instances
--- system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1505137
callback	methods
the way i think i ve written the scripting is to fade out the div contains the nodes content and then use a callback to execute the ajax .load methods to load the new gallery item in as well as doing some other bits to content within this div

1505156
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
vmdk vmx are vmware file-format but you can use it with virtualbox just create a new virtual-machine and .when asks for a hard disk choose use an existing hard disk and click on the button with folder and green arrow image on the combo box right which opens virtual media manager it looks like this you can open it directly pressing ctrl+d on main windows or in file virtual media manager menu .

1505185
profiling	trace
since a trace can be started in the profiling event .when msdb is readonly it is clear that normally there is no write into msdb that can occur

1505185
profiling	trace
profiling trace can pose a significant stress on a live systemd because the traced events must block until they can generator the trace recording

1505185
profiling	trace
live trace profiling are usualy worse file trace sp_trace_create are better but still can cause issues

1505190
subtract	add
i d like to add some functionality where users can enter + or - to add subtract a day from the value

a before insert triggers which would throw an error before an insert is made if the invoices referred to is locked

1505208
value	field
i want the initial value in the field to indicate what people are supposed to enter

1505208
value	field
my question though is how do you get the initial value to vanish .when they enter that field .so that the initial value is only a hint and not a permanent value that they have to erase before they can types in their named

1505210
aes	des
closer to just strings is symmetric key cryptography aes des xdes rc4 where your application has a secret-key used both to encrypt and decrypt

1505247
unsigned	zero
or unsigned zero

1505252
selected	button
for cs4 in the properties box is an icons little button that is available .when you have the textfield selected which you can toggle on and off to determine if the text is selectable

1505253
authentication	login
i have a wss 3.0 site with forms-based authentication enabled and a custom login form

1505269
subclassing	superclass
using class-table-inheritance it is recommended that the subclassing refers to the superclass and not the other way around

1505292
jface	swt
which are the reasons to choose the eclipse rich client platform as the base of my application instead of just using swt jface

1505302
selected	button
.so the general problem is that click a button removes focus from the previously selected elements

1505310
version-control	git
modern version-control tools like mercurial or git are even better in this regard

1505311
perl	awk
i am fine with using awk perl sed and not just vi 7.2 toolset

1505323

using jquery i ve attached mousedown event handler to both the selected boxes and each individual option that just call preventdefault on the event object but this isn t sufficient

1505774
mousedown	mouseup
again i ve attached preventdefault-ing mousedown mouseup and click handler to all of the elements involved but it doesn t help

1505774

1505888
32-bit	64bit
or can i just copy the 32-bit dll s in-place of my 64bit dlls

1505897
where-clause	sql
note that the above is not equivalent to the sql query you ve provided because personid conditional will be generator as part of where-clause

i ve tried using cgpostkeyboardevent using the last boolean value to set the key to its up or down status but i can t seem to find the key codes or any character code tables

1505934
sorted	bag
if nothing else .get 0 is easier on the eyes than .iterator .next - hibernate bag support is definitely adequate for this purpose plus you can even add an order-by declaration if applicable and have your list sorted

1506052
arrays	loops
for...in loopss iterate over only dynamic properties of an object .so if you create a for...in loops and it completes one loops you will know that the object is an as.sociativity arrays

i need to display the row numbers in a gridview control to denote visually to the user how many rows have been populate

1506090
children	nodes	children	tree
the only nodes in the source tree that it doesn t copy exactly into the result set are text nodes that are children of newcustomer elements and whose value is either y or n

1506110
constructor	object
you can pass in the object via the constructor like .so

1506110
constructor	object
now in my unit tests i can initializer the test class and pass in a mocked object into the constructor

1506117
any	set
you can create your joptionpanels and then loops through the components of the panels children etc. checkeded to see if any components are instanceof jbutton and if .so checked the text and set the proper mnemonic

1506139
children	nodes
i want to go to each book and extraction all of its children s data however i m having probems it keeps returning null instead of the value of the text nodes

1506145
textbox	button	click	mouse
i want to allow the dialog class to know .when any of the three textbox has been click with the left mouse button

1506145
click	mouse
coming from the world of c# where everything is done for me and i have direct access to any of the events i want got focus mouse double click whatever i m very confused on why certain events are special and provide easy access

1506145
click	mouse
in the case of cedit i don t understand why got focus kill focus change and several others are directly available to me with no problem but other events like mouse click are not

1506145
click	mouse
but back to my actual question in the scenario describe above how can i get the dialog notified of the left mouse click on the textbox

1506159
.net	wcf
i have two .net c# windows forms applications that are communication with each other via wcf named pipe

1506159

the will get the first child nodes of each etc. elements which in each case will be a text nodes contains the text of the elements

1506185
shell	bash
export is a cmd that you give directly to the shell bash to tell it to add or modify one of its environment variables

1506196

stuff wont scale well if you change the aspect-ratio at such a small size .so i wouldn t mess with it

1506201
asp.net-mvc	webforms
can a asp.net-mvc view page have a webforms control on it

1506210
value	field
basically if the form submit properly the web2lead api will take the value in the returl field and redirect you to that value

1506223
subtract	add
you have to add one because it s subtract and thus if the first of the given month is sunday you d end up with 0

1506229
any	set
any concurrent transactional which comes along will checked the dirty flag and if its set to true it should get the data from the database otherwise it can read from the caching

1506250
getter	setter
would you go .so far and call it a duck typed thing that is reduced to getter and setter in other words a data transfer object

1506308
entity-framework	ado.net
if your stored proc is purely for logging i would probably just surface it outside the entity-framework context and just call the stored procedure the good old-fashioned ado.net way..

1506324
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
that said you should avoid using asp.net webforms server controls in your asp.net-mvc applications

1506325
mapping	unique
you could then map ip to the ports on the nat and have a unique mapping

1506337
digits	base
the obvious pattern in the weight is of course that the weight is w b k with b the base of the numbers and k the index of the digits

1506337
digits	base
the base for each digits is the amount of different possibilities for that digits

1506337
digits	base
in general the k th digits will have base b k k + 2

1506383
duplicates	contains
if your lists don t contains duplicates items and you don t care about the order of your output you can just do

1506383
duplicates	contains	duplicates	sorted	contains	sorted
if you have two lists which may contains duplicates aren t necessarily sorted you want results in the order they occured in a and you don t care about performance you can do

1506427
callback	methods
handle the result-of an async data retrival request the callback methods shouldn t be public purely for testing

1506427
protected	public
you are using a third party framework which allows you to extends by overrides protected virtual methods the path from the public methods to these virtual methods are generally treated as black-box programming and will have all sorts of dependancies that the framework provides that you don t want to know about

1506458
value	field
i was trying to set the field value outside the datagridview

1506464
hash	md5
string-comparison will be more efficient than either crc32 or md5 or any other hash algorithm proposed

1506482
double	int
c++ standards doesn t have int pow int int it has double pow double int float .

1506485
combinations	permutation
it is provided by a similar concept the factoradic and is related to permutation my answer related to combinations i apologize for that confusion

1506486
midl	idl
for how to defined other types of parameters and such for a function refer to the c++ header that was generator by midl from your idl file

1506487
contains	set
the compiler doesn t determine a types for the anonymous-class it creates a new anonymous-class that contains the properties that are set

1506492
configuration	environment	configuration	installation	installation	environment
many installation will support either a --prefix configuration option and or a destdir environment variables

1506515
onmouseover	mouseover
however what you could do is onmouseover add a class to the elements called fired and if you see that class don t fire triggers the mouseover

1506539
xsd	xml
get a good xml editor such as oxygen and tell it you are making a new xml document using a schema points to your xsd file and see what you are allowed to types

1506540
selected	checkbox
then in jquery have a click function of some kind that will make the ms_selectedlist display clock essentially making it appear to be like a selected box .when its really just an absolutely positioning div tag with a bunch of checkbox inside

1506559
contains	set
if you configure your load-data-infile to only insert certain columns all others will be set to their default value not to value they currently contains

1506575
put	get
further if i reverse the mapping put a ilist carriers on the company entity and try to get a filtering list of companies by a carrier it works every time but i don t know why

1506587
triggers	insert
this is not the best behavior - it really should delete then insert .so that the various events assign to those activities are triggers as expected not just mapper extension methods but database level default too

1506587
fflush	gets
as far as fflush current behavior i ve looked into trying to break this out but it gets very complicated - insert which depend on deletes would have to execute after the deletes but updates which depend on insert would have to execute beforehand

1506588
value	field
such data contains mixed date value in one column in database that field is varchar 32

1506591
contains	any
the idea is that .when a user types myseconddomain.com it will add this hosts header into the body of the http-request from the browser to iis iis will then read this value and checked to see if any of the website s contains a match for the hosts header and redirect the user to the appropriate website thus myseconddomain.com will appear as though its on its own server which it technically is anyway.

1506594
shell	bash	any	set
see the discussion here -- export and set are both shell cmd and whether on windows or unix they re still inevitably being addressed to a child-process running the shell be it bash cmd.exe whatever and .so bereft of any further action .when that child-process terminate .when os.system returns to the caller

1506595
version-control	git
this kind of workflow though sounds tailor-made for a distribute version-control systemd like mercurial or git

1506597
.net	wcf
will this service only ever be called by .net wcf clients

1506606
floor	ceil
you multiplying the value by 16 use the floor or ceil methods and divide by 16

1506616
subtraction	formula
on this page there is an arrays formula for finding the positioning of first digits in a string. you should be able to modify that to use the t function to determine if a character is text incorporate a little subtraction and then get to what you re looking for

1506636
subtract	time	subtract	add
don t use any of the deprecated methods and don t use tostring unless you understand what it is displaying. to display format convert add subtract time etc date time always use a calendar instances or date-format implementation and it is hard to go wrong

1506648
sql-server	oracle
i m trying to export from sql-server to oracle a table that consists of an id and a really long xml string stored as nvarchar max

1506648
sql-server	oracle	sql-loader	bcp
i m using the sql-server bcp utility to export to a text file mystuff.bcp which i then import into oracle via sql-loader

1506663
contains	elements
one elements contains a string that include quotes

1506665
.when	ready
the best you can do if you want this functionality is to serialization the tree and write the raw-data to a disk file then bring it back .when you re ready for it

1506677
exception-handling	try-catch
this methods has a try-catch block and the exception-handling was handled there printing the stack-trace using system.err

1506679

.so that the hyperlink if any under the caret will fire rather than having to click with the mouse

1506709
haskell	python
i have a lot of experience in haskell and very little in python and would like to be able to start writing some of the backend non-web-related things in my favorite language

1506728
scala	java
all i have read .so far is that scala has native collections types that make it a bit clumsy to integrated with a large java codebase whereas clojure follows a simple iterable iterator-centric way to inter-operate with java classes

1506749
arguments	default
besides it is always a good coding practice to make your one arguments constructor including those with default value for arg2 arg3 ... as already stated

1506753
hide	show
edit to show or hide an image the javascript looks like

1506769
stderr	stdout
you can configure the logger to printing to stdout or stderr instead not to mention filtering out unimportant information

1506782
zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
i keep seeing cakephp and codeigniter referred to as full stack asp.net-mvc frameworks whereas zend-framework is said to be non-full stack

1506784
base-class	inherited
it s probably al.so better to inherited from a collections of t than a collections of busines.sobject .so that the methods and indexer you inherited from your base-class use the correct types

1506801
openbsd	debian
on a debian box and an openbsd server the order is utterly random

1506801
openbsd	debian
the debian box is 5.10.0 as is the openbsd machine

1506813
ref	out
what is telling you that it needs to be either out or ref

1506813
ref	out
passing an intptr as out or ref is really akin to passing a double-pointer

1506813
ref	out
you do not need to pass the intptr as out or ref inorder to send data back to .net

1506828
sql-server-express	sql-server
there may be an import data option in sql-server management studio you can use this i just checkeded in sql-server-express and it wasn t there but i m certain it exists in the full versioning of management studio - can t checked at the moment

1506829
multiplying	modulo
continuing left for the 3rd column we divide by 6 because the columns to the right have 3 and 2 possibilities each multiplying to make 6 and then take the remainder modulo 4 because there are 4 possible value in this column

1506844
python	java
.when comparing python and java it seems a bit unreasonable to blame the language for the speed difference

1506844
python	java
java is compiled jit except on mobile-devices whereas python is interpreter

1506844
scala	java
regarding interop w java scala is closer to java but i m sure both languages interoperate well

1506844
scala	java
and since scala author martin odersky wrote sun s java compiler i kinda think no balls have been dropped on the scala side either

1506844
scala	java
scala is more likely to be the next java while it s hard to imagine that lisp will finally take off after not doing .so for over 50 years

1506853
altera	fpga
this might be an example from an extremely narrow domain but altera s nios ii platform is a soft-core microcontroller that you can customize within an fpga

1506874
binary-data	chunks
i am using adodb.streaming to generator chunks of binary-data and using response.binarywrite to streaming it to client

1506874
http	ssl
now problem is that there is a known feature in ie which sets the response cachecontrol header to no-cache by default for ssl http sites

1506875
qheaderview	qtableview
you can get a pointers to a qheaderview object using qtableview s verticalheader and horizontalheader methods

1506906
firefox	safari
something that isn t working on firefox safari but is working on ie on itself is already pretty weird but i can t seem to figure out this problem

1506906
firefox	safari	youtube	flickr
on my site there are links to social media in the top right corner youtube facebook and flickr on ie they are linked on firefox safari they aren t

1506906
firefox	safari
if i enlarge this to say 1200px the links do work on firefox safari

1506923
overlapping	margins
due to the margins of #image overlapping with the content of #social the browser thins that #image is another layer

1506932
worksheet	excel
a good example of this comes from the article writing custom excel worksheet functions in c# by gabhan berry

1506932
contains	any
note that the .reg file does not contains any registry updates that can

1506932
default-value	default
by deleting all the characters from the named you are creating a default-value and the icons for the registry value will be automatically renamed default

1506938
scala	java
as both scala and java are essentially class-based languages they interoperate more easily

1506938
scala	java
a java class is a class to scala and a scala class is a class to java

1506938
scala	java
problems might arise .when it comes to scala s singleton or java s static-members particularly .when there s a framework involved expecting things to work in a certain way

1506942
boolean	int
one common methods is to make a memorystreaming out of an arrays of bytes and then make a binarywriter on top of that memory streaming and then write int boolean chars strings whatever to the binarywriter

1506950
sql-server	oracle
i need a solution that will work for sql-server and oracle

1506955
stdin	eof
if you have control over the java code you could detection a fairly normals situation like eof in stdin or a so-called poison pill in stdin and use that to decide in java that now is the time to exit

1507008
selected	listbox
this means you can use selectedvalue to get hold of the corresponding dictionary key for the selected item in the listbox

1507011
put	get
i could try to put all the quotes which i probably should but i don t know how to get to that variables anyway because i m doing all of this from whithin the person view etc

1507017
silverlight	wpf
it does have the advantages of both asp.net since you can create browser pages and also the user-interface capability of silverlight some people say wpf is like silverlight with steroids

1507037
shell	bash
i m using mac os x 10.6 using the default bash shell

1507042
configuration	logging
this gives you or someone coming later finer control over logging levels etc via the logging configuration

1507047
header-only	boost
yes most boost libs are header-only .so you do not need to compile any .source files

1507050
silverlight	wpf	rad-controls	telerik	panels	grid
the rad-controls from telerik have a built-in office and outlook skins and provide all the different controls you want grid left panels bar right grid right scheduling their controls are available for silverlight asp.net and wpf .so you can try them both out and see what works for ya

1507055
header-only	boost
most of boost is distribute as header-only libs - meaning you do not need to building any kind thing to use that libs

1507059
click	mouse
for a fast and selective solution you can click with the mouse wheel yes

1507060
header-only	boost
if you look at the list of boost libs you will see many of them labelled header-only .so there is no additional libs to link against

udp	tcp
this is part of the nature of udp one of the bits of reliability you give up .when you switching from tcp

1507498
traffic	packets
the packets could be lost due to an increase in unrelated network traffic anywhere along the route or full receive buffering

1507500
udp	tcp
one option is to change the network protocols use tcp or implements some acknowledgement + flow control using udp

1507517
centering	fixed
then put a single row fixed width table inside of the table data of the centering tablerow

1507520

1507667
e-commerce	product
i am building an e-commerce website from scratch and have to make a special product configuration page

1507699
stderr	stdout
then you need another trick that can swap stdout and stderr this little monstrosity here

1507699
stderr	stdout
as already mentioned predate.sh will prefix each line with a timestamp and the tstdate.sh is simply a test program to write to stdout and stderr with specific time gaps

1507699
stderr	stdout
.when you run the cmd you actually get d to stdout written to stderr but that s your tty device or whatever else stdout may have been .when you started

1507700
contains	lookup
note that lkp_color_table can contains unused color same goes for other lookup tables

1507704
json	xml
xml which can be done simply with xmlserializer or datacontractserializer but that offers much less control over the xml or json json.net etc

1507789
32-bit	64bit
in the end the problem was that i was trying to load a 32-bit binary with apache running in 64bit mode base as describe in this .post i was able to get it running immediately by doing the following

1507789
32-bit	64bit
after replacing the 32-bit binary with the 64bit binary everything worked as expected with no special apache handling

1507821
ready	live	.when	ready
i manage everything with a subversion repository which allows me to simply do svn updates on my live site .when i am ready to pull in my changes

1507827
stderr	stdout
you can use the following trick to swap stdout and stderr

1507827
stderr	stdout
provided stdout and stderr both pointed to the same place at the start this will give you what you need

1507827
stderr	stdout
sets stdout to got to the current file handle 2 original stderr then closes 2

1507827
stderr	stdout
sets stderr to got to the current file handle 3 original stdout then closes 3

1507844
required	checked
checked the occurances of the words required and compare to the count of split words

1507856
difference	count
assign the largest unassigned numbers to the grouping with the lowest sum unless the difference in size of the the groupinging is less than or equals to count of unassigned numberss in which case assign all of the remaining numberss to smaller grouping

1507862
updating	updates
updating the version_col_name by increment it by 1 is totally secondary to the optimistic-locking act and becomes relevant to to the succeeding updates

1507872
knapsack-problem	np-hard
this looks kind of like the knapsack-problem which is np-hard

1507905
export	report
.when i export this report to pdf the text in one table display over the other table texts texts behind other texts

1507914

you re probably not using mainframe db2 but the luw linux unix windows versioning may also have the functionality to timeout badly-behaved sessions those that hold resource locks without activity which would prevent orphaned cursor from accumulating

1507921
directory	folder
ok i just downloading junit 4.7 unpack the zipfile changed directory into the folder and ran the following cmd successfully

1507923
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp

i would love it if i could have a single deployment project that install certain files depending on which valid serial key is detected

1508036
lazy-evaluation	maybe
i find the expression-blend interface confusing or maybe i am just too lazy-evaluation to learn it

1508039
getter	setter
getter and setter omitted for brevity

1508049
debugging	trace
this is what i see in the debugging trace file

1508052
getter	setter
things like converting getter and setter to properties and sometimes indexers for example

1508064
contains	elements	contains	any
this makes some sense because it would be much more difficult i think for it to traversal every child elements to look for an unordered list that they contains plus take into account any unordered lists that are direct children then determine which is the one that should be made into the tabs

1508085
buffering	streaming
each connection request a buffering from a pool fills it with data from a shared network or disk streaming or channel process it then returns the buffering to the pool for re-use

1508097
defined	declare
to resolve your problem one way is to declare i with extern linkage in the header file then defined it in only one of the implementation files as show below

1508098
ubuntu	debian	stderr	stdout
the devscriptings package in debian ubuntu contains a scripting called annotate-output which does that for both stdout and stderr

1508105
slidedown	slideup
.when should we use slideup slidedown and .when to use slidetoggle functions in jquery

1508106
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to edit the browser caps for my asp.net application in web-config but it seem after editing the effects are not realized in my browsers e..g firefox and google-chrome .so i heard that you can put your browsercaps in machine.config but after doing that .when i run my applications on my server its now saying service not available...as in like .something evil happened to my machine.config file

1508129
slidedown	slideup
you should use slideup or slidedown if you have either multiple triggers or multiple effects

1508129
slidedown	slideup
but if you are using slideup and slidedown together for the same triggers event you are basically just doing slidetoggle but making it harder on yourself

1508139
contains	any
initialization better results come from random cluster centroid as the algorithm itself doesn t contains any local minima avoidance rules

1508148
windows-vista	windows
.when using windows-vista or windows 7 the office tools words do not look at the local intranet list of internet-explorer

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari work with the following css 3 prefixes

1508186
widget	button
i m using asp.net-mvc and i have a widget within my form collections on my html page and .when i click on the save button for the main form i would like not only to save the data on the main form but also the content on the widget how can i do this

to cover both google-chrome firefox and any browser that supports css 3

1508198
scala	java
it is trivially easy to call java from scala

1508198
scala	java
it is easy to call scala from java as long as you conform your external api to the common points between scala and java

1508198
scala	java
for example a scala object is used in some ways like static-methods in java but it s not the same thing

1508198
scala	java
scala classes may compile to a numbers of classes with named that look funny in java

1508198
scala	java
building component in scala or clojure that uses lots of java libs is very feasible

1508198
scala	java
you can of course call into this component from java but what you are not going to want to do is try to consume a scala api intended for use by scala programs from java

1508198
scala	java
in my view scala is java done right

1508225
variables	boolean
and i don t want to go through the hassle of having the play pause stop button to updates a boolean variables because other that those button i suspect there may be a billion reasons for the status to change

1508231
windows-xp	windows
i m working on styling a tabcontrol on a pc runnnig windows 7 and everything looked fine but .when i tried running it in windows-xp i get a hideous white border around the tabcontrol

1508256
python	ruby
i ve seen some comparisons between smalltalk and ruby on the one hand and ruby and python on the other but not between python and smalltalk

1508259
order	join
it could use the index on hte order by column to get all the rows in the right sequences and then filtering out the others - but - that would mess up the join

1508275
post-increment	pre-increment
use pre-increment istead of post-increment to iterate through your vector

1508275
temporary	copy
post-increment will always create a temporary copy of your current elements which can be expensive

1508293
versioning	upgrade
you don t have to deal with sql-scripts even .when existing database is being upgrade to next versioning

1508306
python	ruby
languages including python ruby

1508324
buildpath	libs
.when you say you added the dependency as a referenced libs i assume you mean you added it as a jar dependency to the eclipse project via the java buildpath section of the project properties this will work only for compilation in your workspace

1508324
target-platform	rcp
rcp needs dependencies nested jars to be defined in the manifest .so they are re.solved in the target-platform

1508327
bmp	png	bmp	ppm	ppm	png	pgm	bmp	pgm	ppm
bmp pbm pgm png ppm xbm xpm

if i consciously create a syntax-error i get the error output on the url-for example .when i put a spaces before def

1508409
spawn	exit
rpc call spawn a process to execute the m f a that you asked it to .so in your case it will spawn a process that execute my_server start_link and then exit

1508419
constructor	object
instead you could try passing a factory in on the constructor of the object

1508452
sql-server	mysql
i get 1 sql-server db and 10 mysql dbs

1508454
constructor	object
the deck constructor takes a reference to a vector of card object the shoe normally 104 cards and pushes a pointers to each card onto it s own deque of pointerss

1508454
constructor	object
once this vector of dynamically created card object has been created - i then pass a reference to this vector to the constructor

1508459
attributes	properties
yep you can decorator properties or constructor parameters with the dependency attributes

1508471
constructor	object
you cannot add constructor or destructor to an objective-c object

1508486
authentication	login	value	field
however - the main issue i can see with your approach is that if you re using the default login controls the user can still login initially and then you d need to be checked the value of the deleted field in either the loggingin before authentication or loggedin after event handler - you might be able to get away with modifying the built-in isapproved properties to handle this by default

1508487
any	set
however .when i debugging it what happens is as the control passes over m_printer.open it magically ends up in btnprint_click and does not go any further unless i click the button on my form and then at m_printer.printnormal it break and throw poscontrolexception and the text therein reads an attempt was made to access an exclusive-use device that must be claimed before the methods or properties set action can be used.

1508500
unique	words
the words field is not a unique field .so many recording have the same words

1508505
constructor	object	pointers	stack
in your deck constructor you re saving pointers to object that reside in stack .so as .soon as the .solitairegame constructor ends they will be deleted and your pointers will be invalid

1508522
basic	vba
it s driving me nuts tried editing the excel in notepad - crash the excel tried some basic vba but i was only able to edit connection properties of pivot-table and not change the dsn

1508530
managed-code	native-code
if your com thread is busy in native-code .when you call abort nothing will happen-it just sets a flag .so .when the thread comes back into managed-code it will pop the threadabortexception

1508538
parentheses	let
i m really not sure how mysql handles mixed logic like that since it s not enclosed in parentheses .so let me know if it works

1508542
contains	sorted
now we are talking of an arrays that contains a null value not about a null arrays that was sorted out in the previous part

1508543
versioning	upgrade
most will automatically upgrade a working copy automatically to their own versioning

1508556
terminal	prompt
such terminal probably being connect to standards input. this will cause the job to generator a signals and the shell will prompt the user to do something

1508556
linux	unix
these were picked up line-for-line by commercial unix and in cloned for the work-alike linux kernel

1508585
firefox	safari
accessibility no one knows that microsoft always made the best accessiility features on all of its product they always worked well with disabled people comparing the browsers only ie supports full accessibility and safari firefox etc are no where closer

1508585
extends	sealed
majority of components controls are sealed .so its difficult to extends them and overrides to make new components easily

1508585
contains	any
flex contains lots of controls and you dont need any third party libs

1508586
contains	elements
the html standards says inline elements can t contains block elements

1508604
any	set
however if i set duff proxy settings in internet-explorer the webbrowser stops working sending any navigation request to res ieframe.dll dnserrordiagoff_weboc.htm# and if i clear the ie settings it works again

1508635
constructor	object
but in the constructor you push heap object on to it like this

1508635
put	get
perhaps have deck own the card object initially and .when they re removed they get put into the vector in solitairegame and don t exist in both at the same time

1508635
constructor	object
.when you push the card object onto it they ll not get pushed to the correct vector which will go out of scoping at the end of the constructor and your class member will be empty

1508640
command-line	mkdir
for documentation click that link or try man 2 mkdir from the command-line

1508658
protected	public
the only solution i ve found is to subclassing qtabwidget and overrides the protected qtabwidget gettabbar as public

1508660
daemons	systemd
or you could run the daemons as root and put your key in the systemd keychain

1508693
implements	abstract
operationdefinitions definitely does have an abstract methods call java.util.list since it implements the operation interface

1508704
mta	sta
.so could you explain sta and mta

1508714
checkbox	button
the problem is that .when button is pressed it does not recognize the latest checkbox action

1508715
ms-project	mpxj
that said it might be easier to use mpxj which purports to provide a robust and open api for manipulating various types of ms-project file

1508725
stderr	stdout
stdout and stderr log files should have been created in the logs directory of your tomcat installation

1508747
web-applications	webserver
the standartized protocols to use between python web-applications and webserver not only apache is wsgi

1508754
value	field
i get all the value prior to the empty field and unexpected results from the empty field onwards

1508757
vbscript	jscript
its tempting to advise you to use jscript on the server side instead of vbscript

1508757
dictionary	arrays
the associativity arrays in vbscript is called the dictionary is available from the scripting libs

1508771
selected	textbox
selected the row you use as footer actually the textbox associated and set the dataelementoutput for that textbox to nooutput

1508774
inlining	inline
if you use a variables or methods only once you may inline it but inlining is always equivalent to declaring it explicit

1508813
key-value	key
.so it looks like you re really just using the dictionary as a set of key-value pairs and you want to evaluate the value function for the first key predicates that returns true

1508813
dictionary	arrays
rather than a dictionary since you re not really doing a lookup i would use an arrays anonymous here for convenience

1508826
linux	unix
that behavior does not occur on linux unix - the file is closed by the end of your code and it doesn t matter if it isn t anyway

1508840
background-image	width	background-image	height
for instances an empty span has no height or width .so any background-image will be covering the background of an area of 0x0

1508840
put	get
you ll notice that if you put in i hate static dimension in that span you tested you ll get a small corner of your image

1508840
display	height	display	width
now you could set the height and width in the css and therefore not hardcode it into the html however you can only do this for elements with a display types of block

1508840
display	height	display	width
if you want the area to have height and width but still flow inline you can use display inline-block

1508842
background-image	width	background-image	height
.so just set the width and height in your css along with your image as background-image and your fine

1508859
sql-server	mysql
i know that stored procedure in mysql are new and might not be as robust as that of sql-server but is there anyway to just create a generics scripting that i know i only want to run one time .so i wont have to go back into my database and remove all these stored procedure later

1508869
strncpy	strcpy
use strncpy rather than strcpy

1508870
controllers	routes
setting aside the model this question is about the routes and the controllers

1508880
put	get
i know i could get 10 recods for each model put them in a dictionary and sort by date well once i know how to sort by date in python but this seems fairly inefficient

1508887
contains	elements
it produces a streaming contains the elements of the given iterator

1508916
python	java
these links are great but are predominantly python biased i am using gwt and therefore have to use the java flavour of gae does anyone have any examples of how to achieve these join equivalencies in the java versioning of gae

1508935

one idea for creating the user-interface is to store control info with each field value in the database and construct each view completely .when we query the database

1509481
value	field
if your field can have only two value in it why not use a bit boolean

1509488

qt-creator then takes care of all the magic and i simply need to alternate between the building configuration to have both a 32-bit and a 64bit qt .app

1509932
32-bit	64bit
the only libs i haven t managed to find for 32-bit development on 64bit architecture are the gstreamer libs meaning that phonon might not work

1509933
unsigned	bigint
does anyone know of any work around by which i can save unsigned int 0 to 4294967295 simply using 4 bytes instead of using 8 bytes and bigint

1509942
eclipse-plugin	aptana
note this can be used with the aptana radrails eclipse-plugin as well as aptana

1509999
filtering	grouping
it also matches the mental model better you have list of data sources from then you filtering out the data you re interested in where then you sort this data orderby and lastly you either project it into a different representation selected or partition the results grouping by

.net	wcf
in other words dictionary and many other .net types are not interoperable .so wcf will not attempt to preserve them in a servicecontract

1510245
dictionary	arrays
you can specify svcutil.exe to use specific collections instead of arrays in the generator proxy code but i m not sure it will work for a dictionary

1510250

just wondering i strongly types these views in asp.net-mvc and then use request.form on the submit controllers to get the data out validation it put it in an object send to database

1510255
stdin	pipe
if your editor can read input from a pipe and save to a pipe then you can actually use the versioning of gnupg that decrypts to stdout and encrypts from stdin

1510402
python	ruby
i would say that python explicit and smalltalk implicit both try like c to offer a single way to perform an operation while ruby s more in the perl-ish school of there are many ways to do it

1510402
python	ruby
smalltalk and ruby have separate namespaces for methodss and other attributes in smalltalk non-methodss attributes are not visible outside the object s own methodss .so extraction a methods and calling the resulting object required more introspective ceremony but the common case of dispatching may be thereby made marginally simpler in certain cases -- in particular just mentioning an argument-less methods implicit call it while in python like in c calling is explicit performed by append parentheses while just mentioning well.

1510407
getter	setter
for simple things like getter setter or simple math stuff i don t test

you can either read the schema manually which can be hard or use an xml editor like tom is suggesting but there s another possibility many platform offer tools that automatically generator classes from xsd schema which you can later automatically serialization to get the correct xml

1510695
contains	set
add a width to the div contains the table the div with the overflow-x scroll styles attributes set

1510697
put	get
currently i am using a svn-externals definition to get the files out of zend s svn systemd during deployment however i don t want to rely on that svn and i also don t want to put traffic on external svns with each deployment

1510699
comparator	sortedset
the only possible way to achieve that is to have your elements s equals methods behavior be consistent with your comparator - the reason for that is that core set operates based on equalsity whereas sortedset operates based on comparison

1510699
comparator	sortedset
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses comparator

1510706
subtyping	generics
note that in generics wildcards extends just means is a subtyping of .so you use it for either classes or interfaces

1510714
invoke-sqlcmd	cmdlet
.when i try to use the invoke-sqlcmd cmdlet from sql-server 2008 to execute a query that contains scripting variables ex

1510714
object-reference	instances
invoke-sqlcmd object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1510717
contains	any
classes that reside directly in a source directory are in the default package it is usually not a good idea to keep classes there because it is not clear to which company and application the class belongs and you can get named conflicts if any jar file you add to your classpath contains a class with the same named in the default package

1510730
xsd	xml
the xml snippet you posted looks like xsd schema

1510738
number-theory	primes
it gives an amazingly detailed explanation of one way functions number-theory and primes and how they relate to cryptography

1510758
attributes	properties	any	set
asmx uses the xmlserializationr internally to serialization typess .so all of the usual xmlserializationr rules apply types needs to have public parameterless constructor any public field and public get set properties will be serialization system.xml.serialization attributes have special meaning etc.

1510759
scp	ssh
i have a java program which runs in tomcat and which needs to execute several ssh and scp cmd as well as a few simple cmd such as ls on the local machine

1510759
command-line	cmd
i am running the web application in which the ssh cmd are execute as root i start tomcat as root user with my web application code deployed as a .war file and as far as i know the correct certification key are configure on both the local and remote machines at least i can perform the ssh cmd at command-line as root without having to enter a user named or passwd

1510759
scp	ssh
updates i have now taken the advice of the helpful folks who responded to my original question and have written a class which provides methods for making ssh and scp call implements using two java ssh libs jsch jsch-0.1.31 and sshtools j2ssh-core-0.2.9

1510759
scp	ssh	command-line	cmd
i expect that i am facing some sort of configuration issue on the servers where i am running the codes although this is not obvious since i can perform ssh and scp cmd on these servers with no problems .when i issue the ssh or scp cmd on the command-line

1510776
default	reset
go to tools - import and export settings - reset all settings save current settings if you like - choose your default language i chose vb.net and it should appear

1510785
comparator	sortedset
it s a little bit odd that sortedset as a part of the standards api break the contract definedd in the set interface and uses the comparator to defined equality instead of the equals methods but that s how it is

1510789
connect	inet
i m trying to connect to a web service using io .socket inet yes i know that there are lots of better modules for doing this but i don t have them and can t add them .so please don t suggest it but i m timing out i think that s what it s doing waiting for a response

1510791
zipfile	archive
.when i add them to a new zipfile using 7zip command-line tool the charset encoding information is not saved and .when opened on a windows computer the archive does not correctly display filenames

1510802
filtering	grouping
i want to find all the users that are a member of a grouping in a certain ou .so my filtering would look .something like this

1510821
processor	cpu
if not please make sure the cpu is consumed by sqlservr.exe by checked the process processor performance counters

1510821
worker	fibers
a worker is backed by an os thread or fibers sys.dm_os_threads

1510822
arrays	loops	nsmutablearray	nsarray
i m currently testing around with nsarray and nsmutablearray and it s really annoying that i haven t found any methods for effectively display the contents of my arrays without creating loops and display row by row

1510841
populate	row
you will get data in all of the columns from trips but data will only be populate in columns from residencies where a row existed if no residencies row existed those columns will be null

1510882
value	field
this is the basic structure for sql that will updates the original table with the value from the backup table joining on a presumed common field which would be the primary key

1510922
waitpid	fork
in one approach i made parent pause after while-loop and sent some conditional from sigchld handler only .when waitpid returned error echild no child remaining but the problem i am facing in this approach is even before parent has finished fork all process retstat becomes -1

1510935
associations	model
i am looking for a good solution for a probably typical problem of managing model with habtm associations in ruby-on-rails

1510952
firebird	mysql
not sure this would work in firebird tested on mysql

1510957
stax	sax
add root elements and use sax stax or vtd-xml

1510971

in a freemarker templates i want to expand a boolean variables to a string like that

1511002
web-services	api
this would ideally be easily achieveable with the favoured api s web-services and other dohickeys

1511004
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i was certain it was fasthosts fault .when i deployed an empty asp.net-mvc .app thanks to phils suggestion and then an empty normals webforms .app - and they both gave the same errors

1511005
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc does not do data binding in the sense of webforms .so it is best to have your object get the data it needs either by itself or using an orm like nhibernate with the repository design pattern

1511013
libavcodec	ffmpeg
ffmpeg no reason could not find libavutil and libavcodec package

1511013
firefox	gecko
gecko 1.8 firefox 2 yes

1511013
firefox	gecko
gecko 1.9 firefox 3 no reason missing ff3 development package

1511016
checkbox	textbox
they all iterate through model properties using reflection and create appropriate controls textbox for string checkbox for boolean etc

1511018
perl	c++
finally you can consider the church turing thesis that is a statement of equivalence of programming languages .so c++ can be compiled translation to your favorite platform independent language say perl lisp c-- etc

1511034
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
your cloud server provider must have something similar they call crontab that runs ruby php perl python and http jobs

1511046
entity-framework	linqpad
do do this hook up linqpad to your entity-framework context press f4 to include a reference to linqkit.dll and linqkit as a namespace import

1511061
printf	strlen
you should use strlen on pointers before the copy to make sure it fits or use printf if you have it

1511095
decrement	increment	decrement	lvalue
i believe that the increment or decrement operators needs an lvalue to assign to

1511104
lookup	any
this is because clustered index lookup are very expensive relative to sequential i o .so any plan which required more than a few percent of rows to be looked up is probably cheaper to do with a scan

1511108
filtering	grouping
if you still want to checked for membership in a grouping in addition to being part of the ou you can add this as a member-of part to the filtering

1511108
filtering	grouping
not totally sure about the wildcards - in general ldap search filtering do support wildcards but i m a bit hesitant about using a wildcard in a rdn like this grouping dn here

1511131
value	field
user changes a value on any field

1511142
highlight	selected
i m trying to generator a color that could highlight an item as selected based on the color of the current object

1511146
post-increment	pre-increment
additionally the post-increment expression i++ would be evaluated first because it has a higher precedence than the pre-increment ++i operators

1511159
android-emulator	adb
you re best off using adb from the command-line to jack into a running android-emulator

1511159
android-emulator	adb
if you can get the specific directory and filename you can do an adb pull to get the database file off of the android-emulator and onto your regular hard-drive

1511159
android-emulator	adb
edit removed suggestion that this works for unrooted devices too - it only works for android-emulator and devices where you are operating adb as root

1511163
32-bit	64bit
i have a 32-bit machine that compiles 64bit code for another machine and links a handful of libs libpng libz for example

1511183
export	csv
give the data file z.csv export your data from excel into a csv file

1511188
value	field
it may be passed either by value whereas it gets copy-paste field by field or by reference creating a cross-domain object-reference with all the beauty of remoting

1511211
administration	account
my problem is that some of our sites have rename the administration account for security reasons

1511211
administration	account
does anyone have a scripting which changes the passwd of the administration account based on the sid of the original administration account

1511224
versioning	upgrade
one thing to note if you use any 3rd party package make sure they have a delphi 2010 versioning available that you can upgrade to before you convert

1511231
json	xml
anyone know any good javascript libs that can take a javascript object or json string and export valid xml

1511276
sftp	ftp
sftp task secure ftp .

1511301
python	perl
likewise perl python and other common suggestions for these types of questions on stackoverflow

1511311
selected	listbox
selected a member from the listbox

1511314
vbscript	jscript
actually wscript cscript is the engine vbscript and jscript are the languages

1511314
vbscript	jscript
personal opinion only follows my personal recommendation is jscript because it reminds me more of a real programming language and makes me want to punch myself in the face less often than vbscript

1511320
vbscript	jscript
you could use vbscript but why .when jscript is available

1511327
vbscript	jscript
however micro.soft 1 hates javascript .so you ll encounter .some apis that are trivial to use with vbscript but painful to access using jscript

1511337
controllers	routes
alternatively if it is just for url purposes you could create specific routes for these controllers

1511348
base-class	inherited
each tracked entity implements the itrackchanges marker interface and each value object inherited from the valueobject base-class

1511376
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
here is what i want to do and i know it is possible with perl php python and java but i am working with c#

1511377
any	set
is their any way using xpath to selected the complete first nodes set for example from

1511385
hash	md5
it seems to me that we should be able to add the the source code comments recompile the source code and use something like an md5 or sha1 hash using something like fciv to compare the before and after dlls to confirm that the source code comments did not impact the compiled versioning

1511387
vbscript	basic	vbscript	jscript
to expand on the other s answers a bit wscript and cscript are programs used to run scripting written in vbscript visual basic like syntax or jscript javascript-like syntax

1511387
vbscript	jscript
you can write wsh windows scripting hosts and wsc windows scripting component scripting that use both vbscript and jscript by combining them in an xml-based wrapper if you need to merge pre-existing code in the two languages

1511415
parsing	comma
additionally i think that comma in the second header line is going to give you a parsing error

1511490
reliability	robustness
what i mean is that if all the members on your team can effectively read understand and maintain a piece of code as it is written then there is often little points refactoring that code - beware of wasting time trying to satisfy resharper .when the changes you are making aren t going to really make any difference to the reliability maintainability robustness portability or efficiency of your code

1511495
show	next
i could use the error string from idataerrorinfo but that doesn t show up in the html.validationmessage next to the field

1511514
average	max
on average the systemd needs to handle 2000 messagess daily from each client where the messages size will range from 1k to msmq max size 4mb

1511516
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
i have an itemscontrol whose for the itemtemplate datatemplate contains a button

1511516
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
i want the cmd on the button to bind to a cmd on the datacontext of the itemscontrol not the itemtemplate

1511543
navigation	styling
with my css styling code it looks good in firefox but in ie the paging navigation button are reduced to just a sliver like they ve been clipped somehow

1511547
base-class	inherited
notice how in the base-class you inherited x but you miss the first parameter

1511550
linked-list	arrays
if the list is really big and there are a large numbers of updates operations expected a simple random-access arrays or linked-list will be too slow

1511550
treeset	treemap
many popular languages have some sort of sorted data structure in their libs treemap treeset in java multiset guava in c++ s stl or you can easily find a free implementation for your language

1511551
binary-search-tree	tree
insert would be o log n if the tree remains decently balanced use a self-balancing binary-search-tree to ensure this or hope your data will not be insert in a highly regular order to approximate o log n .

1511570
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	jsf	wicket	jsf
with wicket and other server-side-centric component frameworks like jsf and tapestry the architecture is a more traditional 3-layer one and what is sent and received are pages or fragments of the pages not puredata

1511577
.net	wcf
wcf is not just web-services as others have said and is probably the most appropriate .net technology to use for messaging solutions

1511577
.net	wcf
it doesn t have to be a console .app it can be a wpf winform windows service whatever is the most .appropriate -- any .net executable can be a wcf service hosts

1511619
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays declare above the beginning of a for-loop as

1511619
arrays	loops
now .when i use inside loops i get the expected value of the arrays

1511619
arrays	loops
but outside loops this newly created arrays 2-d is getting lost and i am getting only a 1-d arrays as an output

1511652
constructor	private
possibly add a private constructor that throw an error and make the class final

1511685
.when	ready
what platform language should we start learning if we want to be ready .when full 3d support is release

1511687
.net	wcf
this is especially true if you consider the interoperable nature of wcf - it s after all not just a .net technology but an interoperable soap and rest stack that could be talking to other systemd that have no clue about generics yes those still exist

1511687
xsd	xml
anything you want to send back and forth between client and server as a soap messages has to be in a form that can be expressed with a xml schema your datacontract - i don t see how you want to model a generics in xsd - it s just not designed to do that

1511710
base-class	inherited
its purpose is to act as a base-class for a grid that i encapsulate inside the class .so that it can be modified .when the class is inherited later

1511717
contains	any
btw if you seek code to manipulate files steer clear of any sample that contains the words readtoend .

1511723
hash	md5
ok according to facebook your client libs should perform all the necessary validation for you by using the application secret to md5 all the params and validation the hash

1511723
any	set
the result is that you have a valid set of cookies sent from facebook that are no longer any good

1511743
arrays	loops
i d just use a hashtable associativity arrays and loops through your countries

1511744
shell	bash
i m new to bash scriptinging and the nix shell altogether but i m trying to write this scripting to make grepping a codebase easier

1511744
shell	bash
any other tips and or pitfalls with shell scripting and using bash in general would also be appreciated

1511745
hide	show
i expected this to hide all elements and only show the printablearea however everything gets hidden

1511788
highlight	cell
i am trying to use conditional formatting to highlight a row of cell contains key-value pairs in another column .when certain watch cell are yellow

1511788
numeric	digits
i have a three columns a b c contains numeric digits and then two columns key 1 key2 that is also numeric

1511793
value	field
if the lookup value are in a different database then you d have to retrieve them for display using dblookup and construct a view that is keyed off of the unid or whatever key you decide to use.the only drawback to this technique is that you wouldn t be able to display the field value in views as the actual value isn t stored in the document just a reference to it

1511804
javascript	dom
however your learning curve from vanilla javascript or jquery won t be too steep especially .so if all you care about is dom mantipulation event handling and effects

1511806
pascal	delphi
the most notable exception-handling that spring to mind apart from the aforementioned windows are sql and delphi pascal

1511812
decimal	hex
is there an easy helpers function in common-lisp to convert from hex to decimal

1511821
gridview	formview
first the answer seemed to be for a gridview and not a formview e.row.cells 0 gave it away

1511829
panels	grid
the children properties of the grid object will give you a collections of all the children of the grid from the panels class

1511835
subclassing	superclass
you need to signify that the superclass methods is being called because you need to have the ability to make that decision for each subclassing separately - otherwise you might have a subclassing that doesn t want to delegation anything to the superclass at all - .so the default is that you just put in the code

1511854
python	perl
with perl i use the scheduling crontab events module but i would like to convert to python

1511865
libcurl	curb
gem install curb gives an error saying i need to specify where the libcurl libs lives

1511868
nested	order
of course this always order items by their place in the nested set

1511877
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
you need to install a webserver apache lighttpd nginx etc. on your machine then make sure the server is setup to process php files through the php interpreter

1511884
click	mouse
however there is a difference between 2 and 3 in case 3 the mouse will still switching to the hand .when hovering over the link and the user can still click on the link and javascript-events will still fire on the link

1511896
contains	set
where in the code can i tell it to set a templates variables contains all the navigation objeccts without setting it in every view

1511899
launchd	daemons
but keep in mind this will launchd apache and mysql daemons in the background

1511920
function-call	inline
i just timed two variants under gcc 4.3.3 compiled with -o3 using c++ inline to eliminate function-call overhead one billion iterator keeping the running sum of all count to ensure the compiler doesn t remove anything important using rdtsc for timing clock cycle precise

1511920
32-bit	64bit
the non-parallel versioning speeds up a tiny bit because i m running in 64bit mode and it likes 64bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers

1511938
object-reference	instances
you can however reference instances members in static contexts by specifying an object-reference explicit

1511944
scriptaculous	jquery
seems like people use jquery with either scriptaculous or yui for the interface elements.

1511957
specifications	w3c
they link directly to the w3c specifications from the javadoc

1511959
attributes	properties
interestingly they don t broach the subject of how to named the private attributes hidden behind a public properties

1511961
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
instead languages such as perl php python ruby would be much preferable

1511964
protected	public
if you want to expose a field make it public or protected use a properties which should be capitalize if it s protected or public

1511972
selected	button
i have an asp.net-mvc page that needs to submit the selected value from a grouping of radio button

1511972
jquery	.post
and then .post it with jquery s ajax to the asp.net-mvc controllers

1511972
jquery	.post
and because stack overflow won t let me .post 2 links because i m new you will have to google jquery-json google-code to find the jquery json plugins i m using

1511992
silverlight	wpf
the sample below is tested in silverlight but i believe the same happens in wpf

1512038
gw-basic	basic
once you get past some basic concepts with the help of gw-basic you can begin to introduce a more modern disciplined language

1512045
screen-orientation	portrait
android screen-orientation portrait in the manifest xml

1512067
silverlight	wpf
this works fine in wpf but not in silverlight .so one would assume it s a possible bug in silverlight

1512080
adobe-illustrator	photoshop
a lot of the really artsy sites are produced in another program first usually photoshop or adobe-illustrator and then sliced into html div s

1512092
punctuation	words
this would match either a words or a non-words spacing punctuation etc. sequences possibly an empty one

1512132
signals	sigint
unfortunately if i run that process remotely over ssh and send sigint the ssh process itself traps and interrupts rather than forwarding the signals

1512137
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.3 and google-chrome

1512144
signals	sigint
try signals sigint at the gdb prompt

1512150
constructor	object
it uses reflection to create an instances of the class whose java.lang.class object is stored in the aclass variables using it s zero-argument constructor if it has one and then call one of its methods it is assumed to implements ainterface

1512162
latex	tex
as said before just put the custom .sty into texmf tex or in usr shared texmf-texlive tex but donâ t forget to run mktexlsr or texhash to updates the local package database of latex

1512164
function-templates	member-functions
the placement of explicit specialization declarations for function-templates class templates member-functions of class templates static data-members of class templates member classes of class templates member class templates of class templates member function-templates of class templates member-functions of member templates of class templates member-functions of member templates of non-template classes member function-templates of member classes of class templates etc. and the placement of partial-specialization declarations of class templates member class templates of non-template classes member class templates of class templates etc. can affect whether a program is well-formed according to the relative positioning of the explicit specialization declarations and their points of initializer in the translation unit as specified above and below

1512183
llvm	gcc
from gcc 4.x to clang llvm

1512197

1512260
consistency	rdbms
foreign key enforce consistency in an rdbms

1512260
consistency	rdbms
.when constraints are enforced within the rdbms you can rely on consistency

1512260
consistency	rdbms
the extra code you have to write to do this far exceeds any performance cost of the rdbms managing consistency

1512262
delphi	c++
dlls rarely request methods pointers because methods pointers only exist in delphi and c++ builder

1512276
put	get
those numbers get put into the string

1512283
click	mouse
their value just give the mouse positioning on the button .when it was click

1512288
show	next
for example if i am replacing the expression 0 0-9 with 1 aaa it will show the numbers with a spaces and then aaa next to it

1512292
pixels	line
it would involve a bit of math mostly along the line of map-projections but instead of scaling bitmaps and getting artifacts you would be scaling points distance and redraw using vectors which would make it smooth at any resolution especially if you re connecting dots with beziers instead of pixels or line

1512302
calayer	uiview
i wonder what difference will it make if a assemble the complex view by creating a different uiview for each elements and adding them as children of the complex view or if i should instead create a a different calayer for each elements and add them as children of the complex view s layer properties

1512308
web-services	webserver
what is the best + reliable way for two applications running on the same machine to communication with each other without using web-services or a webserver of any kind

1512321
firefox	gecko
give a look to the geckofx project an open-source component for embedding mozilla gecko firefox in .net applications

1512323
web-services	webserver
it doesn t need web-services webserver etc - just a socket on each side

1512344
double	int
it s using a double as the interval but in fact call math.ceiling on it and casting the result as an int to use with an underlying system.threading.timer

1512355
rpgle	rpg
rpg including modern rpgle

1512359
buffering	streaming
the important thing is that you use a smaller buffering and fflush the write streaming to clear out memory

1512370
latitude-longitude	location
if it has geospatial points types then it makes sense to enter the coordinates as pointss rather than a latitude-longitude pair and consider using that field as a spatial key if you re going to be accessing the table mainly by location

1512376
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera	display	height
if you browse this page with google-chrome opera or firefox and the browser s windows height is smaller than 800px some menus will overflow the windows and the user must scroll down the page to display the options hidden

1512378
double	int
i have a test dll created in another language basic not c in fact that contains a cdecl function that adds an int to a double

1512386
contains	any
anyone know any open source c# asp.net project that are well documented use design-patterns appropriately and contains the best practices

1512391
controllers	routes
i ve protected all the methods in my controllers but it looks like in_place_editor is calling some weird generator stuff that doesn t even show up in my routes like quotes set_quote_text 1

1512394
textbox	button
i thought about validation an invisible textbox directly next to the button but this didn t feel right

1512398
client-server	web-services
as far as implementation is concerned tcp sockets and web-services are about as easy to set up on either side client-server

1512403
decimal-point	zero
this solution omits the leading zero in front of the decimal-point and does not handle cases where the answer is 1.00

1512424

1512445
pthreads	openmp
what is your methods of parallelization pthreads openmp etc

1512448
child-process	spawn
or if you don t mind spawn a child-process you could just use sed there s a native ports on windows or you can use cygwin

radio-button	checkbox
maybe you are using the wrong control for this without knowing what you are trying to accomplish i still want to suggest that you look at the possibility of using a checkbox or radio-button instead

1512476
g++	gcc
i ve been using the uva online judge to solve some programming challenges and .when submission my solutions i m told the judge will compile my code using the following parameters to gcc g++ that i don t know -lm -lcrypt -pipe -donline_judge

1512480
tablerow	layout
the reason is that a tablerow doesn t have layout

1512490
repr	eval
it s really easy to use but you have to use repr to save the data in human-readable form and then eval to read it back

1512495
value	field
i assume myfield is the field you want to get value of

1512505
actionscript	mxml
don t think it is is possible to call the constructor with arguments from mxml but with actionscript you could have optional-parameters that would set the values.

1512537
javascript	dom
i d recommend you trying to split the css into the several border properties as i think most browsers don t directly map multi-component properties into their respective components .when css is being set through the dom properties in javascript

1512548
defined	declare
this means that regardless of where a function is declare it is move to the top of the scoping in which it is defined

1512564
short-circuiting	equivalent
both versioning are short-circuiting in perl but the textual forms and and or have a lower precedence than their c-style equivalent

16-bit	8bit
i created one variables that stores a 16-bit variables and i m tring to store the upper half in an 8bit variables

1512587
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
this will mean that your set can only ever contains one collections of any given size .

1512592
contains	any
one way for instances could be to create user table contains both types of users storing only the common attributes and create student table and provider table with foreign key to user table and specialized attributes if any

1512597
display	height
in the browser the samplecontrol isn t visible it still occupies 200px in height .so it is there and below it a button is display

we currently use email for issue tracking and i intend to set up a bug issue tracking systemd perhaps bug genie mantis or trac - we want something web based php open source mysql we have source control svn

1512632
registration	login
the main goal is to keep session alive and submission forms .so i could pass multistep registration process or browse website after login

1512663
variables	boolean
i would write a c++ function that given the variables d m and y returns a boolean result on the validity of the date

1512665
environment	execution
i wonder if you could modify your cgi environment variables before execution the wsgiapplication instances

1512668
highlight	tooltip
you ll notice in the image the tooltip appears over a highlight date but otherwise future dates aren t highlight therefore you can t actually tell if there is an event unless you mouse over a date.

1512673
haskell	scheme
maybe you d like haskell -- in which case you could try write yourself a scheme in 48 hours an interesting tutorial you get to write a scheme interpreter in haskell

1512697
similarity	distance
we can simply use the standards k-means and we can use other similarity metrics as well such as euclidean-distance or cosine distance

1512727
instances	private
contact management they install mssql express as a separate instances and use a private username passwd for sql and then the db

1512728
cos	sin
any line on the xy plane can be describe as p x cos theta + y sin theta

1512731
authentication	login
under user authentication and then login selected the option that

1512743
priority-queue	queue	queue	fifo
by queue do you mean a fifo fifo queue or a priority-queue

1512743
queue	fifo
for dealing with fifo queue and logging perhaps you could look into ring buffering and log rotation

1512747
google-chrome	firefox
this is one of those rare cases where things work as expected in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1512755
asterisk	ivr
i m trying to setup an ivr or to be more specific an automated attendant using asterisk

1512757

a google-search didn t turn up any books for me but this course page contains a list of articles which may or may not be relevant for you

1512776
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve tested the code in google-chrome firefox opera safari ie7 8 and every thing is working everywhere else.

1512778
scala	java
while i don t know of any scala specific solution you can try using woodstox a java libs that implements the stax api

1512781
bison	yacc
therefore you get to hack your grammar to change it from lr k to lalr 1 again forcing you to suffer the experiments that expose the strange cases and hacking the grammar reduction logic to try to handle k-lookaheads .when the parsing generator yacc bison .

1512790
hide	show
what is your objective - to hide the image show on the page

1512800
order	add
add the necessary index -- if the incremental costs on insert and updates and extra storage are an overall win to speed up the order in your queries

1512807
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve been developing big applications using try-catch to handle all the exception-handling and errors

1512817
error-handling	try-catch
try-catch is the most useful .when either you have your own error-handling function which you should or also .when you want to suppress errors

1512821
16-bit	x86	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	x86
in the wierd and twisted world that is x86 machine-code the 16-bit model is quite a bit more complex than the 32-bit model at least from the points of view of a user program

1512827
exception-handling	try-catch
maybe you don t need a try-catch block in your tiny functions -- but if you structure the scripting right you can just throw exception-handling from your small functions and have the larger controlling functions calling them in a try block

1512831
exception-handling	try-catch
if nothing inside of your small function has the ability to throw an exception-handling there isn t really a points to wrapping it in a try-catch block

1512837
duplicates	sorted
should work and you can remove duplicates if any very easily since you re getting the named in sorted order itertools.groupby in python and whatever analogous mechanism in whatever is your favorite language

1512853
triggers	insert
my problem is in some of the firefox versioning the request is triggers twice at some time and the recording are insert 6time with same datas in the table..how to prevent such situation without using unique concept.

1512863
contains	set
if you can t pass the prefix on field.render have a properties set methods on the field to pass in the new prefix and write a custom implementation of the setter on the form to set the prefix in all of the contains field .when it s set on the form

1512869
linux	unix
the most reasonable way to make compilation read a file would be #include but it s not obvious to me how to make it read standards input in a portable way on all unix systemd easy in linux thanks to the magic of proc

1512878
jquery	.post
after a .post to a actionresult methods from jquery ajax .post i return redirecttoaction but it is not redirecting

1512883
export	csv
in my application ios i need to export some data into csv or html format

1512894
spaces	output
the spaces of input output configuration is too vast for you to have any real chance of encountering at translator that somebody might have built that matches your needs

1512896
contains	elements
use the contains selector to find elements with matching text and then replace their text

1512902
contains	any
interface methods canâ t contains any implementation

1512914
strtok	strlen
ok if strlen is the only function allowed you can first find the length of your source string then loops through it and replace all non-letter characters with null - basically that s what strtok does

1512915
environment	restart
.when i save my vim session i would like it to restart the interpreter in the other windows loading in the new environment

1512923
abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	inherited
an abstract-class is only to be subclassing inherited from

1512923
abstract-class	subclassing
as one of the similarities to abstract-class it is a contract that is used to defined hierarchies for all subclassing or it definedd specific set of methods and their arguments

1512923
any	set
.when we create an interface we are basically creating a set of methods without any implementation that must be overrides by the implements classes

1512923
abstract-class	base-class
.when we create an abstract-class we are creating a base-class that might have one or more completed methods but at least one or more methods are left uncompleted and declare abstract

1512923
abstract-class	base-class
the purpose of an abstract-class is to provide a base-class definition for how a set of derived classes will work and then allow the programmers to fill the implementation in the derived classes

1512927
e-commerce	product
i am working on an e-commerce application where we want to charge the user for a product and .when he pays for it send the payment amount to 2 different account

1512938
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari i can see the browse button

1512954
account	api
authorize.net s current api doesnt allow any such facility of forwarding payment to some other account etc

1512972
boolean	int
i have changed one of the functions with raw pointers int and boolean to std vector and std vector.

1512972
boolean	int
same algorithm one implementation is using 4 5 dynamic-arrays of int and boolean

1512978
digits	short	enumerate	except
i don t have any easy answer for this except you can get best of both worlds in some cases by putting a short hash value of something you can enumerate easily from other data sources on the beginning of your key - for example a 16-bit hex hash of the userid - which will give you 4 hex digits followed by whatever the key is you really wanted to use

1512978
lookup	any
the next tricky bit is secondary indexes - cassandra doesn t have any - .so if you need to lookup x by y you need to insert the data under both key or have a pointers

1512989
implements	abstract
any new methods that are abstract in versioning 1.1.0.0 implements will break the api

1512994
contains	any
if you can start with a single recording contains any combinations of csv-special and or sql-special characters format it parsing the formatted string and end up with a recording equals to the one you started with you know your code is good

1513003
getter	setter
properties could be rename or they could have a setter getter added or removed

1513003
getter	setter
adding a setter getter is not breaking but all other properties changes are breaking

1513003
account	api
beyond the api level behavioral changes should also be taken into account

1513003
account	api
take important behavioral nuances and their effect on the use of an api into account .when creating a new versioning

1513004
google-chrome	safari
after that users of google-chrome and safari cannot click at link foo

1513010
copy-constructor	temporary	temporary	copy
this is copy initialization and instructs the compiler to create a temporary .obj by converting y and uses .obj s copy-constructor to initializer x

1513010
temporary	copy
for copy initalization because the temporary used is the result-of an implicit-conversion constructor marked explicit are not considered

1513040
linux	unix
my code uses tls storage and under linux unix pthread_key_create can take a pointers to a function that is called .when the thread is destroy

1513062
python	php
i heard very great things about python and how much better it is compare to php

1513064
.net-remoting	asmx
microsoft has recently deprecated .net-remoting as well as all their other previous communication technologies such as asmx web-services as legacy and is highly recommending that developers move to the wcf platform

1513137
command-line	cmd
adjusting the time intervals in which watch runs cmd can be adjusted using command-line parameters

1513140
data-members	private
i want to access a private data-members in a class

1513140
data-members	private
there is no member function in the class to access the private data-members

1513143
subclassing	superclass
this means that superclass get the benefit of subclassing behavior but it also means that overrides methods can theoretically get invoked before the constructor in that class

1513149
abstract-class	subclassing	defined	declare
as long as there are not too many implementation of foo i would declare an abstract methods in someinterface for each subclassing of foo and have an abstract-class forwarding call to a default-methods that is defined for the most general types

1513153
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine .so far but .when i want to insert .something at the cur.sor positioning it gets slow in firefox .when there is a lot of text in the textarea google-chrome works fine

1513161
google-chrome	firefox
as i m running into some other minor problems with firefox i m pondering switching to google-chrome for this but can anyone tell me how to load fixedsys in google-chrome

1513169
getter	setter
that s why i suggest the minimally evil hack - don t make everything private and if you can get away with a getter but no setter do that

1513174
specifications	w3c
edit also found this in the w3c css2 specifications

1513179
database-table	mysql
i tried this experiment for example- i have a java jdbc program writing to a mysql database-table called my_test

1513184
data-members	private
whether the source code of the implementation cpp-file of the class is under your control doesn t matter changing private to public for data-members in header suffices and works just fine even if you re given a binary-only libs that contains class definition

1513184
virtual-functions	base-class
reinterpret_cast the cast works just fine if you re not casting a pointers to dynamic base-class dynamic means with virtual-functions or base whose actual instances at the moment of casting can be derived from the class at the particular piece of code

1513197
32-bit	64bit
i have another section for compiling the 64bit jnilib above this in the scripting but the 32-bit one is being used for 10.4.11

1513207
function-call	inline
as a high level points i m not quite sure why you re trying to use inline-assembly to do a simple call into printf as all you ve done is create an incorrect versioning of a function-call your inline pushes something onto stack but never pop it off most likely causing problems cause gcc isn t aware that you ve modified stack-pointser in the middle of the function

1513229
authentication	login
your .app redirects the user to the provider s authentication url which is where the provider authentication the user directly with a login form or by checked a cookies in the user s browser for the provider site the provider may also ask the user to grant permission for to give access to your .app for their user account

1513229
authentication	access-token
you only have to do the request authentication access dance once to obtain the access-token

1513268
csv	xml
i would avoid a csv file and maybe rather use a xml file

1513270
dpapi	salt
i have no idea if it will help but windows provides since 2000 a mechanism to retrieve and store encrypted information and you can also salt this storage on a per-application basis if needed data protection api dpapi

1513273
intermediate-language	cil
mono.cecil is good for analyzing any souce codes that can be compiled into common intermediate-language cil

1513274
python	c++
let s say you want to throw the following exception-handling from your c++ code module mylibrary.cpp along with a little error messages to be caught in your python code

1513274
python	c++
this will wrap the c+++ function do_something in a try-except block which catches the c++ exception-handling and converts it to the python exception-handling defined in step 2 above

1513276
contains	elements
my model are the same the reason is that the model i use usually contains only the properties corresponding to the elements on the form

1513310
removeclass	addclass
and then use addclass and removeclass -

1513330
callback	methods
even if you are using sync operations though typically you d just use callback methods instead of events in a case like this.

1513352
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
and you still have to be careful if you re working with class heirarchies because as soon as you use multiple or virtual inherited you cannot assume that the layout of the derived-class matches the layout of the base-class - you have to ensure that the offset is valid for the exact runtime types not just a particular base

1513352
getter	setter
therefore node_base can have pure-virtual getter setter and other methods

1513355
linux	unix
on linux and unix look at this question

1513372
attributes	properties
model binding has attributes that deal with excluding properties in a bound class from attempting to load from binding

1513377
32-bit	64bit
is there any way to use visual-studio to debugging a dump of a 32-bit .app that was produced on a 64bit computer

1513381
constructor	object
each time you use new it creates a new object of the requested class and then call the constructor on that object with the value you give it

1513381
constructor	object	value	field
as the numerator and denominator field of fractions are not marked as static then each instances of fractions will have its own copy of those field .so the value passed to the constructor of the object whose reference will stored in the variables c are stored in the first new object and those of d in the second new object

1513383
cartesian-coordinates	points
for that purpose i transformed the points to cartesian-coordinates and built a mesh of triangles that i can rendering with vtk

1513400
json	xml
as a much lighter weight alternative to xml json provides you with all that

1513403
getchar	stdio
getchar and other standards functions that read stdio are typically line-oriented .so block until newline

1513413
mbunit	nunit
use nunit or mbunit etc for unit-testing

1513418
alt	src
how to extraction img src title and alt from html using php

1513427
debugging	trace
though i ve used the trace sources from bea stollnitz website to debugging my binding

1513444
nsinteger	int
an nsinteger is not an object types it is simply a typesdef for an int or long dependent on whether your application is 32 or 64bit

1513445
authentication	login
it is the wish of the client to have one login for both systemd .so the user logs in in the parent site and then are automatically authentication on the iframed site

1513476
jquery	.post
jquery .post

1513478
pointers	stack
instead what you probably want to do is use an int pointers to scan through stack value instead of a char-pointers

1513491
output	cat
you d be better off writing the output to files and then cat ting the files at the end of the run

1513499
erlang	scheme
.so my question is if standards function definitions in oz are not lazy-evaluation what does oz do that languages like scheme or erlang can t or won t

1513524
value	field
to display initial field value properly formatted use dateinput widget

1513525
contains	elements	contains	any
i would therefore like it to be possible for the xml file to contains the elements in any order and for the deserializer to still work

1513528
contains	elements
the div rightmenu has no height because it contains only floated elements which do not have a height themselves

1513528
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the overflow hidden will clear the float for firefox safari and google-chrome

1513533
reflection	runtime
how can i allow a user to enter a string into a winforms application and then use reflection to parsing that string which can be execute at runtime

1513547
constructor	object
i can also do validation on the value in the object constructor that i wasn t able to do with the arrays

1513550
formatting	printing
whatever you do you re going to have to do with two passes - one to find the length one to printing using that length in the formatting

1513618
directory	folder
i have directory called mysourcedir it has sonme files and folder

1513625
default	reset
i ve got a line of code that sets the fill value to a - character in my output but need to reset the setfill flag to its default whitespace character

1513641
tcp-ip	icmp
using icmp ping can be useful at a low-level but presumably what you need is a connection to an actual endpoint via tcp-ip to do real work

1513648
required	checked
while it will support indexing it will required a full join for every session types you want to checked

1513659
authentication	login
now i want to send these credentials onto my site lets say www.abc.com login and authentication whether the username and passwd is correct or not

1513679
icmp	tcp
a lot of companies have measures in-place to prevent outgoing icmp request tcp connections to ports other than 80 443 for example or even to prevent you from reaching the internet directly by transparently proxy your traffic

1513679
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
under an internet-connection i would understand any way to contact the outside be it udp tcp or icmp

1513707
variables	boolean
try make another variables types example boolean and keep it false if the messages hasn t show yet true .when it show and change the conditional to something like this

1513712
arrays	map
imho the simplest and most readable way is to pass a map instead of an int arrays

1513720
user-input	output
i tried to separate server output and user-input with ncurses windows

1513726
tcp-ip	udp
is there a reference which lists approximately how long it takes in relative or absolute terms to transfer information over network udp vs tcp-ip disk memory sequential random-access in-process vs interprocess etc

1513738
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	put	get
if the issue is that you re collecting new value you must put them in first get the id numbers of the newly insert career you re using an auto_increment mysql sequences oracle or identity sql-server for those idcareer value yes

1513766
input-field	selected
if you give a named to your input-field then you can easily selected throughout the others

1513781
command-line	findstr
but you might just want to use cmd.exe built-in findstr or the grep command-line tool

1513782
fflush	stdout
you may want to fflush stdout to ensure that the buffering are in a consistent state before you do that

1513783
nested	order
if you have a live-updated view like this you don t need to manually maintain the order in the file or spread a lot of silly nested regions around in your source

1513793
arrays	loops
and then there will a for each loops to go into every object in the arrays

1513797
versioning	upgrade
register a myfull.app url with the full versioning and have the lite .app present an upgrade option that call that url with the various data you want to exchanged encode in it

1513805
breadcrumbs	theming
this is not optimal as it disables any other breadcrumbs manipulation that might be happening before the page theming but if you know that you always want your breadcrumbs this might well be an advantage

1513808
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i created a testpage which has been tested in ie 8 google-chrome 3 opera 10 and firefox 3.5

1513813
selected	cell
.when i selected these cell and try to get cell value with the following code

1513813
selected	cell
is there some properties of datagridview that specifies the order of selected cell

1513813
selected	cell
note that i selected cell by dragging cursor from top-left-most cell with value 1 to the bottom-right-most cell with value 4

1513827
entity-framework	ado.net
if you re in a more enterprise-oriented environment if your .app will likely last 10 or more years or if you need heterogeneous database backends or if you need to map between disparate physical schema in your database and your object domain model - then pick the ado.net entity-framework and linq-to-entities

1513837
contains	elements
here at each iterator would contains six strings you d still need to convert first and last elements to int

1513838
perl	lua	python	lua	python	perl
i think too it is a bad idea it might be simpler to code in python or lua or some other language without these inherited from perl i think

1513868
protected	public
have mytestableclass extends myclass and then provide public methods in mytestableclass that expose the protected methods of myclass that you need

1513892
silverlight	wpf
works in silverlight 3.0 and is not a wpf solution

1513894
if-statement	loops
i might be missing something but couldn t you factors each of the branches in your top-level if-statement into separate functions create a list of test to action tuples and loops over them

1513897
hide	show
i want to show one and hide the other based on a conditional

1513916
put	get
... if we just put the file in cvs and updates the other machines from there the encrypted passwd on each machine would get overwrite

1513920
perl	c++
is there a scripting-language for c++ like perl which can be used for rapid development and use some tool which can convert into c++ program to get higher performance for deployment

1513924
user-input	output	output	mode
for example if your application is running in ncurses mode could you have a split windows with a line or two at the bottom in one sub-windows reserved for user-input and the rest of the output server output and accepted user-input in a second sub-windows above it

1513942
python	c++
many project combine c++ and python -- see for example

1513952
sequences	unique
create a table with a big pool of 5-character strings that are added in sequences .so they are unique and have a guid as their primary key

1513968
c++	lua
you may try lua quite often used with c++ in games industry

1513977
contains	elements
try hiding the contains elements i don t know what s turn into assuming they are input elements of types image

1513981
unique	words
there is a methods to pick unused unique words by random but it s probably not going to be any better than what you are doing now

1513990
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
however this one makes me worried because the adoption rate for current browsers is spotty even in cutting edges ones like firefox opera and safari

1514004
constructor	object
on an aside if you ever need to clone object consider the use of copy constructor instead of implements cloneable

1514024
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
personally .when firefox google-chrome and opera have good implementation that s .when i ll start using html5

1514030
superclass	inherited
use a superclass see xjc superclass from which all your bound classes will inherited

1514034
.when	ready
if you can use jquery it has .ready function that call callback .when dom is ready and .so every scripting are already loaded

1514040
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
ruby is ideal but i can parsing php python c java etc

1514049
shallow-copy	deep-copy
while the correct answer is indeed to store a reference there are time where the distinctions between myarray shallow-copy and dclone deep-copy matter

1514049
contains	any
if myarray itself does not contains any references then storing a shallow-copy will help you avoid that behavior

1514053
configuration	installation
try adding the following configurationuration into visual-studio s configuration file located inside the visual-studio installation directory at common7 ide devenv.exe.configuration

1514110
xsd	xml
i have a relatively simple xsd file defining my xml schema

1514110
derived-class	base-class
unfortunately the way in which xjc generator the classes means that only derived-class gets the xmlrootelement not the base-class

1514134
getprocaddress	dllimport
pe format doesn t support unre.solved external .so you either use headers and dllimport or loadlibrary getprocaddress and pointers to functions

1514161
web2py	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	web2py
although django turbogears web2py are all good frameworks i found the latter quite simple and flexible

1514165
sequences	unique
fully pre-populating a unique sequences pool with your parameters required a 459 million row table

1514199
penetration-testing	security
at the bits-and-bytes end there is penetration-testing and security research which is often as much cataloging of programming bugs as actual research

1514216
put	get
or just get it off the gcc source tar ball and put them where your eclipse could pick them up adjust the include-path accordingly

1514222
subtract	time	subtract	add
for a treeview it would be more complex but i could see that you would want all your richtext controls to be indexed maybe use the tag properties and then as you move them in your treeview use the index to add subtract from other indexes and then use the relocate methods in a loops that many time to get it to it s new location

1514227
python	java
since virtual machines have become .so common in languages like java python and c# the distinction between scripting and programming has been blurred

1514228
data-structures	dictionary
i have a few data-structures that are bascially dictionary with some methods that operate on the data

1514244
udp	tcp
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1514244
udp	tcp
also tcp with nagle turned on batch-file packets which again wouldn t be a fair comparison to udp which doesn t do that

1514250
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
data live in their own files or portions of db etc in any of the many suitable formats mostly standards ones possibly including multi-language ones such as json csv xml .

1514269
.when	ready
.when a thread initializer a connection-wrapping object the object gets its connection via pool.get which automaticaly enqueues it to wait if there are no connections currently availabe and dequeues it .when a connection s ready for it

1514278
protected	public
all examples i see tend to present entities with virtual automatic properties and an empty constructor protected or worst public and that s it

1514289
hide	show
i had mistakenly added my jscript along with that to hide and show controls

1514299
fflush	stdout
the call to fflush stdout will translation into a write call of whatever has been buffering but not sent to the underlying io ports

1514310
latex	tex
more precisely in texmf-local tex latex pst-gantt

1514334
jquery-address	jquery-ui-tabs
what i want to do is use jquery-ui-tabs with jquery-address - for back button and bookmarking

1514340
put	get
if you put pointers to object in the queue and any other stl containers the pointers won t get deleted .when you remove them

1514352
subclassing	base-class
i d put the parent on the constructor function though .so it s like a subclassing knowing its base-class and i d call constructor .something else there is already properties called constructor in firefox but it doesn t do what you think and is generally best avoided

1514352
subclassing	inherited
the only drawback i see is that you can t inherited the constructor function .so every time you make a new subclassing you must write a constructor that call the base constructor even if your subclassing s constructor does nothing at all

1514353
instances	private
a private instances field may later be used as the backing field for a properties

1514354
updatepanel	gridview
for some reason .when i have an updatepanel around my gridview after you page once it never display the last row

1514354
updatepanel	gridview
i also have a form on the page that allows you to add new rows to the database and consequently the gridview as well as an edit and delete link inside the gridview all within the updatepanel

1514354
updatepanel	gridview
any ideas why the gridview won t display the last recording row after i page only .when it s inside an updatepanel

1514361
any	set
.so set should be clear however admittedly there does not seem to be any consistent rules about with vs enable

1514382
while-loop	for-loop
i know a while-loop can do anything a for-loop can but can a for-loop do anything a while-loop can

1514390
boost	stl
if you used a containers of a proxy types as raw pointers smart pointers shared_ptr weak_ptr or adaptor as boost reference_wrapper then the stl containers will destroy the proxy but not the types

1514394
unique	words
in other words for all nodes the parent_id should be unique

1514397
while-loop	infinite	while-loop	loops
in languages where for is more strict infinite loops would be a case requiring a while-loop

1514405
defined	declare
i thought it was ok for the include eg c works even w o including basic libs while i m sure it would be if i declare the defined this way

1514420
while-loop	for-loop
the while-loop and the classical for-loop are interchangable

1514422
implements	extends
in generics extends means extends or implements

1514425
constructor	private
if you are willing to forgo lazy-loading those default constructor can be private and you don t have to make any other changes to your domain model to use nhibernate

1514440
entity-framework	ado.net
there s regular ado.net linq-to-sql entity-framework

1514458
.when	ready
then .when your ready to create work with asp.net you setup the environment like

1514464
parser-generator	antlr
the only thing that comes to mind is a parser-generator like antlr which has c# sample grammar available

1514472
contains	any
then test the resultset returned to see if it contains any dataset or is it tables

1514485
value	field
and later i enumerate each of the recording and grab the value of the wrkordnbr field

1514503
fwrite	fclose	fwrite	fopen	fclose	fopen
if that is the case you will need to replace that function with fopen fwrite and fclose see also the php manual page

1514505
constructor	object
the object has been initializer by its constructor on the first line

1514510
environment	building
i am working on writing a cross-platform usb libs and using the ddk building environment would make my building-process much more complicated

1514515
contains	any
once loops finishes reader contains nothing which is what you get if you look at any of the items in your list

1514526
any	set
and note that set of recordinging means something like a person s recording along with their addresses phone numbers or any other joined tables

1514526
rollback	commit
commit if everything was successful rollback otherwise

1514526
savepoints	rollback
rollback to the savepoints if there is an error go on if everything is successful

1514531
contains	any
not that it s the final solution but obviously you need to escape any literals string that isn t mean to contains html

1514538
any	set
now .when your stored procedure runs this can do any code-behind the scenes in otherwords it can return any set of data

1514568
any	set
use any character in the current codepages for a named including unicode characters and characters in the extended character set 128â 255 except for the following

1514570
linux	osx
it is possible on the linux and osx filesystems although i am pretty sure that windows does not permit this

1514587
double-quotes	single-quotes
if you want to concatenation several strings without the double-quotes .when using single-quotes

1514590
javascript	dom
the javascript textcontent and nodevalue of the dom text nodes are not entity encode - they just contains the actual entities

1514626
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework and linq-to-entities is quite a different beast - and quite a bit more complex

1514626
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
it really shines .when you have very large .apps with dozens or hundreds of tables in your database a big and possible complex business object-model in your .app and you need to support all sort of backends sql-server oracle postgresql etc.

1514652
subtract	add
i wanted it to be more simple .so i wrote this i realize it would do + for both add and subtract

1514695
bison	yacc
php uses yacc bison just like gcc

1514701
value	field
now in the workflow you can bind the index properties to a properties or field at a higher level like the workflow itself and the value will be stored there instead of in the cloned copy of you activity

1514737
interpreter	runtime
php is compiled down to an intermediate bytecode that is then interpreter by the runtime engine

1514737
perl	ruby
this process of compiling to bytecode and interpreting it at runtime is typical for languages that run on some kind of virtual runtime machine including perl java ruby smalltalk and others

1514738
cos	sin
lat2 asin sin lat1 cos d r + cos lat1 sin d r cos î

1514738
cos	sin
sin lat1 cos d r - as sin and cos will never be larger than 1 the largest result can be 1

1514738
cos	sin
cos lat1 sin d r cos î - same as above

1514755
cherrypy	django
cherrypy vs django which would you use and why

1514756
show	next
page 2 etc but i can t seem to get the paginator to work with my .htaccess rewritten url .so for example threads thread-name show the page fine etc but .when i click on the next page link i just get the same page if i use the normals url such as index.php

1514770
updating	updates
in fact updating a sphinx search index is .so costly that the recommended .solution is to create one index for older archive data and another smaller index for recent data that is more likely to be updates

1514785
cherrypy	django
i would use django because of its large user base and existing modules including the built-in admin interface but i would imaging that cherrypy is more flexible than django

1514797
32-bit	64bit
-default snow leopard ruby 1.8.7 64bit and 32-bit running ruby-on-rails 2.0.2

1514797
32-bit	64bit
i think i ve resigned to the idea of needing ruby 1.8.6 32-bit but it seems to keep conflicting with underlying 64bit systemd c libs in snow leopard

1514798
linked-list	tree	linked-list	arrays	linked-list	heap	data-structures	tree	data-structures	linked-list
i was going through data structure online class and it was mentioned that linked-list and arrays are fundamental data-structures and .so my question is about hashtable heap tree and graphing are those not fundamental data-structures and if not are they derived from any other data structure

1514823
scheme	lisp
in lisp well scheme anyway the only fundamental data structure is a pair

1514830
cherrypy	django
cherrypy is webserver http framework while django supports web application front-to-end it provides object-relational mapper templates session management automagically generator db schema and all crud screens and more

1514846
tga	png
what i want to do is take a folder of png files combine them into a textures atlas and then export the atlas as a tga and the uv coords to xml

1514868
versioning	migrate
that way your clients are sensed to migrate to a newer versioning of .net anyway

1514880
associations	model
i ve also tried to do this with named scoping on the membership model but i can t seem to get has_many to use a scoping in the associations

1514884
while-loop	for-loop
if you can provide an upper bound for the conditional in a while-loop to become true you can convert it to a for-loop

1514896
loading	png
.net supports loading png

1514898
loading	png
loading a png file into a .net bitmap is easy

1514910
primitive	int
i know that if you compare a boxed primitive int with a constants such as

1514912
google-chrome	firefox
also .when i load a javafx .app in firefox or google-chrome it says it can t find java

1514915
textbox	button
i m a noob to vb.net and i was wondering how to make something you types into a textbox on the application types that text into a website textbox and submit whats in the textbox by pressing a button

1514918
dictionary	arrays
is there any way of combining a large 180 000 words dictionary into a portable standalone application maybe using some kind of compression technique to lower the file-size but ultimately to keep to a reasonable load-time which is more favoured than a simple pre-defined literals arrays

1514949
multiplication	bit-shift
will the eclipse compiler automatically convert multiplication by a power of two into a bit-shift or should i do that manually

1514966
.war	jar
it has to be in the classpath of your .war - either a package under web-inf or jar under web-inf .lib

1514982
multiplication	bit-shift
the source code compiler won t replace a multiplication by two with a bit-shift

1514982
multiplication	bit-shift
long answer it won t because it can t know if a bit-shift is faster than a multiplication on the platform the code eventually will be running

1514982
multiplication	bit-shift
.so the question should rather be if a specific viewmodel will replace the multiplication with a bit-shift and it probably will

1514982
subtraction	addition	multiplication	addition	multiplication	bit-shift	multiplication	subtraction
in either case a multiplication with a power of two is replace with a bit-shift but for multiplication with a power of two + - 1 3 5 7 9 15 17 ... hotspot will generator a bit-shift and an addition or a subtraction for intel cpus while generator a multiplication for amd cpus since the amd cpu execute a multiplication much faster than the intel cpu

1514995
subclassing	base-class
i think what you might want to do is defined 2 classes as subclassing of a base-class entity

1515005
spaces	output
that should get you pretty decent output because it will show the spaces

1515032
blender	3dsmax
you can design you map in any .bsp editor 3dsmax blender and store the data you need in xml

1515040
constructor	private
in my experience the only thing that nhibernate required of a domain is virtual properties and methods and a default no-argument constructor which as jeff mentioned can be marked private or protected if need be

1515040
nhibernate-validator	linq-to-nhibernate
nhibernate is my or m of choice and i find the entire nhibernate stack nhibernate nhibernate-validator fluent-nhibernate linq-to-nhibernate to be the most compelling framework for persistent poco domains

1515049
click	mouse
how do i detection collision on line preferably with mouse click

1515053
children	nodes
basically i want to selected a nodes div in which it s children nodes s h1 b h3 contains specified text

1515062
subtract	time
alternatively instead of using a 24-hour clock to express the time use a 1440 minute clock it s easy to subtract one time from another to get a time difference

1515068
selected	button
disk utility has access to this data - .when you selected a drive and press the info button it lists

1515078
subtract	time
if you need higher accuracy rounded to the nearest numbers of minutes rather than simply numbers of minutes simply subtract from minutes_until_9pm or replace time null 60 with time null +30 60 respectively

1515086
boolean	int
inorder to save spaces i am using a single 32-bit int field in a struct to represent several different sets of boolean properties

1515086
32-bit	64bit
a how do i defined flag as a 32-bit int in a portable fashion across 32-bit 64bit platform

1515113
base-class	inherited
per the suggestion in the test class load .doc i have a base-class for each of my test classes to inherited from sg testbase that lives at t .lib sg testbase.pm

1515134
unchecked-exception	checked-exceptions
in general i try to use unchecked-exception because there is generally not a lot you can do about most checked-exceptions and you can still handle unchecked-exception you just don t have to

1515146
32-bit	16-bit
you could always assume that int was at least 16-bit and now a 32-bit assumption is fairly reasonable

1515146
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
we routinely write stuff in php python ruby or lisp because we want a powerful language and the cpu s are .so fast these days that we can get away with an entire interpreter never mind a not-perfect choice of bit-twiddle-word-length ops

1515155
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
the recommended way to do this is to just use a uinavigationcontroller and push uiviewcontroller s onto stack either modal or non-modal

1515156
build-system	cmake
recently i worked with cmake build-system and i have to say that s very handly driving you to split sources from binaries by design and with overall good tools for configuring your compiler s options

1515165
exception-handling	error-handling
se-radio made a podcast episode about that topic of error-handling that explains some philosophy about how to use exception-handling which can be restated as where to absorb them

1515166
any	set
any elements that you create after the statement will not magically get the events that you set on the elementss before

1515192
selection-sort	in-place
since the length of your list will never change selection-sort works in-place use an arrays

1515216
memmove	memcpy
you can do that with memmove not memcpy since the src and dst are points to overlapping memory like .so

1515229
selected	button
you can selected the one that s causing you grief and once again hit the big red button

1515254
web-applications	enterprise	web-applications	security
java ee is composed of web-applications enterprise applications and management security components

1515259
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
if you really need to do it server-side and you don t need to do any batch-file request there are client libs for php python ruby and java

1515271
json	xml
you can also serialization classes to xml or json write custom storage formats use databases etc

1515276
any	set	value	field
you can handle this by allocation 3 bits and requiring that the 3-bit field is one of the value 1 2 or 4 any other value is invalid because of too many or too few bits set

1515284
required	checked
like checked for required libs correct versioning database connect database compatibility etc

1515284
required	checked
should the .app checked itself for the required dependencies

1515297
fullscreen	minimize
where fullscreen is defined as 0 the three icons that are usually at the top of any windows minimize maximize restore and close are not there

1515327
mousedown	mouseup
you don t need both a mousedown and mouseup event handler

1515327
click	mouse
using the x and y properties in mouseeventargs .so you can see where the mouse click are and determine .when you are in the square

1515332
explode	implode
i m not sure why you d serialization it in php either because implode and explode would be more appropriate

1515337
tiff	png
from two images one is a tiff and the other one is a png

1515340
classnotfoundexception	classpath
if a required class is not found on the classpath a classnotfoundexception will be throw

1515342
dbd	dbi
please note that the file notes load.unload is distribute with dbd informix and contains guidelines on how to handle unload operations using perl dbi and dbd informix

1515342
insert-into	prepare
given the column named and the numbers of columns you can create and prepare a suitable insert statement insert-into table col03 col05 col09 value

1515347
average	max	average	min
i would do this in a loops 1000 time and take the max time min time and average time

1515347
subtract	time
then for the body you have the average time for the header .so do the same call with the body now being include and do it again about 1000 time with the same three numbers and you can then subtract the average header from the average body and get a rough estimate

1515354
tiff	png
inorder to send binary-data you will need to use a servlet but you can take advantage of the java advanced imaging api and read in both images then you can combine them and save them as a tiff or png

1515355
webserver	upload
i need to upload a file to my webserver from a c# program

1515365
swing	awt
i m changing a program from awt to swing as proposed on the second chapter of swing s book and the panels just disappears .when i do the change from panels to jpanels

1515370
player	movie
now django per se is a bit ambiguous as a search term it s also the named of a popular guitar player whose life inspired a woody allen movie etc etc nevertheless adding python to the search to remove those other meanings you can see in this graphing how its relative popularity changed in comparison to another classic python web framework zope

1515370
turbogears	pylons
- for being too magical or too monolithic compared to alternatives such as pylons turbogears werkzeug c which are lighter-weight esp

1515370
plugins	add-on
however django s popularity tells us that for most people interested in developing server-side web sites and apps these django design choices are perceived positively django s seen as a very rich and well integrated framework and it does have a lot of add-on and contributed plugins but those are more a consequence than a cause of its ascendancy

1515372
static-initializer	static-block
i would have to research whether or not a static-initializer block is execute before annotations are resolved or not solve the real problem but you should use a static-block for things like this

1515374
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl	python	java
i have a c project which i would like to expose to a bunch of other languages frameworks like python java .net perl php ruby

1515392
hyperlink	external
i didn t need vba to make the hyperlink but i couldn t find an easy way to make external references without vba

1515403
children	nodes
but suppose we didn t care for load nodes and children thereof -- if they had any

1515409
stateless	stateful
ejbs - stateless and stateful session entity and messages driven beans

1515411
jtable	jtree
this should have the added benefit of making your jtree behave the same way that your jtable behaves .when you press a jbutton

1515412
assign	add
but if i assign it a 0 or a for an empty string an exception-handling could be throw since you can t add 3 to a string or a to an int etc.

1515417
implements	abstract
dom abstractions on the issue of the dom you can abstract away from the dom by implements your own event object such as in the case of qevent or even implements your own nodes object like in the case of yahoo.util.element however these usually have .some subtle changes to the standards api .so people are usually just abstracting away from the standards and there is hundreds of cases of libs that abstract away

1515466
data-structures	map
json is simple and python data-structures map well into it

1515490
attributes	properties	getter	setter
to do the same thing with objective-c on the iphone anyway required that you declare a local variables to back the properties write the properties declaration and then use the synthesize directive to have the properties generator for you depending on what properties attributes you specify you might have a properties that wrap getter and setter that take care of reference-counting for you - overall this is a time-saver but the c# way is the clear winner here

1515490
python	java
that s just one example of how monotouch can make your life easier especially if you re used to .net java python other languages that don t required that you get your fingers dirty with memory-mangement unless you want to

1515507
ruby-on-rails	django
one is simply timing django appeared right as the first big wave of ruby-on-rails hype was ramping up and .so it was immediately portrayed as being .sort of python answer to ruby-on-rails

1515507
ruby-on-rails	django
the fact that adrian was at the snakes and rubies meetup in chicago and got to take part in side-by-side talks about ruby-on-rails and django did a lot for that

1515507
ruby-on-rails	django
finally i think there s something to be said for the way django s been marketed which is to say that it really wasn t marketed for a long time or at least not in the sense that say ruby-on-rails was marketed

1515509
signals	sigint
since you re writing a shell you probably want to do this with a few other signals sigint at least

1515510
fflush	stdout
you could add fflush stdout

1515515
fflush	stdout
fflush stdout

1515540
arrays	loops
that would probably be less coding than serializing -- a simple loops through the elements of the arrays -- and would result in a clean database-design rather than some gooey mess

1515544
synchronous	.when
.when you do this synchronous

1515549
zend-framework	codeigniter
or the email classes from the zend-framework which are uncoupled from the rest .so easy to use with codeigniter

1515555
rvm	gem
a problem i had while double-checking that this worked is that rvm had changed my gem home to something the install hadn t expected

1515555
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
create a file at opt local etc macports variants.conf contains +universal and any other variant flag default you want to set up

1515559
arrays	map
after the map call we have the arrays

1515560
compatibility	platform
non explicit enums can cause some platform compatibility issues and also they re not types safe

1515560
compatibility	platform
finally my advice is that if you really care about platform compatibility then use global consts

1515561
json	xml
there are various good serialization deserialization libs that automatically convert javabeans object to from xml and json strings

1515568
arrays	loops
if you want the total memory usage of the arrays you ll have to loops through and add up how much memory each object uses but i don t think that a generics object will give you its size

1515569
enumerator	any
with c and c++ the identifier in an enumerator are scoping like ordinary variables and constants and must therefore be distinct that any other identifier in the same scoping including identifier within other enumerator lists

1515577
constructor	object
what is the slickest most ruby-like way to have a single constructor return an object of the appropriate types

1515579
subtract	time
basically you keep a list of pending upcoming events that is sorted by timestamp and just before you call selected you subtract the current time from the first timestamp in the list and pass in that time-delta as the timeout value to selected

1515579
hashtable	sorted
you can even go further and store the events-list in both a hashtable keyed on the event ids and a linked-list sorted by time stamp and that can give you o 1 time for all operations

1515598
triggers	insert
and dml triggers are for insert updates and delete only

1515602
buffering	streaming
you ve been given a numbers of answers points out buffering of the output streaming

1515602
pointers	stack
for example the segment fault may have been caused by writing through an uninitialized pointers -- that happened to hold a certain value perhaps some small int because a function you d called previously left that value at the right spot on stack that .when the later function was called and used that same value as a pointers it reasonably dependably contains a value the os detected as a place you weren t allowed to write

1515609
arrays	loops
then for .when you are adding or removing listener you could loops through each elements on the arrays with a simple for-loops

1515656
formatting	printing
then after i printing the formatting methods i need to printing the information that was passed in from main to the first object s ctor

1515661
signals	sigint
i ve tried looking for call to signals thinking they implements a custom sigint handler or similar but the only call to signals that i can see handles sigchld

1515670
arguments	default
blocks don t required all their arguments to be provided but methods do unless a default is provided

1515676
any	set
but .when i checked the cookiess that are set i dont see any test cookies at all

1515685
contains	elements
it appears to contains the result from the previous expression not the elements i selected .pager a

1515715
required	checked
therefore foreign key constraint checked are not required during load-time

1515728
lookup	any
generally if someone swaps out the id of a lookup table you are gonna be hosed in some way or another given that it is mapped across your database any how

1515730
folder	dir
i have a scripting all written up in bash x.sh that will move some files and other stuff on input 1 i just need osx to give me the file named .when new files folder are move created into a dir

1515737
environment	building
you ll start by building a performance test environment if you don t have one

1515739
hide	show
the code below will show hide a div onclientclick

1515748
mstest	nunit
most frameworks mstest nunit etc. allow you to defined setup and teardown methods that are guaranteed to run before and after the test

1515760
hide	show
basically just use the hide and .show to show hide the appropriate div at the right time

1515763
show	next
cookies set with setcookie don t show up until the next page load

1515771
required	checked
checked for required runtime environment provides

1515771
.when	ready
start .when the module gets ready for regular operation

1515771
required	checked
should the .app checked itself for the required dependencies

1515786
any	set
.so once you ve precomputed the intermediate distance for a fixed set of interior cities you need to do 12 two points shortest-path problems for any pair of start and endpoints

1515795
repository	entity
and according and there it is said that we create a repository interface for each entity and after that we create a repositoryfactory that is going to give instances declare as interfaces of repositories

1515811
primitive	int
as you say for any comparison between a wrapper types int long etc and a numeric types int long etc the wrapper types value is unboxed and the test is applied to the primitive value involved

1515821
repository	entity
most people prefer a repository per entity because it lets them vary domain service in a more granular way

1515848
instances	self
you re defining an instances methods on the eigenclass and what is self in an instances methods

1515857
.when	ready
.when we do upgrade i will most likely continue to use the standards old fashioned dialog boxes until our customers are ready for a change

1515883
contains	elements
what does the the elements with named something contains as a value

1515899
python	c++
just as the title asks does c++ have the equivalent of python setitem and getitem for classes

1515900
having	union
there is nothing wrong with performing a union unless you are really talking about joining on releated entities those having foreign key relationships

1515900
union-all	union
but you might want to use a union-all rather than just union as union will perform a sort to remove duplicates entries

1515910
16-bit	8bit
as dominic says character encoding is the problem - however if you can either really ensure that you ll only deal with 8bit chars unlikely but possible or assume 16-bit chars and limit yourself to half the available spaces 4096 chars then you could attempt this

1515913
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
the viewwillappear viewdidappear and viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear messages are the only messages you need to manually send to the child view controllers

1515913
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
in addition .when you add the child view controllers s view you should send the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages if the parent s view.window is non-nil

1515920
children	nodes	contains	any
the following expression gives a nodes div in which any children nodess not just h1 b h3 contains specified text not the div itself

managed-code	native-code
i want to be able to defined and understand the basic of terms like compiler interpreter native-code managed-code virtual-machine and .so on

1515942
contains	elements	floating	clearfix
in my opinion using this is a bad idea and it s better to use a clearfix on the wrapping div contains the floating elements

1515947
python	java
i d like to know good strategies for deploying a domain-specific-language which must run under at least 2 languages java c# and probably more python and possibly javascript

1515948
user-interface	drawing
ps generator is not designer generator - generator user-interface semi-automatically no drawing is needed

1515954
compatibility	platform
among other things this gives some security advantages and cross platform compatibility

1515963
scheme	prolog
also it gives a good introduction into scheme prolog and programming paradigms logic functional imperative object oriented

1515964
python	java
you d be best off writing the libs in c or some language like rpython which will generator c-code and then using swig or similar to generator the language specific binding for c# java python etc

1515976
linux	unix
it means it uses cocoa on macosx and gtk on unix linux and win32 wtl on windows

1515984
substitution	replace	subclassing	nsobject	subclassing	superclass
i thought all object were subclassing of nsobject and though the cast would be made implicit superclass substitution a superclass can always be replace by any child class of it

1515988
linux	unix
gtk on unix linux and win32 wtl on

1515999
erlang	ocaml
you can look to my existing configuration based on the code from emacswiki with some extensions - function to handle conversion from text to chars and example of it use for erlang mode - you can change it for ocaml mode also

1516005
python	lua	python	java
examples are python java and lua

1516018
minimum	max
which numbers cast is a registry dword in vb based on its minimum and max value

1516026
16-bit	x86
an x86 is a double words where a words is understood to be 16-bit but i think there s a slight problem with vb not supporting unsigned value

1516072
export	csv
export it into csv format and then open it through excel...short and nice

1516074
shell	bash
i am working on bash shell

1516076
versioning	upgrade
new versioning upgrade or install alongside older versioninging

1516082
selected	cell
basically what i want to achieve is the merging of selected cell effect say for example 1 text for column 1 2 another text for column 3 4 etc.

1516084
contains	set
.so if you want your shell to have a variables contains a list of directory to search for executable you need to set it

1516117
shopping-cart	cart
t want to count the items in the shopping-cart - i want to count the numbers of occurances of _session cart

1516119
callback	methods
my idea is to make each callback be added to the threadpool effectivley having each methods that registered the event handled by the threadpool

1516127
logout	login
haven t looked into jmeter but we have a couple of step that must be done in the test login make .some stuff and logout that we want to measure and we allready had a testflow in rpt that we use .so it would be nice to reuse it even if it is not what rpt are ment for

1516140
versioning	upgrade
i m about to upgrade a svn server from versioning 1.5.5 to 1.6.5 - all is fine with the actual upgrade but i m a little confused about upgrading the actual repositories

1516140
svnadmin	dump
i ve read in a few places here here that it s better to dump and reload the repositories rather than using svnadmin upgrade

1516152
stdin	pipe
it closes the stdin pipe

1516152
stdin	pipe
if read stdin returns 0 it means stdin closed which means ctrl + d was hit assuming there is a keyboard at the other end of the pipe

1516165
double	int
implicit-conversion other than inherited such as int to double are not performed and will throw an exception-handling

1516172
implements	extends
my problem question is this currently mythread is extends thread because i mark it as daemons and i read about how it s more prefferable to implements runnable and to use executor

1516172
implements	extends
.so what i wanted to ask is if mythread will implements runnable instead of extends thread and of course will be rename and i ll use newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor how what or maybe where do i mark .something as daemons

1516183
environment	execution
apparently your execution environment ignore stderr which is a bad idea

1516204
any	set
have there been any hints set in other microsoft programs that might indicate the outcome

1516217
defined	declare
it required some more typing though especially if one declare and defined the function methods at different places and if i don t bother my interface is pretty soon jumbled

1516238
contextmenu	icons
i m aware that the notifyicons class i m using to get the icons in the system-tray has a contextmenu properties

1516250
accessor	ivar
it is also best to use accessor properties .when you want to ensure properties memory-management behavior which is to say always .when setting an ivar to use the setter or dot notation and depending on which memory-management pattern you follow to always use accessor properties .when getting an ivar

1516250
accessor	ivar
the last and best reason to always use accessor properties is that it makes one fewer assumption for each properties that there is an underlying ivar for that properties and that is has the same named i guess that s two assumptions

1516250
accessor	ivar
perhaps in future you will want to replace an ivar with a derived accessor

1516255
derived-class	base-class
in other words if you use a pointers to the base-class to iterate over an arrays of the derived-class you ll get wrong results if the derived-class has a bigger size than the base-class because it will iterate in step of sizeof base-class bytes

1516269
datagridview	databound
if the datagridview is databound you shouldn t directly modify the content of the cell

1516278
required	checked
it doesn t required changing the actual code we all are used to having assert checked in algorithms and learned to mentally skip over them if we want to understand the actual algorithms it might produce better error messages and it will carry over to c++1x better which is going to have a static_assert completely with class designer-provided error messages built-in into the language

1516292
click	mouse
one must be able to find the points at which the mouse was click

1516292
paintcomponent	draw
firstly as a jpanels does not have a way of display a background-image by default there must be a way to hold an image in the jpanels and then draw that on the panels itself which can be performed via the paintcomponent methods

1516292
click	mouse
finding the points at which the mouse was click

1516292
click	mouse
secondly inorder to retrieve the points at which the mouse was click one could assign a mouselistener to the mypanel

click	mouse
process that needs to be performed .when the mouse is click can be include in the mouseclick methods

1516292
click	mouse
thirdly inorder to find one points at which the mouse was click one can obtain it from the mouseevent object that was passed in from the mouseclick methods

1516292

if additional process needs to be performed .when the mouse is click additional code can be added to the mouseclick methods

1516292
swing	awt
painting in awt and swing

1516293
paintcomponent	draw
this methods will be invoked every time there is a need to redraw the panels .so you need to store your points in an arrays and then read and draw each of them in your paintcomponent

1516318
arrays	loops
the only thing you can do to treat the arrays content as if it was all base classes is to iterate over the arrays using a and cast this-pointer to within loops

1516350
directory	folder
by default iis creates log files in the system32 logfile directory of your windows folder

1516356
value	field
the primary key field is an encode string but an unencode value has been provided

1516356
value	field
if you want to set an unencoded value on this field you can either change its types to be an unencoded string remove the gae.encoded-pk extension change its types to be a com.google.appengine.api.datastore.key and then set the key s named field or create a separate string field for the named component of your primary key and add the gae.pk-named extension

1516364
concat	where
insert-into special_users username selected concat joe selected count 0 from special_users where username like joe

1516414
signals	sigint
if you press ctrl-d then the terminal drivers will send a sigint to the signals handler of the program

1516429
value	field
you could create would be the sum of the value returned by hashcode on all of your field

1516430
salt	md5
note use a random salt inside the md5 or sha1 if you prefer .so it cant easily be reverse-engineered

1516438
any	set
but from the description of the paint stages i still would rather use the beforeitempaint event and set the customdraw variables parameter to true to skip any default painting

1516441
motorola	sony
on various mobile phone developer sites like nokia sony ericsson motorola etc.

1516441
ubuntu	linux

have you considered using a php asp.net-mvc framework such as codeigniter cakephp kohana etc

1516486
boolean	int
i have also read that enums are stored as small int - which as i understand it is not a problem with the boolean tests as these would be peroformed starting at the right most bits

1516492
installation	building
it s a late answer but you have to let passenger-install-nginx-module building your nginx installation

1516493
pascal	delphi
but i learn programming and after structured programming with pascal language i m beginning to learn about oop with delphi

1516493
protected	public
i understand what is public declaration interface approachable by the outside but i don t see what s the difference between private and protected declarations

1516495
constructor	object
you will need to export a function from the dll that call on to the constructor and returns the new object

1516504
any	set
if the android-emulator is not able to connect to the internet or any existing network from the get-go you should skim through the documentation provided on the virtualbox site as well as the helpful howtos and tutorials that explain how to set up different kinds of networking on virtualbox

1516507

see iso 3166-1 alpha-2 country-codes

1516535
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you re coming from the asp.net webforms world then the first thing to unlearn would be the statefulness and caching .when you re dealing with asp.net-mvc

1516551
protected	public
the difference between private protected and public is pretty straightforward

1516555
associations	model
the only thing i want is to have my query results mapped to initializer model and their associations

1516556
google-chrome	firefox
using clientx and clienty alone are not sufficient if the browser windows is scrolled verified in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 3.0

1516562
any	set
but you don t need to alter any flash content to set wmode since it is done in the html or via swfobject or other scripting that insert the flash object elements .so if you have control over the scriptinging which output flash elementss that you mention you can take care of the wmode setting there

1516601
linked-list	hashmap
.when looking up a value the hashmap selected the bucket and then searches for the individual elements by a linear search of the linked-list using equals

joomla	drupal
but drupal has no generator header like joomla or others

1516624

i would just put toload and its children in index.html and set them display none in your stylesheet then attach the jquery show and hide functions to an onclientclick handler to make things appear or disappear

1516627
g++	gcc
g++ is a drivers binary like gcc but with a few special options set for compiling c++

1516627
g++	gcc
notably in my experience g++ will link libstdc++ by default while gcc won t

1516639
double	int
briefly they are int + int uint + uint long + long ulong + ulong float + float double + double decimal + decimal enum-and-underlying types delegation combinations string + string string + object and object + string

1516656
margins	padding
labels is an inline elements margins padding would only work .when you make it a block inline-block block or float

1516658
solaris	linux
what happens on linux is different from what happens on solaris for example

1516658
g++	gcc
the easy part because it is not platform-specific is the separation of gcc and g++

g++	gcc
g++ is the gnu c++ compiler from the gcc

1516666
show	next
next time .when you .post a question checked the preview to see if it s readable and format code with 4 spaces in-front .so it s actually show and syntax highlight

which allows me to popup on the click of .mypop which is just a temp input button in my list which is working

1516678
value	field
you better make sure that your separator cannot occur in the field tostring value otherwise you might get key collision

1516681
linux	unix
if you use a unix os like linux or mac os x you can go to the command-line and use the line

1516687

the goal is to allow the user to input value into several form field and use jquery to total them up on the bottom in a div

1516690
32-bit	64bit
i already have a nice makefile that can building the code for both 32-bit or 64bit linux using different targets

1516690

this means iterate through the arrays and for each time in with key and value execute the body of the foreach loops

1516767
for-loop	arrays	nested-loops	for-loop	nested-loops	arrays
the code you ve given then just has multiple nested-loops .so in the outermost for-loop is itself an as.sociativity arrays which is then looped through and the value stored in that as.sociativity arrays are al.so arrayss

1516780
sql-server	mysql
if you are using sql-server or mysql versioning 5 you should turn the long sql statement into a stored procedure

1516786
attributes	properties
the difference between attributes and properties can be important in specific situations

1516786
attributes	properties
before jquery 1.6 the attr methods sometimes took properties value into account .when retrieving some attributes which could cause inconsistent behavior

1516786
attributes	properties
as of jquery 1.6 the .prop methods provides a way to explicit retrieve properties value while attr retrieves attributes

1516786
attributes	properties
these do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties

1516791
numeric	zero
any non numeric or blank value will be disregarded in the calculation they ll be given a value of zero and hence not affect the sum

but depending on the font-size height i get a smaller working windows

1516852
python	php
to rendering a dynamic html page i can format the page in server-side code php python and use ajax to fetch the formatted page and rendering it directly more logic on server-side less on client-side

1516852
json	xml
i can also use ajax to fetch the data not formatted json and use client-side scripting to format the page and rendering it with more process the server gets the data from a db or other source and returns it to the client with json or xml

1516858
value	field
problem is duplicates key can be created if the delimiter appears in the field value

1516876
ref	out
someone asked me the other day .when they should use the parameter keyword out instead of ref

1516876
ref	out
while i i think understand the difference between the ref and out keyword that has been asked before and the best explanation seems to be that ref in and out what are some hypothetical or code examples where i should always use out and not ref

1516876
ref	out
since ref is more general why do you ever want to use out

1516881
ref	out
also ref and out are not just for value-type

1516883
perl	ruby	perl	tcl	python	ruby	python	tcl	python	perl
it has code examples in tcl python ruby and perl

1516884
selected	button
on each button click i am updating the selected recording in the database

1516885
ref	out
out is more constraint versioning of ref

1516885
ref	out
also an value assign to an out parameter is ignore whereas ref required them to be assign

1516890
ref	out
you should use out unless you need ref

1516898
atoi	atof
i think you have to take the returned cstring then convert it into a numbers using atoi or atof depending on the types

1516901
value	field
you say problem is duplicates key can be created if the delimiter appears in the field value

1516904
hide	show
it hide and then show again

1516904
gentoo	linux
browser firefox 3.5.3 under linux gentoo

1516914
fadeout	fadein

1516918
ref	out
you re correct in that semantics ref provides both in and out functionality whereas out only provides out functionality

1516918
ref	out
out and ref parameters are marshalling differently .when dealing with interop code

1516926
activerecord	datamapper
activerecord and datamapper have a find_by_sql methods that helps you more but doesn t initializer all model at least on activerecord if i m not mistaken that is

1516928
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiview	contains	set
nearly all the uinavigationcontroller examples out there show the use of initwithnibname bundle to load a nib contains not an entire uiviewcontroller or subclassing but just a uiview with the nib s file s owner class properties set to uiviewcontroller or the appropriate subclassing and its view outlet pointed at the uiview

1516929
solaris	aix
offering it on aix solaris tru64 and hp-ux

1516991
gnome	kde
the build-system is widely varied and will probably be dictated by your preferences between gnome kde or the ever-present command-line

1516991
automake	gnu
if you end up at the command-line then learn gnu make and pick up a copy of gnu autoconf automake and libtool

1517006
ref	out
just to clarify on op s comment that the use on ref and out is a reference to a value-type or struct declare outside the methods which has already been established in incorrect

1517021

you can use it for production testing and development environment if you need to connect to another db at the same time you can double the configuration of database like

1517136
shell	bash
this is useful as a lot of unix boxes use bash as default shell and that has emacs key-bindings m-f and m-b that let you skip words

1517138
ubuntu	linux
i m using the netbeans ide for my project on ubuntu linux

1517147
associations	model
i have a page flow allowing the user to choose an object player to add to a has_many player associations in another model

1517154
foundation	cocoa	cocoa	uikit
this is how cocoa foundation uikit coredata etc all behave

1517158
selected	button
my solution would be to have the selected state of the button be in a separate uiimageview directly below the button in the exact same location

1517183
terminal	prompt
i don t know the term definition to what i m doing but i m prompt cmd from java to the terminal

1517188
msbuild-task	msbuild
create a separate msbuild project referencing the .sln or .csproj as an msbuild-task

1517194
gksudo	sudo
gksudo is the gtk versioning of sudo

1517211
subclassing	nsobject
subclassing nsobject is no problem but subclassing nsoperation nsoperationqueue and nsthread is an issue for example

1517216
selected	button
the issue that i m having is that i have my start page then the user can selected a button from there to open a settings page modal view

1517229
margins	padding
i m not sure how padding margins s will affect this but if you use display inline

1517229
margins	padding
with margins and padding set to zero it should be okay

1517248
attributes	properties
it s simple take the named attributes of the param tag and set the same properties of the activex control with the value of the value attributes

1517250
jqmodal	jquery
i ve tried jqmodal and jquery user-interface but haven t managed to find any good samples or tutorials yet

1517334
any	set
any examples i ve seen have the value set as the full brush but i want to use an existing resource and i don t know how to write it

1517335
getter	setter
in c# you won t see many performance issues around trivial properties getter and setter like this

1517339
contains	elements
the main page that holds the tabs throw an error .when loaded because there is javascript that refers to elements that haven t loaded yet those elements are in the external file that contains the code that relies on the plugins

1517339
external	embed
if i embed the javascript that triggers the plugins functionality into the external file it is outside of the document-ready function from the main page and therefore isn t usable

1517339
javascript	dom
basically i am looking for a technique that allows me to ajax load an external html file into the dom while not crapping out the main page itself because javascript that is already there is expecting html which is not yet there

1517361
data-structures	tree
balanced tree data-structures allow for faster searching of results see

1517363
mergesort	timsort
if you prefer reading java code than c code you could look at joshua bloch s implementation of timsort in and for java joshua s also the guy who implements in 1997 the modified mergesort that s still used in java and one can hope that java will eventually switching to his recent ports of timsort

1517373
constructor	object
here staticresource mybrush is in fact creating an object of types staticresourceextension passing mybrush as the only arguments of its constructor which itself sets the resourcekey properties of the object

1517389
any	set
this is caused by the lack of any means to query or set file-permissions in the current java runtime

1517397
windows-xp	windows
but not on windows 7 rather on a virtual-machine running windows-xp hosted on windows 7

1517430
implements	extends
but if i m extends a controllers and i call for example listaction on the page controllers but this action is implements in content_indexcontrollers it still looks for the listview scripting in the page controllerss scriptinging directory

1517431
linux	unix
virtual desktops are very common in unix linux and once you get accustomed to using them they become an essential part of a productive workflow.

1517440
webforms	asp.net
if you are good at writing webforms applications you have lots of asp.net server controls already at your disposal and you don t need a lot of finesse read code-behind in your application then webforms is probably a better choice

1517440
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but there is a learning curve to asp.net-mvc .so if you are averse to learning new things i would stick with webforms

1517442
web-services	api
i am looking for a way to search for email using the exchange web-services operations -- ms api to their own hosted exchange solution

1517444
text-editor	editor
but even notepad++ or any other text-editor will enough to get you started since you don t need to compile your code just have a good editor

1517450
execute	declare
.when you declare the dialog options you can specify button with named and a function they execute

1517450
value	field
to get the named and value of your field then validation them and then .post myfield to your controllers with a

1517456
put	get
the numbers are written to the folder however there is no spaces between them .so .when i put it in the decode it will not decode is there anyway for me to get a spaces between them

1517458
emacs	vim
you can also use either vim or emacs for python development

1517470
emacs	vim	notepad++	emacs	notepad++	vim
that being said i recommend learning python using a basic approach - use a text-editor like notepad++ vim or emacs to learn the basic

1517471
selected	checkbox
i would like to know how i can add an option checkbox for users to selected to have a desktop shortcut created on the finish page the last screens of the install in addition to the run xxxx option that s already there

1517473
expression-blend	silverlight
ran the project in blend dragged the dll files into c program files expression-blend 3 libs silverlight v3.0 and

1517473
expression-blend	wpf
c program files expression-blend 3 libs wpf v3.5

1517488
chdir	cmd
see the gnu-screen chdir cmd

1517488
any	set
and your new windows along with any future created windowss will be in the set directory

1517488
chdir	cmd
screens chdir cmd

1517488
chdir	cmd
the second line send the currentdir to the chdir cmd and then creates a new screens windows

1517507
notepad++	textpad
visual-studio and most other editor like notepad++ and textpad doesn t handle long line well

1517532
imageview	textview
- consists of imageview textview

1517537
cos	sin
x r cos long sin lat

1517545
scheme	lisp
in a language such as lisp or scheme using s-expression to represent the program text probably will reduce the amount of work for the parsing

1517545
python	java
java python c# delphi all have quite simple grammars

1517547
value	field
disallow the value of this field

1517562
required	checked
of course such an approach would required you to checked a specific file folder exists prior to the loading that portion of your catalog

1517562
required	checked
also you would required a thread to constantly listen for usb events and then perform the neccessary checked if any usb device has been connect disconnect and perform the neccessary checked on the filesystems again

1517564
http	ssl
the transport security can be enabled using ssl if you are using http for your service

1517564
web-services	webserver
it is generally easiest to enable this at the webserver level you don t mention that you are doing any special hosting of web-services

1517564
log4net	nlog
before you spend too much time building any logging code it is worth looking at nlog log4net and the enterprise libs logging block

1517564
json	xml
whether to use rest json xml soap etc really depends on your audience

1517564
python	ruby
are they going to be using languages like ruby and python to call your service or will they be using .net

1517564
json	xml
generally json is not a panacea and xml is not always the worst option

1517564
json	xml
xml is arguably more flexible than json to represent your data

1517567
notepad++	scite
i find scite to be a good alternative to notepad++

1517570
value	field
why don t you just make sure you use a separator which does not occur in your handfull of field value

1517571
ruby-on-rails	grails
grails is directly analogous to ruby-on-rails but running with groovy

1517571
groovy	java
.so you can make use of java libs that you already have or are available since they re compiled to bytecode and thus run on a jvm plus the power of the jvm for garbage-collection speed via jit compilation etc. and the conciseness of groovy

1517571
groovy	java
the learning curve for a java programmer to pick up groovy is supposed to be pretty small thus leveraging off the huge numbers of available java programmers

1517571
ruby-on-rails	grails
grails like ruby-on-rails promise a more dynamic and imperative development-environment than the standards development mechanisms whether that s true in practise i can t advise

1517584
emacs	vim
for dynamically typed languages power editor like vim and emacs make excellent ides

1517584
emacs	vim
you can use gui tools to make your layout and still use vim emacs for development

1517585
static-typing	typechecking
static-typing .when typechecking is

1517585
haskell	perl	haskell	fortran	haskell	pascal	fortran	pascal	fortran	perl

ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
types php prolog python ruby

1517585
smalltalk	tcl
smalltalk and tcl

1517589
click	mouse
the previous programmer who did everything in as2 had essentially embedded a two and half minute flv on the time main time line and at certain frame points would add in clips for interactivity with basic mouse click functionality that would triggers those clips to play other clips with some flash elements and some video elements

1517596
pointers	stack
but actually i don t know the microsoft web-services stack well enough to provide valuable pointers

1517609
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
it gives you all you need and nothing more syntax-highlighting code-folding auto indentation and optional plugins to integrated a python shell right into the editing windows

1517623
32-bit	64bit
.so .when i do use ie i use 64bit versioning but i am under the understanding if the site or .something like that does not support 64bit it goes to 32-bit

1517639
nsapplication	nsmenu
- nsmenu applicationdockmenu nsapplication sender

1517667
value	field
the remarks of wyatt barnett though attracting attention from unwanted observers holds key field up for view and the ipv4 nonsense show the worth and value of wyatt s snarkle

1517670
scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala	kotlin	scala
other languages offer some form of types-inference the capability of the types systemd to deduce the types of a variables ocaml haskell scala kotlin

1517670
value	field
a language is dynamically typesd if the types is associated with runtime value and not named variables field etc

1517670
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
example perl ruby python

1517690
ruby-on-rails	grails
grails previously known as groovy on grails is a programming framework based on groovy and inspired by ruby-on-rails there are difference but there are lots of similarities too

1517690
ruby-on-rails	grails
like ruby-on-rails grails promotes coding by conventions development best practices and is meant to be highly productive

1517690
groovy	java
why would one want to use groovy on grails .when we have standards programming languages like c++ java j2ee and .net c#

1517700
direct2d	direct3d
if you don t plan on using wpf which might be overkill if you only intend to do image-processing starts using technologies like direct3d opengl or the recent direct2d to apply with ease pixels shader on a rendering target

1517704
response	timeout
a few people points your server at never-ending response could carry out a trivial resource-exhaustion attack even if your http client enforces a timeout

1517727
versioning	upgrade
then it will be up to you if you want to upgrade project to .net 3.5 versioning but if no - fine vs 2008 has .net 2.0 support as well

1517775
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517785
show	next
just remember you have to descend upwards because you are in an anchor that is a child of the li then the next sibling is the li that you want to show

1517789
value	field
anyway if that happens you ll probably get a silent failure where it sets the field or properties value on a local copy which is then immediately discarded

1517805
constructor	object
if i wanted to differentiate between these show methods based on the object a1 and a2 as well as based on class instances expression calling show directly on constructor and did not know which constructor was used especially for the object a1 and a2 how do i find that out--say reflectively

1517819
value	field
you need to be careful of repeat calendar entries as these will have start and end datetime field value which map to the first entry of the series

1517824
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like insertion-sort merge sort bubble-sort etc

1517824
quicksort	heapsort
and some sorting algorithms are not like heapsort quicksort etc

1517825
constructor	object
it is not possible to determine by reflection which constructor was used to initializer an object

1517827
constructor	object
it shouldn t matter how you created an object because a constructor may not even have been used at all say in serialization it should only matter that all it s properties public or not are set appropriately to reflect the state it needs to be in

1517829
subclassing	base-class
or two different subclassing of a common base-class in that way each class could have it s own distinct implementation of the show methods

1517829
data-members	constructor
alternatively have a data-members inside a perhaps a boolean or the string whose value is set differently by each constructor

1517834
arrays	loops
ganesh m - if the key does not exist in the arrays then your function will be stuck inside of a never ending loops

1517834
while-loop	arrays
perhaps i should choose an arrays with a size of power of 2 and use a simple while-loop

1517841
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
you could write a command-line php scripting that fork to accomplish this though you might be better off looking into writing such a beast in language that supports threading such as ruby or python

1517882
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
as you surmise tools such as ant and scons etc etc can help here but inevitably unless you re lucky enough to get away with very simple and straightforward process you ll find yourself enriching them with ad-hoc scripting c some powerful and flexible scripting-language such as perl python ruby c will help

1517888
sqldatasource	gridview
the gridview control in asp.net provides updating capabilities .when assign a sqldatasource control to the gridview s datasource however .when programmatically assign a code level sqldatasource to datasource the built-in updating capabilities go away and you are forced to roll your own

1517888
sqldatasource	gridview
why can the gridview still not take advantage of the sqldatasource updatecommand

1517907
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517907
google-chrome	safari
nope it s only in webkit safari google-chrome and also via gears

1517907
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is supported by firefox 3.5 ie8 and safari but not google-chrome

1517930
quicksort	heapsort
if you don t need stability you can use a fast memory-sipping algorithm from a libs like heapsort or quicksort and forget about it

1517944
any	set
why would you want to set any of these systemd properties

1517973
revision	svn
i commit my application to svn in which repository is stored in my external harddisk in one pc it commit successfully to be revision 9

1517976
synchronous	.when
i see two tests one to test that an asychronous action is launchd which can be done with a mock and the second to test that the action that is run asychronously performs correctly .when run and you can do the latter synchronous

1517993
variables	boolean
you need to set a variables to a boolean use an if-statement and if it was entered just output anything otherwise don t

1518002
constructor	private
the goal i want to checked the incoming bool usewebserviceconnection as you see below and set the private field connection-string before passing it to the base constructor based on usewebserviceconnection to set the connection-string

1518007
local-storage	web-storage
you may be thinking of local-storage and session-storage which are part of the w3c web-storage api

1518020
triggers	insert
i think you will be best off explicit storing the locked unlocked state for the invoices in the invoices table and then apply triggers on insert and delete and updates though you don t actually say you want the fees on the invoices frozen to prevent modifications if the invoices is in the locked state

1518022
python	java
the priority order is an important indication but it s not entirey rigid if the top task required extensive work in java and the second one required it in python i may well pick the second one as my relative productivity will be enormously higher that way -- and vice versa for a team member who s a java guru etc etc

1518059
instances	private	getter	setter
however you could provide a way of constructing a c instances from a b -- either by having the c copy the properties from the b or by having the c store the b as a private member and delegation properties getter and setter to the contains b

1518087
python	ruby
sure there will be solution for technology you re using in server side ruby python asp

1518121
scala	java
methods that would have a void return-type in java have a return-type of unit in scala

1518124
println	output
you then pass the output of f1 which is to another call to println

1518124
scala	java
the empty parentheses have the types unit in scala which is equivalent to void in java

1518126
python	php
i m new to python i want to learn it not just for web-projects but as a substitute to php for scripting small helpers

1518134
lexer	lex
for example theres a hand written lexer on this website before the flex generator lex

1518136
value	field
i proofed that by adding and extra field that does changes the value after the first time it has one

1518148
contains	elements
you d need to do this for each elements which contains character data

1518171
arrays	map
don t forget it s also much faster to get to one specific item with a map if you have the key than it is from an arrays unless you have an index but a key will always get you the right value whereas having an index may not work if new elements are insert or older ones removed

1518176
dictionary	map
more generally you use a map implementation .when you need to efficiently retrieve items by lookup retrieving something based on the key - such as dictionary caching repositories etc

1518176
arrays	map
in other words you use map s as an indexing data structure and you use list s as you would usually use arrays

1518194
webserver	upload
question how to upload an image from my webserver to facebook via facebook api

1518227
positioning	fluid
that being said there are some people who still have the wrong frame of mind in css you should avoid layout that are completely reliant upon absolute positioning and pixels perfect abuse instead rely on fluid em-based layout .when you can as these are more adaptable to different screens resolutions and environment

1518272
nsdata	nsurl
init the vc subclassing with an nsurl and then downloading the contents of the nsurl into an nsdata object

1518272
uiimage	nsdata
use the nsdata object to create a new uiimage

1518278
copy-constructor	temporary
in the above example returnb is returning a temporary according to the c++ syntax rules .so the compiler must see a copy-constructor

1518278
copy-constructor	constructor
which just reinforces and confirm the need for a copy-constructor taking a reference to const .when temporaries are to be copy-paste for construction irrespective of whether or not the constructor is actually used

1518322
firefox	opera	font-size	display
i found my page text display in opera and firefox with different font-size

1518322
firefox	opera
it looks fine it firefox but opera 9.64 display it large size

1518326
constructor	object
you can read the text from the file and split the string to an arrays and then use the overloaded constructor for fonts class to create the new fonts object

1518332
exception-handling	error-handling
how do i separate out exception-handling error-handling from business-logic

1518338
implements	extends
i have implements a custom listview by extends linearlayout for every row

1518341
constructor	object
is that constructor does memory allocation and all the stuffs required to create an object

1518353
constructor	object
the compiler will implicit defined a a .when the compiler uses this constructor to create an object of types a

1518353
data-members	constructor	defined	declare
the compiler first implicit defined the implicit declare constructor of the base classes and non-static data-members of a class a before defining the implicit declare constructor of a

1518353
arguments	default
if default value are supplied the trailing arguments can be omitted in the expression list of the constructor

1518353
arguments	default
note that if a constructor has any arguments that do not have default value it is not a default-constructor

1518362
nested-loops	loops
basically the idea is to ensure that all loops and nested-loops are covered during execution

1518368
web-applications	security
most work for application security these days is web-applications

1518368
security	owasp
some things to google phrack owasp and the bible of our industry the art of software security

1518369
build-server	teamcity
it is supported in eclipse and jetbrains idea support and also teamcity build-server

1518376
value	field
if you insert a 0 value into an auto-incrementing field in mysql the value will actually become the next available value in the sequences .so a table with auto-incrementing field set to 10 will insert at 11 and not 0

1518384
data-members	constructor
invoke the default-constructor for each of the class s data-members for each data-members that has a constructor at all which means not primitive-types .

1518393
python	ruby
having just found out that you can use ruby or python inside a silverlight application

1518393
python	ruby
i know that the ruby engine inside the silverlight application is trimmed down just as the .net clr is .so i would like to know that even without all the functionality of a full ruby or python engine

1518396
object-reference	instances
i got an error that the object-reference is not set to the instances of an object .when i insert value through form

1518404
panels	grid
you may also not see them in the query panels because text is truncated results to text mode or you are in results to grid mode

1518407
buffering	streaming
its buffering to the underlying streaming

1518444
delphi	vb.net
language c# vb.net delphi

1518460
oracle	mysql
in mysql and oracle

1518466
internet-explorer	firefox
not working on both internet-explorer and firefox

1518474
visitor-pattern	visitor
hey there i have read the few post here on .when how to use the visitor-pattern and some articles chapters on it and it makes sense if you are traversal an ast and it is highly structured and you want to encapsulate the logic into a separate visitor object etc

1518494
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
rather than simulate the request to the underlying stuff json supplier and since its only once a day i am happy to simply develop a bookmarklet to grab the data - preferably as a xml or csv file

1518511
google-chrome	firefox	arguments	undefined
now in ie8 and google-chrome it finds the passed arguments as htmldiv and works fine but in firefox it give an error cc223423432 is undefined

1518537
arrays	loops
another solution that is more clean is to store them in an arrays and loops through them

1518555
derived-class	base-class
i m getting a pointers to a base-class which is actually a pointers to some derived-class

1518556
any	set
i ended up using the aroundinvoke interceptor methods that way you can catch any exception-handling on the server side and extraction whatever info you want to and wrap it to throw your own exception-handling and set the ejbcontext to rollback the transactional

1518569
dictionary	arrays
json framework supports converting arrays dictionary strings numbers and boolean

1518572
instances	private
i always thought that .when calling private function even .when there are more instances of the same class i dont need to use this keyword because its considered as local call also

1518576
contains	set
i don t know why the div contains some padding-bottom even i set padding 0

1518577
pure-virtual	subclassing
if present the virtual function is known as a pure-virtual function and enforces each subclassing of base to implements the function

1518594
iaas	paas
also the question is not for any specific kind of application in fact the intention is to know which types of applications domains can fit into which of the cloud slab -saas paas iaas

1518594
python	java
can you take any existing java or python application and ports it to gae

1518601
jquery	.post
.post with jquery and ajax

1518602
quirks-mode	doctype
it s entirely possible that what you think is bottom padding on the div is actually caused by another styles rules - for example padding on the body elements which is possible if you enable disable browser quirks-mode playing with the doctype tends to have that effect

1518615
value	field
a situation where you would need it would be if you have a methods for example your constructor that takes parameters of the same named than field of your class and you want to assign the value of these parameters to the field eg

1518641
json	xml	web-applications	security
i believe with enough dedication most web-applications can be designed this way thus eroding many of the server logic vs client logic difference such as security expandability raised in your question because in both cases the request is routed to the same controllers of which the business-logic is all the same until the last mile where json xml instead of the full page html is returned for those xmlhttprequest

1518642
filtering	grouping
depending on how you mean filtering you could either use distinct or maybe grouping by both are used to remove or grouping duplicates entries

1518664
selected	button
and .when i selected one of these item and hit the button it should send me the request with these attributes

1518686
autoit	basic
or using the autoit automation language basic like

1518701
uitableview	uiview
i think your problem is in your animation you ve specified uiview instead of uitableview

1518701
uitableview	uiview
i was unable to duplicates your problem using either uiview or uitableview but i m using sdk 3.1 and it might be a bug that has been fixed since your .post

1518720
malloc	free
malloc and free are systemd compiler dependent .so it s hard to give a specific answer

1518734
malloc	free
the malloc free implementation remembers the size of each block as it is allocated .so it is not necessary to remind it of the size .when freeing

1518752
python	java
java may be a good choice for the easy language especially since there is currently a plentiful supply of java programmers - in the future i think even easier languages such as python will begin to take over

1518756
silverlight	wpf
silverlight doesn t have this but thought i d .post it just in case someone stumbles across this .post looking for a wpf solution

1518760
contains	lookup	contains	any	lookup	any
the working directory will only contains the editable source code and bazaar will do a network lookup for almost any operation

1518778
hide	next
or to make it much nicer for the user incorporate jquery to hide all of the field except the first one and provide a button for them to click that unhides the next one

1518778
value	field
there is good information on how to access list form field using jquery in the question how can i set the default-value in a sharepoint-list field based on the value in another field

1518780
implements	extends
we can extends a class but we cannot implements a class

1518780
implements	extends
we can implements an interface but cannot extends an interface

1518800
implements	extends
interfaces in contrast to ifoo for interfaces in the .net world and instead uses the difference between extends and implements to signify the difference to the programmer

1518802
implements	extends
i hope this small examples clears the difference between extends and implements

1518806
implements	extends
the implements java keyword is used to implements an interface where the extendss is used to extends a class

1518806
implements	extends
remember in java you can only extends one class and implements zero to many interfaces for the implementss class

1518811
subclassing	superclass
in fact if a superclass implementss an interface then any subclassing will also be considered to implements that interface

1518811
sql-server	oracle
.so for example having an abstractsqlexecutor with sql-server and oracle subclassing makes a lot of sense

1518811
subclassing	inherited
but having a fileutils parent class with some utility methods in and then subclassing that all over the place inorder to inherited that functionality is a bad idea in this case you should likely declare the helpers methods static or hold a reference to a fileutils instances instead

1518816
any	set
while this problem may not be possible to be solved fully there are some attempts to make static analysis as smart as possible one of them - nstatic from wesner moise - has the expectations set quite high this may also be the reason that the tool did not ship and seems to not be shipping any time soon

1518819
selected	button
if you want to stick with the .net 2.0 framework once you upgrade to 2008 click on my project in the solution-explorer selected the compile tab advanced complile options button target framework drop down box

1518826
drupal	django
i make website both using drupal and django - sometimes with pinax python

1518826
python	php
.so let me try to set up the difference between python and php and the different cms s

1518826
python	php
python - php

1518826
python	php
more providers will allow you to run php and you can generally find php hosters a bit more cheaper than python hosters

1518826
python	php
generally it s easier to code with python in many regards but this is something that can be overcome simply by using more time with php

1518826
drupal	django
django pinax vs drupal vs wordpress

1518826
drupal	django
if however you want to take it further i would suggest that you use either django or drupal

1518833
constructor	object
not sure if this is what you want but this is a constructor named generator which returns an object and a prototypal methods is defined outside of it with the new keyword

1518843
.net	wcf
you could generator a web service client proxy using one of the tools available in .net either through visual-studio or one of the command-line programs wsdl.exe .when using asmx or svcutil.exe .when using wcf and make the resulting class and its contains assembly available to com

1518858
duplicates	elements
i want to get the result that move the duplicates elements like this

1518898
qpushbutton	qmainwindow
connect a signals from this widget to a slot from the qmainwindow for example if the widget is a qpushbutton connect the signals click to the qmainwindow custom slot you have created

1518904
.when	ready
it will make your client code more complex since you ll have to handle the return of each async call and determine .when they have all completed and you re ready to building your xml

1518905
selected	cell
one of these is bound to a dataset the other isn t visible - at least not until the user selected a uniqueidentifier cell in the 1st grid

1518915
hashtable	sorted
for example in a sorted index i want adjacent value to be close unlike say in a hashtable and i want the data the index is points to close by too

1518915
python	java
.when working in python java or c# i am deliberately one or more level s of abstraction away from this types of solution and i m entrusting the jit compilers and optimizing runtime with doing clever tricks on the low levels for me

1518937
copy-constructor	rvalue
long explanation to understand why your code doesn t compile if there is only non-const copy-constructor 1 you need to be familiar with the terms lvalue and rvalue

1518937
pass-by-value	lvalue
.when the compiler is performing overload-resolution finding which overload of a function methods best match the provided arguments it will allow lvalue s to match parameters pass-by-value 3 reference and const reference-type

1518937
temporary	rvalue
the last piece of the puzzle temporary object are rvalue s

1518948
soappy	suds
there are a lot of things i m not sure about how to handle errors how to deal with 20-odd wsdl files a soappy suds instances for each

1518952
authentication	login
it gives an authentication error even though the domain login i m using to run the site has full access to that network shared

1518953
any	set
any idea if there is any other settings that needs to be set here

1518969
subtraction	time
with background subtraction what you do is to building a background model during the time there is no foreground person present in the image

1518972
web-config	app-config
dear 2 30 you paste the following code inside configuration section at app-config or web-config file

1518979
command-line	cmd
today for the first time in several months i needed to use cvs on the command-line on my mac macos x 10.4 and discovered that the cmd no longer work

1518979
directory	folder
the directory i was in contains a cvs folder with a root file that looks exactly as i d expect it to

1519003
system.web	.net
selected system.web on the .net tab list items

1519023
contains	elements
.so what id like to do is with jquery if .value contains hide the whole elements in the same way display none would

1519032
.when	ready
.so .when you feel ready for it you can just do

1519035
logout	login
i want to create a user account systemd for a website that would allow people to create account and can then login and logout

1519045
hide	show
and then to hide show it

1519046
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
the default behavior .when pushing a uiviewcontroller on a uinavigationcontroller is for the os to display a back button that pops the uiviewcontroller off again

1519048
handler	service	scheduled-tasks	task-queue
they offer different levels of integration though azure pretty much lets you run arbitrary background service while .app engine is oriented around short lived request handler tasks though it also supports a task-queue and scheduled-tasks

1519051
assign	add
if you are using a datatable assign a currencymanager then add positionchanged on your currencymanager variables

1519057
rollback	commit
is it because you do the commit after doing the rollback

1519057
rollback	commit
you should place the commit last inside the try block .so either rollback or commit are called

1519058
rollback	commit
in this case your commit is called after the foreach but it will not be called if you run into an exception-handling and do a rollback

1519077
selected	checkbox
here you can selected the building configuration for debugging release and all building types by checked the checkbox labeled as building

1519081
player	movie
i d also start the player paused and only start once the windows recieves focus - this means anyone randomly opening lots of tabs doesn t start the movie playing until they get to the tab with the video - it s nice for the user and also saves your bandwidth

1519098
web-config	app-config
before i had my configuration in web-config do i now still keep my configuration there or more it to the wcf service libs app-config

1519098
web-config	app-config
where is the best place to store configuration value in the web-config of wcf website or in the app-config of the wcf service libs

1519112
rollback	commit
if an exception-handling occurs between line 05 and 16 the transactional will never be marked with commit and thus rollback as soon as the transactional and connetion is finalized at line 18

1519113
web-config	app-config
in the web-config of wcf website or in the app-config of the wcf service libs

1519113
web-config	app-config
i would try to configure in your web-config app-config a base directory which you d then use to find your files

1519142
soappy	suds
there are a lot of things i m not sure about how to handle errors how to deal with 20-odd wsdl files a soappy suds instances for each

1519144
datagrid	textbox
my question is that i have a datagrid control and i am using the asp textbox in my grid instead of the bound field

1519154
binary-data	chunks
now someone accidentally added some huge chunks of binary-data to the svn repository

1519160
ip-address	hostname
how can i resolve an ip-address to a hostname using php

1519189
javascript	dom
my only advice do not create memory-leaks by connecting dom javascript-objects circular references that won t be cleared by dom and javascript gcs

1519189
javascript	dom
more details on dom javascript memory-leaks

1519196
solaris	linux
is there a way to find out these details on solaris and linux both or on either of them

1519214
wcftestclient	was
as a benefit the wcftestclient can also deal with complex types object that you want to pass into service call - that was never possible on the asmx test pages

1519214
.net	wcf
otherwise you d have to use something like wcf storm .net tool or soapui java-based for your soap service

1519221
http	ssl
ok .so setting http sniffing aside because you won t be using ssl the main problem points is the authentication cookies

1519223
internet-explorer	firefox
depending on the data sent how well it can be compressed and whether the client browsers support it iis will only send gzip compressed content to clients that support gzip compression such as internet-explorer 6.0 and firefox your server can serve more request per second

1519246
command-line	cmd
note that s on windows but i use the unxutils cmd they are handy on the command-line

1519255
arrays	map
a map is a map or associativity arrays

1519255
comparator	sortedset
a more direct comparison would possibly be between set and list both these hold value where the list is explicit order you can get elements # x and the set is typically not order well unless it is an sortedset in which case iterator order will be order by a comparator

1519255
contains	elements
to checked if an elements belongs in an arraylist contains elements the implementation iterate over all the elementss of it checkeded whether one have found the elements using the equals methods

1519255
contains	elements	contains	set
on a list you can ask for element# x in addition to what you can do on a set which is add remove ask-whether-present contains and iterate over all elements

1519258
directory	folder
if your hosts is a virtual directory then put your data files in the app_data folder of the hosts project and set copytooutputdirectory donotcopy

1519263
telnet	tcp	udp	tcp
i want to authentication via ad from my webserver i even test the ports 389 and it was open by telnet i even added ports 389 udp and tcp to firewall of webserver to be sure it is open even i turned the firewall off but nothing changed

1519285
display	width
the problem with using tab characters is that their width is dependent on the settings of the console you re using for display which means you can t guarantee that all columns will line up using this approach

1519289
linked-list	arrays
you could consider arrayss and linked-lists fundamental in that there s essentially a single way to implements them a sequences of contiguous object for an arrays a linear chaining singly or doubly linked of object for a linked-list

1519317
arrays	loops
why not use an arrays and loops through it

1519339
vertex-shader	shader
if your situation is the same the only options are to offer specific shader profiling eg hlsl vertex-shader 3.0 and let the developer cope with the difference or abstract it all away somehow which is more work and may be less flexible

1519362
cappuccino	sproutcore
maybe you can use sproutcore or cappuccino accordingly

1519368
constructor	object
the boost libs and it seems the upcoming c++0x standards defined various types traits templates to differentiate between object which have trivial constructor copy constructor assignment or destructor versus object which don t

1519368
copy-constructor	constructor
a types is non-pod if it has a defined constructor copy-constructor assignment-operator or destructor

1519368
constructor	object
if an object has a non-trivial assignment-operator or a non-trivial constructor it s not a pod

1519368
constructor	object
.so under what circumstances would it be useful to know that an object has a trivial assignment-operator but a non-trivial constructor

1519371
64bit	x86
some old x86 instructions are undefined in 64bit mode

1519371
32-bit	64bit
are there any instructions that are defined only in 64bit mode and not in 32-bit protected-mode

1519389
radio-button	button
now i am checked the radio-button with the and by submission it dunno whether i got the button correct but i sorta guess it is correct the server should get a request where it says right

1519389
javascript	dom
i am asking b c somehow a javascript i am using is supposedly hiding this status everywhere but in ie by somehow altering the dom or what do i know and i can t seem to get the right request nor find the reason why or how it does it

1519407
perforce	git
it also integrated with git subversion and perforce

1519411
connection-pooling	pool
as far as i m aware the mysql-connector supports connection-pooling and it s enabled by default .so just let the connector worry about managing the connection pool

1519417
push-notification	devicetoken
i have been simply trying to get devicetoken from my iphone application using apple push-notification service

1519418
binary	hex	decimal	hex
hex -- decimal then decimal -- binary

1519427
c++	lua
i have very successfully used c++ for the engine with the application written in lua on top

1519436
getter	setter
i had indeed forgotten the getter and the setter

1519442
selected	checkbox
there is a list of checkbox and corresponding selected boxes if a particular checkbox within an li is checked then the corresponding selected box should have a value selecteded else throw and error

1519457
dependency-injection	factory-method
and the work of the factory-method can be delegated to a dependency-injection framework like spring.net or castle-windsor at a later points

1519460
authentication	login
some apps do the authentication often assuming that the server login has timeout

1519482
primitive	int
in any case you can only have a reference to a non primitive types .so if your arrays is of types int you can simply do

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
try ogre3d or irrlicht

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
with ogre3d and irrlicht you might uses .net as well though the ports are not always up to-date and plugins are not as easyly include as in the c++ versioning

1519540
jboss-portal	liferay
as portlet containers portal you might want to have a look at liferay which is pretty good looking or software like jboss-portal server which needs a nicer themes but is imho better structured in the inside

1519550
iframe	popup
on a succesful login we want to open the .app in a new popup windows but it seems that the logged in session is only retained inside of the iframe and not in the main windows or in the popup

1519561
selected	listbox
the problem i am having is that .when you selected something from the second listbox that should populate the third one the postback triggers the first listbox too which then repopulates the 2nd one back to its default-value

1519605
credentials	account
if it s using the process credentials - how can i either force the process to run as mydomain my.username or give the network service account permission to read the file

1519614
uitableview	uiview
i am display data in uitableview .when the data is being loaded i show a uiview with wait messages and .when the is loaded in the table view i remove the uiview using animation

1519617
dialog	pop-up
i need to pop-up a success confirmation dialog after a user click to add someone to his friend list

1519617
value	field
2- i also need to replace a placeholder ###usernamed### on that html page with the actual user named firstnamed spaces lastnamed which is the value of another field on the document

1519633
python	c++
i have an application written in excel plus a bunch of c++ python addins

1519633
configuration	environment
the location of the various configuration files used by the addins is determined at startup time by a numbers of environment variables

1519633
worksheet	excel
i d like to debugging a problem related to these environment variabless by the most direct possible means can i simply types in an excel formula which will cause an environment variables to display in the worksheet

1519638
instance-variables	accessor
but then i feel like i m breaking oo practices by not always going through the accessor for instance-variables

1519651
copy-constructor	std-pair
however std-pair will need to make use of the copy-constructor for myclass

1519656
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
our company is continuously improving the implementation of the linq-to-sql tecnology for oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite

1519671
python	java
python doesn t have native int like java only boxed int in java-speak

1519674
constructor	object
.so the constructor takes not only the wrapped object but al.so a function-object which caller tells us can perform these operations in the way desired which may differ from the native behavior for the contains object

1519679
triggers	insert
like if an insert updates or delete statement is performed...i don t know if this is what you meant but you can look into triggers

1519698
contains	any
and i definetly know that result list contains only object of types any but

1519719
getter	setter
add getter and setter in customclass.java

1519720
globalization	translation
using the built-in globalization methods is a lot of work because you have to manually create each globalized form and then manually replace all the text with the translation and this task pretty much required the programmer to be fluent

1519737
installation	building
you could building this from the v timezone_names view - it s granted to public in a typical installation

1519768
children	nodes
with these extensions you might issue the xpath query to retrieve that specific nodes s children

1519778
hide	show
it would be better to only create it once and then just show hide it or have it created from the start and then just show hide it

1519799
qmake	cmake	scons	cmake	scons	qmake
read about scons since you use qt - it support moc object cmake or qt s qmake for that

1519802
json	xml
have you tried out optimus to validation the page and see if it can transform the data into xml or json

1519810
anchor	nav
my guess is that the above code assign the behavior to the anchor with class cal on the first load but click on the next prev button refreshes the calendar in the div and those nav button do not have the ajax behavior

1519824
random-seed	generator
generator a secret random-seed that will be used on every machine

1519827
instance-variables	accessor
i m not sure about accessing instance-variables directly i think one shouldn t but for some variables it just doesn t make sense to use accessor

1519829
triggers	insert
if you have two separate tags you should place a triggers tag in the second updatepanel and insert a asyncpostbacktriggers with the controlid of the first dropdownlistfor here s a simple example

1519838
scala	java
i am learning scala and i have a java project to migrate to scala

1519838
scala	java
the problem is that new classes those are wtitten in scala do not integrated seamelessly with existing java code java needs java.util.list scala needs its own scala.list

1519838
scala	java
how do i achieve transparency magic conversion of lists and maps between java - scala without need to do toscala tojava

1519838
scala	java
if it is not possible what are the best practices for migrating java - scala code that uses java.util.list and friend

1519855
associations	model
if i have t-sql or a stored proc that returns recording from multiple tables using dbi perhaps is there a way for me to manually initializer the activerecord model and their associations

1519856
perl	c++
my advice would be to write it in perl i m assuming that is your language of choice based on the question and if it becomes a problem or you have performance issues then look into moving that code over to something like c++

1519869
message-queue	messaging
usually it finds its best use in user-interface worker threads that don t hosts visible windows but use the message-queue as an inter thread messaging systemd and also need to wait on kernel handles

1519898
configuration	environment
however i also need to set environment variables dynamically for example to make my excel addin use an alternative configuration file

1519899
contains	set
geometry.java .so far only contains .some variables i want to work with the get set methodss along with a constructor methods

1519899
spaces	output
my interpretation of the output is that c1.figure and c2.figure are writing data to the same spaces in memory and thus .when i called c2.figure.setlength 75 it also altered c1.figure.length

1519944
abstract-class	subclassing
1 there is some abstract-class a with several anonymous subclassing stored in the static field of a

1519948
vxworks	linux
p.s i run sed from vxworks development shell .so it doesn t have all the cmd that the linux versioning does

1519952
authentication	login
in the future it s meant that the user always login on the asp.net site .so what i ve done is trying to authentication on the php site at the same time as the asp.net

1519987
32-bit	64bit
in 32-bit mode this is only available with branches aka branch offset in 64bit mode you can form effective addresses for any memory operands relative to the r ip

1520003
assign	add
not only do you have to add your own certificate iphone developer johny appleseed you must also add apple s certificate assign authority to your local keychain as well

1520024
any	set
you can t set the next instruction or do any of the fancy stuff like see what a function has returned in the locals windows

1520028
selected	button
i have an asp.net-mvc page that submit json of selected value from a grouping of radio button

1520028
jquery	.post
and then .post it with jquery s ajax to the asp.net-mvc controllers

1520061
javascript	dom
but is there an elegant way to have javascript work on the dom of the source xml document instead of the rendering svg

1520069
for-loop	arrays
and temparrays is being loaded with the archive arrays but .when i go through the for-loop poollistdata addobject testtemp

1520075
triggers	insert
after that s been done create views of the tables that are in a uniform approach and set up triggers on the view for insert updates and delete statements

1520089
endpoint	uri
what i d suggest trying to do is configuring the second instances to startup on an endpoint with a diferent uri

1520098
document	editing
maybe use can ajax instead of editing the document locally send editing cmd for the original xml to the server which transforms again and then send the new svg back

1520104
directory	folder
i have added it file application directory and it s present .when the files are extraction in the appdir programfiles folder

1520119
debugging	trace
i m interested in how plausible it would be to capture win32 debugging trace system-wide in the way debuggingview does

1520128
synchronous	.when
because .when the browser receives the reply from the server that is a http 30x redirect it will do just that regardless of how the request was initiated either synchronous or asynchronous

1520136
ienumerator	ienumerable
a custom implementation ienumerable ienumerator or

1520147
margins	padding
if that is not what you meant and you d rather only the elements s width and height excluding padding margins etc try getcomputedstyle

1520152
margins	padding
you mean how to measure the padding margins via jquery

1520162
any	set
ideally a simple option to set a universal custom error page or to flat out disable sending any html along with the error-code in the default error page would be best

1520195
environment	building
we are working in a codeigniter environment with enterprise cruise running our building

1520195
environment	building
however this doesn t work in our environment reasons fix building not currently supported on project monitored via http

1520205
.net	wcf
this is because of two things since wcf is designed to be interoperable your client could easily be a non-.net .app you should not use .net exception-handling - those are too platform-specific

1520205
.net	wcf
the wcf runtime on the server side treats all non-handled .net exception-handling as severe exception-handling and thus puts the channel in a faulted state assuming something really bad has happened

1520237
ienumerator	ienumerable
in .net ienumerable just means the class provides a methods getenumerator which returns an ienumerator which itself only contains current movenext and reset methodss

1520237
arrays	loops
even .when working with javascript arrayss the above loops returns the index of the arrays elements not the actual member at that index

1520266
any	set
is there any way to set the length of the arrays being sent up to the database in code or do i have to make a new static arrays and copy my data into it

1520267
linux	unix
this is with ruby 1.8.5 and ruby-on-rails 2.3.4 the shared webserver is linux + apache 2.2.11 unix

1520268
attributes	properties
if you are talking specifically about html attributes properties it s easy to set them by a named in a string

1520268
attributes	properties
but then you need a to be the html attributes properties named which would be â alignâ not â textalignâ

1520289
fwrite	fread
i don t want to create a new file on the filesystems just have a streaming that one function can fwrite to while the other can fread from it

1520302
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista and windows 7 display semi-transparent forms .when aero is activated

1520305
constructor	object
you need both methods to building a tax object but you don t want to have to depend on using new everytime because the constructor may be complex

1520322
webforms	asp.net
i ve worked on several asp.net 2.0 webforms apps in ie8 native mode and haven t had any issues

1520325
stderr	stdout
al.so that warning might be on stderr instead of stdout .so tail +9 might be what you need

1520325
fclose	fopen
a more robust approach could be to modify the matlab scripting to write to a separate file using fopen printf fclose

1520350
versioning	upgrade
this is a shared server and the versioning of ruby is 1.8.5 and can t be upgrade

1520356
response	timeout
the receivetimeout is a bit like a mirror for the sendtimeout - while the send timeout is the amount of time you ll wait for a response from the server the receivetimeout is the amount of time you ll give you client to receive and process the response from the server

1520369
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
note1 dynamic-sql sql-injection

1520394
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
the double colon replace the single-colon selectors for pseudo-element in css3 to make an explicit distinction between pseudo-class and pseudo-element

1520396
value	field
you can use this view controllers to display a standards email view inside your application and populate the field of that view with initial value such as the subject email recipients body text and attachment

1520429
contains	any
is there any selector to match all tds contains male

1520440
shopping-cart	cart
there is a cart counter on the top of every page that tells you how many items are in the shopping-cart

i think commanding support icommand in addition to great data binding capabilities makes it suitable for wpf and silverlight

1521386
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in cases like yours where a databinding definition has a lot of code in it i often create a helpers methods either inside a scripting runat server for for asp.net-mvc views and other inline-code-friendly cases or in code-behind for traditional webforms apps which handles the code i want to run

1521396
bindingsource	dataview
the bindingsource s datasource is a dataview that contains a datatable

1521423

1521424
xsd	xml
the most common way to validation an xml document is trough an xsd

1521923
json	xml
the simplest solution would be to return the icalendar representation in xml or json format your pick as a simple string from your wcf call

json	xml
and then go on and handle it further on the client once you ve received the string contains the icalendar xml or json

1521931
contains	elements	display	width
inorder to get the div contains the floated elements to size with its content you could give is display inline-block and maybe width 100 .so that it takes up the whole area.

1521931
display	height
giving it a display of inline-block makes everything outside of it think it is an inline-level elements but everything inside it is treated like it is a block-level elements and it ends up giving height to anything inside it that might be floated without having to give it a set height

1521967

mips	x86
arm il is identical to x86 il or mips or sh3 for that matter

1522453
dictionary	for-loop
assuming the lists of verbs is fixed and small this is easy to do with a dictionary and for-loop

1522516
order	join
a rules of thumb is to create indexes on foreign key pks often have indexes created automatically field involved in join where clauses or order

1522522
qpushbutton	qwidget
since he is subclassinging a qwidget you can do this for all qwidget subclassing like qpushbutton

1522549
plugins	add-on
one conventionally imagines a cms being the core and plugins being the add-on you install for the cms

1522554

i have already tried margins and padding and that does not work

1522578
solidworks	cad
the control for reference is solidworks emodelviewcontrol which is include in the edrawings lightweight cad viewer

1522579
contains	set
without actually going through the exercise i might suggest that in the stored proc building a table of all candidate dates and then construct a table that contains all the dates that are not covered by a daterange in an existing row then building your output resultset by negating this set

1522603
any	set
i want the scripting to be portable enough to run on any old page and set of images as long as the ids used match

1522606
associations	model
the model and associations were created perfectly and i thought things were going to work well

1522630
value	field
mysql 5.0 lets you insert an arbitrary value into an auto increment field but this does alter the next value used for auto increment

1522630
value	field
and although you can alter the next numbers an auto increment field will use with this has to be greater than the maximum value currently in that column

1522635
value	field
as staticsan mentioned the auto_increment field automatically uses the highest value plus one

1522637
32-bit	64bit
you should be able to wrap your 32-bit com component with an out-of-process com server that you can talk to from your 64bit application

1522637
32-bit	64bit
64bit c# with a 32-bit vb6 com object

1522647
32-bit	64bit
the problem you are running into is that you are trying to load a 32-bit versioning of the dll within a 64bit application

1522647
32-bit	x86
try switching your visual basic application to target 32-bit x86 and that should fix the problem

1522648
filesystems	fat
basic filesystems are very simple for instances there are even fat drivers out there for 8bit pic s

1522648
webserver	upload
i ve built systemd around pic18 microcontollers that run a webserver and allow program updates via a simple upload screens it just stores the new program into an eeprom or flash reboot into a bootloader and copies the new program into internal program memory

1522648
kernel	mmu
for example an arm with mmu with full linux kernel support and available device drivers

1522652
implements	abstract
those interfaces abstract jce providers which implements specific algorithms

1522652
implements	extends
if you are planning some custom ciphers for which there is not already an implementation you ll be implements your own jce provider and specifically extends javax.crypto.cipherspi

1522676
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
if you re running leopard that methods isn t available .so you ll need to create an nsbitmapimagerep with the cgimage instead and then create an nsimage of the correct size and add that representation to it

1522693
order	join
i have tried several approaches left join order to a numbers table etc

1522702
processor	irq
edit chrisw had a better description of what s going on in an smp systemd - raising the irql on a processor will prevent the irq from being handled on that particular processor

1522718
class-members	base-class
refactoring class-members into a base-class

1522751
switching	router
and assuming that your switching is really a router

1522758
pixels	line
defined a set of edges - single-pixel-long line vertical or horizontal between two pixels

1522758
arrays	loops
also use additional arrays of flags to identify pixel-edges that have already been used in loops - perhaps one for horizontal edges one for vertical

1522758
arrays	loops
this should make it easier to find all loopss without repeatedly evaluation any - you scan your main bitmap and .when you spot a relevant edges you checked these arrays before scanning around to find the whole loops

1522758
arrays	loops
as you scan around a loops you set the relevant flags or loops id numbers in these arrays

1522785
contains	set
set up a character table with the characters that your string should contains and then just sequentially generator strings and do a regex.ismatch on them

1522795
loading	gif
everything works in my development-environment mac os x snow leopard the loading gif appears and on my log the email gets sent and the request completed notice show

1522795
loading	gif
but on my production machine the loading gif just keeps going and the form doesn t get sent

1522796
constructor	object
using a bitwise copy break any kind of resource management because at the end of the day you are left with 2 object for which 1 constructor has run and 2 destructor will run

1522804
contains	elements	contains	set
get a set of elements contains the

1522816
duplicates	contains
this is a rare exception-handling and info from the log doesn t contains all details i need to resolve duplicates the problem

1522817
triggers	insert
you would use an insert updates triggers for this

1522838
selected	cell
.when you tap a cell if the category selected has sub-categories i initializer a new instances of directorycategorycontroller and push it to display the sub-categories

1522847
implements	extends
one way to fix this is to extends and overrides the rendering methods to implements some sensible markup-generation code

1522861
export	report
i am not sure of the exact process - i think it s some kind of report application that they can export results to a sql table

1522861
value	field
which plugins is called depends on the value of the publisheventtypeid field in the publishevent row

1522877
linked-list	nodes
also you could link the head and tail nodes and create a circularly linked-list

1522879
http-get	get
.so now you can do an http-get to yourservice.svc 123.ics and get an icalendar back

1522902
low-level	hardware
i m consuming a com dll that deals with the low-level hardware integration and providing an interface for the user-interface to do io with the hardware

1522908
any	set
the engine doesnâ t really do any adaptation until you leave training mode and you have set the fadaptfromtrainingdata flag

1522932
handler	service
you could create a wcf-rest service for this lookup the wcf-rest starter kit but as a quick-and-dirty solution you could do something much simpler just create an asp.net page that process incoming postdata in its page_load handler

1522940
constructor	object
can i skip providing the parent typesdescriptionprovider in the constructor but later set it in the gettypesdescriptor methods .when i know specifically what types of object is being queried

1522945
constructor	object
.so if it is your code i d recommend creating just one object during application initialization and pass it around with dependency-injection or as plain constructor arguments

1522945
constructor	object
if it is a libs you can either checked in constructor if it is first object being created or not and throw an exception-handling or you can go with static constructor as you did but without instances properties forcing developers to pass instances around

1522947
dfa	nfa
this can be done by traversal the dfa include pseudocode or else by walking the regex s abstract-syntax tree directly or converting to nfa first as explained by doug mcilroy paper and haskell code

1522951
python	php
i m looking to have a photo-gallery javascript webpage that will display inorder of the latest added to the dropbox folder php or python

1522958
value	field
in this case you might not have the right to updates add a value for that field

1522961
subtract	add	digits	short
i d recommend storing it as an arrays of short int one per digits and then carefully write utility classes to add and subtract portions of the numbers

1522967
value	field
based solely in the messages you provided above it appears that you are trying to set an invalid value to some field or parameter etc.

1522973
python	java
the python conditional expression is a bit different from what you might be used to if you re coming from something like c or java

1522974
rollback	commit
you can use truncated in a transactional but the only statements permissible after that are commit and rollback

1522992
multiplication	addition
you ll have to implements long addition long multiplication etc

1523016
triggers	insert
all you would need to do is insert a call to debugger right before the error would be triggers or stick it in a rescue clause

1523025
multiplication	division	atan2	sin
besides the fact that it s theoretically impossible to simply factors out earth s gravity the first step i would take would be to benchmarking each of the operations that you re performing multiplication division sin atan2 etc and then engineer a way around the operations that take significantly longer to compute or avoid computing the problematic operations

1523028
defined	declare
couldn t you declare the full classname for users but put a class definition in the .h file that include only the publics and privates then in the .cpp file subclassing from the public definition and defined only privates

1523042
arrays	loops
how to loops through javascript arrays member-functions the following code doesn t work

1523053
constructor	object
another useful tip is that you can use object.hasownproperties properties inside a for..in loops to branch only if the object directly owns a properties and the properties does not descend from the constructor s prototype of which all object pretty much descend from object.prototype

1523058
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i already use php to detection browser and include an ie7-only inline stylesheet and for mobile browsers and my page looks nearly identical to the way it does in firefox opera google-chrome safari and ie8 but .when i change the windows size some things go wonky and come back into line if you refresh

1523080
attributes	properties
what you want is the value properties not the value attributes

1523080
attributes	properties
xpath can only see the attributes not the properties

1523091
constructor	object
as written the constructor for the superclass are called everytime a new object is defined .so a lot of unnecessary call are made

1523092
mocking	stubs
if you have a lot of interfaces or if your interfaces have a lot of methods an isolation mocking framework can save a lot of time over hand-coding stubs

1523121
decimal	hex
if you re willing to tolerate computing pi in hex instead of decimal there s a very cute algorithm that allows you to compute a given hexadecimal digits without knowing the previous digitss

1523121
decimal	hex
of course if you want to get the nth decimal digits you will need to know all of the hex digitss up to that precision inorder to do the base-conversion .so depending on your needs this may not save you much if anything in the end

1523130
debian	rpm
it s possible to install an rpm on debian and an apt on rhel

1523133
enumerator	any
methods returns true if any of the items in the enumerator respond true to the block provided

1523136
wamp	php
the .application is a c# winforms .app that has a apache + php wamp stack essentially

1523170
twitter	tweets
is it just because currently there isnt really a points to a man in the middle attack with twitter tweets since currently whats the worst that can happen and why would someone want to give me invalid tweets

1523173
value	field
i have a field justsomenum of types decimal 3 2 in mysql that seems to always have value of 9.99 .when i insert something like 78.3

1523182
decimal-point	digits
the first arguments is the total numbers of digits of precision and the second arguments is the numbers of digits after the decimal-point

1523193
value	field
without actually testing i would expect that caching the field value in wrapper that is avoiding all the tostring call and casts would probably have more of an impact on performance

1523208
groovy	java	easymock	mockito
is it just hype about testing java classes with groovy rather than using mockito easymock etc

1523222
sql-server	ms-access
for non supported data types ms-access will generally use a string and sql-server might be wanting something else

1523230
firefox	safari
ie8 safari firefox etc

1523232
heuristics	clrs
i read from clrs book that there is no magic to do this i was curious if there are any heuristics to do this

1523237
python	ruby
learn a dynamic-languages like ruby or python use it for .some real-world tasks such as generator or mangling test files .so you appreciate the simpler language for manipulating files structures and strings

1523253
enterprise	platform
however if you are looking for an enterprise application platform for .net you might take a look at our product netquarry at www.netquarry.com

1523253
enterprise	platform
the netquarry enterprise application platform uses iis as the application-server and provides a feature-rich application support later on top of that including object relational mapping rich ajax user-interface etc

1523257
wavefront	.obj
this code is based on jeff lamarche s the start of a wavefront .obj file loader

1523285
triggers	insert
add another column to the book table called author_list and then create an insert updates triggers on author .so that this column is rebuilt whenever an author is changed for the specific isbn

1523287
memcmp	strcmp
an alternative would be to use memcmp instead of strcmp .so you don t have to worry about the pesky nul terminator

1523296
solaris	linux
except its only supported for solaris and linux not windows

1523305
sql-server	oracle
we also use sql-server but the database team work exclusively with oracle

one thing you can try is creating a virtualenv and then points pydev at the interpreter inside the virtualenv

1523315
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
what s the best way to find out if a user is not using ie 7 or 8 firefox safari google-chrome or opera

1523341
32-bit	64bit
in my case i was not remembering that the powerpc g5 is a 64bit processor and this was failing because i was using the 32-bit versioning

1523349
arrays	map
but i was hoping i could use map instead just to make the code a bit more readable as there are at least 8 elements in the arrays

1523358
32-bit	64bit
the superpack will certainly not work on a 64bit python but it should work fine on a 32-bit python even on windows 64

1523360
xsd	xml
since the contents of the xsd file s control the scoping of your database that ndbunit will operate on at any one time the intent of the tool is that you would have many different xsd files for different of your data-dependent tests and that you would carefully scoping the tests the xsd and the test data xml together .so that they all closely correlate with each other for different collections of tests

1523373
nsstring	nsurl	nsstring	nsdata	nsdata	nsurl
if you need to maintain the file named then perhaps you need to make a class with the filenamed as an nsstring or nsurl perhaps and the image data as an nsimage or nsdata object as ivars

1523381
.net	wcf
in the .net world we use wcf which has many different security model including signing and if desired encrypting each messages response

1523400
command-line	cmd
essentially the above code will crawl your test class named mytest in the example above and expose all the public methods as cmd that can be execute via the command-line

1523411
directory	folder
place folder with common code within svn directory and ignore it

1523417
value	field
i m assuming this is because cucumber is not populating that self.site field with value from the configuration gem before it runs

1523417
configuration	environment
i ve include the configuration gem in my test environment but have not had any luck

1523423
attributes	properties
however it doesn t display value attributes properties

1523425
increment	reset
move right-to-left and .when each digits overflows increment the one to the left and reset etc

1523438
required	checked
by that i mean how can i checked which forms references are active at a given time or event .so that i can remove them if they are not required make them available for garbage-collection

1523444
recording	playing
i think if you use a txmldocument object to load the xml file into you ll either have a serious performance issue or run out-of-memory i had trouble .when i was playing with a 250k recording xml file awhile back

1523453
syntax-highlighting	kate
many tools support haskell syntax-highlighting kate geshi pygments

1523457
icollection	ienumerable
i checked msdn and tabpagecollection implements ilist icollection ienumerable

1523465
subtract	add
how can i add subtract and compare binary numbers in python without converting to decimal

1523467
interface-builder	iboutlet
if you use iboutlet from within interface-builder back to your code things would be a little easier

1523478
subtract	addition	subtract	add
the operations add subtract and compare operate on numbers - 101 base 2 5 base 10 and addition is the same logical operation no matter what base you re working in

1523480
perforce	git
some like perforce and i believe also git and probably a few others will let you integrated changes between files even within a branch

1523504
png	gif
it is a windows metafile and i want to convert it to a png or gif and save it to the filesystems

1523529
hidden	reset

1523533
png	gif
to save it as png gif

1523538
installation	environment
i found a good tutorial and the quick start documentation on the installation of jetty in a windows environment

1523553
value	field
now the problem is this custom types has .somefield and i want to assign value to this field but i have no idea which types can come from query-string .so i can t say any specific types at the

1523554
variables	boolean
you refer to issolved as both a function and a boolean variables

1523567
linux	unix
note that unlike file.getabsolutepath the file.getcanonicalpath methods resolves . and .. pathnames resolves symbolic links on unix linux and converts windows drive letters to standards case

1523569
openssl	gnutls
the openssl and gnutls implementation of srp-tls are the only c-based ones i know that are maintained tinysrp hasn t been updates since 2001 and there have been many security notices against the underlying openssl versioning it s based on though i don t know if they impact tinysrp itself

1523570
codeigniter	yii
based on what i ve read codeigniter and yii are very similar but yii is a bit faster and doesn t have un-needed code for php4 since i plan on developing exclusively in php5

1523582
webforms	asp.net
here is the sequences of events on the asp.net webforms page

1523585
getter	setter
in java you write getter and setter which are plain-old methods that return or accept a value respectively

1523588
filtering	sorting
there s a good discussion of one possible solution here that manually construct a datatable from your business object list to make filtering sorting paging easier than manually implements those methods

1523589
linux	unix
less problems like cmd not found or difference between unix linux and windows

1523606
checkbox	button
if the user then unchecks the box and presses the button to invoke a postback the state of the checkbox remains as checked on the server side

1523607
windows-vista	windows-xp
unlike windows-vista .when windows-xp is shutting down - it doesn t tell you which program is requesting not to be shutdown

1523617
kohana	yii
yii cake kohana all have pros and cons and are great in their own way

1523638
rich-internet-application	ria
html5 is expected to be a game-changer in web application development making obsolete such plug-in-based rich-internet-application ria technologies as adobe flash silverlight and sun javafx

1523658
filtering	grouping
however the obvious way of doing this take the og_my view and change the filtering organic-groupings grouping member to false does not work

1523685
any	set
i wasn t sure if the other answer was exactly clear on this points but any iboutlet you set up on your view will get wired in with that same loadnibnamed call you are doing today

1523685
any	set
since you want to keep the view you would retain that - doing .so would mean any subviewss of the main view would be kept around as well since a view will retain anything set as a subviews

1523688
contains	any
i suspect in most cases it would be perfectly acceptable not significantly worse than any other of the multitude of inefficiencies these systemd contains

1523690
selected	textbox
this way the user can still types to search for an entry but the safari user-interface won t force them to selected one since its just a textbox

1523705
required	checked
entering this function n time may required up to 729 n cases to be checked

1523706

a collections of useful helpers and utilities are much preferred be it php or python

1523706
versioning	upgrade
if there is not a versioning what would it take to upgrade it to work on python 3.1

1523739
defined	declare
defined your datatemplates in xaml probably in a resourcedictionary or in the resources of the view like assuming you have declare viewmodel the namespace contains your viewmodel and vw the namespace contains your views

1523742
selected	checkbox
i was successful in validation for checkbox but if this checkbox is selecteded the user has to selected a dropdown corresponding to this

1523759
webserver	upload
your webserver will run out-of-memory before the upload completes

1523766
selected	listbox
testsordrd contains the selected value of listbox

1523769
delphi	c++
if you re working with com and automation in c++ or old versioning of delphi you should use variants for the parameters that you want to make optional

1523769
vbscript	jscript
.when receiving call from other object that are capable of omitting parameters vbscript jscript you need to checked all your variants for cases where the types has been set to vt_error and the scode field is disp_e_paramnotfound

1523788
order	join
i want to join the order table s order_num field to the ipn table s custom field

1523788
order	join
selected from order left join ipn on order.order_num ipn.custom

1523789
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can also do this programatically by just creating however many uinavigationcontroller you need in an arrays and assign that to the uitabbarcontroller appropriately

1523793
dictionary	arrays
i d like an arrays of file attributes dictionary or just file named order by date modified

1523798
versioning	downgrade
1 downgrade to a lower versioning of php that is compatible

1523798
versioning	upgrade
2 upgrade your phpmailer to a newer versioning if it exists

1523799
duplicates	elements
this might because there are duplicates elements with the same named

1523805
windows-xp	windows
sql-server compact 3.5 is a free easy-to-use embedded-database engine that lets developers building robust windows desktop and mobile applications that run on all windows platform including windows-xp vista pocket pc and smartphone

internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in internet-explorer 7 internet-explorer 8 safari firefox and google-chrome

1523839
reliability	scalability
what you don t want to do is try and duplicates locking in your .app which is going to turn into a giant scalability and reliability mess and will likely still result in database-deadlocks

1523857
instances	private
what do you recommend to push these changes to interested users connect to a different service instances running on the same private network same colo.

1523860
jquery	dojo
for ajax call you can use a variety of libs i personally recommend jquery and dojo

1523862
contains	any
which is in some way logical because the actual feed in feeduri doesn t contains any time information

1523870
compile-time	hardcode
the address hardcode into the machine-code at compile-time is a relative offset if memory serves me it is to the data section base

1523874
ubuntu	debian
i m wondering that is there any use for distutils for me because i m planning to do a ubuntu debian package

1523902
itemtemplate	gridview
another way is set the machinegroupid value to a hidden-field in gridview itemtemplate

1523907
toolchain	buildroot
you might want to look at buildroot for building a toolchain to target arm and other processor

1523937
xsd	xml
.when i enter the data in these xml files data should validation with xsd

1523951
panels	grid
even i tried same and it didnt work for me in some other panels form i wanted to setup grid but it didnt work

1523982
value	field
you have put the field namedd in the value clause instead of after the table named and there is a spaces missing between tbla and where

1523982
value	field
also if the id field is numerical you should not have apostrophes around the value

1523983
selected	checkbox
i don t know exactly why that is though - if you make the checkbox unselecteded by default and selected it the value is changed on the server correctly

1523983
hidden-field	checkbox	value	field
the workaround is to add a hidden-field to the page that represents the state of the checkbox then updates the field s value to on or off for example whenever the checkbox is click

1523984
contains	lookup
i need to perform a jndi lookup of these session beans from within an unmanaged pojo also contains in the ear and in this case in the same jar as the ejbs as well

1523997

i managed to do that but the problem is that events that happen inside the widget button click etc does not get fired although i have added the handler

1524013
checkbox	button
there is a page which display list of user a checkbox next to it and a submit button at the bottom of the page

1524013
selected	checkbox
a logged in user can selected those checkbox and submit currently a controllers checked whether the selecteded user list is-empty or not and acts accordingly

1524021
arguments	default
i think you want to defined a single options arguments in your function and extends it against a default value object

1524035
click	mouse
the problem is that you cannot click through since its topmost and the centering of form is actually positioning to mouse xy

1524043
selected	button	selected	cell
what would be the best methods to selected all the cell in the table uitableview .when the user presses a button in the toolbar

1524045
datagridview	richtextbox
then in the mydatareceivedeventhandler i call a delegation which display received data in richtextbox or in datagridview

1524045
datagridview	richtextbox
i just don t know how to put all this together should i defined mydatareceivedeventhandler in myserialport class where should i put delegation for display text how can i make possible to show text in richtextbox or in datagridview ...

1524070
versioning	upgrade
was this project upgrade from an older versioning of visual-studio

1524092

use a partials class to extends your data-class and implements the oncreated partials methods and in this set the value to string.empty

1526394
javascript	dom	mootools	extjs
you could also roll your own user-interface using the underlying cross-browser libs yuser-interface extjs jquery mootools etc. or even just plain old javascript html css dom

1526396
authentication	login
if the filtering finds a request not authentication it can redirect the user to a login page or whatever

1526406
32-bit	64bit
if you are building for a 32-bit systemd you need to enable 64bit offset to be able to pass the otherwise 2 gb limit

1526434
.net	wcf
this code sample looks like you are using .net ria service and the domaindatasource itemssource binding data elementname dds control not wcf

1526443
subtraction	addition
since none of your operations are addition or subtraction you could do the whole thing in logarithm form and convert back at the end

1526468
executable-jar	jar
regarding the servlet you can also defined which dependencies you want packaged up with your jar and if you are making a stand alone application you can have the jar tool make an executable-jar

best link i could find google-chrome safari firefox with example

1526477
google-chrome	safari
sample source code safari google-chrome

1526509
configuration	upgrade
you ll need to change your configuration settings upgrade some deprecated interfaces i think we had less than 30 in our solution but the biggest pain is making all properties methods of your domain object virtual

1526510
32-bit	64bit
what is the difference between how the char datatype is stored or represented in 32-bit vs 64bit in c

1526540
triggers	insert
- i call it from navision just before insert a new recording for who knows navision inside an oninsert triggers thus in the context of a transactional

1526541
arrays	map
array.prototype.foreach is an ecma-262 fifth edition feature which you can t rely on being available the browser support baseline is third edition where there is no map filtering foreach or even indexof on arrays

1526541
javascript	dom
ignore the dom stuff which is best documented elsewhere but it s good for the javascript built-in types

1526545
32-bit	64bit
one possible difference is that chars might be aligned on 64bit rather than 32-bit boundaries

1526545
32-bit	64bit
might take up 2 4 bytes on 32-bit and 2 8 bytes on 64bit

1526572
rollback	commit
the transactional manager gives you very nice log output about created and joined transactionalal and also about commit and rollback

1526587
configuration	environment
this is simple for configuration settings read from classes i have control over just provide a wrapper that performs substitutes env webservernamed with the actual server named for that environment but i also want this substitution to take place .when settings are being read from classes i have no control over wcf nhibernate etc.

1526593
uiimagepickercontroller	uiimage
get a uiimage from uiimagepickercontroller

1526594
databound	radgrid
is there are way to access all of the data from a databound radgrid

1526595
any	set
the problem is that the function has to be able to set any types of object since it s a by ref parameter

1526601
gtk	gdk	cairo	gdk	cairo	gtk
it does however link against gtk gdk and cairo

1526601
cairo	xlib
it appears therefore that it is using either cairo or raw xlib call to do its drawing on linux

1526620
contains	set
that way the web app-config can contains the core information and the unique environment settings can be set in the file for that environment

1526622
user-input	output
getting the user-input can be done many ways .so these answers focus on printing nice looking output

1526650
mapping	unique
use a map only if you are actually mapping from one value to another - if you simply have a set of unique object use a set if you have order object use a list

1526654
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the above code works perfectly in ie8 firefox and google-chrome haven t tested in opera but only registers the click function with the first matching elements and not all that match it

1526663
append	input
instead of that pass your url as the first parameter and mod your server code to read the automatically append q parameter which represents the term or string in the bound input elements

1526678
progress-bar	progress
in my wpf .app i have a long running upload running which raises progress events as it goes which updates a progress-bar

1526678
updating	updates
if a user click cancel while the progress is updating he she will have to wait until the progress has been updatess and if the progress is updatess during execution of oncancelbuttonclicked the dispatcher.invoke call will cause the view.progress updates to be queue til after _cancelled is set .so i won t get a problem there

1526700
checkbox	textbox
among them are textbox and checkbox

1526700
checkbox	textbox
each is created in code with textbox t new textbox and checkbox c new checkbox and are added withotu altering any other properties

1526700
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button
the textbox value is whatever i typed in before i hit the save button but the checkbox is always false regardless of whether i checked it or not

1526705
configuration	environment
configuration environment production.rb

1526705
configuration	environment
configuration environment development.rb

1526709
put	get
should get you where you want to go put your table named in for table

1526709
key-value	key
as i recall if you execute that query the php query result accessing functions that would normally give you a key-value pair will have the column named as the key

1526714
primitive	int
most of the stuff you are reasonably going to want to store is going to be text or primitive data types such as int

1526718
jquery	.post
i had located this stack overflow .post how to transform html table to list with jquery

1526718
spaces	output
currently the output is formatted like this ids and urls simplified for spaces and clarity

1526728
put	get
in the other hand hashmap provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put .so although it may use more memory getting an elements may be much faster using a hashmap than a arraylist

1526738
selected	checkbox
gettimezoneinfo will tell you if daylight saving time is currently in effect on the server you could use this information along with a checkbox for dst .when the user selected their server time offset

1526764
value	field
.when storing changes you ll see that linq-to-sql generator a where-clause that checked the existing value on field which isn t always what you want

1526769
mouseover	mouseout
you could try mouseover mouseout instead of toggling

1526779
lookup	any
the browser must parsing the new rules it must lookup the #text elements again in the dom and it must perform any new layout rendering calculations

1526793
stateless	stateful
i m in the stateful client-stateless server camp due to scalability but .when facing the hurdles of explaining why this and that became harder to implements using a stateless server you get kind of resigned in the long run this is where stateful server shines

1526793
stateless	stateful
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
also going from stateless to stateful is easy just ignore state info that you are providing since you already know it

1526793
stateless	stateful
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scalability issues

1526793
stateless	stateful
maybe stateful server should be the exception-handling to the stateless rules .

1526809
getter	setter
as a result fxcop correctly complains that the foo properties or rather its implicit getter and setter methods doesn t have the same linkdemand

1526809
attributes	properties
however .when i tried to apply the same securitypermission attributes to the properties to fix this warning it turned out that properties are not a valid target for this attributes

1526815
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
i m looking for a feature rich grid sorting grouping paging ideally filtering etc grid that will work well under ie6

1526815

even 64bit versioning of windows still include msscript.ocx with wow64 in c windows syswow64

1526836
value	field
.when accessing the field value pass the instances rather than null

1526844
versioning	upgrade
we have an extensive classic asp site and we re looking to upgrade to asp.net most probably the latest versioning

1526844
any	set
this would only have to be set up once as it is never modified by any page other than the login page

1526851
system.reflection	.net
my application detection loads plugins at runtime via a system.reflection inspector of other .net assemblies in a specified directory

1526863
getter	setter
you should be able to apply the attributes to the getter and setter directly

1526886
key-value	key
but to answer the question since hashmap stores key-value pairs while arraylist stores just value i would assume that the addition of key alone to the hashmap would mean that it takes up more memory assuming of course we are comparing them by the same value-type where the value in both are strings

1526889
derived-class	base-class
.when calling methods on a base-class from a derived-class should the base keyword be used

1526907
derived-class	base-class
there are time .when the base keyword has to be used such .when you want to call a methods in the base-class that s been overrides in the derived-class

1526910
height	frame
although the sizewithfont call returns the correct size and i m setting the uilabel s frame to that height it draw a couple of line short

1526910
height	frame
it s also the height that the uilabel s frame is set to which i have verified by logging and also by stopping execution and inspector the value

1526910
pixels	line
however as you can see it s clearly not drawing the full 90 pixels high although it s correctly allocation the spaces for it the thin black line above edited is the table cell border

1526913
udp	tcp
its worth noting the same 16-bit crc implementation applies to tcp as well as udp on a per packets basis

1526913
udp	tcp
.when characterizing the properties of udp consider the majority of data transfer that take place on the internet today use tcp

1526918
value	field
i think 1 is efficient compared to selecteded from any field as the query won t have to get the actual value from the physical loc .when it execute the selected clause of the subquery

1526919
shell	bash	sftp	ftp
that s all fine if he connect with plain old ftp - he s restrict just to that directory but to enable sftp i had to add him to bin bash shell which suddenly opens up my entire server.

1526954
while-loop	arrays
i m writing a data into arrays in the while-loop

1526954
put	get
the only reason why it might get pushed out of the caching is if some other data is deemed more urgent to put in the caching

1526967
constructor	object
it s the same reason that in c# classes .when you extends a class you use base for calling base-class constructor instead of a named object it simplifies code and makes maintenance easier

1526979
python	php
my guess would be that by the time object-oriented capability was being added to php the designers were looking at python

1526985
dynamic-dispatch	overrides
now your base.foo will not do dynamic-dispatch and therefore will not call the overrides foo in morederived

1527005
contains	elements
this will however only cause it to pick up on changes made to the list not to individual elements contains in the list in other words additions and removals will be reflected on the user-interface but modifications won t be

1527008
hashmap	arrays
.so if you want an offhand answer the ratio should be about 1 3.25 or .so but you are only talking pointers storage--very small unless you are storing a massive numbers of objects--and if .so the utility of being able to reference instantly hashmap vs iterate arrays should be much more significant than the memory size

1527008
hashmap	arrays
hashmap can as well if you specify the size but if it grows beyond that size it will re-allocate a larger arrays and not use .some of it .so there can be a little waste there as well

1527010
click	mouse
how to make a copy of a polygons using mouse click .when the mouse click a menu popup showing menu for copy

1527075
installation	building	any	set
.net of these building installation issues and somewhat-scant docs for the python binding icu s really a godsend if you do any substantial amount of i18n-related work and pyicu a very serviceable set of binding to it

1527078
optional-arguments	arguments
if i call the function with all the required arguments plus optional-arguments including range g then i get #value

1527078

jquery	.post
using jquery s .post i need to supply the string

1527138
any	set
the overhead is cost of setting up the problem solution such as reading the algorithm into memory spreading the input amongst servers process or any operation which only needs to happen once or a set numbers of time which does not depend on the input size

1527144
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
another answer suggests calling rand for each 8bit 16-bit 32-bit chunks depending on size of rand_max

1527149
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash-function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

1527149
contains	elements
if you are iterator over every elements in the arraylist and testing for equality or using contains then this means that your operation is running at o n time or worse

1527152
while-loop	for-loop
third you could use a while-loop but even better would be a for-loop and the range and len functions

1527161
quicksort	mergesort
why is quicksort better than mergesort

1527178
mergesort	heapsort
is there something that causes you to shy away from algorithms like heapsort or mergesort

1527188
any	set
if you use any data that was given to you by a user to set somefile s value you d better sanitize it

1527201
quicksort	heapsort
but if you want to be super-safe you may want to use something like introsort which starts out as quicksort but switches over to heapsort if it detection from the recursion depth that the algorithm is starting to go quadratic

1527201
quicksort	in-place
in response to edited question i haven t personally tested every single quicksort libs but i feel safe betting that pretty much all of them have checked in-place to avoid the worst case

1527204
value	field
i ve been able to read the current value and modify it but .when i save the document the changes to the custom field are lost

1527307
configuration	environment
did you defined the mailer configuration in just your environment development.rb and not also in environment production.rb or in environment.rb

1527321
constructor	private	instances	private
you can make the cthreadsaferecordset constructor private then provide a public factory-method that participates in your locking and returns an instances

1527327
children	nodes
then if you create a selectdecendants methods it would keep calling itself to get the children of the current nodes

1527349
defined	declare
the added benefit is that each function runs in its own execution context each variables you defined every text declare is unique to that function body .so there s a lot more control inside of a .each

1527358
function-call	inline	inlining	inline
inline function-call won t show up as subroutine call in the assembly code - the code to implements the function is emitted inline at the points where the function-call would otherwise be that s what inlining is

if you have a wsdl which describe the methods your client wants to call plus a xsd xml schema which describe what data elements it will expect to send and receive you have all it takes to create a service from it

1527469
.net	wcf	environment	building
this is called the contract-first approach to building wcf service and is fairly popular especially in environment with interoperability requirements like java client and .net service or vice-versa

1527470

1527620
development-environment	publishing
if you use visual-studio as your development-environment you can publishing the site precompile and checked the named assemblies option .when publishinging and this will essentially create a dll for each aspx page .so you can do the one off page changes if necessary

1527620
updating	updates
this was a great feature we found as we were constantly updating the whole site and there were time .when things would get updates that shouldn t

stderr	stdout
each process actually gets its stdin stdout and stderr file identifier 0 1 and 2 from the calling process

1527687
directory	folder
finder sets the current working directory to the folder where the .app bundle is located .so the above emulates it all best

1527687
stderr	stdout
console is usually used for viewing stdout and stderr

1527687
stderr	stdout
i cannot test this since i m not on mac but i ve actually found some sources that say that stdout and stderr should be redirected there

1527687
stderr	stdout
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launchdd in the normals manner because the launchd infrastructure specifically send their stdout and stderr there

1527693
hide	show
have multiple sections divs and show hide different ones using javascript which may or may not involve ajax and need not be a tabbed interface

assuming the value started in a1 paste this function into d1 and copy to d1-d16 to get sums for each field there would of course be duplicates

1527698
value	field
searches field within range that match criterion and sums up the value in sum_range at the same index where the criterion has been found in range respectively

1527705
any	set
you can set up a rules for setting revision field to any of the date elements month day year in different formats have them increment by one or leave them untouched

1527709
child-process	spawn
if the spawn process has arranged that file-descriptor 1 standards output is the result-of an open call on a disk file then i o from the child-process to that descriptor is exactly equivalent to the same i o done to a file it had opened manually

1527732
duplicates	contains	contains	set
just roll your own set of assemblies which contains the functions .so that you don t have to duplicates the code

1527741
installation	environment
in fact there are a large numbers of modules extensions and other resources that can be added to the default installation to create a more customized environment

1527758
javascript	dom
you will then invoke it periodically and asynchronously from javascript to checked the progress and updates the dom to notify the user

1527769
player	movie
if you re embedding the player using swfobject you re going to want to use swfobject.getobjectbyid to get a reference to the movie

1527770
.when	ready
searching for a selector that doesn t exist is a waste of time but .when you put that up against the wasted time of a second scripting http-request which blocks the dom from being ready btw searching for an empty selector will generally win as being the lesser of the two evils

1527868
malloc	free
.when you have arrays of arrays of arrays ... in the form of pointers you need to malloc and free every level individually

1527868
malloc	free
i put it all in the main function but it s the same idea if the malloc s and free s are in their own function

1527877
webserver	nginx

just to avoid anything more complex being the issue checked what account the job is being run under has a procy and credentials or whether it is using the base sql-agent account and then checked whether that account has access rights to the folder file you are trying to import

1530541
credentials	account
the account the sql-agent is set up under by default or a named account you specidy with a proxy credentials

1530541

1530581
malloc	free
i have exactly one single location in my code where malloc and free are called

1530670
keydown	keyup
i think this might be more related to the fact that in keydown you open your menu and keyup gets passed to the menu then instead

zend-framework	symfony
i would definitly go for an orm at least if you are working on a big project for which you don t want to use or pdo functions methods directly -- doctrine being the most developped used nowadays it s the default orm of the symfony framework and can be integrated in zend-framework quite easily

.so could .someone please explain to me if the event really exists in asp.net-mvc where do i get it inherited or what from where and where do i put it

1531132
groovy	java
coming from java you should find groovy pretty easy to use

1531147
arrays	loops
then you could loops through the arrays and checked each one for a final a rtrimming it if necessary

1531158
doxygen	phpdoc
whatever you use to document your api doxygen phpdoc zend the generator docs won t show the members that are accessible through magic functions

1531158
getter	setter
the __get function has a well-defined function header .so you won t be able to create getter that return a reference for example which is really great .when working with arrays - without the reference you would need to call the setter again.

1531167
click	mouse
however everything is ok but click on button in main form the .app consists of form1 for options and transparency form2 following the mouse

1531167
any	set
i have not found any workaround something like if there is a control with higher z coordinate set this to topmost

1531168
margins	padding
i guess i ll need some extra css to solve this messing with padding height or margins on that specific elements doesn t give any result

1531204
click	mouse
you can use sendmessage to pass mouse click to the form underneath

1531243
button	popup
by click on header button popup will open

1531254
boolean	int
if you required mxn boolean value to be uniquely encode in an int you required 2 m n value

1531266
widget	button
you can t set one stylesheet directly on the button and one on the parent widget

1531279
value	field
only store the value of the populate field

1531286
assign	add
simple fix add 1 to the value before assign to choice

1531288
qpushbutton	qobject
2 another approach is to do void qpushbutton installeventfilter qobject filterobj on push button instances filterobj will implements custom focus events handling

1531302
any	set
should i set all the string variables to the empty string if they are null to avoid any problems

1531310
progress-bar	progress
report progress with a progress-bar and firing javascript-events

1531353
any	set
any time the link is click the id will be set from parameter

1531353
any	set
any time the form is posted the id will be set from the form

1531356
constructor	object
note that the query selected them into an anonymous object -- you can change that if you have an actual class with the properties by using the class constructor with properties assignment instead

1531374
temporary	copy
this creates a temporary object initializer it with b and then the default assignment-operator kicks in which does a bitwise copy of all variables overwriting the pointers of s

1531382
listbox	textbox
for example myname gmail.com will be split as myname and gmail.com and myname will be added to a textbox which i am able to do but i am not able to add the email domain gmail.com to the listbox

1531401
caliburn	prism

prism	csla
i ll updates the thread once i ve had a good look at both prism and csla

if you want the lists to have references to independent object you ll need to make a deep-copy of the object as you copy them from one list to another

1531453
jndi	jdbc
with jetty you set the jndi named of the connection pool in the configuration here jdbc ds

1531488
delphi	c++
the same messages is used whether you re using c++ delphi or any other language

1531498
linux	unix
on a linux unix server you could use systemd to do it via a shell cmd but i would rather stay with the php functions for security and portability reasons - anyway

1531519
display	width
in my iphone application uitable having .so many cell with text.the text size is more than the width of the device..so how can i wrap the text in cell and display the text in the different line or devide it in the line

1531526
webforms	asp.net
is it possible to achieve this separation in an elegant manner with an asp.net web application project webforms

1531531
json	xml
you could use your existing asp.net-mvc .app and potentially have actionmethods return json or xml if you d prefer which your sl areas could consume and rendering

1531531
asp.net-mvc	wcf
datawise you could either reuse your model and expose it via wcf or ado.net data service wait for ria service to stabilise depending on your timescales or still use the asp.net-mvc action methods but return json from them for the sl .app to consume

1531552
checkbox	textbox
can anyone please tell me how to disable a textbox if a checkbox is checked and enable textbox if the checkbox is not checked

1531559
postgresql	mysql
if you want to get an idea how some of the built-in functions are implements you can look at the open-source databases source code such as mysql or postgresql

1531573
windows-xp	windows
for instances if the user turned off creation of 8.3 file named you will definitely have unc path issues because it causes the network provider to fail in retrieving proper file named in windows 2000 and windows-xp

1531582
enumerator	any
this lets me send any enumerator such as an to the printer object

1531590
credentials	security
for the second part one solution is to remove the iusr iis anonymous user the right to access the _vti_bin search.asmx file with iis got to the _vti_bin folder right click to file security properties this way moss will retrieve the credentialss provided in the credentials caching and you won t have the unauthorized operation messages

1531628
put	get	value	field
by making the field final you also get the added bonus that once the field has been set to a proper value subclassing can t put bogus stuff there except for using reflection etc but then all bets are off

1531628
implements	extends
edit also as pointed out by more attentive posters you don t implements classes you extends them

1531638
any	set
is it set to true for any of your user-controls

1531645
authentication	login
.when i use a login-control system.web.ui.webcontrols.login everything works fine but if i try to do a custom forms-authentication login .when i call formsauthentication.redirectfromloginpage safari just send me back to the login page as if i m not authentication whereas every other browser logs me in and send me on my way

1531663
windows	ms-dos	directory	folder
.when the first windows 1.0 user-interface came along several years later said directory were represented by a folder icons in the ms-dos executive which is what the windows-explorer was originally known as more or less

1531663
directory	folder
hence folder is a user-friendly metaphor for the more technical sounding directory

1531675
groovy	java
i wonder if there is any way i could change the default output system.out for the groovy scripting that i m execution from my java code

1531685
getter	setter
just use a interface with setter getter or the constructor variant from gustafc

1531698
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i thought that by overrides touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent in this way should work but it doesn t

1531701
windows-xp	windows
in windows 2003 and windows-xp in windows 7 and server 2008

1531703
value	field
if it isn t your browser populating the field then it s most likely that the model backing the textfield has the value

1531707
any	set
i can t see any way to communication to jdbc that the result set should be updatable in this case

1531731
.when	ready
then .when they are ready to promote code for others to view they push all their revision branches back to your internal repository

1531747
radio-button	textbox
in my page jsp i have a radio-button grouping and a textbox which is disabled initially

1531747
radio-button	textbox

i am export words report with jrrtfexporter object

1531763
any	set
is there any properties i have to set to see full report or any suggestions

1531778
uitableview	uiview
if you just have a uiview with a uitableview and a uipickerview as two subviews resiszing the uitableview should be trivial and obvious

1531783
linux	unix
if you want the file to have unix linux eols you either have to set the svn eol-style properties to linefeed or use a linux unix client to do the export

1531786
linqdatasource	gridview
.when i used sql-server-profiler i noticed .when i would get a list of all recording using a linqdatasource to bind to a gridview i would see two queries being execute

1531790
selected	button
for visual-studio 2008 you need to selected add service reference then click the advanced button on the bottom left of the dialogue

1531797
wmv	mp3
the browser display media files with wmp .so i do not understand why wmv will not play but mp3 mpg work fine which are al.so played in wmp

1531817
getter	setter
though one of the lovely things about as3 is that because of how getter and setter are handled you can switching from public field to accessor-controlled private field without needing to make any changes to code that uses this object

1531825
32-bit	64bit
i have been using the asp.net charts controls for a while on win2k3 32-bit setups without any issue but have noticed that on our new win2k8 64bit box i am getting a warning messages showing up in the event-viewer from the charts control

1531849
click	mouse
ad 2 lookup the .js file in my maidenhead locator viewer - you can surely reuse code for initializing the ge event handler and the handler for a mouse click note i am trapping a right click

1531858
.net	wcf
i can confirm that the .net clr networking counters appear to work correctly for wcf service

1531866
internet-explorer	firefox
is is possible to read cookies created in firefox from a html page that was opended in internet-explorer

1531882

1531890
worksheet	excel
i want to open a particular worksheet on a excel file through url

1531906
system.web	.net
i m using .net 3.5 sp1 and in the reference dialog it says i have versioning 2.0 of the system.web component

1531936
any	set
to answer your question as far as i know you can set the ._x properties of a movieclip to any value you want as long as it is within the boundaries for of a 32-bit int

1531937
contains	set
what i need to do is building typed collections of those object .so the days on the calendar can each contains a set of appointments reminders etc. which come from the database

1531940
windows-server	windows
do you mean if windows 7 and windows-server 2008 cryptoapi is backwards compatible with older versioning of cryptoapi then yes

1531944
rollback	commit
if you have a 10s timeout the second .app would simply wait for the first .app to commit or rollback 1 sec then move forwarding

1531966
shutdown	exit
if you have a thread that is waiting on unmanaged code i m not sure if setting the isbackground properties will still cause the thread to exit automatically on shutdown you may still have rework your threading model to make this thread respond to your shutdown request

1531978
pagespeed	yslow
if it s web it would be wise to note your page size and performance using firebug + yslow and or pagespeed

1531980
json	xml
if you re building restful applications serialization to json or plain old xml for that matter should be just fine

1531994
sql-server	oracle
there is no clean way to force cte materialization in sql-server like oracle s and you have to do dirty tricks like this

1531995
motif	gtk	motif	x11	gtk	x11
i read all the comments about the gui but anyway wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more using one codebase .

1532002
binary	octal	binary	hex	octal	hex
you can also use oct to translation binary octal or hex strings to numbers based on the prefix

1532025
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
indeed many of the more complex asp.net webforms based built-in controls do not work .so well with the asp.net-mvc model due to their reliance on viewstate postback and other unsupported functions of the asp.net-mvc model

1532025
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
also if the asp.net application you are building is incredibly small and tightly focused on one function it could be quicker to develop using the more traditional webforms platform rather than asp.net-mvc however for anything larger probably most commercial corporate applications asp.net-mvc is perhaps a better choice as it allows much greater testability of the produced code and promotes a better separation-of-concerns

1532026
sql-server	mysql
been a long time since i ve used mysql but on sql-server items are not comparable with the operators if one of the operands is null

1532027
selected	textbox
the caret is in the first textbox the tab has its first index selected etc

1532048
textbox	button
i have a panels with some textbox and a submit button and an updatepanels that is set to triggers .when the button is pressed

1532058
highlight	selected
also the first item .when selected doesn t highlight at all

1532077
contains	elements
for example a numeric expression may contains too many complicated elements

1532081
parsing	comma
1-since the code parsing using double quote and comma and separate each value..but in following example if first named consist of double quote sting within it then the parsing will create one more field

1532083
private-members	private
disclaimer my hack references private-members of the ajaxcontroltoolkit code stuff that starts with underscore.js is private .so it is probably not guaranteed to be future-proof

1532095
buffering	streaming
1- is it a bug for xmlutil.serialize dealing with big xml streaming or do i need to configure somewhere a maximum buffering

1532124
any	set
not sure if it will be of any help but you can play with caching settings and set say privatebyteslimit to 1 and privatebytespolltime to 00 00 01

1532165
pascal	delphi
if you confirm that the dll really uses the pascal calling-convention then specifying it in delphi is as simple as changing the stdcall directive on your function-declaration to pascal

1532186
delphi	basic
the problem in delphi is with string literals that contains characters outside the basic ascii-range

1532198
display	height
set the height to 0 and the display to something like block

1532203
selected	checkbox
the code could loops through all of the rows one-at-a-time and selected each one but then the checkbox in the grid header is not checked

1532225
updating	updates
- updates action - updating a blog .post selected in index

1532246
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
agreeing with anton json is a serialization format like xml or csv

1532246
json	xml
json is typically lighter weight than xml but there are some data-structures that don t lend themselves to json serialization

1532246
json	xml
if you re using a restful interface you can but not recommended alternate between json and xml depending upon the service call

1532261
contains	any
the first div contains an image which can be any width i d like the second width to scale with it i.e

1532264
hide	show
my requirement is to show the edit link .when user place cursor over the entire master div divitemholder and hide it .when he move out

1532282

rest is a way to defined a clever get or .post request to a server than can reply in various formats xml plain text json

1532291
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works in firefox google-chrome and opera but in ie6 ie7 and safari the god forsaken browsers they all give me parsererror

1532306
administration	account
edit just to make sure it s clear my python program is running as administration and i have account user1 user2 and user3 which each have information in their own hkey_current_user

1532310
16-bit	8bit
the use of tchar implies that you are writing code that can target unicode text is stored in 16-bit wchar field or ansi building where text is stored in 8bit char field

1532314
checkbox	button
after the user has checked a checkbox also in the updatepanel i set the button s visiblity to true and it becomes visible as expected

1532332
any	set
ideally you ll be able to make one query for any set of data you want

1532371
click	mouse
if the validation is display and you mousedown on the button the validation can push the button out from under your mouse .so .when you lift your finger you don t actually cause the click event to triggers

1532371
onmousedown	onmouseup
is there any javascript running on the button s client side onclientclick onmousedown onmouseup

1532404
strdup	free
use strdup to copy the returned by c_str into a remember to free it afterwards

1532404
strdup	free
note that strdup and free are c not c++ functions and you d be better off using methods of std string instead

1532408
attributes	properties
to clarify logger is a properties on ninjecthttpapplication of types ilogger and has the inject attributes

1532411
archive	backup
there are free alternatives to make backup of pretty much any os image or archive of your choice

1532418
selected	checkbox
if you selected all of the rows in a multi-selected jqgrid by click on each one manually the checkbox in the header doesn t get checked .so i wouldn t necessarily expect it to happen .when you do it programmatically if you use setselecteded rowid true for each row it s the equivalent of click on each as the true parameter indicates that the click event should be fired for each one

1532418
selected	checkbox
if you dig into the .source code and look at what happens .when you click the checkbox it is in fact just looping through all of the rows and setting each as selected .so i don t think you re going to do a lot better

1532427
operators	keyword
the like keyword is an operators

1532428
buffering	streaming
i think i need to do some kind of bufferinging of the tokens in the token streaming and .when a full phrase is matched i discard all tokens in the buffering

1532431
radio-button	textbox
always disable it for every radio-button then re-enable it if the radio-button is the one that enables the textbox

1532431
textbox	button
alternatively if there are multiple radio button that will enable the textbox

1532433
associations	model
i typically use simple associations at the domain model stage and refine it into either composition or aggregation as appropriate .when i resolve the detailed class model

1532436
hide	show
it works perfectly hide the and show it .when i click on the

1532438
revision	svn
i have checked out wc in current folder .app which is not svn repository folder sources were built and i want to make a tag in repository based on revision in my wc

1532447

hi i am writing a small utility too using silverlight 3 and wcf for our localization team to checked and correct the translation stored in .net resource-files .resx

1532458
decimal-point	digits
the field for the icd-9-cm principal and other diagnosis codes is six characters in length with the decimal-point implied between the third and fourth digits for all diagnosis codes other than the v codes

1532484
difference	count
i would not optimize this for speed unless you use it inside a loops with a very high repeat count and have measured the performance difference

1532493
punctuation	words	punctuation	tokenize
you ll really have to write your own analyzer i should think since whether or not some sequences of words is a phrase is dependent on cues such as punctuation that are not available after tokenize

1532513
xlsx	xls	xlsx	xlsm	xlsm	xls
using the xlsx open xml file-format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contains macros

1532527
contains	elements	contains	set
the context is set to after the first one is selected and process .so the visible elements from that context no longer contains firstname

1532533
selected	button
button have a very handy mechanism where you can set button images for unpressed and pressed selected states even in interface-builder

1532544
stderr	stdout
but this solution leaves stderr going only to the screens and i want stderr go to both the screens and also to the same logfile that stdout is being logged to

1532562
tracking	robot
couple of friend and i will be building simple robot to tracking a white line on a black surface we have never done this sort of thing before and i have very high level plan of attack

1532562
tracking	robot
follow up on the answers using photoresistor seems to be the way to go bu i have one more question there will be signals to the right of the tracking telling the robot which way to turn

1532571
contains	lookup
i have tried to create a lookup column contains folder id but that doesn t help cause folder is not a types and it just doesn t work

1532597
margins	padding
if it s not taking up the full height have you checked for excess margins or padding

1532633
delphi	basic
i have used c perl lisp delphi visual basic 6 c# java and various other languages which i can t remember off the top of my head

1532633
verilog	vhdl
i d like to challenge you to write a cpu ram in vhdl verilog and see how stuff really works even .when really simplified

1532645
variables	boolean
have you comparator classes include a boolean member variables named something like sortascending and allow this value to be specified through the constructor

1532648
authentication	login
the .app configuration has no way to know what you consider to be a login .so if you re not using the users api for login you need to checked if a user is authentication from within your .app

1532649
contains	elements
there is more to uml than class-diagrams based on the limited information provided i would make the sap invoker elements an external actor on the systemd use the systemd boundary to contains the oo aspects of the systemd documented within the class-diagram use an activity-diagram to document the full workflow

1532675
stderr	stdout
.so you want stderr to behave like stdout going to both the screens and the same logfile

1532677
revision	updates
first time i ever did an ad hoc updates as opposed to the first revision i forgot to increment the versioning numbers in the plist

1532688
hide	show
it s easier just to hide and show as required

1532711
environment	building
hi i m building environment with scons

1532718
put	get
make note of the system-requirements and i understand 8gb of ram is required for a production server - you may be able to get away with less if you can put up with disk thrashing.

1532722
entity-framework	ado.net
in my non-cloud based application i make use of the ado.net entity-framework to communication with my database

1532725
row	col
i think a big optimization would be to keep not only the state of the board but for each row col square if it contains each of the numbers 1-9

1532725
contains	lookup	row	col
now to checked if a positioning can have a numbers you simply need to checked if the row col square the positioning is in don t contains that numbers which is just 3 arrays lookup

1532756
click	mouse
in short i will be using one program firefox and will need a program to automatically move the mouse and click wherever i tell it to

1532764
hash	md5
you cannot possibly use more than one core to calculate md5 hash of a large file because of the very nature of md5 it expects a messages to be broken up in chunks and fed into hash-function in strict sequences

1532765
business-logic-layer	data-layer
if you aren t really doing logic in your business-logic-layer i would just remove it and have your data-layer call the stored proc

1532779
hash	md5
however you can md5 the file in sections in parallels and the take an md5 of the list of hash

1532779
hash	md5
also a hash such as sha256 should be selected rather than md5 for new project

1532825
selected	checkbox
programmatically selecteded the selected all checkbox will triggers the selected all code which you can find in grid.base.js starting at line 1053

1532826
contains	set
bonus most of the evaluation consists of set comparisons union intersection contains with some mapping from key to get the pertinent sets

1532829
nhibernate	bltoolkit
checkout nhibernate or bltoolkit

1532840
webforms	asp.net
the design-view is design for asp.net webforms and does not evaluate any function-calls

1532845
pdf	xmp
but beware pdf metadata has a long history and isn t only stored in xmp

1532861
implements	extends
in your sample you are implements that list not extends it

1532864
ienumerator	ienumerable
along with the already suggested methodss of using a foreach loops i thought i d also mention that any object that implements ienumerable also provides an ienumerator interface via the getenumerator methods

1532865
duplicates	elements
go through all elements checked whether there are duplicates in the remaining ones and shift the rest over them

1532871
minimum	max
you may want to impose a minimum length options like at least one numbers and one special character but no max limit

1532872
hide	show
you should be able to use the iteminserting event of the listview to hide or show the add to cart link button

1532885
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
while it s running smooth on firefox safari and google-chrome ie blocks the scripting execution

1532891
difference	datediff
because you end up with having to fix logic to add threshold .when datediff s start to come out with thousands of months difference etc

1532905
buffering	streaming
for background purposes we are streaming the image to the browser using response.binarywrite buffering where buffering is a byte arrays contains the binary-image

1532927
javascript-events	onfocus
you would have to use the javascript-events onfocus and onblur and set a variables of some sort

1532938
contains	any
instead of ctes i often use inline tvfs which may contains ctes which allows proper re-use and are not any better or worse than ctes in my sps

1532950
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 does not display the border-bottom but firefox and google-chrome does

1532961
click	mouse
this was answered in how do i get the coordinates of a mouse click on a canvas elements

1532968
contains	set
this div contains another set of divs each one representing an image with caption and other details

1532969
value	field
the database has some field that are boolean value stored as 0 or 1

1532985
contains	elements
edit actually it seems tr doesn t act like it contains the td elements in ie7

1533000
uiresponder	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclassing of uiresponder which has apis for handling touch-events touchesbegan withevent

1533000
touch-events	touch-event
it is possible then for you to subclassing uiwindow overrides the touch-event handling apis and manage the touch-events yourself

1533010
bmp	png
i think it doesn t support png but bmp jpeg and animated-gif

1533019
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
however i am receiving this error terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - ui.application getstarted unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x3d19130

1533023
average	max	average	min
it becomes more suitable for proper performance-testing if you use the clear snapshot cmd after the code you re interested in has been jited and if you use the mechanism of producing files you can parsing them yourself to gain a min max average output

1533042
perl	php
previously i have used perl or php with mysql

1533049
puts	gets
include gets the contents of a file and puts it in the place you insert the include statement

1533087
interpreted-language	interpretation
perl isn t an interpreted-language it is compiled to bytecode .so you pay the price of interpretation only .when the perl executable is started

1533090
ruby	php
for example you could write a php-extension if you plan to use php or a ruby extension if you plan to use ruby ruby-on-rails etc

1533097
operators	keyword
i believe that other than the ctype and directcast operators and new functionality given to the if keyword everything that utilizes methods syntax in vb.net is in fact a methods call that is execute at runtime

1533097
operators	keyword
they are casting mechanisms that are evaluated at compile-time and the if keyword can now be utilized as an operators using a method-like syntax but it uses short-circuiting evaluation instead of evaluation all parameters before evaluation the if operators

1533097
operators	keyword
however due to backwards-compatibility issues they decided not to change the behavior of iif and to simply extends how the if keyword can be used allowing it to be utilized as an operators

1533097
double	int	boolean	double	boolean	int
using the above one can test for individual optional-parameters such as boolean double int ranges or any variant via the optionalboolean optionaldouble optionalinteger optionalrange and optionalvariant functions

1533097
double	int
none of the above failed in my testing unless passing in an obviously incompatible arguments types such as passing in a string into an int or double parameter-passing a numeric value into a range parameter or the like

1533097
double	int
they can hold int value such as 0 1 2 -1 etc. of course but these are actually typed as double .when held by the cell

1533097
double	int
to prove this you can assign an int to the cell.value but it will be stored as a double -- if you checked the data types held by the cell.value via typesname or .gettypes .tostring it will return double

1533097
boolean	double
cell can holds boolean strings double date currency which translation to decimal in .net and cverr value and that s it

1533114
xquery	xslt
saxon xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 3.0

1533114
xquery	xslt
xmlprime xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 2.0

1533116
variables	boolean
also the reason for making the boolean volatile as opposed to the object is that access of a volatile variables is more expensive due to the memory-model constraints - thus the boolean allows you to enforce the memory-model then the object access can be done much faster within the thread

1533142
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
.so here is how it looks like in firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1533163
google-chrome	firefox
what it seems like to me is that firefox wait for an entire page response before making any new request to the resources required by the page while ie and google-chrome function by starting a new request the second it is encountered

1533193
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i need cross-browser compatible javascript code that will return me the height and width of the current document area in all three browsers ie firefox webkit google-chrome safari

1533199
selected	button
unfortunately with my first attempt .when u click on one .post comment button all textarea open then i tried to use this to make sure only one elements is selected

1533209
json	xml
hessian is much better communication-protocol than xml and or json

1533218
spring	guice
if you think spring is overkill then perhaps picocontainer or guice

1533244
firefox	safari
firefox works correctly to begin with same with safari

1533258
internet-explorer	firefox
i m tring to insert an image in a wysiwyg editor but i can t insert images in internet-explorer 6 7 although it works fine within firefox

1533261
jquery	dojo	stripes	spring
we have webapps running with stripes dojo hibernate and others with a mix of stripes spring jsp jquery etc

1533261
stripes	spring
adding stripes to our existing project was fairly simple thanks to their support for integration existing spring configuration

1533276
any	set
also i m not getting any output in webgate access oblix logs oblog.log even though webgate access oblix conf oblog_config_wg.xml has the log level set to loglevel_trace

1533280
foundation	cocoa
iphone apps are realized using the api known as cocoa-touch that shared about half of it s api s with the cocoa framework used for developing mac os x desktop applications the shared parts are commonly known as foundation

1533284
debugging	trace
i can see a window.alert messages show up in the console but i would also like to trace messagess for simpler debugging and status tracking both within dragonfly on pc and opera on the device

1533285
jquery	.post
try using jquery .post

1533286
cassini	iis
problem was with hostsing wcf service.i had hostsed them on cassini webserver which ships with vs2008 instead of iis.cassini does not allow streaming over http.so just using iis to hosts wcf service resolved this issue

1533291
any	set
.so my question is is there any kind of restrictions that the server cannot set the session on a computer

1533312
margins	padding
you should set all margins and padding for the parent elements to zero inorder to get what you want

1533334
datagridview	databound
i have a datagridview being regularly populate via databound object and the numbers of rows can potentially become large say many thousands during a logging cycle

1533346
zipinputstream	inputstream
it actually uses the zipinputstream as the inputstream but don t close it at the end of each entry

1533350
dictionary	arrays
basically it reads a dictionary file into an arrays

1533353
selected	cell
i m using this technique to selected one of two uitableviewcells .so the users knows which cell a uidatepicker below the table view it will effect

1533375
oracle	mysql
i ll explain where i m coming from our application supports several database vendors db2 mssql mysql and oracle

1533381
oracle	mysql
i m new to oracle i ve been using mysql mainly until now .so this might be a dumb question

1533387
contains	elements
an arrays instances and it will be a ibindinglist contains the arrays elements

1533394
duplicates	elements
also if a duplicates elements is found there is no need for shifting all elementss after this by one positioning

1533394
arrays	loops
in first pass of j loops arrays 1 2 will be compared with arrays0 then 2 will be written to arrays newlength arrays 1

1533394
arrays	loops
in second pass of j loops arrays 2 1 will be compared with arrays0 and arrays1

1533394
arrays	loops
here since arrays 2 1 and arrays0 are same loops will break here

1533400
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.when it comes to user-interface you should ideally create your business layer interface in a way that would allow for different user-interfaces webforms asp.net-mvc silverlight

1533404
export	csv
all the dbms i know of including all the ones you ve listed support export and import to csv

1533408
selected	button	keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
alternatively if the user selected a value from the autocomplete drop-down either via keyboard or mouse then the textfield s value is set to the autocomplete selection and the form is submitted as if the search button was click

1533413
digits	zero
is there a way to add a leading zero to a date that is 7 digits and should be 8

1533414
implements	abstract
the class that needs friend access to a member should create a inner public abstract friend-class that the class owning the hidden properties can export access to by returning a subclassing that implements the access-implementsing methods

1533414
implements	abstract
its only statement is a call to an abstract protected member that the export class implements

1533439
updating	updates
other browsers will sometimes updates the dom out of sequences and this is what you re encountering a case where your non-ie browsers are updating the dom despite still being stuck in the scripting-running stage because you re doing a synchronous call it s not finishing the scripting until you get the return-value

1533449
unicode	ucs
utf-8 8bit ucs unicode transformation format is a variable-length character encoding for unicode

1533456
yaml	ini
external configuration static data ini styles xml yaml database etc read by a configuration class of some sort

1533479
.when	ready
.when you are ready to actually push that code to your production server you should tag the branch using a unique named probably with a timestamp

1533487
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know why it is working in firefox but ie and google-chrome are certainly not doing anything illegal by requesting the resources early

1533487
any	set
cookies can only be set in the header which happens-before any page content is loaded

1533489
environment	building
if you are using a different building environment then you need to follow that environment rules for creating a manifest and adding it as a resource to the exe file

1533543
hidden-field	checkbox
basically instead of using the checkbox to pass the variables i use the checkbox only for display of being checked or not and then use a hidden-field to pass the value

1533549
account	userid
that said this assumes you first checked authentication to that operation - userid and if the user wasn t allow to access other users account you would return 401

1533571
sql-server	mysql
the insert query above uses mysql syntax i m afraid i m not that familiar with sql-server s tql variant

1533610
template-engine	jinja2
consider using a template-engine such as jinja2 with python

1533614
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
one avenue to consider is using the new sql-server 2008 merge statement it is designed to handle such cases and finally catch up sql-server with other vendors both oracle and mysql been offering this functionality for years...

1533618
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox google-chrome internet-explorer 8 but not in ie 6 or ie7

1533619
contains	elements
footerid is a elements on the page that contains the markup for your footer

1533619
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533641
duplicates	elements
insert all the elements in a binary-tree the disregards duplicates - o nlog n

1533643
contains	elements
footerid is a elements on the page that contains the markup for your footer

1533643
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533650
javascript	dom
using the dom methods might be the purist way to do stuff but innerhtml has been proven to be much faster and is used under the hood in javascript libs such as jquery

1533663
communication	messages
you might need this if you have a communication partner which required a very specific format and you have to tweak your soap messages to match that given layout exactly

1533667
duplicates	elements
what s left between the properly hash elements and the duplicates elements will be the elements that couldn t be placed in the index corresponding to their hash because of a collision

1533667
duplicates	elements
this can be show to be o n provided no pathological scenario in the hashing even if there are no duplicates approximately 2 3 of the elements will be eliminated at each recursion

1533689
javascript	dom
i think you should use instead of document.write dom javascript api like document.createelement .createtextnode .appendchild and similar

1533722
textbox	button
add a click event to each button set to increase or decrease the value of the textbox

1533723
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
my thinking right now is that most if not all of the major browsers firefox safari ie opera will caching a javascript file the first time it is used and then on subsequent scripting tags the browser will use the caching copy if available and if it hasn t expired

1533725
double	int
the default assignment-operator will behave well with plain old data int double char short as well user defined classes per their assignment-operators

1533729
terminal	prompt
the user can either run it from a terminal after chmod-ing it or can double-click it and tell it to run from the prompt

1533730
versioning	upgrade
running each upgrade scripting in sequences is required to get up to the current versioning of the schema

1533730
versioning	upgrade
one alternative is to required upgrading to each intermediate versioning in sequences forcing the user in this example to upgrade to 1.2.3 before 1.3.0

1533739
64bit	x86
if the servers are going to be 64bit then at the very least your staging testing servers should be even if your devs stick to x86

1533744
hash	md5
we found that the passwd are hash using the md5 algorithm

1533753
superclass	inherited
but my activity class inherited activity and it seems that this is not available in the superclass

1533753
superclass	inherited
hence should i create a menus activity class that inherited from a different superclass

1533754
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5x google-chrome 4x include it only once

1533758
queue	fifo
a non-database .solution could be to have the client make the request async and then push the request on a fifo queue to control the request .so that only one request at a time is getting evaluated

1533771
hash	md5
you could store either in the hash field itself md5 d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e or in another column which algorithm was used to create that hash

1533771
hash	md5
hopefully passwd eventually expire and over time all of the md5 hash will be phased out

1533799
ubuntu	linux
.when i try to use luainterface on mono on linux using mono 2.0 on ubuntu 9.04 i get the following exception-handling

1533806
hash	md5
-- in the login process where you verify a user s entered passwd temporary store the user s submitted passwd in memory no security issue here as it is already in memory somewhere and do the usual md5 hash compare with the stored hash

1533806
value	field
-- if the correct passwd was given matches the existing hash run the temporary stored passwd through the new algorithm store that value updates the new field to identify that this passwd has been updatess to the new algorithm

1533843
lookup	any
if you have a swap member function you can just call it directly from the assignment-operator and avoid any issues with function lookup

1533847
positioning	slider
in particular it has the benefit of calculating the slider animation distance depending on the positioning of the textfield

1533854
order	add
you can add more order clauses in your orderby statement separated by a comma

1533865
value	field
if the value is coming from a servlet then the containers is most likely converting an empty form field to a blank string

1533874
subroutine	scoping
as i stated above .when the application is initializer i execute the set application role with a given connection that only has local scoping inside that subroutine

1533876
silverlight	xbap	silverlight	wpf
xbap now deprecated and silverlight run in the browser but both are subset of wpf

1533905
32-bit	64bit
on a 32-bit architecture you ll get 4 on a 64bit architecture it ll be 8 etc

1533905
malloc	strdup
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary spaces it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy

1533905
malloc	free	malloc	strdup	calloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	strdup	strdup	free
you should also not forget to free spaces you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function

1533905
contains	any
one reason is that in many memory managers free blocks are linked together using some hidden data structure and any allocated block should be able to contains at least such structure another is that allocated blocks are always aligned in such a way to be compatible with any types alignment

1533908
directx	gdi
also wpf uses directx to draw it s graphics now gdi or gdi+ which also gives it a lot more flexibility to draw advanced 2d graphics or even 3d graphics

1533908
directx	gdi
al.so since it sits on top of directx the gpu is used to draw all the graphics instead of the cpu like gdi .so in a way you re using less process power from the cpu

1533909
silverlight	wpf
both wpf and silverlight provide many of the same benefits .when compared to older technologies for user-interface development though such as windows forms

1533909
silverlight	wpf
databinding in wpf and silverlight is very powerful and very flexible

1533909
silverlight	wpf
the separation of presentation from behavior in wpf and silverlight makes it very easy to create very customized user-interface code very quser-interfaceckly

1533910
arrays	map
i have attempted some way to do that like map .member divs in one arrays and then changing the sort order but without success

1533913
row	col	value	field
is there a way in one query operation to force mysql to increment the last or maximum value of that field by 1 as the value for that col in the new row

1533933
button	popup
if allowed then execute the button as normals if not then popup a modal-dialog saying he is not allowed to create a new project

1533937
sql-server	oracle
i understand that this is a broad question and i hate that i can t give a very specific use case other than it will be an implementation in an organization with out a full time admin dedicated to management and it will be running in a mixed environment against jd edwards oracle and sql-server

1533948
any	set
within any asp.net-mvc request you can set up a collections of internal partials request each of which can set up its own internal partials request and .so on

1533986
32-bit	64bit
i have my own thinkings on how to fix it but for thoroughness i want to ask what are some techniques you would use to make this code work for both 32-bit and 64bit without a macros

1533986
32-bit	64bit
sizeof id is 4 on 32-bit 8 on 64bit

1533986
32-bit	64bit
works in 32-bit crash in 64bit for obvious reasons

1533988
design-time	designer
it is possible quintin is right and that something is going wrong with the designer support of your control that is you ve created controla and are extends it to controlb by adding a button at design-time

1533992
any	set
.when i got my new company pc from it it was set to one tick from full and i didn t have any problems with datagrid

1534012
javascript	dom
i ve tried adding closing styles tags and javascript in the css file but the dom seems to just load it as css that it isn t able to process

1534024
value	field
basically you just create a class that inherited from the field that most resembles what you want then rewrite the clean methods .so that it returns the value you want

1534040
required	checked
abc may have def zza xas etc and i would like to iterate through a list of these children named required instead of checked if they exist

1534041
scripting	shebang
the mp2 scripting doesn t have a shebang line because it s mod_perl .so it doesn t know where perl lives

1534085
.net	wcf
not sure which versioning of the framework you re using but if it s .net 2.0 not using wcf checkout web service extensions 3.0

1534086
.net	wcf
wcf is part of .net 3.0 and up

1534087
c++	lua
swig-wrapped c++ object are lua userdata object conforming to a particular set of rules

1534098
constructor	object
expected behavior creating a new regular expression with literals constructor will obviously create a new regexp object with a lastindex properties set to zero

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
actual behavior in firefox google-chrome the lastindex properties seems to persistent through multiple regexp creations

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
note this weirdness appears to happen in firefox 3 and google-chrome 2 but curiously not ie

1534111
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
what is the time-complexity of a function such as count sum avg or any other of the built-in math -functions in mysql sql-server oracle and others

1534117
abstract-class	subclassing
usually you ll make an abstract-class if you don t want a class initializer but you expect subclassing to be initializer

1534117
abstract-class	subclassing
using abstract-class can be very helpful to create a partially-implementsed class where subclassing will fill out the rest of the methods to fully implements the class

1534117
abstract	extends
a class full of static-methods can be declare abstract if you want to prevent usage of the class but generally i would say that if you mark a class abstract you should be able to find classes that extends the class

1534119
rhino-mocks	moq
moq or the next versioning of rhino-mocks have no plans on listening to the profiling api why is that

1534124
cursor	row
it works fine except that for each loops in the cursor a single row of results is dispayed - just showing clubcardid 2 clubcardid 3 etc

1534124
cursor	row
...then the i get the value test display for each row of the cursor

1534130
teamcity	ncover
ultimately i m aiming for having a new ncover coverage report the summary one at least in my teamcity building project

1534130
gallio	ncover
i ve seen .so many different examples of how this should be done that i can t seem to tracking down the problem with how i m calling ncover via gallio

1534140
constructor	private
other methods include defining the constructor private

1534141
firefox	opera
in firefox opera it only fires the mouseout-function .when leaving the div

1534142
radio-button	selected
how can i make radio-buttons to be selected .when i click on any of two labels in front of that radio-button

1534153
nhibernate	ado.net
anyway i m replacing a project at work that uses ado.net that will now be using nhibernate with linq-to-nhibernate

1534162
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to add a pretty basic route to an asp.net webforms .app running under iis 7 integrated mode for request coming to i would like to show the results of a dynamic page

1534166
ssl-certificate	ssl
obviously this wouldn t be as secure as using a ssl-certificate but with the null-character ssl attack out there recently demonstrated against paypal would it be worthwhile to revisit something like assl for sites that need to be highly secure such as online banking etc

1534179
search-engine	seo
this is seo search-engine optimization in action

1534184
search-engine	web-crawler
the software ignore the part following the identifier the slug but the idea is that search-engine web-crawler consider the description part of the link text and thus weigh the resulting page higher in search results

1534186
mstest	nunit
afaik the test class attributes for mstest are identical to that of nunit

1534189
hash	md5	salt	md5
if your database indicates they are using the old algorithm with no salt first verify the passwd the old way by checked that the md5 hash of the passwd matches

1534195
pixels	line
this isn t to say the 80 pixels of extra width you get with widescreen would never be useful but i tend to keep my line-of-code short .so seeing more line would be more valuable to me than seeing fewer longer line

1534205
put	get
i don t see the problem really - i get a full size keyboard on my laptops and enough spaces to put two editor side by side on my desktops

1534215
contains	elements
report.xml contains header elements and n value rows

1534223
silverlight	wpf
silverlight 3 now supports the datagrid natively and i m pretty sure that vs 2010 will have the datagrid rolled into wpf

1534223
expression-blend	designer
visual-studio and expression-blend also have a visual designer that works on top of xaml.

1534223
silverlight	wpf
as you have probably figured out by now wpf is not silverlight

1534226
display	height
i move up to a 24 widescreen to maintain the 1200 pixels height for my primary display at home and don t regret it one bit

1534227
contains	elements
the markup sent down from the server ought to contains the bulk of it which you can then manipulate using css rather than brute force removing replacing elements if at all possible

1534229
append	input
i don t know clojure .so i can t tell if you have .some detail wrong in your code but using stringbuffer and append the input line by line is the correct way to do it well using a stringbuilder initializer to the expected final size if known would bring significant but not dramatic improvements

1534234
telnet	ftp
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

1534240
associations	model
because the associations isn t saving after the building could i later add the user_id field in the model

1534262
arrays	map
i think that depends on what you want map to do .when func might change the arrays

1534278
formatting	printing
pretty printing formatting

1534280
subclassing	nsobject
the nsdictionary retains the nsobject subclassing .when it is added to the nsdictionary

1534289
packaging	building
info building unnamed - test packaging pom 1.0-snapshot

1534290
double	int
it works for double int and whatever other numbers you want to use

1534295
margins	padding
problem the top row of button seem to be inheriting some extra padding or margins from somewhere but i cannot figure out where

1534309
cursor	row
under no circumstances would i use a cursor to insert a million rows one row at a time

1534334
line-endings	newline
the newline at the end of it has to be a windows crlinefeed which nicely shafts you if you re using plain linefeed line-endings

1534339
pointer-to-pointer	dereference
to use your pointer-to-pointer you dereference it once to get the address that actually points to the int and then a second time to get the actual int

1534349
32-bit	64bit
the compiler reserves four bytes on a 32-bit systemd eight bytes on 64bit to store a pointsers that would points to another pointsers that would points to an int

1534356
multiple-files	filehandle
perlfaq5 recommends tie filehandle multiplex for printing to multiple-files

1534377
execute	prepare
i d like to use prepare statements because it will be execute in a loops

1534382
sql-server	oracle
if you happen to al.so have sql-server ssis can be run connecting to oracle .so you could use fuzzy grouping yourself

1534390
python	java
the operators is implicit in many oo languages like java python etc

1534401
c++	lua
luainterface looks to be pure c# but it uses a mixed-mode c++ cli-ified versioning of the windows versioning of the native lua libs that mixes .net code and native 32-bit windows code

1534406
contains	any
this xml representation only containss data that gets serialization methods depends on the settings in plain-jane web-services it is usually just an xmlserializer thus does not contains any functions or properties definitions

1534411
groovy	java
i have a java object called parameter and i m trying to mock it using groovy

1534411
implements	abstract
but i get a runtime error because i don t implements the abstract methods

1534411
implements	abstract
if i m trying to create a mock why would i need to implements the abstract methods

1534419
null-terminated	c-strings
use c_str if the code you are using assumes a string is null-terminated such as any function written to handle c-strings

1534424
altera	xilinx
this is for the same reason that even the best fpga-based cpus xilinx s microblaze altera s nios are toys compared even to low-end embedded arm cores

1534429
debugging	trace
i d start with installing firebug extension for firefox than debugging your s ajax request firebug let s you trace all the details like what data is actually sent what was the response code body etc

1534445
put	get
well if you put your engine on the web for free for a few days and advertise a little you will probably get at least a couple dozen tries

1534450
python	c++
.so python or c++ for a c# programmer

1535237
mstest	nunit
i have never used nunit only mstest for c# and junit for java .so i am kind of biased in that respect

1535237
mstest	nunit
unless you have a particular reason to take the nunit testdriven.net approach like you need a certain feature or you just prefer that way of setting up tests and trying to integrated it back into vs then i don t see any reason not to just use mstest which works right out of the box

1535261

ruby-on-rails	cakephp
where else does asp.net-mvc fall short compared to the spring.net ruby-on-rails cakephp etc

1539000
asp.net-mvc	webforms

1539004
contains	elements
i have a big arrays contains lots of elements contains numerical data

1539006

i see no problem with having global object with constructor

1539050
constructor	object
they should just not have any dependency on other global object in their constructor or destructor

1539054
subclassing	nsobject
nsmutablearray or any of the ns-container types for that matter can only store elements that are nsobject subclassing

1539103
defined	declare
the variables is declare .so the various files know how to access it but it will only be defined once - in an appropriate .source file

1539106
arrays	loops
c does not have a built-in notion of lists or list-comprehension you have to set up an explicit loops over an arrays and have to support the length of the list yourself

1539114
object-reference	instances
the dispose methods is called first .so that animalxmlreader.getnames gives object-reference not set to instances of object exception-handling because animalxmlreader has been set to null in the dispose

1539116
put	get
the compiler will substitute the reference to the constants with the literals value .so you get the same performance as if you put the value directly in the code

1539231
spring-annotations	spring
you should also downloading the refcardz for spring configuration also by craig walls and spring-annotations

you might instead consider using the get_pages function and loops through it manually doing an is_page checked on each one to see if the current page id matches the id of the page you are at in the arrays

1539256
updating	updates
judging by how this new way works it seems to me that the dom is being updates but jquery isn t updating with it .so it loses tracking of the child elements

revision	svn
beginning with versioning 1.5 svn puts information about merged revision into the properties

1539266

i know swingx jxtable would probably work but i d rather not go through the hassle because everything else is pretty much working now and i don t know how well netbeans visual-editor handles jxtable etc

1539335
getter	setter
you can still use dot-notation even if you write custom getter or setter provided of course that your getter and setter maintain the correct methods naming for the properties

1539336
data-structures	tree	data-structures	trie	tree	trie
good index data-structures would include a trie aka digital tree or a ternary tree

1539336
tree	trie
i m going to assume a trie or a ternary tree

1539336
binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	trie	binary-tree	nodes	tree	trie	children	nodes	children	tree
a ternary tree versioning follows similar principles to a trie but instead of multiple children per nodes you basically have next-letter binary-tree logic built into the structure

1539346

the request proceeds in the background and the instances will then send messages to the delegation in this case self like

1539429
entity-framework	nhibernate
i have been looking at nhibernate entity-framework etc

1539430
void	main
for instances in java if you have a function of the signature public static void main string .

1539471
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate is quite mature and seems be to lighter compared to entity-framework

1539477
selected	button	selected	listbox	mta	sta
but if weâ re talking automation-tests triggers button click selected listbox items i think itâ s has do to with the fact that wpf must run in sta mode while cruisecontrol.net operates in mta

1539486

events .when the user click their mouse on a control presses a key or otherwise interacts with the user-interface in a way i need to handle i subscribe to the delegation that the control publishes for the event

1539552
32-bit	64bit
int is 32-bit and long is 64bit

1539559
constructor	object
finally if you really wanted to you could create a wrapper class that contains the object you re returning and dispose the constructor parameter

1539567
mouseover	mouseout
.so i m doing mouseover and mouseout

1539568
versioning	upgrade
.so far i m reading this guide and it says the first thing you should do is upgrade cpan to the latest versioning

1539601
environment	restart
is there any way to add such an environment variables for this next restart of eclipse only

32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit value can be held in a single register on a 32-bit architecture but not a 64bit value

1539610
32-bit	64bit
java defined an int as a 32-bit signed int and a long as a 64bit signed int

1539648
any	set
isn t there any speedy way for me to either inherited printpreviewdialog or set up a printpreviewcontrol that lets me add a new button without involving a form body file

1539671

1539681
height	frame
these cell are created with initwithframe frame height 90px

1539699
ubuntu	debian
generally install build-essential it s in ubuntu .so it should be al.so in debian and then do o conf init in cpan shell

1539723
jsonp	ajax
the only way to do cross-domain ajax is jsonp which you do not support in your view

1539725
boost	stl
if you re using a lot of files and a lot of templates code stl boost etc. then bulk or unity buildinging should cut down on building and link time

i m trying to use jquery s keypress to triggers a button click on a modal-dialog created using the jquery-dialog function

1539773
contains	elements
the styles collections contains only the styless that are applied directly to the elements not the styless inherited from a styles sheet

1539774

1539785
z-index	tooltip
place an under the tooltip tooltip z-index iframe z-index

1539823
hide	show
also the show hide parameter button is grayed out .when the form first display

1539833
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
where else does asp.net-mvc fall short compared to the spring.net ruby-on-rails cakephp etc

1539833

1539882
xsd	xml
as far as the unit test is concerned you could defined an xsd schema and then validation the result xml against this schema and also test that it contains the value you are looking for

1539888
put	get
updates since you have all your data in a json object from the get go just do your looping through and put it all in a variables then just append that once you re finished

1539902
average	max	average	min
if you are using c# 3 or later you could use the linq extension methodss there are min max and average methodss and on list there is also a findindex methods amongst others but i get the impression that you are learning programming and then it is sometimes a good idea to implements stuff that may be built into the framework just for the learning value

1539908
geos	ogr
try to use gis tools for that such as arcobjects topologysuite geos ogr etc

1539916
16-bit	8bit
if the specifications says the next value is an 8bit or 16-bit value and there s no value in promoting them to int perhaps they re bit flags they are an obvious choice

1539933
value	field
one of these field lets call in input1 will have a set value which you can checked for on your process page the other field input2 will have its value left empty

1539945
entity-framework	nhibernate

1539949
selected	button
i have a gridview with image button for selected rows

1539955
output	mode
for example consider a block-cipher used in ecb mode it maps an input int to an output int but - by design - deriving any general mapping from specific examples is infeasible

1539974
wicket	jsf
wicket is a very simple bare-metal framework where all logic is in java rather than being split between java and jsp as in struts jsf or other such frameworks

1539974
wicket	extjs
finally wicket allows to use ajax while still not requiring your whole page to be written in javascript as extjs required for example

1539974
swing	gwt
gwt from google is based on the swing model while rap from eclipse is based on eclipse s rcp model which is much richer than swing

1539986
attributes	properties
.when i try to use the following i get the error arguments not optional within the get properties of the headcount attributes

1539987
versioning	downgrade
eclipse xml editor and tools is part of the web tools platform and i got the downgrade versioning here

1539990
multiplication	addition	multiplication	exponentiation	exponentiation	addition
quote ... we construct an equation involving only whole numberss and addition multiplication and exponentiation with the properties that if one varies a parameter and asks whether the numbers of solutions is finite or infinite the answer to this question is indistinguishable from the result-of independent tosses of a fair coin. in other words no algorithm can guess that result with probability 1 2

1539993
silverlight	wpf
silverlight doesn t contains a cmd button like the button in wpf

1540003
display	width
as i understand positioning absolute the outer div should be removed from the flow of the document and without a width specified should take up the minimal amount of spaces needed to display its contents

1540003
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
expected output ie8 ff3+ google-chrome 2+ safari 4 opera 9+

1540029
function-prototypes	inline
.so including header-files that only contains things like function-prototypes class struct definitions without inline and definitions of enums shouldn t change anything

1540033
contains	elements
the arraylist will contains an internal storage of object which with each elements points to a byte

1540045
postback	ajax
i am using the ajax.beginform to create a form the will do an ajax postback to a certain controllers action and then the response view is insert into the updatetargetid

1540045
authentication	login
the login page then gets returned from the ajax call because of the authentication attributes and the html gets loaded into the updatetargetid and therefore i end up with the login page html within the user .profile page at the target id

1540056
jquery	.post
i m doing a simple ajax .post request in jquery to another page on my site to get an xml document response

1540064
json	xml
you can use xml json to communication between the server and flash however using amf is probably the fastest way to go

1540088
account	api
for those of us in beta myself include all is not lost as twitter has an api to checked how many request hour you have left for that ip account the api is called rate_limit_status

1540111
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this is very smooth in firefox safari and opera

1540120
margins	padding
i too am unsure exactly why ie treats child elements this way but by specifically defining the padding and often time the margins as well this can be prevented

1540120
fieldset	margins
fieldset margins 0

1540130
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
what are some easy orms or data-access strategies that you d recommend an asp.net webforms or asp.net-mvc project use to communication to an oracle

1540144
append	input
a user can add text to a div by typing some input and click add which will dynamically using javascript append the div with whatever they typed

1540166
value	field
i would simply store them in an int field as seconds or minutes or whatever the lowest time value you are working with

1540166
value	field
.so just store the value as 5665 in an int field

1540171
contains	any
note that a jar may contains any or none of these entry points and that each class may contains a main .so a given jar can be invoked in many different ways as an applcation if .so desired

1540174
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
better themes support eg. tstringgrid tdbgrid now support themess

1540174
windows-vista	windows
support for windows-vista and windows 7 including support for the direct2d canvas in win7 and the touch gestures support you mentioned

1540175

1540182
arrays	map
.so i m using a std map as an as.sociativity arrays

1540214
python	php
n00b at python but i have tons of php experience and wanted to expand my skill set

1540240
mobile-safari	safari
i ve set up a sample that i think conforms to the specifications and .appears to work in safari 4 and mobile-safari but not in my .app s uiwebview

1540244
value	field
an uninitialized local pointers variables or field will have undefined value just like uninitialized int or in general pod-type local variables or field would

1540251
unsigned	short
.when i invoke the write methods passing an unsigned short value it writes it in little-endian format

1540268
firefox	safari
in case you are addressing modern browsers ie8+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ etc. i would also maybe recommend to consider the dom storage

1540271
xmpp	irc
more specifically is provides code and strategies to implements many protocols xmpp irc stomp amqp etc on top of what is known as a websocket - an object that abstracts away the many peculiarities of actually implementss comet

1540288
arrays	loops
with your example the foreach loops should be used like this the plural namedd is a better named for an arrays of namedd than named

1540295
scala	java
i ve tried interop one project with mixed java and scala and i was having problems .so i abandoned it

1540295
scala	java
the scala nature seemed to not invoke the java compiler in every case

1540297
versioning	upgrade
last upgrade for old versioning

1540297
versioning	upgrade
with old versioning of delphi before delphi 2005 you have only before january 1 2010 to upgrade

1540302
children	nodes
haschildnodess does not work because first level nodes may not have children header footer

1540314
numeric	digits
if you restrict yourself to account which you can get to through ach you can simply restrict to numeric digits

1540316
export	csv
export the query above to a csv file open in openoffice-calc and delete the comment_id field leaving the header intact

1540323
scala	java
unfortunately java does not support the uniform access principles other languages like c# scala and ruby do and therefore we are stuck with the ugly and cumbersome getter-setter syntax

1540335
keydown	keyup
also binding it to keydown keyup doesn t prevent them from pasting large amount of text in the textarea

1540346
difference	factors
external factors cause time difference

1540364
keyvaluepair	key-value
while there s nothing technically wrong with returning keyvaluepair the thing you are returning is not conceptually a key-value pair

1540368
domdocument	domxpath
you may have to go outside of domdocument - maybe convert to simplexml or domxpath

1540369
scala	java
i m using scala s remote actors but round-trip time even of a trivial messages is 80ms presumably due to underlying socket not having the tcp-ip nagle algorithm disabled also known as tcp_nodelay or at least that s what someone with some experience with java rmi informs me

1540370
private	self
you can t test private stuff unless it is declare inside the class it self

1540371
decltype	auto
c++ 0x doesn t call it typeof but has both auto and decltype that provide the same kinds of functionality

1540376
protected	public
something else either public package or protected call them and you should be able to get full test coverage testing those things

1540381
xsd	xml
i think i had a problem like you mentioned .when i did not include the xsd in the header of the xml file

1540382
hash	md5
as sam152 said you must create an md5 hash from the user s email-address which is then used in a get request to the gravatar server

1540382
hash	md5
the easiest way to gain access to md5 hash is through digest part of the actionpack inside actionview gem

1540407
revision	svn	revision	updates
you may want to keep some of your changes and copy over new updates from the revision in svn discard all changes and only keep your changes etc. after you are done save the file

1540408
firefox	opera
nonetheless the following should work it does in firefox and ie in opera it doesn t

1540430
contains	any
if i updates an asp.net application or even just a virtual directory contains xml files asp.net will not serve any pages for that application until the updates is done

1540445
attributes	properties
for each such properties you call the validation methods of attributes create appropriate validation class and call validation methods on the properties value

1540475
attributes	properties
that code would use reflection on the object being validation to find the properties with different attributess and run the specific validation logic associated with that attributes on that properties

1540491
client-server	security
i need to implements security for client-server communication

1540491
aes	rsa
i am using rsa for a public-key cryptosystem and aes for symmetric-key cryptosystem

1540496
svn2git	git-svn
would svn2git be better that git-svn for this scenario

1540504
key-value	key
nor do i like using a key-value pair if the first string is not truly a key

1540514
binary-search	big-o
typically big-o is used binary-search is in o log n time which means that the time to search for an elements is the login base 2 implicit of the numbers of elementss

1540514
hashtable	sorted
besides time and spaces other characteristics include whether a data structure is sorted tree and skip-lists are sorted hashtable are not persistent binary tree can reuse pointers from older versioning while hashtable are modified in-place etc

1540529
base-class	superclass
if you are specifying a custom class that itself extends another class it is not necessary to specify this superclass as the base-class

1540545
xsd	xml
as for the attributes named itself the xml needs to defined a namedspace default or otherwise that uses a given prefix and then the xsd needs to specify that same namedspace in the targetnamedspace attributes of the types attributes s definition

1540549
memcheck	valgrind
if you don t mind poking around in memcheck this functionality should be abled to be added in memcheck mc_leakcheck.c in the valgrind source

1540557
credentials	account
i m working on a scripting where a user logs into a guest account on os and is prompt for their network credentials inorder to mount their network home folder while they benefit from working on a local user folder

1540587
put	get
i can put my basic recursion test in a top level execution script-tag and get about 1473 call before reaching a stack overflow

1540593
append	input
it looks like the append function is changing your input

1540597
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
and there are open source wrapper of this dll for php python perl and ruby

1540598
linux	unix
unix linux styles stripes will remove symbols info that is used for debugging purposes

1540600
webserver	upload
write a simple daemons that runs outside the webserver and watches a folder for upload files

1540603
value	field
it has a __sig field of types long but that seems to have a same value for all threads of my process

1540618
sql-server	postgresql
in sql-server if you must do this you can set up a full-text search but i don t know if postgresql has that

1540620
contains	any
i would like to know what the easiest and shortest linq query is to return true if a string contains any numbers character in it

1540639
configuration	installation
in a default configuration deploying to local iis installation in ii6 required admin privs

1540640
advanced-installer	installshield
i think the context would be similar with installshield and similar packagers instead of advanced-installer

1540654
hide	show
simplify your views view logic by writing a html-helper extension methods that can show hide things based on a call to the auth domain service

1540658
callback	methods
ok if i understood what mitchel sellers and willvv replied i ve been counseled to use a callback methods to turn this into a nonblocking solution

1540658
callback	methods
as you may have noticed i m stuck on the callback methods as i don t have a reference to the fstream instances where i want to invoke the write ... methods

1540661
aggregate	grouping
if you know what the column named are you can use linq to grouping the results to get the aggregate then if you wanted them insert as the last recording simply insert them to the ds after you do the query

1540673
python	java
is there a good java equivalent to python dictionary

1540673
dictionary	hashmap
could someone explain the similarities and difference of using hashtable and hashmap versus python dictionary

1540677
malloc	free
much like regular malloc free there has to be some extra information saved by the systemd as you mentioned

1540677
malloc	free
in general the call to malloc or the new-operator sets up a header structure in memory just before the the pointers it returns to you .so that later .when free or the delete-operator is called it can figure out what s up with the block of memory you handed it

1540678
midp	cldc
do you know what java-me configuration and profiling you need to support cdc cldc midp and to which versioning

1540683
dictionary	hashmap
as far as i m aware i don t actually use java dictionary are just another named for a hashmap hashtable

1540692
versioning	migrate
i m wondering if there is a way to avoid copying the code from the default deploy migrate task in my versioning of the task

1540703
implements	extends
i would write a class that extends your curent class and implements the initalizingbean interface in spring whichs checked the field you specify

1540704
internet-explorer	firefox
this all works perfectly well in firefox but in internet-explorer the callback is being called immediately before any data is received

1540727
callback	methods
what you have to do is use the callback arguments in the beginread methods with it you defined a callback methods or a lambda this methods will be invoked .when the information has been read in the callback methods you have to checked for the end of the streaming and write to the output streaming this way you won t be blocking the main thread you won t need the waitone nor the endread

1540736
versioning	upgrade
if you are using an older versioning of eclipse like 3.4 or 3.4.1 a good solution is to upgrade that is install another fresh versioning of eclipse 3.4.2 or 3.5.1 while reusing your same workspace

1540748
compact-framework	.net
how do i programmatically determine the windows-mobile device types using .net compact-framework 3.5

1540757
python	c++	python	java
they have this in python and java and many other languages but not c++

1540757
python	c++
if you wanted to remain with the more c++ styles of classes and instances instead of the less familiar prototype look at how python object and serialization work

1540758
sql-server-express	sql-server
the forums i have found states that aspnet_regsql.exe is used .when one is migrating the created sql-server-express db to a sql-server fx

1540758
sql-server-express	sql-server
but is this change a global change meaning that next time i start a new asp.net-mvc project or standards win forms project and add a db it will use sql-server as provider and not sql-server-express

1540769
cpu-architecture	x86
there is no user64.dll for the exact same rea.son you just describe .net program can be agnostic to cpu-architecture .so the same code needs to work on x86 and x64

1540779
http-status-codes	http-status
for example system.net.httpstatuscode enum i would like to get the http-status-codes instead of the http-status text

1540791
administration	enterprise
i m on windows-vista enterprise sp1 as administration cmd was also run as administration

1540797
hash	md5
you generator the md5 or sha1 sha2 etc hash of both files and if the files are identical then the hash will be identical

1540841
version-control	git
edit also i would assume that you re using some kind of version-control systemd and i can t say for sure but i use git to manage all my latex docs and it might be possible to use some kind of post-commit hook to execute a scripting to rebuild the document

1540847
versioning	downgrade
how can i downgrade the versioning of an svn working copy

1540860
contains	any
if your .app has 1 form that has n grouping boxes each of which contains any numbers of controls

1540865
svn2git	git-svn
svn2git just uses git-svn underneath .so it won t be better per se

1540870
git-clone	git-svn
use git-svn clone -s svn_repos to have git-clone the subversion repository assuming a standards subversion layout

1540873
versioning	upgrade
i think you should upgrade your svn command-line tool to latest versioning

1540877
oracle	mysql
what sort of gotchas might i run into .when moving from mysql oracle or some other rdbms

1540877
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	ingres	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	firebird	ingres	oracle	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	ingres	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
i found a comparison of different sql implementation which covers postgresql db2 ms-sql mysql oracle and informix and explains if how and gotchas on things you might try to do and his references section linked to oracle sql-server db2 mckoi mysql database equivalent which is what its title suggests and to the wikibook sql dialects reference which covers whatever people contribute include some db2 sqlite mysql postgresql firebird vituoso oracle ms-sql ingres and linter

1540886
unix	bsd
examples unix v6 1975 unix v7 1979 and more currently bsd 2.11 1992- 2008

1540898
versioning	upgrade
--skip-unknown-format means that if the scripting finds a versioning it doesn t understand in some directory it skips that directory and continue with the upgrade

1540919
contains	set
the first form contains a combobox that show a certain set of category

1540923
mathematical-expressions	formula
they will have their own syntax required for the formula and some parsing may still be involved but you will be able to handle mathematical-expressions and order of calculation through the engine

1540931
firefox	safari
tested in firefox ie 8 and safari

1540944
binary-tree	tree
for parsing simple math expression i have a slightly unconventional but easy-to-implement solution create a binary-tree and push each token to the tree one by one

1540944
order-of-operations	parentheses
the algorithm for pushing is place the new token to the right of the last insert token as a child then make it float up until it satisfies the order-of-operations lower precedence goes above higher precedence and nothing goes above an open parentheses until it is closed .

1540952
required	checked
if you know the size of the dynamic downloading and exact timing isn t required in the specifications then you could do an internet speed checked before the downloading add some buffering time to the calculated time it will take to downloading the file and just show the dialog box for that given period of time

1540957
arrays	loops
loops over the first arrays

1540957
arrays	loops
inside that loops have another over the second arrays

1540973
braces	macros
yeah i have to have the code indented with spaces and tab 4 spaces wide and if it is c++ java code put curly braces in its own line emacs macros do the rest -

1540983
environment	restart
service constantly monitor the environment in runs in and once a value of the environmental variables reaches its threashold value the service must restart itself

1540993
bitnami	redmine
we re using bitnami s redmine stack a single-installer for the whole redmine package including apache along with the nascent redmine mylyn server-side plugins and eclipse

1541002
value	field
apart from this being unnecessarily slow you ll lose any non-serialisable data such as event handler javascript references and form field value

1541005
restart	exit	environment	restart
have your .app monitor the environment variables and exit .when it should set the service to restart under the recovery tab for the service

1541063
integration-testing	automated-tests
.when you can automate integration-testing because it s important to have automated-tests but those tests don t have to be unit tests

1541077
packaging	building
i don t know anything about advanced-installer but i m guessing it is essentially packaging up the rcp product that results from your building

1541090
protected	public
there is a primary priority to test public interfaces then protected then private

1541090
protected	public
usually public and protected interfaces are a summary of a combinations of private and protected interfaces

1541091
administration	account
if the user of your .app is not an administration then the registry write will be virtualised into a per-user virtual store -- though if your other program is running under the same account then it should still be able to see that per-user setting.

1541093
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
your scripting run fine now just because you have a case-insensitive collation server if you deploy on a case-sensitive collation server and your scripting don t match the exact case of the field tables named errors will follow galore

1541105
contains	elements
if there is complex content in the elements which normally there shouldn t be but for rss 0.9 there can be as unencoded html firstchild.nodevalue won t contains the text content of the elements

1541109
postgresql	oracle
in oracle you can set all of those options on a query by query basis trump the optimizers plan in the process but in postgresql you re pretty much at the mercy of the optimizer for good and ill

1541129
any	set
you can set your .sourceobject at the form level and have your button in a commandbar instead of having them as controls on the form .so you do not have any form specific code like onclientclick and controls

1541139
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
tested in recent versioning of firefox ie safari google-chrome and opera windows

1541157
put	get
as i said i ve been lucky to get all my contracts i haven t had to put any real effort into finding work yet

1541203
textbox	button
my site has .some pages that begin with only a textbox and a button .so that the total height of the content area is only a few inches beneath the header area

1541221
filtering	grouping
...in order to filtering out the difference between your max and min value once you ve determined your grouping

1541223

if for example someone 8 was silly enough to publishing their site to a virtual directory witha local path set to the project folder in vs2008

1541237
moss	wss
starting with wss 3.0 moss 2007 most sharepoint specific technologies aka web-parts was incorporated into .net

1541265
sftp	scp	sftp	ftp	ftp	scp
it works great for ftp and webdav resources but how can i get it to work with scp or sftp

1541286
versioning	upgrade
since you cannot realistically choose any versioning other than delphi 2010 to upgrade to then if you are going to upgrade at all then you have to bite the unicode bullet and will find yourself presented with lots of tempting language-features to tinker with and distract you

1541314
constructor	object
.so .when does it make more sense to use the factory-pattern rather than an overloaded constructor to initializer an object

1541316
google-chrome	firefox
mine happens to be the fastest on firefox and google-chrome and the second best on ie8

1541319
subclassing	base-class
i use a factory .when i want the factory to construct one of several different possible subclassing and i want the caller to know about the base-class but not to know about the subclassing

1541337
inherited	accessor
i just really want to xml serialization an arrays but i m getting you must implements a default accessor on system.arrays because it inherited from icollection.

1541339
entity-framework	nhibernate
are orm frameworks such as entity-framework linq-to-sql subsonic nhibernate promote good programming practice or just a tools to speed up the development

1541364
32-bit	64bit
since both are on distinct architecture respectively 32-bit and 64bit i think you have to create 2 distinct compilations

1541370
contains	any
in nunit for example you create a fixtures class that contains any numbers of test methods

1541411
value	field
it also has the problem with ties in that unless you include a unique field in your order by you can get 11 recording with a top 10 should two recording have a tie on the value in the order by clause

1541425
webserver	security
your webserver needs to log request for security etc

1541429
python	perl
as using the codedom in c# or the eval function present in perl python etc

1541438
where-clause	sql
by letting the where-clause be computed in sql instead of on the client this can be an order of magnitude more efficient if a low of the items were changed recently as is often the case

1541456
debugging	trace
is there an easy way to get debugging output from this dll from another application .so we can send these trace home .when .something is broken

1541464
typedef	struct
i m having some trouble with some struct typedef declarations in a header file not seeming to go through to my implementation file

1541464
typedef	struct
they are all typedef d from struct named in the exact same manner

1541464
typedef	struct
it s worth noting that i ve also tried having the typedef and the struct definition combined as one statement but that didn t work either

1541464
typedef	struct
typedef struct _v value

1541464
typedef	struct
typedef struct _str string

1541464
typedef	struct
typedef struct _int int

1541464
typedef	struct
typedef struct _fl float

1541479
radio-button	selected
which were one of the items selected would return the value of the selected or in that radio-button list

1541485
callback	methods
there s a kind of hack to do this by placing the code you want to execute after the connection closes within a callback methods registered via to register_shutdown_function

1541493
dependency-injection	inject
if you re doing dependency-injection but need to create instances of the dependency as needed within the dependant one option is to inject an interface to a class factory

1541495
shell	bash
if you re on a systemd with ksh or bash try the following before launchd the mysql cmd shell

1541500
bison	yacc
you might find alternatives as demos of better known parsing generator such as yacc bison yacc++ or antlr

1541503
response	timeout
if your server takes 2seconds to response shouldn t the timeout value be 2000 instead of 20000 which is 20 seconds

1541504
subtract	add
after each line work out how many spaces you have to add subtract based on the current line numbers and then work out how many asterists you have to add subtract

1541510
linked-list	arrays
another difference is that i use a vanilla linked-list i use a linked-list of arrays

1541517
contains	elements
each of these item elements becomes a ul that contains the item and each of its n-1 following siblings

1541552
python	c++
finally here s the python code i used to test the pseudo-code not really giving you the code since you need c++

1541557
value	field
also the user can enter value into the field in any order and the one left is calculated

1541573
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you will not be able to modify your string since it is a nsstring and not a nsmutablestring but you can accessit by

1541592
selected	button
then the user has to decide whether one of the matches is the intended person or not and either click add again to add it even if it s a duplicates or click the button at the bottom to go to the selected customer

1541614
blacklist	whitelist
i would also rather whitelist field to be serialization rather than blacklist those not to be

1541620
arguments	default
i thought python was supposed to pass arguments by value by default .so that once the function is finished i still have the original value from before i called the function

subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

1541740
hide	show	removeclass	hide	removeclass	show
and to hide simply use mouseout and removeclass show

json	xml
.when the flash .app uses more complex data i either serve it via xml or json you need the as3corelib from adobe inorder to parsing json in as3

1542049
json	xml
one might use urlloader and urlrequest inorder to load the xml json via http from the backend

1542058
void	main
main doesn t return void it returns an int

1542058
void	main
you know this because you declare int main void like a good programmer but then we get to the end of main and there s no return statement

1542102
interpreter	runtime
at least it s not impossible to run something that was generator from .net sources or interpreter them at runtime

1542102

display	height
reading around i see the rea.son for this is that the inactive tabs have display none initially .so the height of the divs within the accordion do not get calculated correctly

1542171
configuration	environment
the basic idea is that i m deploying several configuration files and based on an environment variables the application itself decides which one to use

1542176

1542310
multiplication	addition
an addition note if you want to leave this as an int operation and not use floating-point you want to order it .so you do multiplies before divides to get the most precision as long as overflow doesn t occur during multiplication

1542337
attributes	properties
the typeof resource and properties attributes are extensions to xhtml which are part of the rdfa specifications which is why eclipse doesn t know about them

1542348
spaces	output
a cheap solution would be to have a buffering that has spaces for an extra null-character and just put a null-character at the points .when you know the actual size and then output the null-terminated buffering as you already do

1542391
buffering	streaming
do you actually want streaming to happen or do you just want it serialization and are ok with it being buffering

1542391
data-members	private
.so do the usual datacontract types-conversion trick don t mark the streaming with data-members but create a private data-members properties of types byte that wrap the streaming

1542398
contains	elements
1 use variables to store the start-index and length of the sequences of arrays elements that must contains mike s entry if there is one

1542418
apache	vhosts
variables www vhosts hostname logs fo_errors.log has owner set to apache apache and has write permissions

1542429
duplicates	contains
this seems to be a duplicates question - see my answer to wcf returning a custom object with a collections of custom object contains streaming for a solution

1542431
contains	elements	contains	any
i d reccomend using a labels as a drag handle it doesn t need to contains any text it could just be styled .so the user understands it can be used for dragging and not a form elements because then you re overloading it s behavior in a way the user most likely won t expect

1542445
firefox	safari
the scripting works well on firefox safari ie8

these are of course very simple examples but might there be something that is as scalability as let or let in lisp

1542554
communication	messages
or what seems more likely a messages is sent to some other daemons process responsible for tcp communication

1542573

1542772
linux	unix
they ll be persistent automatically via files in unix linux and in the registry in windows iirc

1542786
defined	declare
this isn t java. one would assume that there is a class exitlistener defined or at least declare inside that header but there could just as well be some other class none at all or many classes

1542786
defined	declare
as others have said you do not need a class definition inorder to declare a pointers to that class .so assuming that exitlistener.h defined the exitlistener class you don t need to include the header at all

1542799
log4cplus	log4cpp
do you choose qdebug qwarning qcritical qfatal methods or maybe something like log4cpp log4cplus etc. or maybe some custom-maked code

1542812
any	set
the session proxy class could then be refactored to allow injection of any class implements the interface and allowing get and set types operation on that isessionvariable implements class in a strongly-typesd way

1542837
16-bit	8bit
it s a bad answer but if you have lots of input elements but they re all 8bit int or maybe even 16-bit int it could be the best way

1542837
duplicates	elements
the first elements the second elements duplicates of the first having been removed etc removing all identical elementss

1542848
build-process	msbuild
it can be integrated into the build-process using msbuild

document-ready	.when
pps .when setting the html code by hand be sure to hook up on the document-ready or loaded event before playing with the html dom

1542851
value	field
that makes it basically infeasible to enforce sensible rules - .so either you d have to ensure that all field were set in the constructor or allow them to have default value

1542855
any	set
the compiler can t however know whether the instances variables is initializer before you hit that methods call because it could be set by any other methods which may be called in any order by external code

1542856
python	java
there s apparently a windows inotify equivalent - the java jnotify libs has implements it - but i don t know if there s a python implementation

1542865
webforms	asp.net
see this .so .post that describe how to implements the pattern in asp.net webforms

1542868
double	int
.when a chunks of memory is allocated for a new object instances the runtime writes zero across the entire block ensuring that the new object starts at a known state - this is why int default to 0 double default to 0.0 pointers object references to null and .so on

1542872
versioning	upgrade
you cannot upgrade iis to versioning 7 on server 2003 - you would have to upgrade your server os to windows-server 2008 inorder to run iis 7 it is an integral part of the os

1542876
16-bit	8bit
here s the code to load the image to make sure that i load with the full 16-bit range just writing source test.png in the image control loads it as 8bit

1542886
identity-column	sql-server
is it possible in sql sql-server to retrieve the next id int from an identity-column in a table before and without actually insert a row

1542893
databound	formview
you need to use formview databound event like

1542900
data-members	constructor
â if t is a non-union class types without a user-declared constructor then every non-static data-members and base-class component of t is value-initialization

1542907
uniqueidentifier	identifier
rather than using an identity-column you could use a uniqueidentifier guid column as the unique row identifier and insert known value

1542969
.net	wcf
if you re on .net 3.0 or higher use wcf - it s the most current most flexible way to implements soap communication

1542975

1542987
constructor	object
value-initialization of class-type object invokes a user-defined constructor if existant or otherwise value-initialization the members

1542995
base-class	inherited
if you have a virtual-methods in a base-class classa which is overrides in an inherited class classb and you want to prevent that a class that inherited from classb overrides this methods then you have to mark this methods as sealed in classb

1543002
droppable	draggable
i have 1 draggable div and 2 droppable divs

1543002

firefox	safari
i need to implements this in all browser firefox ie7 ie8 safari

1543007
base-class	inherited
class - if i don t already inherited from a base-class or can t inject the new functionality into the inheriteded tree then i think i d be trying to minimize any such expectations that a module might have

1543020
attributes	properties
another possibility would be to set attributes on members or properties like

1543020
attributes	properties
here you could create a loops on all properties having that attributes as it sounds to me that you are eager to create a loops -

1543026
arguments	default
if you are using a cmd that gives a short-form date or want to cope with different arguments being handed to ls you ll have to make multiple attempts to parsing the date with different format strings until you don t get a valueerror post-processing the successful parsing according to which format it has matched -- files more than a year old will often report a date-format including a year but no time of day here you could probably stick with a default 00 00 00 time

1543032
json	xml
i want to use perl scripting that gets the json data and converts it into xml file

1543034
constructor	object
if the object is of non-pod class types then it is default-initialized but if this call a constructor which leaves its members uninitialized then this makes no difference

double-quotes	single-quotes
unfortunately this doesn t work in mysql with the default settings because mysql prefers to think double-quotes are an alternative to single-quotes for string literals

1543309
sql-server	mysql
use double-quotes and required mysql sql-server users to change the configuration appropriately

1543309
sql-server	mysql
have a setting for mysql vs sql-server vs others and produce either the backquote square-bracket or double-quote syntax depending on that

1543396
populate	row
how can i have a list that is populate from the datatable row information

1543402
icriteria	named
if you just want to retrieve parts of your entity like the named for instances then you ll have to write a hql query or use the icriteria api and maybe use projection

1543410
javascript	dom
gwt does it best to avoid common pitfalls that would cause memory-leaks in javascript circular references between javascript and dom nodes are badly handled in some browsers

1543427
shell	bash
in gnu-screen i want to change the default cmd binding to alt-s by tweak .screenrc instead of the default c-a the reason is i use emacs hence gnu-screen bind the c-a key sending c-a to the emacs becomes tedious as nils said to send c-a i should types c-a a as well as c-a in bash shell and i could change the escape to c- but some of them are already mapped in emacs and other combinations are not as easy as alt-s

1543446
contains	elements
it produces way smaller files in terms to reliability and linecount gives a good overview of the items contains in another bigger elements and you don t have to bother creating an end-elements tag for each item used in the file except the containers items

1543455
vba	vb6
as a general vba reference you d be best to pick up a good vb6 resource since if i recall correctly vba is a subset of the vb6 language

i recommend the packing run svnadmin pack to get it to combine 1000 revision files into 1 file this does take a little time but you can continue working while its packing

1543719
svnadmin	dump
no you do not need to dump load to upgrade 1.6 was specifically designed to be an easy upgrade using just svnadmin upgrade

1543755
realloc	malloc
you are not checked if malloc and realloc succeeded

1543766
margins	padding
i would assume this issue has something to do with margins and padding

1543766
any	set
also as you had mentioned on your bottom div you should have that set to its top border to try and prevent such gaps from occurring due to any margins or spacing within the div itself

1543771

contains	any
as others have pointed out if the header file containss the macros definitions is structured .so that it does not contains any typedef or enum declarations these cannot be repeated

1543796
parentheses	macros
this is because a macros invocation - for a function-like macros - must be immediately followed by an open parentheses give or take white spaces possibly including comments

margins	padding
i d like to get some feedback on using padding and margins for page layout versus absolute positioning

1543994
margins	padding
.so far in my web designs i have used the rules of thumb to use appropriately titled divs with floats padding and margins .when laying out a page and if .something required ab.solute positioning like an elements to be stuck on the edges of the screens or a div use it .when necessary

since in this mode the file program doesn t quit .when done the output would otherwise not appear

1544178
buffering	streaming
consider this at a low-level the output bufferinging simply means that doing write on a bufferinging streaming copies the data into an in-memory buffering until the buffering fills up or typically until a linefeed is found

1544178

1544324
any	set
i have a custom class called parameter and a custom activity with generics collections properties called parameters and i want to set binding for one of parameters in the generics-list of parameters properties i ve tried with activitybind but it is not working is there any way to do it with workflow-foundation

1544644
contains	any
this database should also contains things like your configuration-management for ssis package any logging tables any import metadata tables we keep tracking of every run of the import and the status of that run as well as a bazillion other things about the import like the filename the normals file size etc

1544674
queue	fifo
if you have a multiple-producer single-consumer queue fifo you can easily make one lock-free using slist or a trivial lock-free lifo stack

1544684
emacs	vim
however i personally recommend you to get familiar with vim emacs whatever editor you feel comfortable

1544684
emacs	vim
the best thing about emacs vim is that the flexibility to extends the functionality through plugins whatever you call it

1544700
spring.net	ninject
i ve looked at spring.net unity ninject castle and structuremap .so far and i have no idea what makes one better than the other

1544796
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl	python	java
note i think that apart from perl python and some small effort in c++ and java no other programming language has good bioinformatics libs at all

1544823
initializer	getter
also just an aside you should really only expose a getter for that collections and initializer a readonly backing field with the actual collections

1544885
arrays	map
people suggest to keep references to all markers you have on the map in an arrays

1544885
arrays	loops
and then .when you want to delete em all just loops trough the arrays and call .setmap null methods on each of the references

1544893
callback	methods
to remember bob you generally make a function as in nickyt s answer to keep a copy of â bobâ in a closure .so it can be remembered at callback time and used to call the real methods

1544903
python	c++
i have heard that c++ and python are two of the most used languages

1544903
python	c++
c++ vs python is what i am considering.

python is used in some games as a scripting-language for game logic missions sometimes ai but there is also lua and possibly many others but python certainly is used here

1544931
visual-c++	dev-c++
dev-c++ bloodshed from boorland is easier to use than microsoft visual-c++ and it shouldn t take more than 5 minutes to understand the user-interface

1544932
python	c++
many games write the core engine in c++ then have binding to python for less performance critical code game logic missions ai

1544947
lookup	any
if you go the second route virtual directory there will not be any reverse lookup done unless you filtering on domain named

1544949

1544989
pyopengl	panda3d
python2 has better libs support for game stuff -- pygame will set up your windows and give you 2d operations pyopengl to do fancier stuff panda3d etc

1544990
versioning	upgrade
currently all upgrade work fine .whenever updating to a newer versioning numbers however i m getting an odd behavior .when downgrading

1544990
versioning	downgrade
the rea.son the downgrade is needed is because the client application needs to be running the same versioning as the server to ensure compatibility and the entire process needs to be automated .so if the client-server versioninging don t match on signin the user can just click yes and the proper versioning is downloading install and started

1544990
downgrade	upgrade	versioning	downgrade	versioning	upgrade
the end result is that regardless of upgrade or downgrade the current versioning needs to be fully uninstaller and the downloading versioning fully install .so if there s another way to accomplish that that ll al.so be a good answer

1545072
python	c++
game programming is not different in c++ than python

1545072
python	c++
you already know c++ .so the answer is learn python

1545072
python	c++
you ll also learn a lot of game programming by doing it in python even if you need to switching to c++ for doing heavyweight 3d engines

1545077
python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
using c++ also gives you another benefit you can implements a scripting-language such as lua or python for for instances game logic

1545088

we are looking for a control we can use in our wordpress blogs that will keep our source code-formatting and provide scrollbar

1545148
content-length	content-type
if the client indicates they can handle gzip encoding via the accept-encoding header or or similar then compress the file caching the compressed result somewhere write the correct headers for the response content-encoding gzip content-length n content-type text plain etc and then use sendfile 2 however that may or may not have been made available in your environment to copy the content from the open file-descriptor into your response streaming

1545148
lighttpd	apache
alternatively if you have apache lighttpd or similar acting as a transparency proxy in front of your server you could use the x-sendfile header which is exceedingly fast

i changed the base types for the custom field control from spfieldtext to spfieldmultichoice along with changing the fld_typess field definition value from text to multichoice

1545427
value	field
the custom field allows multiple value to be selected

1545437
value	field
using automatic properties over field allows you to change the internals of your class down the road in case you need to make setting the value of that properties do something or checked authentication rules or something similar on the read

1545438
queue	fifo
yes you would need to implements your own queueing mechanism if you want a fifo queue

1545589
value	field
.when i programmatically change a field value on an splistitem i would like to set a comment for this change

1545590
listbox	textbox
with the newer .net controls the listbox are virtualized which helps but you also don t run into other memory issues such as the textbox concatenation

1545598
postgresql	mysql
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1545608
cobertura	eclemma	code-coverage	cobertura	code-coverage	eclemma
code-coverage eclemma i find the cobertura plugins doesn t work too well myself

1545619
stderr	stdout
inorder to accomplish this i create a separate pipe for stdout and stderr and use them in the startupinfo structure .when calling createprocess

1545619
stderr	stdout
i then launchd a separate thread for each stdout stderr handle that reads from the pipe and logs the output to a windows

1545619
stderr	stdout
the problem i am having is that if the child-process logs to stderr and stdout in quick succession my .app will sometimes display the output in the incorrect order

1545619
stderr	stdout
is it possible to capture stdout and stderr in the original order they were written to while being able to distinguish between the two

1545622
updating	updates
al.so the table i am updating the value in hibernate doesn t know about it .so i would have to do a straight jdbc updates -- is that even possible

1545645
value	field
i just want to set the value of a field in my model instances by named

1545645
value	field
i want to set the value of bar by named not by accessing the field

1545656

1545831
firefox	safari
well then something that acts though a web browser firefox or safari i m on mac

1545861
children	nodes
you know it has children .so all you need to do is force a way to make it checked all the descendants and not stop at a single good instances for and nodes

1545861
children	tree
on the same note if all children are true adding them to nsl would also required recursion because you don t know how deep the tree is beyond the current state and immediate children

1545906
macros	basic
i once worked with a very talented assembly programmer who had augmented the basic arm instruction set with a numbers of macros

1545907

linux	unix
edit if you re on unix linux or i presume cygwin you may be able to achieve what you want with wget

1546015
stderr	stdout
if you re looking for a permanent solution your best bet is probably to redirect stdout and stderr to a file .when launchd the program

1546019
union-all	union
union will give you all distinct results as where union-all will give you results combined from the sets

1546023

ones in c++ i know of include the number-theory package lidia and ntl and the bigint package used for cryptography code in crypto++ and botan

1546037
lgpl	gpl
and all of them unlike the bigint-cpp package which is gpl are either bsd or lgpl - not sure if it matters - but it might matter a lot

1546037
division	modulo
of course doing this by hand is easier if you don t actually need all the arithmetic operations division and modulo in particular are rather tricky

1546073
playstation	xbox
same holds true for playstation platform or older xbox etc

1546115
authentication	login
if the user successfully authentication then the user is sent back to the login page as though nothing happened no error messages etc.

1546147
value	field
for example i have x product rows all these rows represent distinct product but many have the same field value except their id and color_id are different

1546147
value	field
question is there a way to fill some rows fully then use a special value to points to certain field value

1546159
addition	division
however this is not true in the c# versioning because of the parentheses the addition will come first then the division

1546161
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are interested in good seo and a faster website asp.net-mvc is much cleaner html and faster than webforms

1546170

understand things like memory-management pointers stack variables scoping etc

1546172
value	field
create separate tables for the field1 field2 and field three value

1546209
hash	md5
you can t store them entirely secure because you d need to be able to encrypt and decrypt .so one-way hash algorithms like md5 sha-1 sha-2 wouldn t suffice

1546256
httphandler	httpmodule
but if you really need to you should have a look at both httphandler and httpmodule

1546256
httpcontext	httpmodule
this could be done in a httpmodule on the beginrequest event of the httpcontext

1546258
expression	evaluation
for some reason the evaluation of this expression is never true

1546267
execute	declare
i am trying to ports some code from ms-sql to mysql and there is this code that declare a variables and then execute some selected statements - it looks like

1546282
low-level	hardware
many of the proprietary non-eclipse based ide s from the likes of keil or iar are looking a little old fashioned and are seldom satisfactory as editor although they often offer a lot of low-level functionality in terms of target hardware and rtos awareness and simulation

1546292
javascript	dom
it simply returns the javascript dom elements for direct manipulation according to the wc3 specifications interpreter differently by different browsers unfortunately

1546304

works in at least ie firefox and google-chrome

1546314
dotnetnuke	umbraco
this is actually a problem with asp.net rather than merely umbraco - i found the answer on a dotnetnuke forum

1546315
any	set
not only is it not yet specified in unicode but there doesn t seem to be any standardised character set for it at all only ad hoc encoding generally using the unicode private use area

1546327
sql-server	mysql
try this for your mysql translation of your above sql-server code

1546337
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php
i can use either perl ruby or php

1546345
jquery	.post
wcf j.son service degrade gracefully down to working as a standards webservice .so you should have no problems using jquery to .post and retrieve data from them

1546346
textbox	button
i need to place controls such as button textbox and containers windows etc throughout the screens

1546358
expression-blend	designer	expression-blend	wpf
perhaps you can design using vs wpf designer or expression-blend and then write a converter from xaml to your format

1546365
expression-blend	wpf
you could use expression-blend to generator the xaml then you could parsing the xaml manually and generator the user-interface in dx instead of wpf

1546393
32-bit	64bit
for efficiencies in process most data types are stored at word-boundaries which means 4 bytes on 32-bit machines or 8 bytes on 64bit machines

1546422
16-bit	x86
i used it on 16-bit x86 hardware - that s how long ago it was

1546431
substring	charindex
from this i d assume that i d be able to cast this back to a string then do .some instring or charindex function to figure out where the underscore.js are .so that i can encapsulate all of that in a substring function to pick out the part i need

1546470
updating	updates
however if you want to become a rock-star developer it is best done by informal training- make unintentional mistakes and have senior developers curse at you learn a design pattern because an .app you are updating uses it almost cry because a bad developer wrote a huge messy program lacking documentation and best practices and now you have to do several updates to it asap

1546475
any	set
you specifically agree not to access or attempt to access any of the service through any automated means including use of scripting or web-crawler and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt

1546502
hash	md5
unicode or terminal 0 can wreak havok on the md5 hash and result in wildly different key from apparently the same password-hash

1546514
variables	boolean
which is better checkeded if each variables is -1 or using a boolean foundmatch to keep tracking and just checked that at the end

1546526
temporary	copy
in sql-server i can copy tables or temporary tables to new table using a syntax

1546527
protected	public
if you decide that it should become public protected or internal some day it s not difficult to refactor to a properties anyway and with tools like resharper it takes about 3 seconds to do so.

1546547
16-bit	8bit
among other things a conformant c90 implementation need not even have a 8bit int for example - it would be entirely legal to have a platform in which and it has a 16-bit machine words and cannot address individual bytes

1546562
order	add
otoh the foreign key suggests frequent querying by campaign in which case having the clustering done by that column could make sense and would also probably do a better job of scattering the insert key in the indexes - both the surrogate key and the timestamp would add recording in sequential order which is .net more work over time for insert because the nodes sectors are filled less randomly

1546571
internet-explorer	firefox
they do in internet-explorer but not in firefox

1546576
typename	typedef
typedef typename boost graph_traits adjacency_iterator adjacency_iter

1546577

if you want to scheduling payment i think you can use the mass pay api to programmatically send payment from the pprint account

1546579
webforms	asp.net
if you are using the default view engine the webforms view engine you may be able to use the standards asp.net tracing to see what is happening in the page

callback	methods
i suppose that you have a callback methods that takes care of the response for the request

1546622
callback	methods
in the callback methods after taking care of the response

1546628
python	ruby	python	c++
i must admit i ve never heard of a language being referred to as open source but i guess one way of viewing it is that the two examples you have given ruby and python are afaik and i m not an expert at all in either both non-compiled languages whereas c and c++ are compiled

1546628
python	ruby	interpreter	runtime
.so for client-side ruby and python applications you have to make the code available to the user since it gets interpreter at runtime whereas for compiled languages this is optional since only the compiled executable is required

1546628
python	ruby
of course on the other hand many ruby and python applications will be server-side as part of the implementation of a website for example and .so the code is interpreter on the server and therefore never visible by the end user

1546647
printf	scanf
in c s printf but not scanf f and linefeed are equivalent

1546649
average	minimum
if each of these letters is equally likely then the minimum numbers of bits required per letter on average is 2

bison	yacc
if you use c yacc and the gnu versioning bison are the standards generator

1546681
rvm	gem
with rvm you can al.so set up gem sets .so that it is easy to keep your sets up to-date on the different versioning of ruby you install

1546685
deprecated	checkstyle
checkstyle complains loudly about these but i d rather have it ignore them completely since i ve dealt with the problem by marking the field as deprecated

1546685
deprecated	checkstyle
but marking them as deprecated doesn t remove them from the checkstyle report

1546704
function-call	inline	inlining	inline
in computing inline expansion or inlining is a compiler-optimization that replace a function-call site with the body of the callee

1546707
python	ruby
this is the case with ruby python etc. where the language is effectively defined by its primary original implementation

1546713
inlining	inline
inlining .solves the performance and maintainability issue by letting you declare the function as inline at least in c++ .so that .when you call that function - instead of having your .app jumping around at runtime - the code in the inline-functions is inject at compile-time every time that given function is called

1546722
javascript	dom
since an id is supposed to be unique on a page the old value may simple be the value of the first div that javascript happens to find in the dom

1546750
checkbox	button
note that checkbox and radio button are button

1546751
oracle	mysql
in mysql there is group_concat aggregate-functions but in t-sql and oracle you need to use another approach.

1546791
implements	abstract
characters are a completely abstract concept and there s no way of knowing without reading the source how a given program including your web browser decides to implements them

1546791
any	set
a piece of text in unicode or in any other character set is represented as a series of code points int that are uniquely assign to characters which are named entities in a large database each of which has any numbers of properties such as whether it s a combining mark whether it goes right-to-left etc.

1546791
sequences	unique
utf-8 is an encoding or a transformation format in unicode-speak that represents each int code points as a unique sequences of bytes

1546791
contains	set
1 a program was asked to write some characters using some character set say iso-8859-1 that does not contains a particular character that appears in the text

1546791
contains	any
before sending an http-request the browser must turn a url which can contains any text at all into an iri

1546814
configuration	environment
the staging.rb file is a copy of the production.rb form the configuration environment folder

1546814
versioning	staging
since we were running the production server with updates versioning of nginx passenger and ruby higher patch level then staging but still 1.9 we began reverting each componentone at a time even going .so far as transferring all of the executable and support files basically everything we had install in usr local to the production machine to no avail

1546815
sftp	ftp
the zeus editor has a syntax highlighter that is fully configurable and it also can do seamless ftp sftp editing

environment	building
if you are and you really want to use notepad++ i would suggest using the windows platform sdk for a building environment compiler + linker and windbg for your debugger

1546874
revision	updates
i am pretty sure that .when you updates a page you never use put although you are technically creating a new revision of a page .so .post makes sense

1546892
children	nodes
i need to get the immediate children of nodes 1 and place them in the combo box

1546892
children	nodes	children	tree
.when a nodes is selected from the combo box list the tree should display only that nodes and its children

1546911
put	get
yes get put .post and delete are all restful call

1546911
web-services	api
rest is usually used in contrast to soap where a web service has the ability to describe itself and its api to a client and web-services can be discovered from directory

1546911
javascript	dom
ajax for the 5 year old child just means having .some .software running in the browser it might be javascript but it could al.so be java or flash make an http-request to the server and handle the response instead of the browser itself .so the display doesn t change until that client program running in the browser decides to modify the dom of the currently-displayed page

1546911
put	get
your example of get people 1523 and put people 1523 is perfectly valid though difficult to do with a regular webserver which won t understand what you want put to do

1546912
postgresql	mysql
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912
postgresql	mysql

1546941
deployment	install	binaries	install
some deployment tools that store the install as binaries could end up in situations where the binary source would exhibit mysterious problems that could never be tracked down properly

1547094
winmerge	utility
for source merging i use the utility winmerge which i find very good for keeping directory of source code in sync

1547121
any	set
the issue is that set does not have any defined order although in this case it s choosing sorted order but i do not believe the complexity requiredments of stl required that - another implementation may choose another order

1547124
required	checked
.so you click on the field and a drop-down menu popup with the ability to checked whichever options are required

open up safari firefox or whatever your using and empty the caching and delete all your cookies

1547855
any	set
nb the trouble with using directory.getfiles and directory.getdirectories to recurse sub-folders is that if there are any exception-handling throw related to security permissions the methods will return nothing whereas recursing manually allows one to handle those exception-handling and still get a set of files back

1547867
attributes	properties
i am pretty sure i ve seen a visual-studio options-like form somewhere before which was created dynamically with some attributes attached to the properties of the class to allow grouping and additional info

1547867

my suggestion is #2 -- you can load the rdlc file in memory and do your modifications there then call the reportviewer export function for that altered report

1547903
attributes	properties	user-controls	treeview
as you find a types get the attributes to determine where to place it in your grouping easiest thing here is to use a treeview call activator.createinstances to create an instances of the user-controls and store it in the tag properties

contains	set
.when the user click on an entry in the grouping a tree nodes get the tag and set the panels which contains the user-controls to the object in the tag properties

1547903
treeview	grid
you could go with a single properties grid that show all of the options or go with a hybrid approach with a treeview that grouping by major functions plugins capability etc. probably based on the types

1547910
export	report
the only thing i can suggest is that you stripes out all the formatting from the rdlc report file prior to export

1548228
processor	cpu
remember that a ht cpu doesn t have any extra execution resources alus load store units etc the performance improvement is due to better utilization of those resources since typical code especially on a modern processor spends a reasonable amount of time blocked waiting for memory loads and stores to complete before execution can continue

1548707
latitude-longitude	street-address
geonames etc. to convert from a latitude-longitude pair to a street-address

1548707
latitude-longitude	street-address
but if you have latitude-longitude pairs in your database already then i don t think you ever need to convert to a street-address

1548707
latitude-longitude	haversine
calculating distance is much easier if all your points are represented by latitude-longitude you can use the haversine formula

1548710
octal	hex
for instances on my machine alt-x has the hex code f8 or 370 octal .so putting

the built-in templates rules for root nodes and elements nodes is to process children

1549735
children	nodes
other than in those two respects children have no special status .when it comes to selected nodes to process

1550998
directory	folder
what this means is that if you do an export you cannot subsequently do a checkin from that exported directory because it lacks the .svn folder that are required for talking to the central svn repo

1551029
oracle	mysql
about the database use hibernate will allow you to use all sql databases oracle mysql etc....

1551042
contains	any
this even happens on the solutions that do not contains any powerdesigner model

1551058
lookup	any
while any bst lookup are at best amortized o log n n being the numbers of items in your tree

1551058
sorted	lookup
doing a binary-search on a sorted arrays and performance in lookup operations will depends on the numbers of items in your database

1551059
contains	any
i got file which containss simplexml structure to operate on xml i use classes bulit in framework 3.5 for string not containss backslashes everything works fine but in case strings i try to write contains backslashes final file isn t saved to disk no exception-handling or any kind of error at all

1551064
cryptography	security
if you need some pseudorandom bits for security or cryptography purposes g. random iv for block-cipher random salt for password-hash mt_rand is a poor source

1551064
linux	unix
on most unix linux and or ms-windows platform you can get a better grade of pseudorandom bits from the os or systemd libs like this

1551067
implements	extends
.when using rpc your servlet myserviceimpl needs to implements the methods of an interface named myservice besides extends the removeserviceservlet

1551067
callback	methods
this myserviceasync inteface should contains the same methodss as the myservice interface except each methods returns void and has an additional last arguments asynccallback callback

1551067
return-value	arguments
the onsuccess will have as arguments the return-value from what you returned in the methods implements by your servlet

1551068
environment	building
if you are seeing garbage you need to review your building cmd and building environment

1551068
bison	yacc
recommendation get hold of the o reilly book on lex and yacc from the libs or flex and bison an august 2009 updates rewrite - probably not in the libs yet

1551068
double	int
you probably need to ensure that and friend are of types double rather than the default types of int #define yystypes double

1551074
swing	awt
the painting in awt and swing article is a good place to start to get information on how painting works

1551075
hide	show
you could then use these helpers across different parts in your application to decide if you show or hide certain functionality

1551083
markup	xhtml
also for future reference you can checked the markup validity of your xhtml document by using the w3c markup validation service

1551092
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
then simply start off with all of those subnav divs hidden and apply the slider effect to show hide them during mouseover mouseout events

1551099
llvm	gcc
for maximum compatibility the gcc llvm compiler utilizes the llvm back-end with the gcc 4.2 parsing

1551125
numeric	digits	digits	base
i have a feeling based on their answer about product ids and two digits the answer they were looking for is to convert the numeric product ids into a different base systemd or packed form

1551130
nsscrollview	nstextview
updates relative to the questions and answers below it seems i have a misunderstanding of the nstextview class in relation to the custom classes i m trying to draw and the wrapping nsscrollview

1551140
32-bit	64bit
i am using vista 64bit with sun jdk 1.5.0_11 i tried with 64bit versioning and 32-bit versioning as well the problem is the same

1551145
directory	folder
usually jquery user-interface css files refer images from folder named images put is same directory as css file

1551146

s the best way to validation an xml file against an xsd file

1551170
codeigniter	kohana
or use an activerecord-like abstraction eg that used in codeigniter or kohana to a set of recording by passing in a criterion or a set of recording

1551178
lightbox	jquery	fancybox	lightbox
this form is in a lightbox using the jquery plugins fancybox

1551223
python	c++	python	java
- the holder trick non-idiom is a design smell which suggests looking for a different and more pythonic approach -- the one case where holder is justified is exactly the special case for which i designed it the case where you want to keep close correspondence between the python code and some non-python you re transliterating a reference algorithm in python and want it working first before refactoring it into a more pythonic form or you re writing python as a prototype that will be transliterated into c++ c# java etc once it s working effectively

1551224
administration	sysadmin
the only reason that prevents this is security if for some application is more sensitive and required a subset of administration sysadmin then it must be separated on a different instances

1551225
instances	private
and your lpthread_start_routine which you implements as a private static methods of the thread class then needs to cast back to thread instances

1551233
datagrid	listbox
i have to add listbox control in column header of datagrid

1551233
selected	listbox	datagrid	listbox
.when i mouse over on dept column header it has to show list of dept named and depend on listbox selected item i have to filtering my datagrid items

1551247
llvm	gcc
llvm-gcc gcc s front-end with llvm s back-end

1551247
llvm	gcc
llvm s back-end is faster than gcc s

1551247
llvm	gcc
some people say llvm s back-end generator better code than gcc s but your mileage may vary

1551295
32-bit	64bit
if you use pure .net code then just compile for any cpu the default and it will work in 32-bit and 64bit environment

1551295
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
however if any part of your application a c++ com dll is 32-bit then you have to change the compile types to x86 to force the entire application to run under wow64 as a 32-bit application or you have to rebuild get the dll in a 64bit native form

1551295
32-bit	64bit
essentially you cannot mix 32-bit and 64bit code in your application

1551300
display	height
right now inorder to get the row height i load in the images get their size properties and use that to figure out how high to make the rows calculating any necessary changes along the way since most of the images get resize before being display

1551303
silverlight	wpf
how about using silverlight wpf both are xml xaml based and support 2d and 3d graphics animation flows process in blend 3.0 and above

1551333
peer	p2p
we are designing a p2p applications using c++ which transmits voice to other peer using udp

1551333
buffering	capture
we are capturing a mic signals in a buffering in the thread which capture voice for one second in the while-loop

1551333
buffering	capture
for every second voice capture in buffering it splits it into packets and send to the other peer

1551333
linked-list	queue
implements a queue using a linked-list which maintains a queue of onesecvoice object or image object in case of image

1551333
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	queue
.so which to chose implements a queue using a linked-list or implements a queue using static arrays

1551341
cygwin	gnu
install unxutils - it s a set of gnu utilities ported to windows sort of like cygwin but they also work outside the cygwin environment

1551352
baud-rate	parity
if the baud-rate stop bits parity are not correct - sounds like you have this one covered

1551376
configuration	installation
although developing for sharepoint could be purely that development like creating web-parts etc. i strongly encourage you and your team to get to grips with sharepoint deployment installation and configuration as well

1551376
moss	wss
i am fully sharepoint certified wss configuration dev and moss configuration dev and having knowledge of both ends has been invaluable for me

1551376
moss	wss
i suggest taking an mcts wss 3.0 configurationuration training and or a moss configuration training for at least 1 or 2 of your team

1551395
linked-list	queue
and if your queue is going to get that large sometimes then maybe you need the flexibility afforded by a linked-list since it can grow to an arbitrary size

1551416
lightbox	jquery
if the lightbox plugins you are using is dynamically creating elements you should be using jquery s live function to bind your handler to all current - and future matched elements

1551436
stderr	stdout
i m writing a utility for running programs and i need to capture unbuffered stdout and stderr from the programs

1551436
stderr	stdout
capture stdout and stderr to separate files

1551436
buffering	streaming
the problem is .when piping output to a file the stdout streaming becomes block buffering rather than line buffering

1551436
fflush	gets
if the program crash the output never gets fflush and is blank

1551436
buffering	capture
.so i need to capture stdout without buffering or with line buffering

1551438
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i mostly do asp.net webforms and more recently asp.net-mvc

1551453
32-bit	64bit
most significantly 10.5 won t load an input manager into a 64bit process and has indicated that even 32-bit use is unsupported and will be removed in a future release

1551460
rhino-mocks	moq
moq or the next versioning of rhino-mocks

1551460
rhino-mocks	moq
ayende the creator rhino-mocks and kzu the creator of moq believes in design for testability and that mocking framework should help you to achieve this design .so they will not implements the features of i.solator even if it was easy

1551465
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	queue
linked-list will be the canonical approach implements a queue using static arrays is actually how i would go about it - .so as to reassemble the udp packets then probably pass the sequenced data to the ll .so it gets order

1551475
put	get
can someone show me really simple code how can i get such information that put in my uilabel

1551485
put	get
which will work find for get and put by order key it s only that if you do toarray you get a bizarre order that is only comprehensible to whomever wrote the hashmap implementation

1551499
ref	out
you can do two building one with opt ref and one without then run dumpbin symbols on the resulting binaries parsing out the symbols and diff the results

1551503
dependency-injection	inject
my initial thought was to create an interface for the data store and inject this into provider using dependency-injection

1551509
vbscript	vb6
you re going to have to learn vbscript which is effectively vb6

1551532
bmp	png
unfortunately .someone on another forum pointed out that line diagram are fuzzed on jpg files .so suggested that i change over to png or possibly bmp files both of which odt files allow to be insert

1551539
arguments	default
this lead me to try to make the templates arguments v have a default types which also doesn t work since you cannot apply a default types to a function templates arguments at least using vc++ 9.0

1551545
bmp	png
png bmp and dozens of other image-formats don t compress your diagram - compression is probably what your commentor was getting at

1551548
worksheet	excel
if i try to open excel manually on a different worksheet from the one the c# application is process the c# application fails with some hresult cryptic messages

1551550
latitude-longitude	location
you need access to a reverse geocoding which will take your latitude-longitude coordinates as input and return some kind of structured address of that location

1551560
command-line	cmd
murky is good for exploring the repository and basic cmd but you will need to know how to use the command-line as well

1551580
joomla	drupal
how is it done in the leading cms systemd like drupal joomla n2 wordpress and .so on

1551596
scala	java
can a scala program be running on a browser with disabled java plugins as scala is compiled to a jvm-bytecode

1551605
png	ico
i ve tried it with other images ico and png

1551607
scala	java
scala is almost always run on the server or as a normals desktop java application

1551610
scala	java
as far as i know it java and scala compiles to the same types of bytecode which is execute by the jvm

1551610
scala	java
therefore you cannot use neither scala nor java if the user has the plugins disabled

1551616
environment	building
more importantly can you take advantage of a parallels or shared building environment - from memory clearcase and perforce had mechanisms to handle shared buildinging

1551617
scala	java
as a scala class can extends a java one it is therefore perfectly possible to write an applet in scala

1551617
scala	java
however this cannot run if java is disabled in the browser as scala runs on the java virtual-machine

1551617
scala	java
in fact there s no difference between a compiled scala program and a compiled java program - they are both bytecode which is run on a jvm

1551639
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
what is not impossible and this goes for obfuscation as well is reverse-engineering the compiled or obfuscation code to figure out what it s doing

1551648
initializer	getter
the main ideas here are verify connection details initializer the connection write a static getter for her and use it as long as needed

1551648
getter	setter
where the setter and getter are simply

1551648
getter	setter
setter and getter with public visibility and static attributes

1551654
value	field
i would move settings that every product will have a different value to a field in the product table

1551672
utility	gnu
anybody s guess why gnu refers to these as archive in other environment this utility is called the librarian and the resulting files just libs

1551678
firefox	safari
if you get it going fine with ie7 8 latest firefox and safari you should be all right

1551678
enterprise	platform
as far as asp.net-mvc again it is a pretty solid platform that i think many enterprise will continue to support for years to come

1551685
asp.net-mvc	webforms
should i consider falling back to webforms until asp.net-mvc matures a bit more

1551708
ruby	php
which php framework should i choose if i want to be able to develop in both php and ruby and ruby-on-rails without having to make too much of a mental jump .when i move from one to the other

1551727
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is essentially a ports of ruby-on-rails to php

1551728
lightbox	jquery
the lightbox i am using takes a copy of these elements and makes changes to them and jquery can not see this but i have been told to reference the elements via classes which has worked but only up to this points

1551740
noclassdeffounderror	classpath
noclassdeffounderror always means that a class cannot be found .so most likely your classpath is not correct

1551741
double	int
usr .lib gcc i486-linux 4.0.1 .. .. .. .. include c++ 4.0.1 cmath 352 note double std pow double int

1551744
silverlight	wpf
basically wpf and silverlight makes heavy use of weak-references - this allows you to reference an object which the gc can still collect

1551751
double	int
the compiler tries to automatically convert the long-long int value to something else double or long etc.

1551755
conditional	operators
the if for while c statements are compiled to conditional jump assembly operators

1551778
strncmp	strcat
i have written the methods for strncpy and strcat but i m having some trouble understanding exactly what to return for the strncmp part of the exercise

1551796
any	set
i have an assignment to write among other things a set of prolog predicates that determine if any two binary-tree s are isomorphism to each other

1551809
debugging	trace
i find it kind of counter-intuitive i fail to see the connection between process and for instances the debugging and trace classes

1551840
floor	ceil
after looking at the source of numbers bytes human a perl-module that i like a lot for this i decided to add two options to the methods one to use 1000 byte blocks and one to use floor rather than ceil for the default rounding function

1551840
floor	ceil
ideally i would like to let the user pass a function as the value of but i can t figure out how to validation that it s either ceil or floor

1551843
arrays	loops
you re best using the foreach construct to loops over your arrays

1551844
directory	folder
i ve got a folder called code core and it is placed in a directory that is one level up from my project directory

1551868
constructor	object
c code doesn t have a lot of the weird stuff in c++ that makes it hard to debugging constructor destructor anything that happens with static global object during cpp_initialize time etc.

1551873
python	c++
if you want higher-level and object-oriented programming then i think c++ is just competed with others like python

1551882
getter	setter
if i have an object with 50 getter setter where every 10 of them is defined under a new interface and i types the object as one of those interfaces will it increase performance

1551887
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
all that said many project jump over c++ and go to languages like python java or ruby because they provide more abstraction and faster development

1551890
margins	padding
i d like to adjust the margins of containers divs and the padding for links within a list .so that the last line-item is as close as possible to the bottom of a variably sized image next to it

1551896
scheme	let
there s no reason to let the user pass a methods in if you re going to be that draconian about what they are allowed to pass you know there are other rounding scheme besides ceiling and floor right

1551907
e-commerce	product
i wonder if they wanted you to note that in an e-commerce application such as amazon s a common use case is reverse lookup retrieve the product id using the description

1551915
dreamweaver	notepad++
what exactly drive you to use dreamweaver over a tool such as notepad++

1551917
png	gif
png gif

1551935
google-maps	openlayers
we want to create a web map using one of the apis such as google-maps or openlayers inorder to display this info directing the user to the correct location on the map and ideally highlight the particular location for example using a shaded polygons or at least identifying it with some sort of marker

1551947
web-services	webserver
are your silverlight applications configure to reference the correct web-services not the visual-studio webserver

1551952
interop	tlbimp
you should use the tlbimp utility to generator an interop assembly from the com types libs and add a reference to the generator assembly with r compiler switching

1551956
interop	tlbimp
you can generator the interop wrapper with aximp.exe for activex controls or tlbimp for other com components

1551966
instance-variables	accessor
since other object need to manipulate our named and items instance-variables we use properties synthesize to generator accessor mutators for them

1551966
instance-variables	accessor
what are the advantages of declaring properties for all instance-variables declaring properties for iboutlet and using accessor mutators within your own class

1551971
linux	unix
you know that per.sonal preferences plays a big role in such decision and at that time the c workforce in unix linux project was far bigger than c++ .so the probability that the initial developer s for a new project were more comfortable with c was greater

1551990
javascript	dom
since this is javascript dom however i know there s a way to get in there and get each color component but i don t know what it is

1551993
wordpress	mediawiki	wordpress	magento	mediawiki	magento
i mainly develop for wordpress joomla magento mediawiki

1552014
ruby	php
given the following php example code how would i do this in ruby

1552017
interop	tlbimp
i have used aximp.exe and tlbimp in one of my project to generator the interop assemblies to overcome com component versioning difficulties and a batch-file with the call and comments is available

1552020
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works fine however in ie it s backwards

1552032
spawn	exit
odd problem now is that doing an exit 0 doesn t close the application though lighttpd thinks it s gone and spawn another

1552039
contains	elements
given an input that input is an elements of codeigniter if the it contains the digits i

1552042
gedit	vim
for example if the user chooses to edit the list of current usernames the list should open as a text file in the user s favorite editor vim gedit etc.

1552044
google-chrome	firefox
the code works flawlessly under firefox and google-chrome but bombs out in ie

1552050
selected	cell
the users should be able to selected any cell they want to enter updates the value then types in the value click submit and submit the value s

1552064
instance-variables	accessor
properties are used to generator accessor for instance-variables there s no magic happening

1552076
addsubview	dealloc
i assume you are asking if you should release the object right after addsubview or in dealloc

1552081
constructor	private
the simplest way to do dependency-injection that i ve seen and actually the only one i ve used .so far... is to have a constructor of your dependent class take the interface as a parameter and assign it to a private field

1552087
gedit	nano	gedit	kate	kate	nano
as far as i know sensible-editor doesn t exist on other distributions and of course xdg-open will fail in a text-only environment but it couldn t hurt to try as many options as possible if you think it s important that a desktop user can see their happy shiny gedit or kate instead of scary old vi or nano

1552116
.when	ready
.when using jquery you wait for the dom to be ready before you start doing stuff

1552131
margins	padding
i generally turn off an margins padding and line-height for li ul ol in css

1552139
authentication	login
i have users in my .app s database that represent the customer entity in the .application as well as the user in the authentication database that s used to login someone to the .app

1552144
constructor	object
if you want to get a jquery object from an elements - just pass it to the constructor

1552145
assign	add
it also means that i need to add data i need to insert a row into the measurement table get its assign pk and then add all the new rows to the measurement_data table right

1552154
buffering	streaming
on the other hand if you are process the data in streaming fashion reading a chunks then process it before reading the next smaller buffering might be more useful

1552154
buffering	streaming
you could set a 16k buffering on the underlying streaming and read individual data value with the binaryreader with ease

1552159
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i would say cakephp if u have to write an .app and coming from ruby-on-rails it ll be a lot easier to adjust your development compared to other php frameworks

1552164
versioning	upgrade
apache for example couldn t be nearly as cross-platform and easily extensible if it was in c++ - you d have to account for the name-mangling of a particular compiler and a particular compiler versioning - gcc has changed a few time in its history or required that everyone use the same compiler universally - which means that every time you upgrade your c++ compiler with a backwards incompatible name-mangling scheme you have to recompile all your c++ programs

1552173
order	add
you could also add ordinals numbers to measurement-data table to know order in which measurements were taken and add unique on measurement-id and ordinals-numer

1552181
contains	elements	contains	any
i m not familiar with nokogiri but are you trying to find all the children of any elements that contains a

1552185
javascript	dom
you ll save yourself a lot of time solving obscure browser specific javascript or dom bugs using the debugging platform specific to that browser

1552195
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as far as sitecore goes there is a learning curve but quite honestly in my case since i actually learned asp.net-mvc first as opposed to webforms the learning curve has also been slightly attributed to some of my inexperience with webforms

1552203
ubuntu	debian
this was maybe 5 years ago on a debian distrib and i don t know how does it work now for up-to-date debian distrib as ubuntu

1552207
margins	padding
i constantly make use of it prior to committing a change to a css stylesheet margins padding colors and the like

1552207
safari	opera
i recommend also familiarizing yourself with safari web-inspector and opera dragonfly

1552210
cygwin	gnu
i m guessing that you have a real bash console somewhere perhaps via cygwin and i would suggest retrying the bison cmd in the full gnu environment

1552224
any	set
how in the world can i set it s x and y points with any certainty as to where it will appear on the stage

1552255
margins	padding
you can use either top bottom margins or padding

1552258
terminal	prompt
simply prompt for the information reading a complete return-terminated line of response and allow the normals terminal input facilities to be used for basic editing

1552263
show	next
i would like to know how to reset the integration windows after every question is asked .so that the windows is clear for the next question to be show to the user but i do not want the score to be reset either .so that i can display the score at the end

1552267
subtraction	addition
.so if you make a new romannumeral class it makes sense to overload addition and subtraction etc

1552267
subtraction	addition
but don t overload it unless it s natural it makes no sense to defined addition and subtraction for a car or a vehicle object

1552272
firefox	safari
the shadowbox video plugins is not working in ie7 although it works fine in firefox and safari

1552273
administration	credentials
depending on the application your customer may not have credentials to login or you may have an administration user that logs in but isn t related to your application data

1552282
perl	php
you might want need to use a server-side scripting like php or perl to query for the ftp-server status

1552285
python	c++
python overloading is safer in general than c++ s -- for example the assignment-operator can t be overloaded and has a sensible default implementation

1552285
python	c++
in some ways though overloading in python is still as broken as in c++

1552291
textbox	button	input-field	textbox
the button are not click correctly and different input methods eg click on the textbox in some browsers will open the input-field

1552291
textbox	button
we would like to have the look-and-feel of the textbox and button to use the same css as the rest of our website

1552291
textbox	button
generics display of textbox and button field

1552299
python	c++
other special cases exist but resist the temptation of overloading operators just for coolness with no semantic connection to the normals meanings as c++ s streaming do for and and python strings in python fortunately not in any more

1552326
contains	any
is there any way to identify a formula of excel cell contains defined named by using vsto

1552337
global-assembly-cache	gac
assembly stdole versioning 7.0.3300.0 be install in the global-assembly-cache gac

1552341
substitution	replace
we could use another substitution to replace all double backslashes with something else

1552345
ssl-certificate	ssl
i need to use a 3rd party s web service and they required client authentication via ssl .so they generator and issued me an ssl-certificate

1552367
input-field	textbox
eg click on the textbox in some browsers will open the input-field

1552367
textbox	button
we would like to have the look-and-feel of the textbox and button to use the same css as the rest of our website

1552367
value	field
you styles a textfield and button however you like listen for changes to the file upload field and copy the value to the textfield to display

1552683
worksheet	excel
you wouldn t want the excel rendering to artificially create worksheet to try to paginate your report

1552683
attributes	properties
the web rendering page length is determined by the interactiveheight attributes of the report in the interactivesize properties in the properties panels for the report but the interactive height is an approximation rather than a fixed page break setting and your page break may still not conform to the pdf versioning even though the interactiveheight is set to the same length as your target page length

it s certainly not a generics solution since your code is now completely dependent on information in the xml - your methods can only count elements properly if the xml document it s process contains the flag attributes that you ve added

1553292
put	get
you could get the same information without having to put together the push arrays yourself

1553297
minimum	max
edit regarding your comment you just need to change the conditional for table t1 with the function for the minimum see the min t1.time above and the conditional for table t2 with the function for the maximum see max t2.time above .so it should be

1553511
python	php
just being curious is using regexp php python faster than using python xpath libs

1553511
python	php
is xpath libs for python generally faster than php s counterpart

1553525
python	php
most comparative operations in python are faster than in php in my subjective experience

1553935
png	gif
it makes the png transparency for ie 6 and you don t need to maintain two sets of images png and gif

1553939
callback	methods
.so you should use a callback methods to handle your data

1553947
compatibility	deprecated
all the new features were added to 2.4 the release was numbers 2.9 to make it clear that it was a special release and 3.0 just comes along and removes two of the things which were holding things back namely it will remove all the deprecated methods and classes many of which have been hanging around for a long time and the requirement for java 1.4 compatibility will be dropped .so java 1.5-level classes generics etc will be introduced as appropriate

1554017
linux	unix
but if you were going to do this in linux or unix i can think of three approaches

1554041
bug-tracking	mantis
i am using mantis php and mysql as a bug-tracking tool and i would like to extends it inorder to document requirements and technical specifications

1554050

i all given the following piece of xml what would the xsd look like that would ensure chema validation failed if mortgageproductinterestratecollarlimitpct was greater than mortgageproductinterestratecappedlimitpct

1554142
value	field
the problem is that the form is not valid unless the checkbox is checked .so there doesn t seem to be a way to get a false value from the field

1554149
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari needs a tweak for body and background issues

1554152
silverlight	wpf
i have no experience in silverlight but you said it is probably similiar in wpf .so i suggest this.

however it does not work to updates the revision history on source code

1554356

i thought that an html form has no effect on the layout of a page and that it is just a way to grouping field to send their value to the server in a single request

1554357
revision	svn
you do get id date revision etc but you need to set the svn properties -- see svn propset in the manual or help pages

1554375
margins	padding
in short a form is an elements that has display block and may have margins padding

1554382
margins	padding

different browsers have different default styles margins padding etc. to form controls

1554386
sql-server	mysql
mysql sql-server sqlite etc

1554386
postgresql	mysql
otherwise mysql is a reasonable choice for a free game database as is postgresql

the problem is that those date ranges overlap and the field can only hold one text value

1554488

1554535
value	field
prevent duplicates value from being entered into a combinations of field

1554535
value	field
create a multiple-field index using the field you want to prohibit duplicates value for

1554535
value	field
i got problems where i could still enter value if one of the indexed field has a spaces there is an option to checked ignore null value .when you set up the index but it didn t work for me but the solution worked because i won t have null value anyway

1554545
radio-button	selected
the way it works is there is a radio-button before each dropdown and ideally on selecteded the radio-button we simply get the current value display on the next selected - option

1554558
configuration	environment
i want to do this because i have the environment object store all my configuration value that other classes may use

1554560
background-color	transparency
.when you save the image as gif the program will convert any pixels that are partly transparency into either fully transparency if it s almost transparency or fully opaue by changing the color into what it would be if it was draw on a solid background-color called matte

1554560
background-color	display
if you need to display the image on different backgrounds you either need to use one image for each background-color or use the png file-format that can support an alpha channel

1554563
.when	ready
any of these work for you then all you need to do is avoid closing the file after reading one bitmap and perhaps doing some extra coding to block .when the next image is not ready yet

1554572
colorbox	jquery
then use colorbox via its iframe attributes to load the results of the controllers via jquery

1554573
command-line	cmd
please let me know which cmd should be used for updating the repository non recursively and over writing the changed files using command-line

1554617
getter	setter
the idea is to allow you to avoid having to write getter and setter until you actually need them

1554625
directory	folder
make sure every file is set to readonly in the solution directory set it on the root solution folder and configure it to propagate to children

1554629
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the answer is the link should trump the local file on most modern browsers but it really depends on the implementation with non-mainstream browsers although you probably don t really care about other browsers than ie firefox safari and google-chrome

1554633
rad-controls	telerik
i m currently evaluation some rad-controls from telerik just right now i m experimenting with the radgrid

1554651
configuration	environment
also you might want to see my .post environment variables are evil in case you were considering using environment variables for the configuration the named environment for the configuration sounds awfully ominous

1554653
folder	dir
i d like to diff two imap folder on two different servers to compare spam filtering i d like to have a command-line tool linux to get just the headers not the whole dir using isync or similar something like this

1554670
installshield	nsis
i m looking for a tool that s able to create setup package for linux just like the windows install creators do nsis installshield etc.

1554686
progress-bar	progress
i m using masm to building a downloading program but the thing is that i don t know how to use a progress-bar to show the progress of the downloading i m using urldownloadingtofile like this

1554697
attributes	properties
it also references the proper attributes of the html img elements src that corresponds to the imageurl properties of the server side image control

1554697
contains	elements
it appears that you may be trying to match several image elements that contains the text getquote in their ids like getquote1 getquote2 etc.

1554705
filtering	grouping
i have the following query which grouping some recording and then filtering where the count of the grouping recording is 1

1554714
contains	any
i suppose is any css class allowed to contains special chracters

1554725
any	set
nor have i assessed any issues relating to the non-ascii character set

1554739
arrays	loops
al.so images should be one string not an arrays of strings .so your loops is al.so at fault

1554741
versioning	upgrade
this could indicate component rules violations in a minor upgrade specifically the addition of a component in a newer versioning looking like the removal in your older versioning - see heaths s commentary though it appears the should force a major upgrade

1554741
versioning	upgrade
if relevant add another component and file to the upgrade versioning

1554742
postback	ajax
the action that causes this code to execute must be a postback event and not an ajax call

1554768
font-size	display
i want to display all the tooltip in my webpage is user defined like user defined boxsize forecolor backcolor font-size etc

1554773
linux	bsd
installing software on linux bsd is usually done by the package-management systemd

1554773
linux	bsd
what this package-management systemd is depends on the linux distribution or bsd variant

1554776
event-listener	listener
the problem is now your event-listener is probably listening for an event represented by the string saved in result and obviously this changes after the first time it s set .so there s no way to assign a listener to it

1554781
ncurses	gtk
it supports ncurses and gtk based setup programs

1554792
cursor	row
now someother developer has used a cursor to fetch rows from openxml and then has applied all the business rules on each row and after that each row is insert in a table

1554797
order	join
for the join you do with proc sql the index may not help because the observations are already order by j and k and there are faster ways to do merging than using indic

1554798
google-chrome	firefox
first of all some of the biggest open source project are written in c++ openoffice.org firefox google-chrome mysql .

1554824
union-all	union
the union will eliminate duplicates in each query use union-all for each

1554851
default	reset
once i ve set either the width or percentwidth properties on a flex labels is there a way to reset the width to its default the width of the text plus padding

1554851
default	reset
obviously i could use two separate labelss one for each of the above cases but i m curious if it s possible to reset the labels to its default behavior

1554861
google-chrome	firefox
i have an asp.net 3.5 application which i m trying to run on ie firefox and google-chrome

1554861
google-chrome	firefox
on ie and google-chrome everything works just fine but firefox causes trouble

1554862
expression	evaluation
i think trace may be what you want although in practice i would expect a good debugger with expression evaluation and conditional breakpoints might solve your overall problem more quickly

1554876
multiplication	exponent
updates you may be able to squeeze even a little more speed out of matlab by using find to get the indic of the ones avoiding the element-wise multiplication and potentially reducing the numbers of exponent calculations needed and using the pow2 function instead of 2. .

1554889
boolean	int
for your particular example you need an imultivalueconverter that will convert the two int to a boolean value representing whether the menu item is enabled or not

1554897
administration	account
try to start the application with an administration user that is not your own account

1554907
assign	add
add a reg_expand_sz and assign the path to your dll to it

1554940
contains	any
you aren t using jsf in any way - this is a plain html page that invokes a jsp which doesn t contains any jsf tags

1554951
lightbox	jquery
however i m trying to use a lightbox plugins with jquery since i want to keep the same functionality but don t want to include 10 different libs

1554951
lightbox	jquery
if i remove the jquery include and keep lightbox it works great

1554951
google-chrome	firefox
if i put it back it break it just brings up the full size image instead of the box neither google-chrome or firefox s console complains about anything it just goes straight to the image

1554951
lightbox	jquery
i tried 5 different lightbox clones plugins for jquery but they all gave me the same behavior which leads me to think there s something i m missing

1554975
lightbox	jquery
doesn t lightbox attempt to include it s own copy of jquery or something similar

1555020
javascript	dom
client using javascript dom

1555046
derived-class	inherited
that might cut the amount of boilerplate actually required in each derived-class since constructor are the one thing that can t be inherited from the base

1555048
performance-monitor	perfmon
the best tools for that are sql profiling and sometimes windows systemd monitor aka performance-monitor aka perfmon

1555074
double-quotes	single-quotes
author may also use numeric character references to represent double-quotes and single-quotes

1555089
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and ie however google-chrome just seems to ignore it

1555126
iprincipal	iidentity
i did see the following .post on .so but it didn t seem to cater for what i m trying to achieve asp.net-mvc - set custom iidentity or iprincipal

1555137
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
on a debian gnu linux or ubuntu systemd simply run

1555140
value	field
i started thinking this pattern seems to very similar to the inotifypropertychanged pattern and i started thinking about implementss a similar pattern and having each textfield implements an onchanged event that would updates it s related value in the person object that sits in the view state however the further i thought on that it required numerous server request every time a person mouses out of a field and seems like it could lead to scalability issues at some points

1555140
any	set
and set on any methods that invokes a postback ie usually just the submit button to set isdirty true and then it will skip repeat alot of work for no reason

1555142
value	field
in our case it was an old product the bug was already fixed in a newer release that accepted value in a field that were not within the defined range similar to having a not null field contains null

1555148
required	checked
handling it in the dal - this required multiple call to the database to checked if any data has changed prior to saving it

1555148
required	checked
handling it in a save stored proc - this would required the stored proc to potentially make an extra needless call to the table to checked but would save the extra call from the dal to the database

1555151
any	set
the thing to keep in mind is that there is no set rules that grouping 3 will exist or any grouping for that matter

1555164
python	c++
wrt python qt+symbian c++ seem like safer bets for cross device compatibility

1555169
getter	setter
in languages that rely on getter and setter like java they re not supposed nor expected to do anything but what they say -- it would be astonishing if x.getb did anything but return the current value of logical attributes b or if x.setb 2 did anything but whatever small amount of internal work is needed to make x.getb return 2

1555169
python	java	getter	setter
the behavior of x.b accesses and assignments such as in languages which do have properties a set of languages which include but is not limited to python is exactly the same as for getter and setter methods in java the same expectations the same lack of language-enforced guarantees

1555169
attributes	properties	getter	setter
in python specifically there s one more great upside to using properties or other descriptors in lieu of getter and setter if and .when you reorganize your class .so that the underlying setter and getter are not needed anymore you can without breaking the class s published api simply eliminate those methods and the properties that relies on them making b a normals stored attributes of x s class rather than a logical one obtained and set computationally

1555169
attributes	properties
in python doing things directly .when feasible instead of via methods is an important optimization and systematically using properties enables you to perform this optimization .whenever feasible always exposing normals stored attributes directly and only ones which do need computation upon access and or setting via methods and properties

1555169
getter	setter
.so if you use getter and setter instead of properties beyond impacting the reliability of your users code you are al.so gratuitously wasting machine cycles and the energy that goes to their computer during those cycles

1555169
getter	setter
but you miss the fact that the same user in a language such as java where getter and setter are pervasive wouldn t expect observable side-effects as a result-of calling a setter either and even less for a getter

1555169
getter	setter
they re reasonable expectations and it s up to you as the class author to try and accommodate them -- whether your setter and getter are used directly or through a properties makes no difference

1555169
getter	setter
getter and setter exactly like properties are tools towards this goal

1555178
viewdidappear	viewdidload
i ve tried adjusting the content size of the uitextview in viewdidload and also in viewdidappear and that doesn t make a difference

1555179
contains	elements
.when i create a paragraph that contains an or a or even some which uses a different font-size than the i notice that these elements increase the line-height by a pixels or two

1555197
contains	set
i m wondering whether i should put those in the .test package of a common module that already contains shared-libraries for the main code or whether i should have a new module test that i can set up a different dependency scoping for in maven

1555199
any	set
.so any child controls of the form that you set opacity on will have their opacity changed

1555226
.when	ready
the webserver has another bare git repository that i can push to over ssh .when i am ready to deploy

1555226
push	pull
what i could do is to create another non-bare git repository on the webserver and do a manual pull after each push but i was hoping to avoid having to login to the webserver each time i do a git push

1555232
include	ssi
what i did was i edited 404.shtml to include this server side include ssi code

1555237
margins	padding
what i do is use pixels for font-size and box dimension positioning but try to use em for line-height margins padding etc.

1555241
put	get
i am trying to get the regex string from a table but as soon as i put it into preg_match it throw an error about an unexpected

1555262
scala	java
i m using java s java.util.date class in scala and want to compare a date object and the current time

1555265
meta-inf	jar
as i understand it the jar signer tool ignore the contents of the meta-inf directory .so that the signing process does not change the digest value of the jar file

1555270
subclassing	superclass
you can polymorphism this by designing a gr2v superclass with the validation methods and the data-members then each reader subclassing off of gr2v and fills up the data with its own readparsefile methods

1555274
authentication	login
if i have a site that uses cookies for authentication .so .when the user returns they don t have to login again

1555281
assign	add
if speed is the primary concern which it almost always isn t at least not in this way then you might also want to .profile an arrays - harder more expensive to add remove of course - but if you are just querying assign by index it should be the fastest

1555283
firefox	safari
i have safari on my mac as the default but i also have firefox install and running

1555286
any	set
after that you set how you want any individual elements to be sized in relationship to each other basically in relationship to what they already are .

1555287
sniffing	traffic
is it possible to detection if a h.323 connection phone call is up by simple sniffing traffic on an adjacent nodes

1555297
stderr	stdout
in most implementation of stdout and stderr that i ve seen stdout is buffering and stderr is not

1555309
scala	java
take a look at joda time which is an improved date time api for java and should work fine with scala

1555323
dialog	pop-up
there is the dialog jquery plugins that can help you to show modal pop-up dialog

1555324
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
jquery is works for ie 6.0+ firefox 2+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.0+ google-chrome

1555339
font-size	height
the line-height will stay at the same computed height for the size of an â emâ on that elements even .when you change the font-size on a descendant elements

1555339
put	get
with relative font-sizes it is generally best to keep the numbers of declarations down to a minimum because they nest that is with your if you put a blockquote inside a blockquote you d get a font-size of 1.5 1.5 2.25em compared to the body font-size

1555346
lightbox	jquery
you could also use the jquery lightbox plugins

1555376
webforms	asp.net
for a developer who likes working in asp.net webforms would anyone recommend going towards a sharepoint shop

1555380
publishing	release
we ll be publishing updates sdk samples .when beta 2 is release

1555384
superscript	subscript
you may also want something to deal with superscript and subscript if your example doesn t already take care of it

1555424
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe mysql or postgresql have pivot functionality - you d have to use case statements

1555427
put	get
that is you should be able to delete it and next time you rebuild it gets recreate and any references get copy-paste into it without any hassle and not to put your eggs all in one basket

1555430
pixels	line
the line height would then be equals to 14 pixels

1555439
ubuntu	debian
we are using ubuntu only and use debian package to distribute building across our servers and control them with init scripting

1555461
annotations	mapping
no there s no mapping or annotations like that

1555500
put	get
on the whole it s fine but i m stuck on an issue where if i try to put a timestamp from an dto into a hidden-field i get this error at runtime

1555510
any	set
the icons display in windows-explorer for any .net application is the assembly icons which can be set in the project settings in visual-studio

1555512
show	next
where i work we use php to building mockups to show customers and get them to sign off on our ideas and then we write the actual product in a compiled language like .net or java since that s the code we ll need to maintain for the next decade or more

1555513
setinterval	settimeout
no there is not just polling with setinterval or settimeout or callback

1555517
python	php
i have a two website in php and python

1555517
python	php
.when a user send a request to the server i need php python to send an http-post request to a remote-server

1555517
python	php
is it possible to continue running a php python scripting after sending a response to the user

1555517
python	php
is it possible to create a nonblocking http client in php python without handling the response at all

1555517
python	php
a solution that will have the same logic in php and python is preferable for me

1555524
any	set
unfortunately any time you set the clipboard s data with clipboard.setdataobject you ll redraw the clipboard since you re changing its contents

1555531
python	php
there are a few similar questions like this one for php python but no existing question on .so

1555533
delta	diff
i m looking for a libs c++ java that would allow me to create a binary diff and send only the delta and the matching patch to merge the data back

1555534
.war	jar
if you sign the .war it will be treated as jar .so all the rules will apply

1555537
triggers	insert
then have an insert triggers on your table that pull the next sequences numbers puts it into the category_sequences column and increment the next_sequences field would have to all be done in a single transactional

1555552
syntax-highlighting	textmate
however i do miss textmate and syntax-highlighting

1555577
codeigniter	cakephp
does such a thing already exist in codeigniter cakephp etc

1555578
exception-handling	try-catch
editing this 7 years later - one important note is that if e is not caught by a try-catch block further up the call stack or handled by a global exception-handling handler then the finally block may never execute at all

1555597
double	int
for example any idiot well most idiots can write a routine that calculates the standards deviation of a list of int float double etc in c++ it is straightforward to write easy to read and performs as fast non-generic code

1555597
comma	words
4 trying to use foreach iterator .when i want to do the same thing every time except something slightly different the last time such as concatate a bunch of strings with comma between them and the words and between the last two

1555606
python	perl
easier in perl or python

1555608
codeigniter	kohana
kohana which branched off of the codeigniter framework supports php5 and allows seo friendly urls with their uri libs and router class

1555633
arrays	loops
i think you can create count arrays for each of your criterion and loops all your input data

1555639
entity-framework	nhibernate
technologies i would prefere are asp.net-mvc and nhibernate with linq or the entity-framework

1555645
any	set
themes are similar to cascading styles sheets in that both themes and styles sheets defined a set of common attributes that can be applied to any page

1555645
treeview	gridview
for example using themes you can specify the graphics for a treeview control the templates layout of a gridview control and .so on

1555645
any	set
by default any properties value defined in a themes referenced by a page s themes properties overrides the properties value declarative set on a control unless you explicit apply the themes using the stylesheetthemes properties

1555646
wamp	php
strict standards non-static methods pear getstaticproperty should not be called statically assuming this from incompatible context in d wamp bin php php5.3.0 pear pear html bbcodeparser.php on line 169

1555653
web-applications	security
does ssl provide any types of security other than simply encrypting the content of the http-request for web-applications

1555658
value	field
for example to get value of this field

1555661
copy-constructor	constructor
but .when i try to do this it keeps trying to call my copy-constructor instead of an overloaded constructor

1555665
double-quotes	single-quotes
or maybe go one step further and substitute single-quotes for double-quotes...but then you d have to consider the cases where the user-input contains both single and double-quotes

1555679
switching	screens
this doesn t flag any glerrors but i m clearly missing something as nothing is appearing on screens after i switching over to my new fbo

1555680
any	set
for example there may well be validation applied in any situation where the field can normally be set or other field may be changed at the same time

1555681
type-safety	generics
no blanket statement is issued about arraylist although the general consensus is to use generics lists for performance type-safety and having a strongly typed collections

1555683
value	field
then you use the field object to get the value on an instances of the class

1555685
keyboard	mouse
letting getcursorpos apart what you essentially want to do here is to emulate user-input like motion of the mouse pointers to a given location or mouse button keyboard input

1555696
constructor	object
in scala constructor parameters are visible from anywhere within the class i see it more like object parameters

1555709
python	php
in php you can close the connection by sending this request this is http related and works also in python although i don t know the proper syntax to use

1555712
append	input
for the code above it looks like should be one of the elementss you append there in which case innerhtml is no good as it will only search the contents of the input which is nothing as input is an empty elements

1555712
javascript	dom
alternatively retain your own lookup in javascript rather than putting everything in the dom

1555713
value	field
once that s done you can use the get methods on the field instances to access the value of the str field

1555719
iostream	boost
i ve tried the following code with both normals ifstreams and the current boost iostream i m using both have the same result

1555728
copy-constructor	temporary
such a copy-constructor cannot be invoked with temporary object as an arguments since a non-const reference cannot be bound to a temporary object

1555728
copy-constructor	temporary
your initializer are temporary object meaning that there s absolutely no way a copy-constructor can be called here

1555728
copy-constructor	constructor
you are saying that the copy-constructor is called instead of the conversion constructor

1555728
constructor	object	copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	constructor
firstly the conversion constructor is called inorder to create an intermediate temporary object of singly-linked-list types from the string you supplied that involves constructing a temporary std string object as well and then the copy-constructor is called inorder to initializer the arrays elements from the temporary this happens for each elements in the arrays

1555757
google-chrome	safari
it also works in safari google-chrome

1555764
buffering	streaming
fgets reads in at most one less than size characters from streaming and stores them into the buffering pointed to by s

1555772
instances	private
.when you added a private field it was an instances variables which means that there is a copy of it associated with each instances of the class

1555777
llvm	gcc
granted i would expect to be able to generator coverage files that work using gcc 4.2 or one of the llvm compilers but for the moment this seems to have me slightly less crippled than before

1555787
google-chrome	safari
problem is this doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

1555787
google-chrome	safari
any other way to add a tooltip or any way to fix this in google-chrome and safari

1555865
web-services	api	account	api
you can use the membership api where ever you like but i would think heavily on whether or not you can secure your web-services sufficiently that they cannot be abused and by abused i mean someone coming in and pounding your web-services to lock out account guess user named and passwd and exploit whatever other functionality you wish to provide

1555866
boost	stl
for higher-level stuff particularly in c++ you probably want to learn some of the popular libs going around stl boost etc.

1555866
malloc	free
that means malloc free new delete all that other weird c++ stuff copy constructor and pointers in general

1555867
google-chrome	safari
i know what you are suffering as the tooltip appear as expected in ie but in google-chrome safari they tend to be blank boxes

1555884
printf	scanf
sscanf works like scanf only instead of process the standards inputstream it process a string that you pass to it the same way printf and printf are related

1555885
exception-handling	try-catch
if the fatal exception-handling is not surrounded by try-catch blocks then you must register a global handler and use register_shutdown_function to checked for an error at scripting end

1555956
ruby-on-rails	rspec	cucumber	selenium	cucumber	webrat
there are a lot of interesting gem beyond the classic ruby-on-rails gem pack cucumber formtastic rspec shoulda coulda webrat selenium will_paginate authlogic searchlogic inherited-resources .

1555978
python	java	spaces	output
i want to put the output of the python application in this spaces like i can do with servlets java

1555979
business-process	bpm
with a business-process oriented bpm systemd you typically write an orchestration to direct the flow of logic

1555984
datagridview	databound
is this datagridview databound

1555988
dialog	pop-up
i have tried the blockui plugins and removing the dialog styles to prevent its overlay showing but although it looks right on screens it disables all the controls including the ones in the dialog pop-up

1556016
contains	any
.so the gac no longer contains references to 9.0.2.7 there are no references to it in the registry there are no paths to the old provider directory in the project or delphi options dialog the old provider assembly is not on the filesystems and 9.0.2.7 does not appear in any of the project files

1556032
variables	boolean
to abort a thread properly the thread should periodically checked some kind of flag be it a simple volatile boolean variables or an event object

1556033
decrement	increment
particularly .when you re using multithreading increment and decrement the reference count can take a significant amount of time

1556044
response	timeout
i m have a servlet for usual browser that wait several seconds and all ok but another servlet for accessing from pda fail on long timeout and i m return response imm

1556065
python	java
scenario a program running in a byte code virtual-machine like java or python wants to evaluate by compiling on-the-fly to byte code and then running a function whose code was automatically generator or supplied from outside

1556065
python	java
this doesn t necessarily have to be doable in an existing virtual-machine like java or python

1556088
attributes	properties
i also looked at all of the directory entry properties - the core properties are there but if i use active-directory explorer to browser an actual user object there are many more attributes listed

1556112
contains	elements
the following markup will have some extra elements inject into it ie a div contains some flash for example

1556114
appdata	temp
configuration data that you want to stick around should go in appdata and temporary files should go in temp

1556115
default-value	default
also if the bl says that the user must be disabled by default and explicit enabled should i prefer an enable variation considering that the default-value for system.boolean is false

1556135
attributes	properties
properties such as width and padding look like regular xml attributes

1556209
arrays	loops
for some elements of the arrays not all n then you ll have garbage in the other elements which will cause the heap-corruption detected in the delete loops you see

1556225
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
programfiles for native 32-bit and 64bit applications and programfiles x86 for 32-bit applications running on x64 respectively overwriting each other s data and settings

1556268
return-value	arguments
as the arguments and its return-value is checked 0 means true and means false yes 0 really means true here because 0 is the ok exit code in unix

1556270
codeigniter	kohana
it s quite ironic because at first i did use codeigniter and just didn t like it but then i found kohana which is a codeigniter fork and it s great

1556270
cakephp	kohana
and yes you can do items apple-ipod-touch-16gb in kohana without setting up any router as-per cakephp

1556275
cassini	iis
the machine is running windows 7 with iis 7 but this instances is running under the webserver built into vs cassini

1556295
json	xml
if there is either no need to retrieve data by these attributes or searching can be deferred to the application once a chunks of data has been retrieved i recommend storing all the attributes in a single textfield using json yaml xml etc.

1556298
selected	checkbox
users expect to be able to selected multiple items via checkbox on any numbers of pages

1556298
postback	ajax	filtering	sorting
caching on the server in session or .app caching use postback or ajax panels to facilitate efficient paginator sorting filtering and searching

1556298
json	xml
most browsers can handle json xml natively - decent libs exist for manipulation jquery

1556298
filtering	sorting
caching on the client using a compressed encode representation of the data - callback into server to decode .when switching pages sorting filtering and searching

1556298
json	xml
slightly improved memory usage on client over json xml

1556298
json	xml
slower performance due to network i o as compared with pure client-side caching using json xml

1556309
contains	elements
this tells you how many elements are contains inside

1556310
decrement	increment
...and this would be an example of the reason why i find the .post pre- increment decrement operators to be highly unreadable .when used in an expression with other operators

1556310
post-increment	pre-increment
note the use of the pre-increment operators instead of the post-increment .so that the compiler doesn t think it needs to keep a copy of the old value

1556312
contains	elements
you can ask a vector how many elements it contains using the .size methods

1556325
any	set
you can set the custom action to run based on any conditional including a checkbox in a dialog

1556344
hash	md5
if normalizing means changing too much code but you can change your schema a little bit you may want to consider creating 128bit hash for your string columns using the md5 function

1556348
stderr	stdout
capture stdout in a string stderr and exit status

1556363
font-size	width
second example break page structure because font-size increases and thus the content exceeds div s width

1556370
designated-initializer	initializer
all objective-c classes have by conventions a designated-initializer which is the initializer methods that must be called either explicit or via an other convenience initializer

1556370
designated-initializer	initializer
failure to cause the designated-initializer leads to undefined and likely incorrect behavior because the instances is not guaranteed to be properly initializer

1556370
attributes	properties
i would guess that the nsmanagedobject initializer sets up the machinery to support synthesize d properties access for the entity s attributes

1556371
sql-server	oracle
i am working on some software that has to create dummy entries in various databases oracle db2 sql-server temporary

1556376
required	checked
this will required many runs to figure out whether a set of chosen parameters are indeed good and on the other hand there is a huge set of parameters value yet to checked

1556407
csv	xml
how can i convert them into xml csv something much simpler that can be read by scripting etc

1556414
operators	keyword
without it rebind could be considered a variables or a constants in this case a types due to the typesname keyword and the following could be interpreter as a less-than operators

1556418
32-bit	64bit
we have a set of asmx but could be wcf 64bit web-services which need to execute some 32-bit managed-code the apis have 32-bit com dependencies and cannot be execute in 64bit for process on the same physical machine

1556456
contains	set
you need to restore from files which are contains in the backup set rather than the backup set directly

1556487
xsd	xml
i need to validation xml against xsd and .so what are free xml validation available out there that could be useful for my task

1556506
revision	svn
svn recognized the keyword tag and replace it with the revision numbers

1556513
perl	c++
xerces has java c++ and perl versioning

1556515
facebook-apps	facebooker
i just ran into this after a long time away from dealing with facebooker and writing facebook-apps

1556515
facebooker	fbml
it makes sense that facebooker won t send fbml to an iframe because a browser wouldn t know how to rendering and fbml tags

1556535
switching	screens
we did it with sdl but the performance was unsatisfactory .so we decided to switching to opengl which proved much faster of course then there was a push to implements more features requiring us to redraw entire screens every frame

1556535
frame-rate	fps
if a single layer of tile is laid before buffering swap it yield 80 fps if two layer are laid frame-rate drops below 60 fps

1556547
32-bit	64bit
if you re going to use 32-bit for your x and y coordinates then you need a generator with at least a 64bit period

1556549
revision	updates
one implements you have just to updates the revision numbers and maybe clean the caching if you use it to updates on every page

1556556
.net	wcf
however no matter what s the final answer i d suggest to have a look at wcf - it supports .net pipe binding and lots of others like binary tcp soap with or without ws- specifications just by changing the configuration and handles the server activation and multithreading for you

1556566
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces and richfaces are both solid

1556588
keyboard	mouse
for example is there any integration with a mouse or keyboard and does that logic impact the frame-rate

1556595
ref	out
in general if it says out you should use a ref parameter it makes is easier on any future developers trying to figure out how the code is working

1556597
lightbox	jquery	fancybox	lightbox
i would like to use jquery fancybox or lightbox to load a contact form from a standards link in a webpage

1556597
fancybox	lightbox
my heart is not set on using fancybox .so if there is a better way to have the lightbox effect with a contact form i would appreciate .someone points me in the right directions

1556607
triggers	insert
then it is easier to answer as you can say that the application spends 3 in the database and out of that 27 are in selected and the rest are insert that involve triggers

1556614
fancybox	lightbox
it s highly customizable and can be made to work exactly like lightbox fancybox and supports everything you would need for a contact form from a regular link

1556628
entity-framework	ado.net
theres also some providers for oracle for the ado.net entity-framework

1556637
solaris	linux
works on windows linux macos x solaris android

1556645
contains	elements
i receive the following error sequences contains more than one elements .when trying to populate my promotion table object

1556646
where-clause	sql
it allows you to building string-based query statements similar to a sql where-clause

1556655
string-search	substring
i was browsing through an article comparing various string-search algorithms and noticed they were all designed to find the first matching substring

1556655
arrays	loops
i m sure i could create a loops that used a variant of kmp or bm and dumped each found occurrence into an arrays but this hardly seems like it would be the fastest

1556668
python	perl
the problem however is that we would like to leverage our existing perl codebase in the python gui

1556668
python	perl
invoke those perl executable in python as systemd call

1556668
python	perl
write perl executable on-the-fly inside the python dashboard and invoke the temporary perl executable

1556675
pointers	stack
using iterator a possible alternative is to have one struct nodes object in your function and passing a pointers to it in the recursive call where you use the pointers for the next link of the nodes object in that functions stack frame

1556711
implements	extends
i d like to somehow extends the generator service reference client to implements ienlistmentnotification as to support transactional process

1556718
sql-server	mysql
i would seriously doubt that swapping sql-server out and mysql in would make any difference at all

1556718
sql-server	mysql
if it were that simple and mysql had such an across-the-board performance advantage over sql-server sql-server s market shared would drop to zero overnight until the discrepancy was rectified

1556732
pointers	stack
it s possible to use the c++ address-of operators to retrieve a pointers to an object on stack instead of dynamically allocation memory with new

1556748
base-class	inherited
tableadapters don t even inherited a common base-class .so you can write generics code well they do inherited from component but that s pretty useless...

1556752
configuration	environment
1 configurationuration file difference between servers - we have environment folder in our project that we store the configuration files in to enable keeping multiple versioning

1556752
environment	building
our building scripting are then built to accept a parameter for environment and pull the correct environment folder overwriting the original files as it deploys them

1556752
.when	ready
then .when ready to deploy we merge it to the correct environment branch

1556752
environment	building
a building tool is monitor those environment branches and auto-deploys to the correct branch .when the code is committed

1556801
put	get
moreover if i copy pasyte showutilitytype function and put inside my .mxml page i don t get this error either

1556807
value	field
you can only perform a distinct on all the field you selected not just on one field which value would you take for other field

1556810
dictionary	arrays
also .when an object is added to an nsarrays or nsdictionary is it retained by the arrays or dictionary .when added and release .when removed

1556811
child-process	spawn
you can spawn a child-process and use an ipc mechanism like sockets or stdio or even embed one interpreter in the other

1556811
perl	tcl
but why switching languages .when perl offers several tk tk tkx and tcl tk binding and a very capable wx binding

getter	setter
i was at the flex jam in ann arbor and i thought james did this with getter setter with his cairngorm example

1556841
dictionary	arrays
anytime you add key or object to dictionary or arrayss the arrays or dictionary will retain it

1556843
python	perl
this lets you write python inside a perl scripting

1556843
python	perl
you still have to write perl but it would let you use python libs inside perl scripting

1556868
triggers	insert
add a triggers to parsing the info in the old field to the related table on insert and updates

1556870
versioning	upgrade
well you saved yourself having to tell them to do an expensive refactor .when they upgrade to the newest versioning of foo

i would like a way to set the viewmodel arguments and environment variables to a default for the entire project and have new run configuration include the default entries

1556885
environment	execution
from what i can tell execution environment maybe do something like this but i seem to need the pde to get them to work

1556885
arguments	default
i can t use the default viewmodel arguments setting in the jre definition panels because my dll depends on a numbers of others and java.library.path isn t used for dependency resolution path is

1556891
ssl-certificate	ssl
in other words it seems that the ssl authentication used by the .net is hardcode to checked the current user store and the local machine store for trusted roots .when validation an ssl-certificate but is there any clean way to get it to checked the service account store instead of or in addition to the other stores

1556893
directory	folder
and nothing else happens no errors or warnings or anything else i checked folder artifacts but it is-empty i tried this on server 2008 and server 2003 with cruisecontrol.net 1.4.4 and 1.4.4.sp1 i also tried checked repository out to my working directory manually but this did not change a thing

1556926
worksheet	excel
a few articles on how to do this inorder to read value from an excel worksheet

1556927
highlight	selected
my preferred way conceptually i m making this up just to illustrate what i m looking for would be to just write the paragraph in the article editor highlight it with the mouse right-click and selected make highlight text visible only to registered users

1556928
alloca	malloc
use alloca instead of malloc function to allocate memory dynamically on stack frame of the caller function instead of heap

1556956
radio-button	selected
for instances if i selected a radio-button through jquery code does this fire the onclientclick event for that particular input

1556965
google-chrome	firefox
the icons doesn t show up in firefox and google-chrome on my sign in page --

1557042
16-bit	x86
i m working in x86 assembly in 16-bit

1557049
boost	stl
just as stl there are a lot of interesting things in boost that you may use in your day to day job

1557054
jquery	.post
using the jquery .post methods and django together can get confusing because the stuff between is structured differently

1557076
value	field
don t know if this is possible but i d like to selected recording based on the field value of recur_type where the m is the day of the week

1557084
google-chrome	safari
say you wanted a greasemonkey scripting to be compatible with safari and google-chrome

1557084
.when	ready
whereas in firefox the greasemonkey scripting only run .when the dom is ready

1557084
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
google-chrome safari and opera seem to run the greasemonkey scripting before the dom is ready

1557084
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
if the browser they are using is google-chrome safari or opera

1557105

i have a form and i wish to get the value of a radio-button but it always gives me the same value floating even though i selected a different radio-button and i run this function

1557111
radio-button	selected
you can get the selected radio-button with checked

1557112
tcsh	zsh
these key works fine with tcsh and zsh but not with ksh

1557125
installation	building
.when i try to install an older building of adobe flash player to test a swf i m developing the install tells me i cannot complete installation because a newer versioning of flash player is available

1557133
put	get
.so it makes sense to put the get post methods in the postings class rather than the users class

1557138
32-bit	16-bit
for c integral types char is at least 8 bits short is at least 16-bit and at least as big as a char int is at least 16-bit and at least as big as a short and long is at least 32-bit and at least as big as an int . since windows ran first on essentially 16-bit systemd and later 32-bit c compilers didn t necessarily agree on sizes

1557154
quickbooks	fedex
big company integration where we re tasked with making our software work with some big outfit like intuit quickbooks or fedex shipping rates

1557171
versioning	staging
i find that branching or versioning tagging works much better for differentiating staging vs

1557216
xsd	xml
you should do it with xml schema definition - xsd - for the data types and web service description language - wsdl - for the actual service

1557226
cryptography	security
it appears that you are attempting to design a crypto-based security systemd but you are clearly not an expert on cryptography arithmetic

1557235
atom-feed	feed
if your rss atom-feed has a specific extension or is served from a specific dorectory i suppose you could use apache s addtype directive .so apache would serve your rss feed with the right content-type

1557256
double	int
double is the default types for non int

1557266
defined	declare
another alternative would be to declare your implementation class totally private in terms of methods and defined a bodyguard class declare friend of the first

1557277
arrays	loops
now let s create a mutable arrays with your phrases - this can be done using a loops because you know the key you re looking for have sequential digits

1557279
contains	any
will based on my limited knowledge block any url that contains index.php css gfx .

1557294
comma	words
in other words the constructor is applied to hello but the comma afterwards is not the comma-operator of strings

1557294
copy-constructor	constructor
by the way the constructor is not really a copy-constructor

1557297
value	field
i have a ruby-on-rails .app where users can input value for a field

1557312
constructor	object
now suppose we sent an object after it had the following constructor

1557314
highlight	selected
i was working on a homework assignment where i wanted to get text that was selected highlight in a textarea to appear in a joptionpane dialog

1557314
input-field	selected
i tried many of the methods for joptionpane but i could not get any of them to place the text the user selected in the input-field of the dialog

1557329
value	field
frankly 33 field on a single page does not sound all that long for describing a rental listing especially .when 23 of the field checkbox and dropdowns can default to the most common value

1557329
value	field
the importance of the field you have seems self-evident to me but maybe you should include a link that explains the purpose and value of the field

1557355
aes	rsa
tls initializer with rsa key-pair for mutual-authentication and aes session key sounds appropiate for what you describe

1557366
imageview	textview
let s say i have a listview with a custom layout for each row having an imageview and a textview

1557366
imageview	textview
i am doing the following custom listview with an imageview and a textview

on most modern desktop systemd a 32-bit architecture will have 4 byte pointers while a 64bit architecture will have 8 byte pointers

1557397
private-members	object	duplicates	contains
it s pretty involved to duplicates that with functional code i assume you mean the pattern where you have private-members in a closure and return an object that contains your public members

1557401
click	mouse
i m trying to solve a problem where the user has to click on an area before it starts getting mouse wheel events

1557401

jquery	.post
i d like to make a very simple jquery box come up saying sorry that blog .post could not be found.

1557440
default-value	default	key-value	key
to associate an extension with a file types you need to set the default-value of the extension key hive_key software classes .ext with a chosen file types by setting the default key-value

1557440
default-value	default
the default-value of this shell key has the default verb key named which is the verb invoked .when the user double click a file

1557440
default-value	default
you asked how to checked this stuff and this can be done by first inspector the default-value of the extension key to get the progid then inspector the shell subkey of the progid key to get default verb then inspector shell verb cmd to get the path to the program launchd

1557442
account	api
for instances there is a google has an specific api for that google account api other service provide similar api s some other do not

1557442
account	api
.so it depends pretty much what are your online account all about and if they do provide a public api or not

1557442
account	api
the public api let you easily login into an account but you don t really need one to do it although it make life much more simpler if you do not have a public api you can still login into any account by simply doing what the browser does

1557442
account	api
i would suggest you to start with the previously mentioned google account api and learn from there

1557447
installation	environment
for restrictive corporate environment where you may not want the data outside of the wan we also offer a self hosted solution where the corporation gets an installation of all the required servers and the internal applications are inject to send usage data to the internal endpoint

1557447
export	report	export	csv
in addition you also have your data available in an excel format export summarized by day in csv files and we also offer an pox api for programatically extraction your data for use in other applications or creating your own report

1557465
onresume	onpause
you can do this in the onpause then reopen it in the onresume

1557484
aes	rsa
real protocols generator a content encryption key for a symmetric algorithm like aes then use an rsa public key as a key encryption key to encrypt the content encryption key for the messages recipient s

1557506
value	field
edit ok as the field is indeed multiple value there are various things you can try

1557509
firefox	gecko
for the recording i ve just field a tightly related issue into gecko firefox et

1557558
backgroundworker	winforms
i d recommend looking at the parallels extensions coming in .net 4.0 the threadpool backgroundworker if they re working in winforms and the lock keyword

1557568
put	get
there are various scheme you can use to get around this but that would depend on how much work you want to put into this

1557577
linux	unix
in linux or unix

1557614
connection-pooling	pool
.when you use connection-pooling any time you create a connection the connection will actually be pulled from a pool of existing ones .so that you don t incur the costs of building one from scratch each time

1557634
.when	ready
you can do a better job using a javascript-framework to ensure that you run your code .when the dom is ready

1557650
font-size	height
this should make your line height the equivalent of your font-size perhaps fixing the height issue

1557659
32-bit	64bit
if you ve recently migrate from a 32-bit mac to a 64bit model you may have run into problems with some of your perl modules suddenly throw up their hands and going wha

1557659
32-bit	64bit
an afp548 article points out the likely culprit cpan on the mac compiles all of your modules as universal 32-bit binaries by default which tends to disappoint 64bit applications such as apache 2.0 s mod_perl

1557671
hide	show
this allows you to easily hide sections you don t want to show

1557673
vb.net	vba
i have to convert a c# project to vb.net and vba

1557678
any	set
the numbers are any set of distinct numbers given by the user

1557703
vba	vb6
as far as automatically converting c# to vba or vb6 i d be willing to say that that is almost certainly going to be completely impossible

1557703
vba	vb6
there are many aspects of c# .net that are not available in vba or vb6 like inherited for one

1557714
command-prompt	cmd
i have to run the following cmd from qt command-prompt qmake -project then make and this gives me the debugging folder with the moc file

1557721
python	perl
a collections of web cgi or other modules layer between apache and some dbms systemd could still be accessed with things like urlopen2 or mechanize -- but it might be better to bypass the perl code and write python to query the underlying presumably canonical model data store

1557737
telnet	tcp
strictly speaking http is not in top of telnet but on top of tcp which telnet is also on top of these days

1557744
python	php	python	java
i think lot of things including python java maybe some php and maybe some ruby-on-rails

1557765
controllers	routes
you must specify at least the controllers and action in one way or another from the path matcher or hardcode for all routes

1557767
python	java
it seems to me like the project that are for internal use gone public have both java and python apis which strongly suggest they do both python and java in-house

1557781
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection di seems to use a constructor or setter to inject it s dependencies

1557786
perl	php
about making it client side this is an old project really and with freewebs no support for php or perl

1557795
python	c++	python	java
that the official languages at google include python java and c++ javascript

1557804
service-locator	inject
you could combine the two -- and inject the service-locator or a factory if you wanted

1557808
actioncontroller	activeresource
there s one in actioncontroller integration session one in actioncontroller testprocess one in activeresource connection ...etc

1557812
if-statement	loops
all you need is a simple if-statement to prevent the second loops being run .when

1557822
keyboard	mouse
another fact about the ui-thread is that it handles all of the mouse and keyboard events along with systemd messages that are sent to the windows

1557830
toast	alert
as of right now i have a drawable button that .when click alert a toast messages of the longitude and latitude

1557831
defined	declare
i want to enable users to quickly declare new instances of footrait with their own defined bodies for foofn

1557851
value	field
your id field implied by the absence of a pk definition in your model is not being autonumbered correctly and therefore every insert after the first is failing with a duplicates id value

1557901
quicksort	in-place
quicksort is in-place

1557980
http-get	get
your form is using get which essentially is http-get

1557982
32-bit	64bit
for converting long string to a 64bit hex char arr on a 32-bit systemd you should use unsigned long-long instead of unsigned long and htonl is not enough .so do it yourself as below because might there s no htonll htonq or hton64 etc

1557986
swing	awt
first things first have a quick look at awt swing in the javadoc

1562725
dictionary	arrays
this will use the nscoding to serialization the arrays or dictionary to an nsdata attributes and appropriately deserialization it upon access

1562725
dictionary	arrays
the downside is that you can t query into the arrays or dictionary it s stored as a blob in the data store and if the collectionss are large you may have to move a lot of data to from the data store if it s an sqlite data store just to read or modify a small part of the collections

1562725
dictionary	arrays
the alternative is to use core data to-many relationships to model the semantics of the arrays or dictionary collections

1562725
attributes	properties
core data to-many relationships are really model a set .so if you need arrays-like functionality you have to either .sort the set using a fetched properties is a convenient way to do this or add an extra index attributes to the entity that stores the arrays items and manage the indexes yourself

1562728

1562907
user-interface	flicker
i m figuring this is a redraw issue due to the flicker but i cannot figure out for the life of me why it s a redraw issue unless the jquery user-interface libs is giving faulty math as this is my next step i m hoping .so can cut down on my debugging and tell me i m an idiot or say i m on the right tracking

meta-inf	jar
remove .sf .rsa .dsa from meta-inf to unsign the jar if not needed

1562930

the default-value of this parameter is true it just needs validationquery to be set to a non-null string to have any effect

1563117

what you would do is as henry suggests and add each new instances of a movieclip into an arrays then whenever you change something you can loops through the arrays and apply the changes to each instances

1563424
aptana	pydev
i don t use an ide but i believe aptana acquired the pydev grouping python for eclipse .so i wouldn t be too surprised if they have that

1563427

1563436
attributes	properties
ok found the answer i missed the namespace properties on the servicecontract attributes

attributes	properties
the service is invoked fine but the parameter value is not passed on...i assume it worked out the namespace from the action properties on the operationcontract attributes

1563448
hash	md5
but there is always the possibility of asking the user to confirm the downloading by pressing a button that call a javascript checked by generator an md5 hash and comparing that to the md5 hash of the file on your server the on-server md5 being generator by you and on a successful comparison use that javascript scripting to updates your db or use it to call a php-scripting to do the same

1563526
updating	updates
updating a copy on staging server using svn up and later doing cp cmd to copy the files from the updates copy to the server copy is always time consuming .when there are more than 10 files

what i want is to be able to send through ftp a whole svn revision .so i am sure i won t forget to upload a file

1563602
gearman	worker
gearman seems like the perfect candidate for this scenario you might even want to virtualize you windows machines to multiple worker nodes per machine depending on how much computing power you need

1563602

1563685
default-value	arguments
if i call g with no arguments it returns the default-value initially an empty list from its func_defaults tuples

1563685
default-value	arguments
since g1 and g2 are different instancess of the g function their default-value for the x arguments is also a different instances which the above demonstrates

1563685
implements	super
finally a super important points that the code you ve posted overlooks if you re going to be doing parallels process on shared data the code that touches that data needs to implements locking

datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
instead of using a datagridcomboboxcolumn for the second column i went with a datagridtemplatecolumn with an embedded combobox

1565802
32-bit	64bit
if you do this .when compiling in 64bit mode your returned pointers will be truncated to 32-bit

1565833
32-bit	64bit
to open a command-prompt for either 32-bit or 64bit

1565844
buildpath	libs
i added the following jars to the project buildpath libs

1565887
jquery	.post
however .when i try to use the string to .postdata using jquery s ajax function it seems to add backslashes to the string resulting in the json string being sent using get rather than .post

1565888
webserver	security
my first thoughts are that is has something to do with xmlhttprequest and it s security restrictions in many browsers but i am not sure why it doesn t work .when i call the site via the webserver instead of the absolute-path to the html file

1565892
jquery	dojo
i had the same problem working on a project the used dojo but found it to be .so intrusive i switched to jquery

1565892
jquery	dojo
with jquery it s a lot easier to use as it only used the standards html markup instead of adding it s own tags like dojo does

1565892
jquery	dojo
i also found a ton more documentation for jquery then dojo as well as some good guides on overcoming the ie6 crap we still have to code for

1565892
jquery	dojo
all in all i would highly recommend jquery over dojo in any project

1565901
instances	private
if only other instances methodss use your private methods then there s no reason to make it a static methods whatsoever

1565908
user-interface	look-and-feel
this will make it easier to use jquery-user-interface-plugins within your code and once you figure how how to apply the jquery user-interface classes to your own code help you to layout most of your own look-and-feel

1565915
abstract	extends
in this case manual and dynamic mocks are basically the same thing because the they rely on being able to extends abstract types

1565918
ubuntu	linux
but .when same nodes is running on linux ubuntu 9.04 the client starts up in 35 seconds

1565927
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
while firefox google-chrome safari are all fine ie is a real pain

1565927
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 is considerably better than ie7 however moving around with the cursor key is a bit unnatural and nothing like as smooth as google-chrome or firefox

1565939
minimum	max
width min max preferred minimum width available width preferred width

1565946
difference	factors
these timing difference can depend on many factors but the first one coming to mind is that you are using a modern windows versioning

1565968
web-config	app-config
the natural place for types 1 is in app-config or web-config and the natural place for typess 2 and 3 is in the database

1565976
contains	any
obviously the c runtime contains a loops to call atexit handler but that loops exists whether you actually register any atexit handler or not

1565990
hide	show
in those cases i might segregate them all into a #region directive .so i can show hide it as needed

1565998
value	field
the value of the field is changed

1565998
value	field
if the value in the object that the field points to changes within the object-lifetime then i donâ t think a field should be marked readonly

1566016
decimal-point	digits
if you want to exclude numbers like 123a street addresses for example or 123.123 numbers with more than 2 digits after the decimal-point try

1566035
double-quotes	spaces
i need a regular expression to split this line but ignore spaces in double-quotes in perl

1566044
visualvm	btrace
visualvm can not .post a link - just google for it with install btrace plugins supports this

1566059
widget	button
i have already looked into the yui menu button widget but was a little hesitant to use since i need to introduce lots of dependencies along with that

1566069
design-time	designer
.when you modify column headers of a listview at design-time the designer generator code to serialization column headers at runtime

1566077
selected	checkbox
the checkbox and other controls for options in the options windows should apply instantly on selection .so user can immediately see the impact of each option as it is selected

1566086
instance-variables	superclass	subclassing	superclass
i have a superclass and a subclassing both of which defined instance-variables

1566098
.when	ready
the first bundles only registers the service .when it s ready implying that other bundles can begin using it immediately

1566104
shutdown	restart
not sure why you wouldn t just use p invoke but one alternate way of restart would be to use system.diagnostics.process.start in conjunction with the shutdown cmd

1566108
contains	elements
the some.jsp also contains the some html elements that are handled by

1566110
put	get
most filesystems get very slow .when you put many files in a directory

1566115
attributes	properties
it has attributes for properties in my model entity like datatype

1566126
keyboard	mouse
its design doesn t include responding to game pad input - a major overhaul would be required to refit it to be usable with something else than mouse and keyboard

1566134
fadeout	fadein
i would like to add a subtle and quick fadeout and fadein effect to a button change through switchclass

1566134
removeclass	addclass
if i would use standards jquery i would like to put an effect on addclass and removeclass but is that possible

1566163
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve tested a all common browsers firefox ie 6 7 safari opera etc. - i cant figure out why this wont work.

1566175
temporary	rvalue
in your code getx returns a temporary object a so-called rvalue

1566183
return-value	arguments
which means that the final compiled code will do something like call malloc with arguments 42 convert its return-value from int to void and put it to foo

1566183
32-bit	64bit
i imagine that on 64bit architecture it might mean taking lower 32-bit and putting 32 zero in front of then thus clearing part of the original pointers

1566185
reflection	runtime
with this generator methods i can set field on an object at runtime without using reflection

1566186

1566189
attributes	properties
i m pretty sure now that this could be also done in different way - by making subquery in selected clause - using the formula attributes elements in mapping for properties but this would work slower than subquery in from clause

1566194
tiff	gif
please also checked this convert tiff images to gif jpeg

1566234
ethernet	packets
.so far i found micro.soft network monitor which is a nice tool but for localhost it s useless because on windows localhost packets don t pass-through the regular network stack .so they re invisible to an ethernet sniffer like ms network monitor

1566261
triggers	insert
the biggest thing to remember if you haven t written a triggers before is that the triggers fires on the whole batch-file nor row-by-row .so all code to insert to another table must be set-based not row-based

1566274
jquery	.post
i think this can be done using a jquery ajax .post event but i m not 100 sure and i m not sure if that s the best way to do it

1566280
while-loop	loops
the fourth line within the while-loop essentially does the opposite of the previous line by significantly dropping the relative weight of whatever numbers just occurred making it less likely to happen on subsequent loops

1566280
if-statement	while-loop
the if-statement at the end of the while-loop is simply there to make sure all the numbers in probabilities are positive

1566291
windows	ms-dos
i m creating an fwt application in fantom and every time i run my application the ms-dos command-prompt windows appears as well as my main application form

1566291
windows	ms-dos
i donâ t want this ms-dos windows to be show

1566293
python	c++
probably because the original versioning of python c python was written in c not c++

1566307
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this webpage looks correct in ie 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 safari 3 4 opera 9 10 and google-chrome

1566323
boolean	int
i m using a 2d arrays of boolean .so it isn t as nice as the people using 16-bit int with bit-manipulation

1566337
primitive	int
there are no particular pitfalls with using bigint except that they are significantly slower than primitive int types .

1566342
32-bit	64bit
this is true for linux windows and mac os x on both 32- and 64bit platform i believe 32-bit platform

1566342
32-bit	16-bit
back in the good old days of dos development it was possible to create programs that ran in a mode where int was 16-bit and pointers were 32-bit actually 24

1566379
python	php
something like the wonderful dive into python would be perfect but for php and html of course

1566392
web-config	app-config
.when you use iis to hosts your service you must configure your app-config file or web-config file to allow iis to expose .some binding .so in your configuration file you will put all your binding you allow to your wcf service

user-interface technologies javascript dom css swing swt

1566438
jquery	.post
looking around the jquery docs i saw the beforesend hook which sounds just about right the problem is that i couldn t figure out how to make .ajaxsetup be .post aware

1566454
unsigned	short
the problem you have i believe is with left shifting int value out of unsigned short range

1566454
parentheses	operators
the thing to remember is that is a very low precedence operators .so parentheses a lot of them are inorder

1566458
32-bit	64bit
for network messaging then you need to do porting while re-compiling on a 64bit systemd because of htonl ntohl etc communication get broken in the case of the network peer is still using the 32-bit systemd using the same code as yours

1566461
perl	awk	difference	count

internet-explorer	firefox
this solution works in internet-explorer which happens to be the only browser my client base is using however i would prefer a solution that at least works in firefox

1566498
callback	methods
simplifying i would need to be able to call a methods in the server and pass a javascript function as a parameter for callback

1566513
arrays	loops
i m trying to building an arrays within loops of value provided from various functions like the_title the_excerpt the_permalink and others

1566528
terminal	prompt
.when my prompt is already at the bottom of my terminal windows this option does exactly what i want less behaves like cat

1566528
terminal	prompt
but for synchronized reasons the different process involved here do not get access to the terminal correctly and everything execute in the background in particular i never get a correct less here and the prompt comes back too soon

1566528
output	cat
.so to summarize what i want is such a function scripting whatever that i can types ls | catless and it behaves exactly like ls | cat .when the output of ls is shorter than one screens and like ls | less .when longer

1566631
widget	button
the server call client inorder to send data to refresh a specific widget like a button

1566646
hash	md5
since you haven t specified exactly what it is that you need in terms of cryptography functions there is the qcryptographyhash class which provides md4 md5 and sha1 hash generator

1566648
queue	fifo
i understand a queue is a fifo or first come first serve data structure

1566650
16-bit	8bit
this is a simple way to make a 16-bit value from two 8bit value

1566698
calayer	uiview
as far as i can tell i need an uiview or subclassing of uiview to display an calayer on screens right

1566700
data-structures	map
data-structures are important because you need to store information such as what does a map look like

1566716
python	ruby
i don t stick to it completely but that is my basic pattern especially since python tends to encourage more-but-simpler lines-of-code than ruby

1566741
queue	fifo
i once wrote a lock-free fifo queue in delphi which worked very well

1566754
exception-handling	try-catch
i added a try-catch exception-handling code block like .so

1566780
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
.when i got to adding the flash using swf object i noticed that it had pushed the elements beneath it down roughly 5px and only in firefox and safari internet-explorer oddly enough isn t affected

1566791
multiple-instances	wait
now i can fire up 10 windows and they will eventually work but every new form will wait before all the other forms have handled all their geckofx events as you cannot use multiple-instances on one thread

1566793
credentials	security	administration	credentials
i have tried to use the default user which is the administration because of process s security context and i have tried using specific user credentials

1566795
aspect-ratio	scale
i think silverlight has the ability to scale but the problem is that your object s aspect-ratio is different from your video s aspect-ratio .so it gets scale .some but then cut off

1566810
text-editor	editor
linking the .rdl extension to the xml editor in tools options text-editor file-extension has the nasty side effect that while the rdl is now show in the xml editor the original report-designer completely disappears

1566811
h.264	mp4
as long as you target fp 9.0.115.0 and the file is encode in h.264 and in a mpeg-4 containers like .mov mp4 f4v etc.

1566847
nsmutablearray	plist
i need to pick string valur from an nsmutablearray then save it into a plist

1566855
margins	padding
try explicit setting the margins and padding of the object elements to 0px

1566871
value	field
it is useful .when you combine it with a raisepropertychanged testid inside the if after the field value is set event pattern often seen with wpf or other databinding solutions

1566889
contains	set
once a user is registered on your site you ll have to set their isapproved properties to false create a random activation code and store this usually in a manually added field on the aspnet_membership table or as part of the asp.net .profile if you re using membership profiling send off the email with a url that contains the user s activation code

1566889
activation	account
once the user receives this email and visits the url you grab their activation code from the url lookup the account from the asp.net membership systemd and set their isapproved properties back to true

1566908
contains	set
step 3 given that your query is encode in utf-8 and contains characters that cannot be represented with latin1 these characters will be lost on transcoding from utf8 to latin1 the default database character set making your query fail

1566924
double	int
imagine the first multiplies two int and the second multiplies a list of double that is terminate by a 0.0

1566925
selected	button
for any file you can click the arrow on the size of the open button in the open file dialog and selected open with.

1566940
put	get
news contains an int column called total_comments which is increment via triggers every time a new row is put into comments. does the slave need this triggers as well to keep news.total_comments up to-date or will it get be told to updates the appropriate news.total_comments directly

1566943
output	cat
pdftk 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf cat output 123.pdf

1566952
cos	sin
you can see cos and sin returning the points on a circle

1566952
cos	sin
then given an angle the angle of the canon you can get the positioning on the circle it points to with sin and cos

1566958
calayer	uiview
the points is not to avoid having copies of the calayer s which are quite lightweight but to avoid having copies of uiview or more specifically the graphics contexts that back uiview s

1566959
cos	sin
the correspondence is the following given an angle theta theta corresponds to the points cos theta sin theta

1566959
cos	sin
why does cos theta sin theta live on the unit circle

1566969
windows-server	windows
however on windows-server 2008 and other windows flavours with user account control i get the following error

1566979
printf	scanf
the most common alternative is chaining overloaded operators instead iostream inserters extractors versus printf scanf

1566993
printf	scanf
common techniques here are format strings as in printf scanf or tag lists every odd elements in the parameter list being an enum telling the types of the following even elements with a zero enum to mark the end of the parameter list

1566997
cos	sin
the way that this concept click for me was to experiment with different pieces of code until i understood the relation between sin cos circles and angle

1567020
javacc	bison
the first thing you should do is play with any of the compiler compiler types tools flex bison antlr javacc and get your grammar working

1567020

i would like to subtract the time i spent on the first page from the session put the user on the new page and then log the user out after his session rest of the session time timeout and redirect the user to the login page

1567026
subtract	time
if it is easier the user session does not need to be subtract by the time the user spent on the first page

1567041
shell	bash
in my new project i must execute a cmd from sudo bin bash shell

1567045
revision	updates
you can back-date that is updates to an old revision individual files and sub-folders in your working copy .so you should be able to pick and choose which files you want to rollback inorder to get everything into a consistent working state again

1567056
cos	sin
the cos and sin part of things extraction the x and y components respectively of the cannon s angle

1567077
security	owasp
owasp is specifically designed to contains standards for security although it has a lot of articles that are too specific for what you want

1567085
hide	show
then .when your timeout fires you just show the desired page and hide whatever s there

1567095
contains	any
obviously you couldn t contextually validation any sort of business-logic that the configuration might contains but you could use a combinations of an xsd-validation plus a lightweight class that is used to parsing conditional within the file

1567096
for-loop	loops
both do the same but the first one is much more readable plus you get to keep the string variables after loops is done in the 2nd option its enclosed in the for-loop scoping

1567102
while-loop	for-loop
don t use a for-loop .when a while-loop is more appropriate

1567102
while-loop	for-loop
a common abuse of the flexible for-loop structure in c++ c# and java is haphazardly cramming the contents of a while-loop into a for-loop header

1567102
while-loop	for-loop
c++ example of a while-loop abusively crammed into a for-loop header

1567108
callback	methods
i ve tried everything i know how to try i ve even added an error option to the .ajaxsetup methods and i still haven t had any success returning even an error messages as to why my callback is not being called

1567118
nsnumberformatter	nsstring
i ve looked at the nsnumberformatter docs and general formatting using nsstring stringwithformat but it s not clear to me a good way to do this

1567119
attributes	properties
i noticed that i need to add the named attributes to the properties inorder for the sql to work correctly

1567144
32-bit	64bit
i m on 64bit cocoa but i ve also tried 32-bit cocoa

1567147
directory	folder
secondly and very similar to the document directory there is the libs folder where you store configuration-files and writable databases that you also want to keep around but you don t want the user to be able to mess with through itunes

1567185
double	int
for simple types like int double and char it makes sense to pass it by value

1567200
attributes	properties
inside the dbml file what you are probably needing to do is change the named attributes of the column you renamed and add a member attributes with the named of the properties you want on the class

1567213
primitive	int
as eastsun already hinted the answer is an implicit-conversion from an java.lang.integer basically a boxed int primitive to a scala.int which is the scala way of representing jvm primitive int

1567226
32-bit	64bit
i include a versioning that i created that can interleave two 32-bit int into one 64bit long

1567231
engineyard	heroku
heroku and engineyard uses amazon-ec2

1567255
xsd	xml
i ve got a requirement for a way to read incoming xml messages parsing them with this xpath path expression language we have invented and then write into to a resultant composite xsd generator class

1567267
contains	any
this works for any report and report that contains subreport as these need the credentials supplying as well

1567269
primitive	int
in your case you should take the int by value because you don t intend to modify the arguments and the arguments is of primitive types

1567272
double	int
a reference to const t is not worth the typing effort in case of scalar types like int double etc

1567296
contains	any
if your code links against a libs containss multiple object then any object that do not contains functions used by your code directly or indirectly would not be include in the final executable

1567341
ellipse	line
.so i am working with an ellipse on a drawing surface and i need to know the shortest distance from the ellipse path centering of the line thickness is fine to a given points

1567353
conditional	parentheses
.when removing completely the conditional in parentheses with the or clause the query then comes slow again 1 minute + but i think it s only because the dataset to return in very huge

1567355
firefox	opera
some sites send difirefoxerent content depending on user-agent header if this is not ie firefox opera webkit it s probably a bots send difirefoxerent content

1567371
stdin	pipe
pipe anything from stdin to the cli application and then pipe any output from the cli application to stdout

1567377
network-interface	packets
the problem is in .net i don t see anyway to tell whether a specific network-interface is a physical hardware network card from something like a nortel ipsecshm adaptor - packets scheduling miniport which get added .when you connect to certain vpns or wifi networks

1567384
arrays	loops	if-statement	loops	if-statement	arrays
you need to either stop your loops one earlier i size - 1 or change your if-statement .so that it only checked wordlist i wordlist i+1 .when there is at least one more entry in the arrays

1567384
if-statement	arrays
that will prevent you from needing extra if-statement but will still protect you from leaving the bounds of the arrays

1567384
unique	words
you know that you ll always have at least one unique words

1567390
compact-framework	.net
i m writing an .app .net compact-framework 3.5 on pocketpc 2003

i am messing around with the combinations of buildout and virtualenv to setup an isolated development-environment in python that allows to do reproducible building

1567494
virtualenv	buildout
there is a recipe for buildout that let s you integrated virtualenv into buildout

1567507
managed-code	unmanaged

dynamic-programming	memoization
you can compute this recursive function with dynamic-programming memoization

1567574
numeric	digits
treating the digits with special significance makes your numbers no longer strictly numeric

1567579
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
i selected one of the checkbox and .when i click image button am able to get the correct status checked true

1567602
gridsplitter	grid
if you drop a gridsplitter into a grid it s behavior is completely useless unless you set a bunch of properties on it

1567631
.when	ready
alternatively you might try registering a one-off change event handler .when the dom is ready like .so

1567635
directory	folder
however .when the test runs it runs from a temporary output directory under the test results folder

1567641
any	set
if it is a regular tomcat installation and you are not using any centos or yum specific scripting you can set java_home in bin startup.sh located in the tomcat installation directory to the installation directory of java 6

1567647
delegation	dealloc
the tableview already realeases its delegation in its dealloc methods .so you should be ok without having to explicit set the delegation to nil

1567649
contains	any
t is any class contains in your test assembly

1567650
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
how can i include the shared source file in my project without adding stdafx.h to the top of the source file and without turning off precompiled-headers

in these cases the user-mode code successfully uses an atomicity compare-and-swap cas operation to lock or unlock the mutex

1567677
jquery	.post
i use jquery ajax to .post a contact form to my email

1567678
base-class	inherited
any thoughts as to why the public properties inherited from the base-class are not getting serialization would be greatly appreciated

1567709
sorted	lookup
if the lookup file smaller file isn t too large then easiest is to just read it in put it in a hash keyed by the named with sorted arrays of start-end pairs for value

1567709
python	perl
my perl is rusty .so no perl example code but i throw together a quick and dirty python implementation

1567753
while-loop	loops
your loops should not be for loops they should be while-loop with an increment step

1567753
while-loop	for-loop
i guess you can just manually checked the conditional within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while-loop makes more sense imo

1567754
object-reference	instances
the error is object-reference not set to an instances of an object. on that line

1567814
value	field
the question is realy should the pk be the whole 8 field keep in mind this table will probably have more then 100m rows .when i m not ever retrieving by the pk or just a hash value of the unique field

1567821
cryptographic-hash-function	hash
message-digest algorithm 5 is a widely-used cryptographic-hash-function with a 128bit hash value

1567833
recording	playing
right now i m sending back a recording of all the move that occur and playing them back inorder

1567840
unique	words
in other words match unique characters do not match characters that are repeated

1567840
unique	words
i understand your question as follows match all unique words subexpressions characters in a string that have no repetition before or after itself

1567853
configuration	environment
to prevent this from ever being an issue again and to allow some flexible configuration i added assets hosts domains to my environment configuration

1567908
nsurlconnection	nsdata	nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
2- you can use nsurlrequest nsmutableurlrequest along with nsurlconnection to make your request and get the data back heres a ref to nsurlrequest youll have to set a few properties such as the url the request types get .post http-headers if applicable once you have done that you can use nsurlconnection to issue the request heres a reference you can use methods such as sendsynchronousrequest or initwithrequest and start to do an async request which will get you your response both cases youll get some nsdata o bject back which you can translation into whatever it is its supose to be a string or some picture data or whatever

1567936
callback	methods
http lite s request methods allows you to specify a callback

1567936
callback	methods
it looks like a callback passed to the request methods is treated differently

1567938
ftp	ssh
rsync will use ssh or rsh not ftp .so this might not work but would seem a better way in most cases

1567958
http	ssl
i would look at using ssl over http providing authentication for the caller of the web-services maybe a public private-key systemd or client certificates and looking to set ip restrictions rules for the caller on the hosting server - at a minimum

1567962
selected	button
i have a button on a form that is dynamically spawn a selected list which is supposed to be populate with json data i have all of the json data being pulled in correctly my only issue is hooking the selectedlist s onload event to fill itself with data i know i could use #itemid .fillselectedlist to fill it but the problem is my selected list id s are dynamically generator and i don t know of a way to concat a selected like #item + itemnum + list

1567962
document-ready	.when
edit my selected lists are inject to the page as html stored in a jquery scripting with the onload fillddl value but they aren t firing .when they appear if i set a scripting to do #file1category .fillddl in my document-ready scripting it fires but errors .so i guess i am expanding my question to include why that onload isn t working and if there is another methods i should be using

1567980
value	field
this value is function of field boost document boost

1567980
value	field
if you want the boost value to be preserve it s useful for example .when you want to recreate index from current index you may add it in a stored field

1567986
ftp	scp
i d throw together a python scripting which uses inotify and scp ftp

1568011
wamp	php
dev server windows wamp php 5+ codeigniter

1568011
ubuntu	linux
live server ubuntu linux php codeigniter lamp

1568031
json	xml
you can structure the trace output put it into a separate database store it into some xml or json file

1568042
malloc	free
i was of the impression that for every malloc ed memory we should call free

1568058
value	field
i have an inline model formset and i d like to make field non-editable if those field already have value .when the page is loaded

1568058
widget	button
if the user click an edit button on that row it would become editable and using javascript i would replace the original widget with editable ones

1568067
mocking	stubs
for mocks or stubs consider using an isolation mocking framework

1568067
getter	setter
there s no need to test getter and setter one-line pure delegation methods and .so forth in my opinion

1568086
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
your impression that you should call free once for each malloc is basically correct things like calloc and realloc complicate the simple story

1568086
arrays	loops
loops followed by free should be correct or at least the general mechanism of free the sub-arrayss first then the arrays of pointers to sub-arrayss - .so you need to review where the double free error is coming from

1568091
getter	setter
what s the advantage of using getter and setter - that only get and set - instead of simply using public fields-for those variables

1568091
getter	setter
if getter and setter are ever doing more than just the simple get set i can figure this one out very quickly but i m not 100 clear on how

1568091
getter	setter
you can have different access-levels for getter and setter

1568109
constructor	mutators
accessor and mutators also allow for encapsulation - if you aren t supposed to see the value once its set perhaps it s set in the constructor and then used by methods but never supposed to be changed it will never been seen by anyone

1568112
python	ruby
in languages which support real properties python ruby maybe smalltalk

1568123
shell	bash
after playing around a little more i found that you can execute an individual cmd or string of cmd in a root shell by doing something like sudo bin bash -c whoami

1568127
getter	setter
one other use in languages that support properties is that setter and getter can imply that an operation is non-trivial

1568148
authentication	login
best practices for web login authentication

1568150
getter	setter
in python for instances there is no reason to use getter and setter

1568150
attributes	properties	getter	setter
if you need to change the behavior you can use a properties which wrap a getter and setter around basic attributes access

1568168
base-class	inherited
i do not want to create a base-class and make all my classes inherited from such base-class

1568171
entity-framework	ado.net
.when ado.net entity-framework creates the user entity it leaves the userstatus field as byte

1568190
getter	setter
for setter and getter you can fine tune it and defined it separately

1568230
getter	setter
improved interoperability with libs that are designed to operate against properties getter setter - mocking serialization and wpf come to mind

1568230
getter	setter	protected	public
getter and setter can allow different access-levels - for example the get may be public but the set could be protected

1568233
scatter-plot	line-plot
i m looking for a parameter which allows a user to selected the charts types x-y scatter-plot bar plot line-plot etc. from a drop-down-menu on a website which is interfaced with sql-server report service

1568246
any	set
if i set mod_rewrite and add suffix to urls as yes it doesn t give any error not sure if it works the way it suppose to or not

1568246
any	set
# block out any scripting trying to set a mosconfig value through the url

1568246
any	set
# block out any scripting trying to set a php globals variables via url

1568252
postback	ajax
to mitigate this you may want to consider using some sort of ajax solution to cause a partials postback or async postback to prevent the blanking

1568262
value	field
this field has the value active and inactive

1568262
value	field
if i set the field status to inactive does mysql have a way to cascade this down to all tables tied to the row i changed the status value for

1568267
xsd	xml
with an xml file it s easy to get or create an xsd to describe the xml file-format

1568278
controllers	routes
you will notice that there are two prefixed routes admin controllers action and manager controllers action

1568282
arrays	loops
if color is an arrays you can do a foreach loops

1568284
value	field
if a field s value contains a double quote character it is escaped by placing another double quote character next to it

1568286
virtual-machine	vmware
my vmware virtual-machine was running and i was monitor the size of the virtual disk file

1568287
click	mouse
i have tried using mouse click event click event key press event etc to manually set the focus .when you click on the mdi parent but none of these events fire

1568287
any	set
is there any way to set the focus to the mdi parent .when you click on the background of the form

1568297
gridview	formview	updatepanel	formview	updatepanel	gridview
i m having an issue finding an updatepanel inside of a gridview inside of a formview in javascript

1568307
contains	elements	contains	set
get a set of elements contains all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements

1568331
json	xml
what i suggest is using xml yaml or json as your internal containers for all of the file types you receive

1568369
multiplication	division
this is because i and j are both int s .so the multiplication and crucially division are done in int math yielding 0

1568377
arrays	loops
i would then copy my data to the device do some stuff with it get it back to the hosts and then loops yet again through the arrays assign the data back to the iplimage and saving my results

1568387
gridview	listview
my goal is to have a listview using a gridview showing a list of master object

1568396
where-clause	sql
i m trying to use a dynamic-linq query to query a sql database and in the where-clause i need to evaluate an conditional with a field that is of types text

1568405
value	field
i m wondering if there is a limit to the numbers of dynamic default value that a parameter field can store

1568417
uilabel	uiview
it wouldn t be too hard to subclassing uiviewcontroller with a uiview contains uibarbuttonitem uilabel to suit your needs

1568448
json	csv
this can be applied to json files csv files and fixed-format files

1568455
environment	execution
you say that you don t have a lot of control over the db environment to install logging package - if this is the case then you ll be limited to querying the information in the dba_scheduler_job_run_details and dba_scheduler_job_log systemd views - you ll be able to see the history of execution here

1568465
linux	unix
if the os is linux unix you can run strace on the executable assuming using apache with mod_php other situations more difficult

1568472
put	get
if you intend to use thaw the json somewhere like in another perl program or in javascript you will still get back exactly what you put in

1568510
getter	setter
not to mention that you have a getter doing the work of a setter which is probably a bad idea on several levels

1568519
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
starting with firefox 3.5 they starting using the same box-model rendering as other more modern browsers ie8 safari google-chrome

1568540
environment	building
in case you re wondering my ultimate goal -- .when compiling a libs undefined symbolss in a local object file indicates a dependency wasn t specified that should have been in my building environment whereas if a symbols is missing in a libs that you re linking against that s not an error -l flags are only given for immediate dependencies not dependencies of dependencies under this systemd

1568546
sunos	unix
the development server is using jboss 4.2.3.ga on jvm versioning 1.5.0_16-b02 with unix sunos 5.10

1568554
hide	show
i have a question is there a way i could create the collapsible effect with the jquery show hide slider

1568583
quirks-mode	firefox	quirks-mode	doctype
without a doctype declaration ie7 goes into quirks-mode and padding works differently than in firefox

1568583
margins	padding
.when a width or height is explicit specified for any block-level elements it should determine only the width or height of the visible elements with the padding borders and margins applied afterward

1568597
traffic	packets
further still you can put the raw socket in promiscuous mode which allows you to see all of the traffic on the network not just the packets destined for your machine

1568613
versioning	upgrade
is it safe to upgrade php5 to the latest versioning and how do i do it - i mean is there something special i have to be aware of

1568617
configuration	installation
it sounds like you have something corrupt with your browser installation this should seriously not even remotely be an issue regardless of embed configuration

1568622
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i tweaked your original example a little and the code below looks the same in ie firefox google-chrome and opera

1568622
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the above works in firefox google-chrome ie opera

1568629
constructor	mutators	constructor	object
between the constructor and the accessor and mutators methods it is possible for the developer to control access to the internal state of an object

1568682
svg	vml
unfortunately the dojox.gfx code is construct assuming the right rendering svg or vml is pulled in at runtime

1568685
versioning	migrate
as 64bit support is not expected in the next versioning it is no longer an option to wait for the possibility to migrate our existing codebase to unicode and 64bit in one go

1568687
cos	sin
y sin yaw cos pitch

1568688
insertion-sort	bubble-sort	insertion-sort	selection-sort	selection-sort	bubble-sort
avoid bubble-sort though -- insertion-sort and selection-sort are faster and at least to me easier to understand

1568692
communication	messages
financial institutions are indeed communication using standardized messages over a dedicated network called swift

1568692
csv	xml
i ve used it to parsing positional and or csv file and liked its xml descriptor format

silverlight	wpf
for you wpf silverlight people who are working with source control that allows merging

1568715
any	set
i d set up the machines to ignore any os specific information

1568717

for this cmd to behave visual-studio is best shutdown whilst you run it and you should wait until the cmd has finished to restart it

1568726
google-chrome	firefox
the company i am working for has a flash component using flex and cs4 that crash intermittently in google-chrome firefox and ie

1568734
bmp	gif
visio has some good export options available...you can create an html javascript export though i ve traditionally just exported gif files which is a nice fast export if you re automating a batch-file export and the text stays readable compared to jpeg with relatively small file sizes compared to bmp

1568735
zend-framework	phpunit
in phpunit 3.4.0 there is a class with the same named as the zend-framework 1.9.3

1568741
silverlight	wpf
i am working with the charting data visulaization controls in the june 2009 wpf control toolkit but i think the same question and answer probably applies to silverlight 3 bubble charts.

1568744
instance-variables	class-variables
since your variables are instance-variables not class-variables you don t have a thread-safety issue during initialization using either methods

1568756
subtract	time
for example the php would return 5 00 pm gmt as the time and if they selected est it would subtract 5 hours from the time automagically

1568767
32-bit	64bit
keep in mind in a 64bit exe you cannot load a 32-bit dll .so if you depend on 3rd party dll files you should checked for a 64bit versioning of those files as well

1568767
object-pascal	pascal
this alternative object-pascal compiler is not 100 compatible with the borland codegear embarcadero dialect of pascal .so just recompiling with it for 64bit might not be that simple but it might help points out problems with 64bit

1568771
dependency-injection	service-locator
this is a classic use case for dependency-injection or a service-locator

1568771
dependency-injection	service-locator
you don t need to go for the full whack dependency-injection here a very simple service-locator will suffice

1568771
mstest	nunit
using nunit terminology here for the methods that gets run before each test -- not sure what the mstest equivalent is.

1568774
contains	set
you might have to set it again just before the if-statement contains the savefield call

1568776
32-bit	64bit
don t use int instead use int32 for int sized at 32-bit and int64 for int sized at 64bit

1568779
value	field
however be it in design mode or sql mode i can t get the value of that field

1568788
webserver	upload
i am currently using i currently encode it to base64 for upload to a webserver but this is not necessarily required

1568804
constructor	object
well if you let this escape from the constructor it might be possible for another thread to access the object during construction but you really shouldn t do that

1568806
selected	textbox
to solve this in the mousedown handler i set focus selected a textbox that is off of the page

1568857
arrays	loops
sorry to ask again but i have dificulties to find how to rebuild arrays from the key string couple saved with loops

1568903
subclassing	inherited
a subclassing is simply a class that inherited from a parent class

1568925
business-objects	crystal-reports
the default limit in crystal 11 appears to be 1000 held in the registry key hkey_local_machine .software business-objects suite 11.0 crystal-reports databaseoptions lov maxrowsetrecords .so your problem may lie in the construction of the parameter field itself

1568925
value	field
make sure it is a dynamic parameter field that will query the database .when used as the odd numbers of value show makes me think this was the list generator .when the report was first run and saved and therefore a static parameter list

1568928
highlight	cell
i have a watch range with certain cell highlight yellow

1568928
highlight	cell
i want to highlight all cell in my target range red for which the value in the corresponding reference cell matches the value in the target cell

1568946
one-to-many	entity
linq-to-sql does represent one-to-many relationships as an entity set while entity-framework treats relationships as first-class object .so that a one-to-many relationship is a set of relationship object with related entities rather than simply an entity set

1568950
mstest	nunit
i m aware nunit has test category but our team likes the microsoft stamp of approval on mstest + ide integration

1568960
ubuntu	mint
mint is an exceptionally good derivative of ubuntu

1568971
getter	setter
lots of people talk about the advantages of getter and setter but i want to play devil s advocate

1568971
getter	setter
right now i m debugging a very large program where the programmers decided to make everything getter and setter

1568971
getter	setter
understanding a local piece of code at first glance is an important properties of good reliability that getter and setter tend to break

1568985
configuration	environment
are there any patterns or best practices that can be used to simplify changing configuration profiling for java web-applications across multiple environment

1568985
configuration	environment
in each environment configuration needs to change

1568989
compact-framework	.net
these operations are very easy to perform in .net compact-framework but the application i am working on is a c++ application

1568990
handler	service
it seems like if i have long-running operations then maybe i want to run some other service in the background and have the tomcat handler communication with it

1568990
factors	primes
edit in the above example what i would like to do is to have a background application that runs autonomously with work queue to factors primes and has a java interface that supports the operations that the tomcat servlets could use to expose the service to the web

1568990
factorization	primes
then i don t have to worry about the web interface or http in my background .app and i don t have to worry about multithreading issues or primes factorization in my servlets

1568998
default-value	arguments
implements the copy in terms of the new methods with a default-value for the arguments

1568998
arguments	default
this works well if there is an obvious default for the new arguments and less well if there isn t

1569003
attributes	properties
you can use special attributes to tell the visual-studio designer how to serialization properties in code

1569006
samba	root
in my development-environment the codebase is mounted on a ubuntu-server viewmodel using a samba mount it is mounted as root and i run mongrel as root

you can also see he discusses the idea of if push pop put pull should be at elements 0 or after elements -1 where he post a reference to icons s list

1569012
installation	downgrade
i would like to downgrade my installation of phpunit 3.4 to 3.3

1569032

1569051
panels	grid
first i ve got a panels outside of the multiviewpanels that holds my grid with another similar radcombobox that also died on validation

1569051
panels	grid
i make a postback on the other radcombobox in the top panels outside the grid in javascript

1569089
configuration	environment	jndi	jdbc	environment	building

1569091
perl	php
i m after a regex php perl compatible to get the first sequences out of some text

1569093
silverlight	wpf
both loadrunner and vsts face the challenge of providing mechanisms for being able to recognize the fast-changing landscape of front-end ria libs javascript ajax jquery telerik infragistics wpf silverlight adobe etc.

1569106
where-clause	sql
i believe the most efficient way to do .so would be to use a where-clause if you re using sql to your query and filtering only for it requirements

1569140
unicode-string	utf8-decode
the .encode utf-8 is needed to get the binary representation of the unicode-string with the utf8-decode

1569144
data-annotations	xval
at least it works that way with xval s integration with data-annotations and jquery-validate

1569183
protege	pellet
it s got a much larger presence on .so than protege or pellet although from a smallish numbers of active people

1569196
environment	execution
however .when execution the same code on our test environment linux based itext throw an exception-handling claiming the image file is not a recognized imageformat in com.lowagie.text.image.getinstance ...

1569215
punctuation	words
you can tack on lookbehinds to checked what the words before the punctuation mark was but that s going to get unmaintainable since you have to checked for every possible abbreviation

1569217
callback	methods
edit alternatively if you absolutely must pass in the a callback methods as a param to the constructor and add the listener in the constructor

1569223
python	java
i m looking for the clojure java equivalent to python lxml libs

1569223
beautifulsoup	elementtree
i ve used it a ton in the past for parsing all sorts of html as a replacement for beautifulsoup and it s great to be able to use the same elementtree for xml as well -- really a trusted friend

1569223
libxml2	lxml
lxml is an xml and html process libs based off of libxml2

1569233
implements	extends
this allows you to generator object at runtime that implements any interface or extends any class whilst attaching advisors interceptor

1569236
quadtree	octree
in 2d you could implements a quadtree and in 3d you could implements an octree which means that you would be able to grouping object and more efficiently discard large groupinging of them before actually checked up on their exact distance

1569247
linux	unix
it is broadly available on unix linux etc

1569247
python	c++
it is a specifications for an api originally done in c .so works with c++ too and there are python implementation of it out there too

1569250
ubuntu	debian
i ve debian ubuntu

1569276
output	mode
as earcar says that error output is only display .when running in development mode but that does look a little odd to me

1569287
subtract	add
that required a maximum of 4 comparisons and 4 add subtract ops to determine whether the target is in the box

1569310
directory	folder
bad example copy the .git folder not the 14gb codebase to another directory and push this to the master once disconnect from the vpn

now i m trying to create some test xml data based on previously defined xsd

1569329
account	userid
userid the login id of the sql-server user account that the provider

1569368
attributes	properties
the best if you really want to enforce that it is a properties of the class and not of the instances is to use an attributes on the class

1569368
attributes	properties
as said by darkassassin93 one of the problem with this approach is that you can t enforce it s presence and .so you have to document that this attributes is necessary contrary to an abstract properties where the compiler does the job for you

1569395
binary-search-tree	trie
storing them order on the lower or higher of the two numbers should cut down a bit the time taken to find what you re after particularly if you store them in a binary-search-tree or a trie

1569397
callback	methods
that is how the documentation show it being done -- the methods is describe as function callback indexinarray valueofelement

1569400
getter	setter
i would just like to throw the idea of annotations getter and setter

1569400
getter	setter
with getter and setter you should be able to do both

1569401
communication	messages
i appears that the infopath only wants to communication via a soap 1.0 messages

1569445
authentication	login
if they are not authentication redirect them to your login page with the url in the query-string

1569445
authentication	login
of course this is all built into .net using authentication where you can deny anonymous access to certain directory and .when you do that .net will redirect to your login page which is set in the web-config and will include a returnurl blahblah on your login page

1569456
click	mouse
the second windows responds to mouse click etc

1569457
toggleclass	hide
i am using a jquery s toggleclass methods to handle tablerow highlight and what i would like to do is create a function that will hide all tablerows that do not have the highlight class applied

1569458
value	field
1 the existing value for the field aren t pre-populated and

1569466
deployment	install
its easy to install exe s and dll s with but i ve got a more complicated deployment process

1569471
shell	bash
how do i get a bash or a similar shell for my new symbian s60 rev 5 phone nokia 5800

1569471
telnet	ssh
i already install putty for s60 but it does not have telnet and it seems that there is no local ssh server running

1569476
sql-server	ms-access
i manage an sql-server 2005 database and i would like to give readonly access to the necessary tables to a grouping of 20-30 networked users who are able to use the gui in ms-access 2007 to write or modify their own queries to the database with some help

1569479
inno-setup	nsis
i cannot create .msi files cause i don t have vs professional and i want to have much more control over the install than nsis or inno-setup give me

1569487
entity-framework	ado.net
applied to object that use ado.net entity-framework or linq

1569487
.net	wcf
better comparable in .net is wcf

1569487
.net	wcf
wcf is the communication framework within .net and is the aspects in .net most comparable to ejb remoting

1569512
contains	set
this response may contains an easily parseable set of key-value pairs but they wouldn t be .post anything

1569539
factors	primes
the second loops checked that the numbers is square-free has no factors which is a square of a primes

1569539
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
also i don t think your implementation of the sieve of atkin is necessarily faster than a straight-forward sieve-of-eratosthenes would be

1569539
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
however the fastest possible most optimized sieve of atkin would beat the fastest possible most optimized sieve-of-eratosthenes

1569556
put	get
you will get a syntax-error if you try to put the single-quotes around the question mark placeholder for the bound parameter and if you do not put the single-quotes inside the variables that you are using as the bound parameter the result will always be 0 rows found

1569560
expression	evaluation
i m not sure what makes you think that assign the result-of the expression to a variables first would be more efficient than evaluation the expression itself but it s never going to matter .so choose the option that enhances the reliability of your code

1569570
.when	ready
.when a change is ready the developer makes sure it merges cleanly to the trunk by merging trunk changes and resolving conflicts

1569574
abstract	extends
alternatively you could roll your own membership-provider by extends the abstract membership-provider class and then use system.directoryservices to checked against active-directory .when validation a user validateuser methods of membership-provider

1569577
low-level	hardware
i think it s mostly because c lets developers squeeze every last little bit of performance out of hardware whereas java doesn t it s not low-level enough for things like high end 3d video rendering

1569582
unsafe	out
i think another strong points to .net is that if you do need to be able to squeeze out that last bit of performance and do some pointsers math or implements a sophisticated high-performance algorithm it s a lot easier thanks to the unsafe mode

1569583
macros	let
let s take this macros as an example

1569588
registration	login
the html registration form appears but the problem is that the html login form won t

1569590
dictionary	arrays
informal dictionary vs arrays vs object performance benchmarking

1569603
python	lua
many games employ scripting languages like lua or python to get higher level programming

1569609
bad-request	http-error
open-uri http-error 400 bad-request

1569617
contains	any
because these are random html files they could contains any content but i would prefer to not have to store or determine the original dtd

1569619
document	editing
above we looked at the way how document opening and editing is handled

1569658
assign	add
usually .when a webpart gets added all parameters that it has available for input get assign a default-value for instances add a dataformwebpart to an ampty page and bind it to a list

1569662
svnkit	svn
how do you use svnkit to enumerate svn repositories in a root directory

1569681
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the issue is that of the browsers in windows that i tested firefox ie safari and google-chrome they don t seem to capture this event .when flash is in full screens mode

1569702
binary-search-tree	data-structures
for binary-search-tree types of data-structures i see the big-o is typically noted as o logn

1569730
shell	bash
i m currently using bash but would be curious to see solutions for any unix shell

1569735
handler	service
i m wondering if there s some kind of messages header i can apply to the methods or package and that can be accessed by some types of handler or something outside of each web service methods

1569743
visualstatemanager	textblock
what you just describe fading in a textblock in response to some business-logic change is a perfect case for using visualstatemanager states

1569747
subclassing	superclass
subclassing and superclass instances

1569773
callback	methods
i used spring s hibernatetemplate to save entity i also add callback methods like this

1569773
callback	methods
but i found this callback annotations was not called .when i called saveorupdate methods

1569773
callback	methods
i found some .post said that only use entitymanager will call these callback annotations methods is it right

1569775
contains	elements
is there an efficient way to walk the dom elementstree to find the contains elements

1569775
javascript	dom
.so i m hoping i can toss the the coordinate into javascript and do the hit testing there with dom apis.

1569776
user-controls	ascx
a user-controls ascx usually has a code-behind of

1569776
user-controls	ascx
notice the aspx instead of the ascx for a user-controls

1569776
user-controls	ascx
maybe you have the ascx control user-controls specified above using a code-behind file that is inheriting from system.web.ui.page instead of system.web.ui.usercontrol that could be causing the visual-studio errors

1569776
user-controls	ascx
for a user-controls ascx your files should be named

1569779
directory	folder
how can i delete a directory folder that contains files or and other folder in j2me

1569782
shell	bash
the process-substitution for bash does a similar thing transparently .so use this only if you have a different shell

1569783
execution	exit
the exit at the end is recommended .so execution doesn t continue unnecessarily

1569787
value	field
edit the subject field in the standards value item monthly email newsletter

1569787
value	field
i would expect the subject would be the one from the standards value item however it seems the branch field value is blank and in turn the created item also has a blank subject field

1569787
value	field
should the branch field value be that of the standards value

1569787
any	set
or does the very act of creating a branch item eliminate any standards value you set

1569788
boost	stl
also knowledge of common libs like stl and boost couldn t hurt...but be sure you know what those libs give you

1569823
interop	tlbimp
then expose create a primary interop assembly for the vb 6 module using tlbimp or simply reference the exe as a com component from your c# code

1569831
gethashcode	equals
i had never noticed this before but it seems vb s anonymous types do not overrides equals and gethashcode

1569852
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
as long as your users aren t using old versioning of safari google-chrome or opera you re in luck use document.elementfrompoint x y msdn ref mozilla ref quirks-mode article

1569863
quirks-mode	firefox
documented here for firefox 3 and here for ie but see quirks-mode for cross-browser difference

1569893
cos	sin
fwiw some cpu s can compute sin cos simultaneously for example fsincos on x86

1569893
cos	sin
if you do this you can make it a bit faster with three call rather than 6 to compute the initial sin cos value

1569897
any	set
client wants tinymce custom built with an ajax image loader that is simplistic in the nature that any idiot can upload and set some settings to an image within the text-editor and make it look nice

1569897
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
firefox opera google-chrome etc work flawlessly but ie of course has the problem

1569938
httpwebrequest	webclient
i even scrapped the whole webclient and went the old httpwebrequest httpwebresponse route and i still get the same error

1569952
conditional	operators
you can then use the general sql logic operators and or not to join multiple exists conditional together

1569956
subclassing	nsobject
but it didnt work due to the fact i have just known lately that nsobject and its subclassing dont implements the protocols nscopying by default

1569964
linked-list	tree	data-structures	tree	data-structures	linked-list
for fun i m going to write my own implementation of common data-structures like linked-list or binary sorted tree

1569966
height	frame
if that doesn t work you can use numberofsections and rectforsection to building a loops that determines the height of the table s contents and reset its frame manually

1569979
value	field
changing that field in the standards value should then updates it in the branches and items

1569979
value	field
if you have changed the field on the item however the link would be broken and you would no longer manage it from the standards value with out resetting the value

1569993
perl	c++
any language is okay i prefer to use perl or c++

1569997
instances	private
in the default shorthand notation the compiler creates a private instances member of the delegation types and uses it in the way that i describe above

1570003
python	ruby	python	java
this means you can have third parties use your antlr parsing to create say python assembly c or ruby .when all you initially provided was java and c# output

1570031
server-side-includes	include
if you want to include newfile.php on the server side you need to use either server-side-includes libcurl or just include remote_file

1570037
nscopying	nscoding
there is no easy way to copy an objective-c object that does not implements nscopying unless you use nsresponder s suggestion of using nscoding in which case there is. there is nscopyobject but this is perhaps the most dangerous function in all of foundation see nscopyobject considered harmful for my thoughts on this insane function

1570061
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i m not sure if that is the goal from the way you wrote the question but depending on your it environment i d expect people who use firefox or safari or opera or ... to be less than enthusiastic

1570065
append	input
on the next pass you would read the input again and process columns 11 thru 20 append the results to the original output file

1570075
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that .when using firefox or google-chrome it show up in different places on different pages

1570084
click	mouse
i d bind all needed dom elements to the click event this will give me appropriate dom object onclientclick as well as mouse positioning

1570092
children	nodes
nodes with no parent_foo_id would be considered at the top of the heirerchy while all successive nodes would appear as children of their parent

1570093
scala	java
you could probably do just as well writing it in java or scala

1570099
constructor	object
and then in the object s constructor store that types .so variables .so that your methods could look like this

1570104
quirks-mode	doctype
it used to be .so that document with doctype got standards mode document without doctype got quirks-mode

1570122
authentication	login
my question - and i apologize for it being a bit vague i ve not been this exasperated in quite a long time - is to request some guidance for plugging in kerberos authentication without login forms in jetty 6

1570128
extjs	flex
also since you re working with small medium businesses they will be more wowed with flex uis over jquery extjs whatever uis

1570131
scala	java
you can approximately do that out-of-the-box with clojure and scala and with java if you add beanshell

1570134
jquery	.post	http-get	get
then just use an http-get or .post from jquery to call the action to get the rendering html to be display

1570135
coalesce	isnull
isnull and coalesce

1570156
contains	any
the scripting is as follows the hudson.log logfile is created at boot but doesn t contains any output

1570176
callback	methods
provide a callback methods for the asynchronous handle .so that it can notify you .when it is completed or

1570179
credentials	security
the key to this scenario is using windows security rather than sql-server security -- access silently passes the credentials .when it request the connection via odbc

1570186
directory	folder
make sure you copy move it in etc init.d folder and checked your link files in rc 2345 .d directory

1570206
text-align	display
it always display the elements at top even if scrolled but the text-align centering doesn t work at all

1570215
ruby	php
arrays in javascript ruby and php have a variables size and can store an object scalar of any types they can also grow or have elements removed from them

1570215
ruby	php
if that s the case then â again these are suspicions that i m looking to have confirmed or rejected â arrays in javascript and ruby are actually vectors and php arrays are probably tables of some kind

1570228
centering	fixed
if you are using a fixed size then use the left properties to centering it since you are fixing the positioning

1570229
internet-explorer	firefox
edit i just tested and this works in firefox and internet-explorer 7

1570242
python	ruby
i was planning to do this in either python or ruby

1570251
contains	any
else if xml contains any extra tags which are not present in object

1570259
value	field
for info it reduces enums to int typically requiring only 1 byte for the enum value and 1 byte to identify the field

1570265
multiplication	addition
the mathematical product operators is a specific example of this idea with multiplication replacing the addition of the summation operators

1570279
bison	yacc
having some experience with it i d use yacc or bison to write a parsing that would only generator a parsing tree if the input was a valid linear equation

1570318
sql-server	mysql
not sure if mysql has this but sql-server has a rank over partition by that you can use to assign each result a rank...doing .so would allow you to only selected those of rank 1 and discard the rest

1570320
textbox	button
if you have a textbox and a button

1570327
dictionary	hashmap	dictionary	arrays	hashmap	arrays
programming or hashmap dictionary an arrays

perl	awk
awk and its descendants perl have associativity

1570359
json	xml
rest json xml php soap protocols every endpoint is namespaced lots of options parameters for every request

1570364
packets	ping
ping should return 0 on success 1 on failure such as unknown hosts illegal packets size etc

1570380
response	timeout
chances are good that the amount of time it takes to generator your spreadsheet exceeds the timeout period allowed for code to finish execution during a response

1570386
sorted	lookup
using trie structures as suggested by perimosocordiae as the underlying storage for these sorted key and associated wordss s wordsids in the leaf nodes words lookup can be done in o n time where n is the numbers of letters or better on average due to non-existing wordss

1570392
shell	bash
found what you were using you have to use set -k see shell built-in cmd in the bash manual

1570398
any	set
try any of these to set a temporary environment variables

1570406
linked-list	nodes	constructor	object
if you re assuming that the nodes object controls the lifetime of the data inside it your nodes constructor or the add function in linked-list will have to make a copy of the data that it is being passed

1570408
required	checked
you would need to checked that the referrer http header matches your site s domain prior to running the watermarking code to determine whether a watermark is required

1570410
notepad++	textpad
maybe you can use a text-editor like textpad or notepad++ for this kind of job

1570410
notepad++	textpad
if your data is tab separated you can easily copy-paste data between excel and textpad notepad++ without losing any formatting

1570448
kerberos	ldap
nis ldap kerberos .

1570464
javascript	dom
as you can see using native dom operations is quite a bit more work but if this is the only javascript functionality you need it might not be worth downloading a whole libs

1570470
constructor	object
it can be handy to initializer object to null or send null parameters into a methods constructor to indicate state or function

1570473
.net	wcf
note using .net 2.0 .so asmx service and no wcf

1570477
markup	xhtml
the only reason why you probably shouldn t use the new doctype is if you want to use xhtml 1.0 markup and conform to xhtml 1.0

1570490
dictionary	map
for your dictionary index building a map map bag char list string

1570490
unique	words
a bag char is an identifier for a words that is unique up to character order

1570500
.when	ready
this code could for example be launchd at startup through the autoexec macros .so that your users will have their links ready .when they open their .app

1570501
ubuntu	debian
if you use debian ubuntu try apt-get install libpng-dev first

1570509
authentication	login
taking the login example if you re storing authentication user information such as userid and client ip-address in an object you could store that object within

1570520
arrays	loops
i have created an arrays that is populate from a wordpress loops -

1570522
hide	show
the problem is that all the javascript show hide div code i find isnt really meant for dynamic instances they all need to be pre assign to a particular div

1570522
hide	show
is there an easy way to dynamically generator show hide controls for a varying numbers of layer

1570537
diagram	erd
the erd diagram created by the wizard in sql-server management studio is a physical erd not a logical one

1570542
environment	building
my pyqt application works fine .when running on linux .when in my windows building environment or frozen on the machine where it was building with py2exe

1570542
environment	building
this was necessary with the previous building environment but moving or renaming that dll doesn t change any behavior

1570552
binary-search-tree	tree	binary-search-tree	binary-tree	binary-search-tree	nodes	binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	nodes
.when developing an intuition about tree structures it s helpful to understand that a binary-search-tree can be searched in o n log n time because that is the height of the tree - that is in a binary-tree with n nodes the tree depth is o n log n base 2

1570552
children	nodes	children	tree
if each nodes has three children the tree can still be searched in o n log n time but with a base 3 logarithm

1570552
children	nodes
computationally the numbers of children each nodes has can have a big impact on performance see for example link text

1570593
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.3 gecko 20090824 firefox 3.5.3 .net clr 3.5.30729

1570600
while-loop	arrays
this statement is made to iterate over object properties for arrays a traditional for or while-loop is recommended

1570615
libcrypto	openssl
you should then still be able to use the sscrypto framework or you can just call the openssl libcrypto routines directly

1570653
radio-button	selected
after this selected run configuration which will launchd a confiuration windows in eclipse and you need to click on the radio-button next to the instrumentation runner and selected the configure instrumentation runner from the drop down

1570664
font-size	display
it will always be better than changing the font-size to display a pseudo half-space because this is not correct with many fonts for which this will still be too large and also because this does not work as expected in spans of text that have colored backgrounds changing the font-size modifies the line-height

1570664
background-color	display
the same without the containers does not display the background-color but it does use the normals proportional fonts .so that the thin spaces is effectively rendering as thin

1570670
latitude-longitude	location
what about using an average latitude-longitude location of all addresses within miles

1570674
string.format	stringbuilder
you can use appendformat ... instead of append string.format ... on a stringbuilder

1570678
32-bit	64bit

1570687
attributes	properties
the bind attributes in this case is telling asp.net-mvc to ignore the id properties of the customer class .when binding form field to model properties

1570687
exception-handling	try-catch
if you want to report unexpected errors like database related exception-handling then you can certainly add a try-catch block around the call to insertcustomer and return the necessary result for display the error messages back to the client

1570729
64bit	x86
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local-variables into registers for faster access

1570739
spring.net	csla
not using any well known libs like log4net csla spring.net drools

1570773
32-bit	64bit
for a pointers it will return the size of the memory-address 4 on 32-bit 8 on 64bit

1570797
local-variables	function-call
if a function-call allocates more than 4096 bytes of local-variables it is possible that the first stack access from it will actually stretch beyond the guard page

1570797
constructor	object
in other words that the access violation occurs near the beginning of an operators methods or some other part of the cout implementation temporary object constructor etc.

1570804
any	set
now i have managed to circumvent this situation sometimes in the past by using the rather inelegant methods of entering some simple sql statement click any cell in the result set within excel then switching to vba and setting the commandtext properties manually in the immediate windows

1570805
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit versioning might be slightly slower or slightly faster than the 32-bit versioning

1570806
command-line	cmd
knowing the cmd that are behind everything or at least generally equivalent helps learn to use command-line tools more easily and also show you where to look in documentation to understand gitk better

1570818
tortoisegit	gitx
if you want a gui for git checked tortoisegit on windows or gitx on mac or qgit on linux

1570844
delphi	basic
close second i m not aware of any native delphi libs that can match msxml s depth of features however omnixml provides great support for basic xpath queries and if you re not using expression for example then it s a pretty good alternative

1570856
double-quotes	single-quotes
it works for double-quotes only single-quotes will display the variables named which leads to error

1570860
show	next
in the link to show the embedding layer is there any way instead of putting #embedding i can do .something .so it grabs the next div .so i can use this dynamically

1570871
textbox	button
the user enters a value into this textbox then presses a button

1570899
child-process	sigint
aim i want to be able to sigint any child-process after a certain timeout

1570912
jquery	.post
now am using .post action to get the value and bind the list its getting full page load but i want to use to ajax with jquery option to show the list of datas in the same view page any one please help me with the code

1570913
contains	set
my points is that it only takes ten minutes to set up a wiping program and start it before leaving and in the morning you have a disk that contains no data that could be possibly recovered - doesn t hurt and compeletely removes the risk

1570915
directory	folder
since in svn the branch is a cheap copy we try to always branch at the root of the project directory if its the folder trunk itself then the branch will be off trunk -- this avoids confusion later about who branched off where and avoids having to run cmd to find it out

1570916
digits	zero
your example means the match needs to be followed by zero or more characters and then a digits but again that part isn t capture

1570917
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
edit after trying to compile two c programs bonus points for something that uses perl python ruby

1570929
selected	cell
how can i get the value of the cell of the selected rows

1570939
authentication	login
we don t have any need to authentication the cient subscriber using wcf-security because we have our own username passwd login which the clients will use to log on the server

1570947
linux	unix
on linux unix use and be really really sure that the device given is the correct one

1570975
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the latest for linux is 5.x although ubuntu debian only has 3.x

1570978
contains	any
in postgresql you can switching on query logging resulting in a file contains all queries issued by any client

1571007
constructor	object
you would need to pass the types as a constructor parameter to the class .when the object is initializer

1571013
python	ruby	python	java
- but if you know sites like commandlinefu just for shell stuff you may also want something like that for ruby java python or c#

1571019
difference	zero
but in general tiobe gives a good idea i think and it should get better since at least google tends to know the difference between zero two or four pluses

1571048
.war	jar
defined an earlier phase for your jar assemblies .so that they have all been packaged before the .war is packaged

1571048
.war	jar
move the jar content into separate project and specify them as dependencies of the .war project .so they are packaged automatically

1571049
any	set	lookup	any
if it does i want to retrieve the tag properties if any and set the content properties with the value i lookup using the tag

versioning	upgrade
i seems the problem is likely to occur if i change the workspace view somehow and or upgrade p4v to new versioning

1571194
order	join
in the past .when working with databases i ve found it necessary to do low-level tweak to the query for example providing hints to the optimiser that it should use a particular index or join order

the pages also contains a listview with a nested datalist

1571508
put	get
there are button on these pages which .when click grab the html content of the page write it to a htmltextwriter then get the text and put it into an email

1571508
any	set
manually set any textbox to visible false then populate literals controls with corresponding textbox value which is rather messy and tedious

1571508
datalist	listview
is there a better way to do all this i m thinking that perhaps doing some .net1.1 styles xslt transforms with page content defined in xml files might be a better way to approach this but am unsure if this will handle my requirement where i m currently using a listview with a nested datalist

1571513
constructor	object
where should we create object of class inside constructor of parent class or with in a function

1571513

fourier series calculations required some sin cos value to be known

1571542
any	set
you can extends this set manually using any textfield in your movie with the character embedding... dialog as long as you use the actual libs fonts named it show in the fonts list with an asterisc at the end.

1571549
cos	sin
as a side points it doesn t make any sense to represent these functions using fourier series since you re just creating a circular problem of how you then evaluate the sin cos terms of series

1571882
any	set
with the appropriate privileges you can call chown 2 to set the gid of a file to any numbers or setgid 2 to set the gid of the current process there s a little more to it than that with effective ids supplementary ids etc

1571882
linux	unix
giving a named to a gid is done by an entry in etc grouping on basic unix linux pthreads systemd but that s really just a conventions adhered to by the unix linux pthreads userland tools

1571891

1571902
protected	public
are they public or if they are protected are you inheriting from the class

1571921
abstract-class	subclassing
also you can replace the interface with an abstract-class for which the constructor required an hashmap that will force subclassing to give one but not more the subclassing will not necessarily have an hashmap parameter

1571935
arrays	map
the map then splits each line along spaces and then creates an anonymous arrays reference for each line

1571946
command-line	cmd
this will evaluate the command-line arguments as shell cmd

1571949

since scala runs on the jvm you can do this the same way as you would in java by using runtime.getruntime execute ... look that up in the java-api documentation

1572112
onmouseover	mouseover
it s al.so generally good practice to nest your second level nav inside your li tag as a nested list this would enable the mouseover state to carry over to hovering over the newly show panels code as it is a child of the li .so you are still technically onmouseover of the contains li block

1572125
set	bag
the semantics of a bag do not match that of a set which is that a set can only have unique instances and a bag can have duplicates instances

1572135

1572167
.when	ready
i suggest that you dispatcher a custom event out of the textinput itemrenderer .when you have a textinput.datachange event or some other textinput.event that suits .when you are ready to save the value

1572204
any	set	response	timeout
i would like to get assistance in one of my projects..ill explain the issues..what am doin is execution a long php scripting...where it takes a long time to finish running it..im experiencing scripting execution timeout and network timeout issues....in my scripting..its a for-loop which does 2-3 process on each iterator...one is requesting an external service through libcurl and getting the response and pasrsing the xml insert the response to the database...suppose that each iterator takes around 1-2 sec...for timeout issues i tried to set the max_execution_timeout and default_socket_timout to 0..please suggest if there is any issue with it..eventhough this is temporary...and main thing to note is for the loop..there may be more than 70k records....its basically a bulk sms system..

1572204
response	timeout
this timeout mainly .when the browser complaints the server..that im waiting for your response for many hours and its time for me to sleep...so bye bye..this is what i learned .so far....so i thought of queing the longs list of recording into small chunks and execution those and sending the response to the browser thereby satisfying it...but the problem im been working around for few days is sending the partials response to the browser...using fflush or ob_implicit_fflush true

1572215
any	set
my assumption was that if a socket was in the time-wait status and had been set with the so-reuseaddr option any new sockets attempting to use that ports would be able to - however i am still receiving the noroutetohostexception

1572455
callback	methods
the following example works but how can i change it .so that instead of execution the anonymous methods it execute my existing callback methods oncreateoffercomplete

1572468
directory	folder
the watcher simply doesn t find all the files in the directory - only if the files are placed in the folder one by one - not if lots of files are copy-paste to the folder at the same time.

1572469
unsigned	short
and then for every unsigned short you get out of the streaming make an int of that short and the previous short and compare that unsigned int to the 16 unsigned int s

1572483
mousemove	mousedown
and only triggers once each mousedown + mousemove

1572499
constructor	object
every double arrays is an object but not every object is a double arrays . the most specific constructor is therefore confusing double which explains the program s output

1572633
webserver	security
as for the security of this this is as secure as your webserver

1572636
sql-server	mysql
have you actually proved that using an out-of-process sql database like mysql or sql-server is too slow or is this an assumption

1572636
schema	rdbms
despite the fact that the recording are plaintext i would still advise using sql over a flat-file solution using a text column in your table schema as the rdbms will perform optimisations that a filesystems cannot caching recently accessed pages etc

restart	reload
i tried restart zenoss and reload the view

1572663
silverlight	wpf
i have a project that i am doing and i need to shared the code between silverlight and wpf assembly problem is that even though the wpf assembly is the owner of that file

1572704
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i work in a perl shop right now and i came from php .so i see .some of the advantages of an arguably low-level language .when doing things on the server-level but it seems to me a lot of the tasks in perl can be performed more quickly in php and .some argue subjective not my opinion that python does these tasks in a more explicit way that s easier to maintain

1572704
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i realize that cpan keeps the community going .so whether perl 6 comes out or not people continue to building modules that increase possibilities in the language but that doesn t mean that industry shops realize this and switching to more supported languages that keep coming out with revised versioning of the language like python and especially php

1572711
versioning	upgrade
i guess i didn t upgrade the right way but for a while i was running two versioning of perl concurrently

any	set
a linear systemd with 2 equation and 3 variables is under-determined -- there may be multiple solutions for any given set of parameters

1572731
versioning	upgrade
i know i m preaching to the choir here but it really is time to get your organization to upgrade to a newer versioning of sql-server

1572732
python	php
however i have never seen a php or python used in this industry not saying it is not used but that i never encountered

1572732
python	perl
nor have i ever heard any conversation of perl can not do x that python can let s use python

1572732

at first sight it appears to be the correct way to fix the problem and it does appear to be another random and arbitrary difference between wpf and silverlight

1574578
silverlight	wpf
don t forget the silverlight is not really a subset of wpf

1574583
firefox	safari
the issue i am having is that in firefox and safari there is a spaces above the list while in explorer it is display correctly with the fflush against the header

key-value	key
i am currently torn however between offering a key-value interface where the sort key is explicit separate from the value or a value-only interface where the value is either also the sort key or the user must handle a separate sort key by passing in some comparison function

1574749
key-value	key
in my view a key-value interface forces the user to always have a key separate from the value even .when some value naturally forms its own key

1574749
key-value	key
a value-only interface allows for a more compact representation of value that are their own key but forces the user to tracking and handle their own key in cases where there is a natural key-value distinction

1574754
restart	reload
in the case where you need to take a new versioning restart the process or reload the libs - restart the process sounds better - your program can execute itself

my hunch is that it s because internally it has to compare the grouping key for each datatable row and the dictionary key aren t considered equals just because they have the same key and value .so each row has a different grouping key and are thus not aggregate

1575422
double	int
assuming double int and enum maintain consistency i won t swear to it but i believe double is an ieee standards it should work reliably

1575579
value	field
i have a database that contains two field that collect multiple value

1575582
gethashcode	tostring
the problem is that you need a single class for it to compare and it uses both tostring and gethashcode in the comparison which is why your dictionary idea didn t work it isn t comparing the elements of the dictionary it s comparing the tostring and gethashcode of it

1575675
deep-copy	object
it does a complete deep-copy of all instances data with no coding required in the object

1575675
attributes	properties
it required nothing no attributes implements interfaces public properties nothing

1575675
dictionary	map
now that is simple enough it just building a dictionary map for the object during the clone and populate it with any object that should not be cloned

i need to sort this arrays using a quicksort and bubble-sort combinations

1575749
bubble-sort	quicksort
once i understand how to do a quicksort with it ll click and i ll be able to easily to bubble-sort

1575752
arrays	loops	32-bit	64bit
one promising one would be to use larger chunks of data 64bit or 32-bit at once instead of 8 you could also detection cases where offset are synchronized for both arrayss and in such cases use a memcmp instead of the main loops replace modulo 8 by logical-operators 7 replace 8 by 3 etc. have to branches of code instead of swapping s1 and s2 etc but the main purpose is achieved only one memory read and not memory write for each arrays item hence most of the work can take place inside processor registers

1575789
attributes	properties	one-to-many	entity
mappedby attributes for one-to-many is used for bi-directional assocations and specifies the named of the properties on collections elements that maps back to owner entity as many-to-one

1575881
.when	ready
the ready function runs once .when the dom tree is ready

1575882
python	php
c# is next easier you do have to declare variables types but like python and php it manages memory on your behalf but the multi-platform aspects everywhere but on windows you d have to rely on the mono project are less convincing

1575888
value	field
a more typical definition of foreign would wrap the union in a struct that include a types discriminator field .so that the valid branch of the union is known explicit at runtime for each value of that types

1575896
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
openoffice.org spreadsheet

1575905
required	checked
innodb requiredd indexes on foreign key and referenced key .so that foreign key checked can be fast and not required a table scan

it also seems to be browser-specific -- firefox won t submit the form .when the user hits enter in a textbox but safari will

1575964
firefox	safari
firefox 3.5.3 safari 4.0.3 macosx

1575964
firefox	opera
a basically you don t. i believe this is because the behavior is inconsistent across platform and web browsers and what works for firefox might not work for ie or opera

1575964
firefox	safari
tested in firefox safari and ie 8

1575995
python	java
i made sure to be very detailed .so it can be easily coded to c java python

1576015
ia-32	x86
the canonical reference to x86 is probably the intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures software developer s manual

1576023
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
if you want a programming language that you can use in any environment then c++ python ruby and java are strong choices also c# if you re willing to consider mono but that does not guarantee that code you write on one platform will run well or at all on other platform

1576023
silverlight	wpf
wpf and silverlight are exciting on the graphics front but that s much higher level than directx or opengl .so it depends very much on your goals

1576031
digits	zero
thats the quick and dirty solution but in the long run it d probably be better to use a split t and count the numbers of field it gets and then checked to make sure field 3 zero origin is just digits

1576036
key-value	key
for very simple lookup tables with a limited numbers of rows and where i m in complete control of the data meaning it s not populate from .some outside .source i ll .sometimes create meaningful four or five character key .so that the key-value can proxy for the fully descriptive lookup value in .some queries

1576047
directory	folder
you would need to apply this permission on the folder that the virtual directory points to

1576058
versioning	upgrade
then make your paid versioning the free paid upgrade versioning and remove your existing lite versioning from the store

1576058
versioning	upgrade	versioning	migrate	upgrade	migrate
a problem with this is how to get all of your existing customers to upgrade to the intermediate versioning that flips the paid switching in time to migrate the application to the free paid upgrade model

1576067
entity-framework	ado.net
i have an .app using the ado.net entity-framework the vs2008 versioning not the newer cooler one and i need to be able to make a call down to the underlying dbms it s postgresql inorder to call some sql that entity-framework doesn t support

1576067
entity-framework	ado.net
i need to run a truncated before insert i m ok with a hacky solution pull out the dbms s connection-string info from ef and use that to create a connection using the postgresql ado.net provider but don t want to manage two sets of connection-strings one for entity-framework one for ado.net

you are trying to initializer the instances field saveformat with a value that depends on the instances field capturetime using field-initializerr syntax

1576256
copy-constructor	shallow-copy	copy-constructor	deep-copy	shallow-copy	deep-copy
if i read the code right as the formatting is somewhat off the problem is most likely that your stock copy-constructor does a shallow-copy whereas the assignment-operator for the same class makes a deep-copy

1576266
pdb	egg
i suspect that somehow the use of an egg is confusing pdb as to what files are being used i can t reproduce the error if i use a non-egg ed libs like pickle

1576689
malloc	free
.when hacking malloc free functions itâ s okay

1576695
subclassing	inherited
if the object-model is an inherited hierarchy then the relationship should not need to be bi-directional and the solution is to obtain the subclassing instances from the subclassing dao

1576695
subclassing	base-class
this removes the need to navigate from the base-class to the subclassing in the base-class dao

1576695
set	bag
if the object-model is a bi-directional relationship then you need to set inverse true on the set or bag at the one end of the relationship - in this case basicentity

1576695
set	bag
hibernate 3 allows the use of indexed collections at the one end of the relationship but the hibernate 2 functionality with set or bag should be enough to test the theory

1577096
switching	screens
it can do the basic switching to full screens and back to normals size stunts however with one exception-handling

1577096
switching	screens	player	movie
on the first fresh load of the .app if i switching to full screens mode first and then click to play the movie the player would be in full screens yet the movie itself would remain in it s original size

1577096
switching	screens
if i switching screens sizes during movie playback then the movie size will shrink or stretch as it should

1577097

google-webmaster-tools	googlebot
fyi google-webmaster-tools just added a handy new feature that show you the actual content sent by the server .when googlebot accesses it

1577209
32-bit	64bit
in many 64bit oses such as 64bit linux int are still only 32-bit wide

1577209
32-bit	64bit
the reason for this is that in many cases an int does not need more range than is provided by 32-bit and using 64bit would only waste memory

1577209
32-bit	64bit
under 64bit windows evens longs are 32-bit for compatibility with 32-bit windows and only long longs are 64bit

1577209
32-bit	64bit
if your application is going to be running on 32-bit as well as 64bit operating systemd then the range of a 32-bit int is obviously sufficient -- otherwise you would be in trouble on the 32-bit os

1577209
32-bit	64bit
if you code cleanly 32-bit 64bit portability should be almost a non-issue -- there s not really much more you need to be aware of than what i ve written above

1577209
32-bit	64bit
portability between windows and linux will generator much greater issues that portability between 32-bit and 64bit

1577696
double	int
i need to store a collections of int and double representing nominal and real valued data in c++

1577696
double	int
the efficiency i am talking about is primarily the efficiency of retrieving the int double value of a certain column although fast setting of value is important too

1577696
double	int
after .some more thought and reading the suggestions .so far it seems that just storing int columns and double columns in two separate vectors is a .solid .solution

1577696
double	int
just storing as a is okay too i guess but it depends on how fast the conversion between double and int is which is probably pretty impressive

1577700
local-variables	class-variables	instance-variables	local-variables	instance-variables	class-variables
what kind of variables do you have local-variables instance-variables class-variables or global-variables

1577705
double	int
but in that case you d have to have some way to know which elements of the vector should be treated as int and which ones should be treated as double

1577705
double	int
to keep tracking of which ones are int and which ones are double you could use a bitset or something like that

1577705
double	int
if not and exact int precision isn t important then you might as well just store them all as double

1577716
margins	padding
also checked for margins padding on the parent elements s such as .moduletableisw and also any spacing on sibling elementss

1577719
bufferedreader	printwriter

1578875
subclassing	superclass
since the responsibility of that change lies entirely with the subclassing then the responsibility for triggers validation must also be with them the superclass can perform validation given the proposed new value of b but it cannot know .when validity must be checked

1578875
abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	inherited
if most subclassing fall into broad category in terms of the strategies they use to affect their b s value you can factors that out into either intermediate abstract-class inheriting from the general one and specializing the general approach to determining b including the validation call or better if feasible some form of strategy design pattern typically implements via either composition or mix-in inherited

1578888

1579432
svnadmin	dump
is the svnadmin dump format documented somewhere

1579432
svnadmin	dump	svnadmin	svnkit
seems like the svnkit libs would have it or have a way to obtain this metadata programmatically but i ve been running around the svnkit javadoc for the last hour and can t find a way to get what i need without going through more trouble than just parsing the svnadmin dump file myself

1579440
shell	bash
also you tagged this question c however i am starting off with a common linux pattern a native application with a bash shell scripting wrapper

1579764
sql-server	ms-access
.when you attach a sql-server view as an ms-access linked table you are asked for a unique identifier

1579771
grouping	sorting
the reason for which i avoid sorting is that it may take some more time and because after i make the first set of grouping some of them will be locked and the unlocked grouping will be dissolved and regrouped using a different time offset

1579771
grouping	sorting
and .when dissolving grouping the files order may be changed and they will required sorting again

1579773
children	nodes	children	tree
you need to traversal your tree .so you ll need to call your function on your children nodes

1579783
average	median
i think you shouldn t use the average of those samples as that would be a median filtering not exactly downsampling

1579788
udp	tcp
i would suggest using udp rather than tcp with manual ack cmd this way you don t get the constants connect sockets as per your boss

that way in your unit tests you can just drop in a replacement methods that determines the environment and configuration variables in a different way such as from a file or directly set at the top of your test scripting

1579935
logging	trace
it sounds like most of the logging that s slowing you down should be trace level though

1579936
processor	cpu
answering the first question apps which benefit most and most easily from multicore processor are server apps which service many clients and have high per-client cpu cost like webserver database servers and other application servers-- and apps which run on top of those servers

1579942
debugging	trace
i haven t been able to trace this in debugging mode

1579944
buffering	streaming
data is streaming buffering left is left lookup table middle is middle lookup table and right is right lookup table

1579944
buffering	streaming
above loops cannot detection a pattern if it is placed at the very end of streaming buffering

1579966

1579997
any	set
we can create new queries fine .so the odbc connection is set up correctly but we cannot change any queries

1580007
external	embed
the easiest way to make std list sort do what you want is to embed a reference to an external counter object in your functor

1580008
firefox	opera
my past attempts at writing userscripts ended working in firefox but not opera because of subtle difference between the two browsers

1580014
instances	private
in this case we the proxy class would be private to the string class .so the user could never create an instances of the proxy class except as a temporary

1580018

if i set it to fullrow which is supposed to only selected the whole row no matter where you click on that row it still visually selecteded individual cell .when you click on them

1580095
selected	cell
as you can see it sure looks like there is a cell selected the g row of the named column

1580095

double	int
unforunately both of these methods required you transform your byte into one of int float or double depending on the image format

1580216
put	get
but i don t know what to put in routes.rb to get it to hook up correctly.

1580239

removing the double-quotes from the use a table or view textbox on the ado.net destination editor or replacing them with something else does not work if there is a spaces in the table named

1580254
double-quotes	single-quotes
.when ssis puts the insert query together it retains the double-quotes and adds single-quotes

1580262
aggregate	grouping
now an initial naive look would suggest you use a group-by clause since that would allow you to split the data into individual grouping for each department but grouping in sql does not really give you a key+all-matching-rows types of result rather it allows you to do aggregate calculations like for each department how many employees do i have

1580262
contains	set
now having said that if you have the proper relationships set in your data context related classes each department should already have .some kind of properties that contains all employees in that department .so perhaps the simple query is just give me all departments and then you can for each department retrieve the employees

1580263
arrays	map
they re far more powerful than java s arrays and include much of the functionality of list and map

1580292

the answer is changing httpwebrequest httpwebresponse to webrequest webresponse only

1580363
order	join
part of the result set include a foreign key and i d like join on that key while ensuring the order remains the same

1580363
order	join
is this a quirk of mysql or am i assured that a join won t change the order

1580378
contains	any
settings screens does not contains any additional logic just a couple of options and html echoed to the screens

1580383

if you want to hosts your wcf service in iis you need iis6 win server 2003 or preferably iis7 win server 2008 the .net 3.0 or preferably .net 3.5 sp1 framework and the ability to create virtual directory in iis .so yes you need at least .some degree of iis configurability

1580491
32-bit	64bit
an alternative to consider still with gritted teeth is a union of a 64bit pointers and an arrays of two 32-bit int and then requiring the fortran code to pass an arrays of two int .when you need to return a 64bit pointers

1580501

platform	anycpu
as i understand anycpu will target the current platform in my case x64

1580507
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
i assume .when i target x64 the program will use the 64bit .net 3.5 and similarly 32-bit framework for x86

anycpu does not target the current developer platform

1580580
32-bit	64bit
the jit compiler running on the target machine will compile the il into the 32-bit or 64bit instructions set according to the target machine operation systemd

1580580
platform	anycpu
this means that .net-assembly compiled as anycpu will run on both 32 and 64bit platform

1580604
contains	set
maybe you are printing japanese characters contains in utf-16 extended set of chars

1580623
32-bit	64bit
if you start you application on a 32-bit machine it will run in 32-bit if you start in on a 64bit systemd it will run in 64bit

1580623
32-bit	64bit
.when i used it in an application that was compiled to anycpu that application ran fine on a 32-bit systemd but could not load the libs on a 64bit systemd

1580623
64bit	x86
in that case the correct solution was to explicit compile to x86 this is a small tool that would not gain from running in 64bit

1580623
32-bit	64bit
.so my application runs as a 32-bit application even on a 64bit windows

1580623
platform	anycpu
another possibilty would be to keep the application compiled to anycpu but handle the different platform explicit for example by delay-loading the correct unmanaged assembly

value	field
for a simple workaround you might consider giving the blank field a token or placeholder value prior to serializing which you can test for on the server for example

1581097
erlang	python
i know this isn t directly python related but if you are looking to do heavy network process you should consider erlang instead of python

1581122
click	mouse
you d be better to pick a few key-events mouse click etc. and tracking only a few details such as time for them

1581151
click	mouse
my initial ideas were to accomplish this through either binding or handling a mouse click event but i haven t had success with either strategy .so far

1581153
pixels	line
you d have to do a checked to leave the item wherever it is if the axis was say x+n y+n but it would be pretty impressive if someone got more than a few pixels staying on the |x| |y| line

basically an automated build-process is required .when you want or need a continuous-integration process

1581492
ruby-on-rails	django
it s not like ruby-on-rails or django where you would learn a total new language you still have and can use php but it s best to stick with good programming principles with the framework instead of work around them with php

1581493
private-members	private	private-members	instances	instances	private
private data is accessible by any instances of that class even if one instances of class a is accessing the private-members of another instances of a

1581493
instances	private	protected	public
it s important to remember that that access-modifiers private protected public are controlling class access not instances access

1581494
shell	bash
shell bash

1581495
children	tree
once all the classes are built up into a tree like structure - one top level class contains a whole lot of other classes the isvalid methods is called on the parent which in turn call isvalid on all of its children

1581504
postgresql	mysql
actually i don t have a postgresql on hand to test if this actually works and mysql doesn t support sql-99 s with recursive and i don t seriously recommend it either

1581523
contains	set
the idea was that we would have a set of maps and these maps would contains variables such as

1581548
scp	ssh	sftp	scp	sftp	ssh
however keep in mind that scp is not sftp - they are completely different protocols that run over ssh

1581548
sftp	scp
it is possible that your sftp does not actually support scp - not all sftp servers do

1581558
css-frameworks	fluid
in particular the fluid grid one has lot of info and a lot of links to resources about the latest design techniques including some of the most popular css-frameworks for grid layout design

1581559
perl	php
is there some nix tool or perl php libs that will let you easily create directory tree visualizations that look like the following

1581563
animation	rotation
that all works but just in the second animation i see the correct rotation animation

1581563
animation	rotation
animation from landscape to high the rotation looks like a real rotation.

1581565
selected	button
selected the qgroupbox and click the lay out vertically toolbar button the one with three blue vertical bars

1581569
linux	osx
i m having trouble understanding the api to set up a l2cap or rfcomm client-server running on osx like i can with bluez on linux

1581578
scala	java
it s open-source and uses swing via both the java and scala libs interfaces

1581579
display	height
while you didn t .post the versioning of ie which was showing the problem on my machine ie8 giving the a tall height clears up the scroll-back-to-top problem that happens .when you scroll with the keyboard while the pop-up menus are display

1581614
salt	md5
mr atwood wrote about the strength of md5 against rainbow tables and basically with a long salt like that you re sitting pretty though some random punctuation numbers it could improve it

1581617
selected	button
now i am using a browse button in my software to selected the text file then it is converted in to mdb access

1581619
linux	unix
how about this example from unix tree linux tree

1581624
silverlight	xbap	silverlight	wpf	partial-trust	xbap
you get all the benefits of the full wpf platform greater feature-set than silverlight and do not need to conform to the partial-trust restrictions of xbap although you will need to configure the clickonce server to allow for trusted application deployment

1581625
background-color	display
you could make your own griditem user-controls with the icons caption background-color etc display on a panels and then plop a bunch of them in the tablelayoutpanels and wire up some event handler

1581639
click	mouse
the following controls do not conform to the standards mouse click event behavior

1581639
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	button	checkbox	button
button checkbox combobox and radio-button controls

1581645
adobe-reader	itextsharp
pdf is a very standards and adobe-reader will always printing it right printinging will not be a problem we went through lot of options and it required reinventing wheel where else generator pdf through itextsharp is very easy as creating normals html in javascript way

1581647
implements	extends
sudo noob was wrong with the statement extends should be implements

1581648
subclassing	base-class
if you want to avoid checked all possible subclassinging the only way i can think of would be to store the classname associated with the subclassing in a field defined on the base-class

1581663
salt	md5
the benefit of having a salt is that it makes it harder for an attacker to pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary words

1581663
salt	md5
but if an attacker learns that you have a fixed salt they could then pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary words prefixed by your fixed salt

1581663
salt	md5
it makes it a bit more expensive to checked the passwd since you need to lookup the salt before you can generator the md5 signature but it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to pre-generator md5 s

1581668
firefox	safari
moreover the sun test your jvm page crash every browser firefox 3.0 safari i tried under osx 10.6

1581687
animation	rotation
that should present the landscape view after the rotation animation is complete and then dismiss it after the device is rotated back to portrait

1581702
attributes	properties
the nodeport class is an attributes that may be set on properties to provide details such as the human-readable named and data-flow directions for the properties

1581706
buffering	streaming
that is the offset in the buffering not the streaming

1581711
solaris	linux
gnu make for c or c++ on linux windows and solaris and iirc java early on

1581722
click	mouse
i looked at the implementation of the image-zoom plugins you linked and it uses the click event technically the onclientclick event which shouldn t be triggers until the mouse is pressed and release within the bounds of the same elements

1581722
click	mouse
sure enough if you click the mouse and release without dragging you get a click event

1581754
subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
however i d conjecture that every solution that uses addition subtraction multiplication or division which cannot be done by shifting would also have that problem

1581772
grouping	sorting
in this approach you are using the db for sorting and a simple comparison for grouping

1581798
javascript	dom
as you move your cursor using some clever javascript and dom handling the image is simply move relatively accordingly creating the effect you are actually zooming in the picture

1581802
base-class	inherited
for instances for a parameter that tells where to read data from have the flatfilereader xmlfilereader and databasereader all inherited the same base-class or implements the same interface

1581805
alpha	rgba
loops at the beginning swizzles the rgb data to rgba with an alpha value of zero at the end

1581820
ienumerator	ienumerable
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1581826
constructor	object
a.new is a static function of a while allocates memory and call the object s constructor afterwards

1581830
constructor	object
unless having been overloaded the use of new-operator first allocates raw memory then call the object constructor that building it up within the memory allocated

1581851
dlopen	dlsym
on pthreads it works pretty much the same but the functions are slightly different use dlopen to load the dynamic libs and dlsym to retrieve the symbols

1581851
dlopen	dlsym
the programming libs howto describe this in more detail or see the manpage for dlopen and dlsym

1581856
svnadmin	dump
a concurrently running svnadmin dump will not interfere with new commit

1581856
revision	svnadmin	svnadmin	dump
the resulting dump file however will only contains the revision that were present in the repository .when you started svnadmin dump

1581864
copy-constructor	mutators
for simplicity s sake i m assuming these are plaintext files with no field or anything and won t go deeper into that but if you have multiple field to store i suggest you make your web-crawler to produce 1..n of specialized beans with accessor and mutators bonus points make the bean immutable don t allow accessor to mutate the internal state of the bean create a copy-constructor for the bean to be used in the other component

1581882
thickbox	jquery
i have used both prototype windowss and jquery thickbox windowss for creating modal windows effects and these are not working only in ie 6

1581882
lightbox	jquery
the sample code for jquery lightbox is like this

1581892
network-interface	packets
you don t say which platform you are working on but if you are working on linux i d open a tun tap interface and get the ip packets back into the kernel as a real network-interface .so the kernel can do all that tricky tcp stuff

1581892
udp	tcp
this is how for example openvpn works - it receives the raw ip packets over udp or tcp and tunnel them back into the kernel over a tun tap interface

1581895
put	get
i m using an arrays for the pages i ve already visited to filtering the links i add to the queue but if there are more than one threads and they get the same links on different pages they put duplicates links to the queue

1581897
perl	awk
is there an efficient way to do it in unix via awk sed perl

1581905
callback	methods
i agree with your reading of the specifications that in such cases lifecycle callback methods will not be invoked by the containers and hence your concern that any re.source-tidy up that would normally happen in the ejbremove callback will not happen and .so there s a danger of re.source leakage

1581905
instances	destroy
you may then choose to rethrow ejbexception-handling or a systemd exception-handling .so that the instances is destroy but at least you ve tried to do the housekeeping

1581917
rollback	commit
in basic scenarios say i dump the above into a console .app then trans1 is independent commit fflush and won t rollback

1581920
dictionary	arrays
why only use the arrays ideally a dictionary would be even better to filtering things you ve already visited

1581920
dictionary	arrays
add things to your arrays dictionaryionary as soon as you queue them up and only add them to the queue if they re not already in the arrays dictionary

1581920
dictionary	arrays
links not yet seen neither in queue nor arrays dictionary

1581920
dictionary	arrays
links scheduling to be visited in both queue and arrays dictionary

1581920
dictionary	arrays
links already visited in arrays dictionary not in queue

1581941
any	set
unfortunately what you can do using jaas is kind of constrained to a small set of operations that any login-system can support

1581953
value	field
and i need this to happen on a keyup action for any of the value field

1581957
internet-explorer	firefox
with recent events with vulnerability found in wpf browser-plugin and firefox forcing a block on it i can t seem to find a setting in visual c# 2008 express edition that would allow me to run debugging my xbap project in internet-explorer without having to switching my default browser to ie

1581969
implements	abstract
learn about oop as an abstract concept and compare to c++ how it implements that

1581981
switching	screens
but .when i switching the canvas to full screens mode the custom cur.sor only appears only for a moment or .so

1581990
any	set
try to set .cookiecontainer before writing any data to .getrequeststream

1582000
binaries	install
the end-user does need to have the sdl libs binaries install on their machine however they don t need to manually install sdl themselves

1582000
binaries	install
you can distribute the sdl binaries yourself as part of your own games install

1582005
selected	textbox
i m trying to dinamicaly modify the users selectedion in wpf s textbox for the purpose of the discussion lets say i want to selected the characters in pairs eg

1582007
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
file upload using the xmlhttprequest object is not possible in all browsers only firefox and safari google-chrome support it .so for a cross-browser implementation use the trick

1582011
callback	methods
you cannot communication with an swf at least an avm2 as3 based swf unless it has registered callback methods in it

1582016
unicode	ucs
package ucs error unknown unicode character 79297 u+135c1

1582018
contains	any
also make sure that dbc.mapping.databasename doesn t contains any of these characters

1582022
unicode	ucs
the ucs package provides facilities for efficient use of large sets of unicode characters

1582035
telnet	ftp	telnet	ssh	ftp	ssh
pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh ftp passwd telnet etc

1582044
contains	any
i realized that the example above was wrong its a specifications .so should not contains any actual contents of the document

1582057
lgpl	gpl
regarding why the viewmodel is not gpl lgpl

1582063
portrait	screens
i can get the demo code to run in landscape mode but the contents always rendering as if they were in portrait mode .so while the simulator display he device in landscape mode the pagecontrol is always on the side of the screens

1582094
python	tcl
if python seems too heavyweiaght to include just for this small amount of flexibilty then have a look at tcl which was specifically designed for this types of job

1582101
credentials	security
if you re storing usernames passwd that the user is providing to you such that your application can then use these credentials to automatically log into authentication with another application or service on the user s behalf well i would suggest that you don t do this if security of that data is paramount

1582105
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
i know a bunch of scripting languages python ruby lua php but i don t know any compiled languages like c++ i wanted to try and speed up some python code using cython which is essentially a python - c compiler aimed at creating c extensions for python

1582113
jtextpane	jtable
i created jtable with jtextpane as cell editor.i want to stop cell editing and want to do some process if i pressed enter key in jtextpane .and i also want to use single line in jtextpane

1582113
selected	cell
but it does not work focus is in jtextpane and if i click other cell the selected row and the selected column is not changed.so please help me to use single line in jtextpane and to stop cell editing if i pressed enter like the default cell editor.thanks a lot

1582122
response	timeout
if the connection timeout it could be caught and a response still served

1582143
instances	destroy
of course depending on the plugins the unbind might look different i belive jqueryui uses .myfav draggable destroy for instances

1582145
python	php
phpdocumentor goes to php as x goes to python django

1582147
32-bit	64bit
we are having an issue with remote dedubbing using microsoft visual-studio 2008 on a 32-bit xp client machine and a 64bit windows-server 2008 virtual-machine on hyper-v

1582147
32-bit	64bit
can anyone confirm whether this kind of remote-debugging is possible at all or does everything need to be either 32-bit or 64bit

1582151
contains	elements
but if they contains other elements your regex process might change attributes value by mistake

1582151
value	field
also by writing to the innerhtml html you would lose any non-serialisable data in any child elements such as form field value event handler and other javascript references

1582176
constructor	object
or you can read the rows and value with a sqldatareader and then take those and turn each row into an object of types whatever-it-is and call a constructor on that object types with those five column value and stick your resulting five object into a and you ve basically created your own little orm object-relational mapper

1582182
expandablelistview	textview
the reason for that is because in another activity i have an expandablelistview with a custom-adapter and custom views and android changes the textcolor s of the textview s from lighting to dark inside my custom views .when items are focused

1582198
put	get
.so in my methods i go off and get these value from the database and put them into my application

1582219
google-chrome	firefox
with the following code my site only works in google-chrome on ie7 8 and firefox show me only the background

1582219
google-chrome	firefox
and with this code works in google-chrome ie7 8 and firefox

1582250
postdata	request
you ll need to supply these as get or postdata with the asynchronous request

1582258
any	set
similarly i d like ffmpeg to intelligently set the output bitrate based on the input video obviously it shouldn t be any bigger than the input

1582293
rollback	commit
what this means is that the commit you have inside your handler won t actually happen and the whole thing will either commit or rollback together - unless you specifically tell your transactionalal not to enlist in the ambient transactional

1582297
put	get
i want to use the methoddispatcher .so that each of the above can have get .post put delete functions

1582299
updatepanel	gridview
an easy solution would be to wrap your gridview in an updatepanel and just code everything as you would with normals postback

1582320
contains	any
this regex matches all non-digitss at the end of the string starting from the last digits or the start of the string if it doesn t contains any digitss at all and removes whatever is matched

1582323
python	ruby
the current standards ruby doesn t even compile to bytecode like python does for example but interpreter the ast instead which probably puts the slowdown in the ballpark of 20-100

1582350
cos	sin
i am trying to for example locate sin cos and tan in a string like 1+sin 28 +cos 72

1582352
any	set
i know nslocale can provide this information but from what i can gather this can be set to any country and not necessarily the app-store that the user is connect to

1582361
selected	listbox
i have 2 listbox selected in html in a asp.net page

1582386
.when	ready
.when ready blit it to the actual screens

1582387
contains	elements
this is usually a combinations of putting wmode transparency or opaque on the flash movie which itself is contains in a float ed elements

1582397
callgrind	vtune
how about making a standalone test harness for the c++ code and profiling it alone with any numbers of tools like vtune callgrind quantify oprofile..

1582417
credentials	account
if you control both the application using the credentials and the account whose credentials are being used there s no plainly obvious reason to use oauth

1582434
restart	reload
at the moment we have to stop and restart the whole application to get the new configuration items reload which given the traffic levels is a bit inconvenient even though there are four instances of the broker across two separate data centres .so we never actually lose the service

1582453
javascript	dom
i d like to store the xml dom in a javascript variables .so that i can access it without making a call to the server every time a user click to load a new piece

1582480
.when	ready
in abc.php you could call this function .when the dom is ready for normals request

1582497
perl	ruby
i m coming from a good ruby foundation and want a quick introduction or mapping between perl and ruby as i heard that perl and ruby are very close in syntax know nothing about features

1582512
getter	setter
and the references to object by getter and setter

1582513
controllers	routes
how do i have to configure the routes and the controllers to make this possible

1582515
stderr	stdout
yes your observation is confirmed - the order of the last three arguments is indeed stdin stdout stderr .so the outpipe in the docs is erroneously getting passed as the input instead

1582529
decimal-point	digits
how can it be considering that double also needs to store data on digits after decimal-point

1582531
dependency-injection	inject
consider refactoring via using dependency-injection to inject the resource-tracker into the classes where you use the static at the moment

1582537
account	userid
17 oct 2009 17 51 11 +0200 bind res conn 91 op 0 msgid 1 result 49 authfailureid 197126 authfailurereason rejecting a bind request for user userid xxxxxxxx ou users dc xxxxxxx dc hr because the account has been locked due to too many failed authentication attempts etime 1

1582537
contains	any
ldapexception-handling in jldap and exception-handling in jndi don t seem to contains any more useful information to show to the user on the presentation layer besides the 49 and the aforementioned invalid credentials messages

1582546
packaging	building
just add it to the rest of your libs for compilation and you need to package it with the rest of jars .when building packaging

1582549
perl	ruby
you might also checkout this to ruby from perl from ruby s website

1582549
perl	ruby
since i m somewhat going in the opposite directions i know perl reasonably well and i m using ruby more and more often i can mention things that stick out to me

1582549
perl	ruby
similarly parentheses are optional less often in perl than they are in ruby

1582549
conditional	parentheses
this gets complex quickly but for example you must have parentheses for the test in a conditional or a while block.

1582549
boolean	int
0 string int and float undef and the empty string evaluate as false in boolean tests

1582552
digits	short
short answer double only stores the most significant figure and not all the digits that could be in the numbers

1582581
implements	super
suppose i have a mysuperclass with a category contains all its private methods and i want to implements a mysubclass overrides or calling super to one of the mysuperclass private methods

1582586
value	field
i have an nsarraycontroller plucking items from a managed object context called field value

1582586
selected	cell	value	field
i can bind this by selected the cell in ib and binding its content object value to field value .arrangedobject and field value .arrangedobject.name as appropriate to get the represented object and the visible title

1582586
contains	set
.so far i ve managed to set it up .so that every pop-up menu contains the list of available field and that the default-value is selected in each of them

1582590
restart	reload
for example the apache documentation indicates that three signals have special meaning to the server term tells the server to shut down hup forces an immediate restart and usr1 request a graceful reload of the configuration file

1582593
mac-address	packets
came to know that single udp packets has source ports destination ports and some mac-address representing router..etc

1582602
json	xml
is there a way that i can see while debugging the result html xml json of a controllers s action

1582610
udp	tcp
one is that the web relies on tcp not udp

1582620
shell	bash
start a bash shell prompt types a tab

1582645
configuration	logging
you can enable messages logging usin the wcf configuration file tool and inspect the large messagess

1582654
any	set
you can do it for any set of classes you want to keep both in their own grouping and in their own folder

1582666
contains	any
in any case this dll definitely seems to still contains the hard and automatic dependency on the castle proxyfactory which explains why you don t need the proxyfactory.factory_class configuration entry

1582668
scala	java
java doesn t allow overloading of return types and since scala is built on the java jvm it s probably just a java limitation

1582683
value	field
i want to set up a triggers .so that if on an updates the prediction field is 3 then the triggers changes the value to 4 and saves it in the database

1582689
expression	evaluation
generally expression oriented languages prefer to have the semantics of expression to be dependent only on the scoping evaluation occurs in not what happens to the result .so for the expression foo in i_take_an_int foo and i_take_any_type foo and foo as a statement all call the same versioning of foo

1582715
fadeout	fadein
have the change and the fadein occur in the callback for fadeout

1582720
background-color	transparency
not 100 sure what you are trying to do but if you d like to have a containers view with a transparency background you can do .so by setting the background-color properties to uicolor clearcolor

1582727
value	field
domdocument is al.so domnodes has a field called attributess which is a map of attributes named and the nodes of value .so you can get the attributes named and value from it #6-9

1582737
linux	osx
answers for linux windows and osx are welcome

1582743
double-quotes	single-quotes
by enclosing the sed scripting in double-quotes instead of single-quotes you can include shell variables such as positional parameters

1582745
put	get
you would have to put some work in to get a unit test application based on an xunit.net framework to target multiple cores ie uses multiple threads or write your own framework that does it

1582761
authentication	login
for the recording i managed to .solve this situation by developing a small backend that required the client to login to facebook once and give offline_access extended permission to the facebook .app .so i can save his session key and use it to authentication the facebook api client every time i need to use fql to get non-public content

1582763
linux	osx
linux osx actually pthreads programming any language that have pthreads call general scheme

1582779
constructor	object
then we use that new object internally this sometimes required having a specialized constructor to make some copies or adjustments

1582780
any	set
is there any way to set horizontalalign from action scripting not from mxml

1582791
stdin	pipe
there are several ways to do it you can use pipe and have the pipe go to a .socket or file for example .so stdin out would be redirected to a pipe

1582794
fpdf	fpdi
checkout fpdf with fpdi

1582809
contains	elements
this works great but if i load a document that contains some iframe elements those will be opened in the systemd browser as well mostly embedded stuff like google-maps digg icons etc..

1582846
checkbox	button
one approach here is to associate a labels control with the checkbox and then using a combinations of css and jquery to make the actual checkbox itself invisible rendering the labels as a button and modify the labels s border properties as the checkbox is checked or unchecked

1582846
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this code works in google-chrome safari opera firefox and ie thanks to a conditional-comment hack since ie treats hidden form elements differently to other browsers

1582852
binaries	install
you install pycurl on windows via the provided win32-specific binaries

1582856
rollback	commit
if you don t commit and disconnect if your php scripting dies for instances nothing will be commited and what you did during the un-commited transactional will automatically be rollback

1582856
rollback	commit
start transactional commit and rollback syntax for mysql

1582856
innodb	myisam
innodb does it also supports foreign key for instances -- it s far more advanced that myisam

1582864
python	c++
an alternative approach to this if you know that you will need to use some c or c++ modules is to start from scratch writing the application in c but embedding python to do most of the work

1582866
children	nodes	children	tree
building a tree where each nodes has three children and each nodes contains the total numbers of 1 s at its leaves

1582866
digits	base
near n 0.63 which you can achieve by setting all bits at positioning with no 2 digits in base 3 i don t know if it will work

1582869
any	set
in any case i ve got a stackpanel which is set to horizontal orientation

1582872
solaris	osx	solaris	linux	linux	osx
it bundles a pache m ysql p hp and p erl and can work on windows solaris mac osx or linux

1582889
contains	any
for example one textbox allows the user to types in any part of a list item s description and the dialog will only present items whose description contains the text entered

1582889
silverlight	wpf
does wpf silverlight have any native support for doing something like this

1582909
zend-debugger	xdebug
i ve also heard that eclipse-pdt can use the zend-debugger extension instead of xdebug

1582917
default-value	arguments
there s also the hack of using a list as a default-value for an arguments and then never providing a value for the arguments .when you call the function

binaries	install
in practise iirc it means that binaries built on machines which has kb971090 install can only run on machines which have the corresponding updates vc runtime you need to ship and install the new vcredist_x86.exe on client machines

1582952
silverlight	wpf
if i was to replace silverlight with wpf in this question what effect would it have on your answers

1582966
value	field
the sequences field value in this temp table reflect the order of the items in the csv string

1582966
value	field
i then updates the data table with the new sequences field value matching with the ids

1582973
teamcity	gallio
it seems like teamcity is simply leveraging gallio to run vs tests

1582975
put	get
in the constructor and add a static variables initializer for numbertomonthmap but that doesn t work - you d get a nullreferenceexception immediately because you d be trying to put the value into a map which didn t exist yet

1582986
http	ssl
using http with ssl will make your life much easier and you can rest at ease very smart people smarter than me at least

1582990
hashmap	arrays
i would do it like jon skeet suggests he wrote it while i was writing this but for cases where the internal numbers representation is in a well defined range of say 0 to 20 or something i would probably not use a hashmap and introduce autoboxing of the int but rather use an ordinary arrays like month 12 but both are fine jon later changed his .post to include this suggestion

1583029
subtraction	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
basically it boils down to long-addition multiplication division subtraction

1583030
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
if you are using windows-vista or windows 7 or windows-xp for that matter you can downloading virtual-machine images from microsoft that contains a fully licensed windows operating systemd with internet-explorer

1583030
google-chrome	safari
safari is similar to google-chrome in that there isn t an easy way to run multiple versioning on the same machine

1583031
python	ruby	python	lua
why not use a scripting-language intended to be used this way such as python ruby lua .

1583032
data-access	ado.net
about difference for wpf the only i can think of is that for data-access whenever possible i would use direct ado.net data connections properly embedded in a data-access-layer linq-to-sql or the like instead of ado.net data service since it is way more flexible

1583034
attributes	properties
along the same line and closer to what you were thinking you could right click tests in the test view windows choose properties and populate the description properties or as you suggested by decorating tests with the description attributes

1583049
contains	elements
note .when the extra elements is contains in every feeditem then the code runs perfect

1583049
contains	elements
it s just .when one of the feed items doesn t contains an extra elements i get the error

1583063
database-table	mysql
i want all the above to happen over a ivr systemd and then store the selection in a mysql database-table called tickets

1583065
firefox	opera
it works fine in firefox ie and opera basically it expands a content block originally filling half of the page to the full page

1583081
deployment	install
.when i created my deployment project though the resulting cab file install on my phone fine but wouldn t run because it couldn t find the sql-server-ce libs

1583082
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
second you must have as many call to free as you do to malloc and calloc but realloc can mess with the count

1583082
getline	strtok
note that the pointers returned by strtok are all pointers into the single chunks of spaces allocated by getline

1583082
malloc	free
all the subsequent frees on the parts of dest are trying to free an address not returned by malloc and valgrind is trying to tell you that

1583082
strdup	free
note that you will need to free each of the separately allocated strdup d strings as well as the arrays of character pointers that are accessed via dest

1583085
mkv	avi
in some cases it would only need to convert the containers format ie mkv to wmv or avi and in some cases it might need to convert the actual movie

1583088
websphere	ibm
as for ivr s you could have a look at ibm s websphere voice response or genesys voice portal

1583093
python	lua
also for both python and lua there s a pretty simple way to write a scripting and then ship an .exe

1583098
deployment	install
i don t want to install duplicates for every one of my applications .so i removed the dlls from my deployment project and created a new deployment just for those files

1583098
deployment	install
i found the answer in multicab a sample deployment project that can chaining cab files and install only those that are necessary

1583108
flv	mp3
i need to extraction the audio data from a flv and inject it into a mp3 with c#

1583121
selected	button
in this example i assumed that all the save button would have the css class .savebutton but you can find your own way to selected the button

1583126
implements	extends
i think you have to implements applicationlistener or extends applicationadapter and implements the handleopenfile methods

1583146
scheme	lisp
for something truly different try lisp or scheme

1583152
delphi	c++	pascal	delphi	pascal	scheme	scheme	lisp
i ve programmed in pascal delphi assembly c++ scheme lisp java c# and cuda

1583172
attributes	properties
internally wcf only specifies what gets exposed in terms of operation and datacontract all defined by class methods and properties attributes

1583172
.net	wcf
the .net frameowrk has the tools to building the proxy in your silverlight project but you must be prepare to handle all wcf response asynchronously and the proxy cannot catch exception-handling throw by the service

1583172
sql-server	oracle
the big issues for me will be implements a very large collections of functionality in the service-layer and not being able to code directly to the data-access-layer we have to be able to run on either sql-server or oracle

1583172
silverlight	wpf
using wpf instead of silverlight changes everything depending on where your data resides

1583174
haskell	scheme	haskell	lisp	scheme	lisp
i ll second lisp scheme and also suggest haskell as a language that will challenge the way you think about programming

1583179
dependency-injection	inject
how two object interact after one is inject into another doesn t really have anything to do with dependency-injection

1583188
scheme	lisp	scheme	tcl	lisp	tcl
in my case this came through my studies in tcl tk which is multi-paradigm but i imagine you can get the same effect from any of the strongly functional languages such as lisp or scheme

1583199
qplaintextedit	qmenu
i would like to execute a qmenu object at the positioning of text cursor in a qplaintextedit

1583199
qtextcursor	qmenu
should i use an other object than qtextcursor inorder to find the positioning of the text cursor where i want to open my qmenu

1583216
haskell	lisp
i m not personally very experienced in these but i understand that lisp and haskell have their admirers

1583218
superscript	subscript
is it possible to display subscript or superscript text in a uitableviewcell without making custom cell

1583222
constructor	object
call constructor on c++ object

1583226
entity-framework	ado.net
it s a technology built on top of wcf with all the goodness of wcf that allows you to fairly easily but selectively and securely expose a datamodel typically an ado.net entity-framework model but linq-to-sql or other technologies work too as a restful service to the internet

1583237
button	popup
i want to move this button into right corner of popup dialog

1583243
defined	declare
systemd is declare and defined in libc

1583258
scheme	lisp
i would try both scheme or lisp and python in that order

1583258
python	c++
scheme will warp your mind in a positive way it did for me and then move on to python where you ll be quasi- able to put together your c++ and new functional knowledge

1583272
any	set
my guess is that you set up your .app not as a ruby-on-rails .app but as a usual like php site .so index.html and the directory listing show up but the .application does not receive any request - basically the server knows nothing about it

1583289
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
the xmlhttprequest object was implements as an activex object in internet-explorer and has later become a native javascript object in most modern browsers firefox safari

1583344
contains	elements
the problem with this approach is that will return all elements that contains the string including html body etc.

1583345
uitableview	uiview
if you don t want to use uitableview use custom uiview for each grouping of data you may need collecting naming and organizing them appropriately eg

1583350
tuples	set
.when using the sqlite3 module in python all elements of cur.sor.description except the column named are set to none .so this tuples cannot be used to find the column types for a query result unlike other db-api compliant modules

1583352
hash	md5
use a cookies and store a unique value maybe a guid md5 hash or something

1583359
average	minimum
you just find the average of the previous minimum and maximum at each step of the binary-search

1583370
udp	tcp
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course

1583379
value	field
unless the value is none in which case the sql field is null this should give you a fairly precise indication what the database column types was

1583395
web-applications	security
web-applications cannot modify the registry and or filesystems on a user s machine because of the security implications

1583396
contains	elements
it s very tempting .when you start out with css to wrap everything in a and be done with it .when really the points is to use the correct html elements to represent the data it contains and use css to styles it

1583405
couchdb	hbase
- couchdb and hbase as other player in the bigtable spaces

1583406
version-control	git
is git version-control or syntax checker

1583410
antivirus	security
checked with the teacher whether he saw the bar not seeing it would imply javascript is disabled somehow either in the browser or through some sort of security antivirus on his local machine

1583425
factors	primes
a composite numbers one that is not primes or 1 has at least 1 pair of factors and it is guaranteed that one of the numberss from each pair is less than or equals to the square root of the numbers which is what you are asking about

1583425
factors	primes
if you then only checked the numberss 2 through sqrt n you will have checkeded all of the possible factors since each of those factors will be paired with a numbers that is greater than sqrt n except of course if the numbers is in fact a square of some other numbers like 4 9 16 etc...but that doesn t matter since you know they aren t primes

1583427
32-bit	64bit
i can reproduce most poster s behavior on my 32-bit systemd here and i can reproduce the op s behavior on my 64bit vista sp2 3.5sp1 framework work pc

1583430
progress-bar	progress
is it right to multithreading via a backgroundworker component to do the downloading on that thread .so that the ui-thread is free to updates a progress-bar showing progress

1583434
textures	fbo
i m using an fbo textures format gl_rgba32f_arb nvidia card on a macbook pro with 10.5 if it matters

1583435
binaries	install
i have install svn console client from these binaries - - 1.5.6 1.6.4 1.6.5

1583448
google-chrome	firefox	margins	padding
if you swap the padding for margins it works the same in both firefox and google-chrome on my pc anyway

1583479
protected	public
you can expose the base protected methods with a public methods on the derived-class for example

1583489
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
then there are some common members that are implements by every types like equals tostring gethashcode

1583492
contains	elements	contains	set
to clarify getting a wrapped set of text nodes is not a problem but chaining cmd onto a wrapped set of text nodes has unpredictable results or does not work with many of the cmd since they expect the wrapped set to contains elements nodes

1583492
children	nodes
you can do it by filtering the children of a parent to return only text nodes but if your question is about performing some manipulation on the text then get the parent elements and manipulate the text contents

1583499
python	ruby
i second python and ruby too

1583499
python	c++
then learn python and realize quite a lot of design-patterns are actually stopgaps trying to patch a defective language like c++

1583503
gethashcode	equals
to provide common members such as equals finalize gethashcode tostring..

1583507
sftp	scp	sftp	ftp	ftp	scp
piping it through gnupg -e key can be used to encrypt the dump but the ftp passwd stays unencrypted sftp scp are better alternatives

1583521
scheme	lisp	scheme	forth	forth	lisp
i can incrementally building and run my programs later i saw this in lisp scheme and forth

1583521
pascal	basic
pascal - it s just like basic but with more functionality and no line numbers

1583521
object-pascal	pascal
object-pascal - cool pascal can have object too

1583521
scheme	lisp
c++ templates - writing code at compile-time is extremely powerful see scheme and lisp

1583521
delphi	c++
c# - this is like delphi mixed with c++ and scala

1583521
haskell	scheme	haskell	lisp	haskell	erlang	erlang	scheme	erlang	lisp	scheme	lisp
for maximum effect my short list would be scheme or lisp joy or postscript erlang eiffel aspectj erlang ml and haskell

1583563
ubuntu	linux
i learning objective-c in linux ubuntu but .when i tryed to compile my application that needs the foundation headers i got an error saying that the file cannot be found but i have install the gnustep development package gnustep-devel

1583570
expression	evaluation
sql is a typesd language and the types of an expression such as scope_identity here depends on the expression not on what happens to the expression s value after evaluation

1583582
contains	elements
big warning if the arrays contains user-defined content you have to sanitize it before injiecting it to the elements html

1583597
ruby-on-rails	django
the only reason i m not checked out ruby-on-rails is because of how similar the orm and other parts are to django

1583611
frame-rate	fps
with double-buffering the frame-rate i get is only up to 60 fps this laptop lcd works at 60hz

1583616
ruby	php	base-class	inherited
.some companies design their .net or java or ruby or php applications to inherited from a common base-class .so that they can all be treated the same way in their systemd

1583635
countif	sumifs
i was doing sumifs but you just want countif

1583637
stripes	wicket
struts2 spring-mvc stripes or wicket which is event based are all good candidates i personally like stripes

1583648
contains	elements	contains	set
get a set of elements contains the unique next siblings of each of the given set of elements

1583648
contains	elements	contains	set
get a set of elements contains all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements

1583662
base-class	inherited
single inherited means that a common base-class isn t always feasible suppose my form has both a fstream and a button -- what common base-class could they have that the cleanup routine would access them through

1583663
order	add	comma	words
in other words i need to grouping the output together by the field surnamebeingsearched i need to list the named of the people doing the searching in an x y and z output format where it knows where to add a comma if necessary depending on the numbers of results and i need to order the results by the surnamebeingsearched field

1583672
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
first of all managed is a bit of a misnomer languages like ocaml haskell and sml achieve such protections and safety while being fully compiled

1583672
haskell	erlang
anyway to answer your question if you look at languages like erlang and haskell state is isolated and immutable by default

1583672
unsafe	out
with kind of systemd threading and reentrancy is safe by default and because you have to go out of your way to break these rules it is obvious to see where unsafe code can arise

1583684
any	set
you can set a value in the table for the versioning of the program used to save it .so your newer versioning will know the older file won t have any value added in the newer versioning - and it can set them appropriately to updates the file versioning

1583701
any	set
it is actually rather safe to set any column to be not null

1583705
arguments	default
maybe you want to have a default empty string maybe not -- decent arguments both ways

1583715
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
-i starts case-sensitive matching - if you want the whole pattern to be case-insensitive then you don t need to end the

1583717
haskell	sml	haskell	scala	required	checked
languages such as scala sml and haskell are non-null by default null is called option or maybe and required special syntax and checked

1583723
put	get
.when possible i expect that malloc will try to put different request close to each other as it will have a block of code that is available for malloc until it has to get a new block

1583734
haskell	scheme	haskell	lisp	scheme	lisp
haskell is pretty popular these days as a mind-bender though it may not hurt as much for you if you already know lisp and scheme

1583745
filesystems	fat
the pre-commit hook should be disabled by default but older versioning pre 1.6.0 used to install them turned off by having executable permissions turned off which might not work on non-unix filesystems like fat

1583786
erlang	scala
i am open to linux or windows and for the languages most scripting languages f# scala erlang or most oop i can program in

1583786
haskell	scala
if .so would haskell f# or scala be good choices for this

1583786
erlang	lua
for example if erlang was used for the controlling of the car and lua for the car itself and also for the animated racetrack

1583797
boolean	int
in objective-c i need to associate a mutable collections int monotonic non-contiguous could get fairly large to boolean value

1583802
scripting	shebang
also checked that the first line of the scripting the shebang line has the correct path to perl

1583812
user-input	output
i know i can use the actionview helpers strip_tags methods in my views to sanitize output but what is the best way to sanitize user-input before i persistent it to my db

1583827
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
now multiplying that place value by the amount you want to add or subtract from the digits -1 or 1 and add the result to the original numbers

1583827
subtract	add
if you want to subtract 1 add -1 1000 -1000 to the numbers

1583845
constructor	object
the boost libs solves this with its classes such as lock_guard in which you initializer an object which acquires a lock in its constructor and whose destructor release the lock

1583862
low-level	hardware
us firmware guys do have object oriented training but the task of embedded systemd can be .so hardware oriented and low-level that it is not high level or abstractable by nature

1583873
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux 9.04

1583877
dictionary	arrays
since david s dictionary key is just an index we can use an arrays instead for the pairwise functionality

1583902
authentication	login
i am authentication a login via libcurl just fine

1583905
web-services	webserver
.so how would this methods call the real methods that is locating in webserver without using web-services

1583920
pdf-generation	printing
pdf-generation is one route and while its a valid solution for some folks i need to printing directly

1583965
boost	stl
the boost libs contains some of the highest quality c++ code available and relies heavily on the stl

1583977
constructor	private
what he call write-once immutability is the kind where initialization is done in the constructor of the class and all field are marked as private readonly field

1583982
firefox	opera
on windows s systemd the only other way was opening up ie firefox opera whatever to run your web-based task

1583991
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

1584020
scala	java	groovy	java	groovy	scala	python	java
for instances it has support for java and groovy but not python or scala

1584027
textbox	button
i need to write a delegation for a worker thread that will handle a wide variety of form controls button textbox list... enable methods

1584034
version-control	git
you can read more about the philosophy that guided bugtracker.net git integration in this stackoverflow question how does bug tracker version-control integration work with typical git workflows

1584059
value	field
the ellipsis ... will be replace by a code which handles the field access according to the value of your invariableassignment

1584061
height	frame
the only tricky part is that if they are of varying height make sure to implements heightforrowatindexpath .so that you can return the frame height for the static cell

1584078
nswindow	nspanel
in a controllers class from a nib i take an nspanel from that same nib and then show it .app modally on a nswindow that was created by hand in code

1584078
execution	exit
trying to move resize or do anything to the windows or otherwise switching away from the application suddenly causes the methods to exit and execution to continue

1584097
arguments	default
function has a default arguments of 1.0 and you write

1584105
repository	entity
can aggregate root entity have methods in which it will call a repository

1584120
internationalization	localization
that s actually called internationalization or localization

1584131
common-lisp	scheme
it s not exactly the same as scheme or common-lisp but learning it will help you if you ever want to work through the structure and interpretation of computer programs or grok what paul graham s talking about in his essays and you can relate to this comic from xkcd

1584134
runas	cmd
in-place of using notepad.exe you may use runas cmd

1584134
runas	cmd
refer this link for more details on runas cmd

1584161
scala	java
scala runs on the java virtual-machine .so it can be used in java shops

1584199
google-chrome	firefox
especially why would this work in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
you would pass a normals unencrypted networkstream which is the encapsulation of the tcp socket connection as the parameter to an sslstream object

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
once you ve finished with the initial ssl transmissions you can simply close the sslstream and use the underlying networkstream for subsequent plaintext transmissions

1584205
error-code	hresult
an hresult is an error-code consisting of a 32-bit int

1584207
google-chrome	opera
i believe ie google-chrome opera incorrectly interpreter id form1 as named form1 or vice versa

1584210
web-config	app-config
have you edited the url in web-config app-config

1584213
keyboard	mouse
basically i want my application to have complete control over the keyboard while it s being used if they want to navigate away they will still be able to do .so with the mouse

1584213
javascript	dom
my question is how can i disable this browser functionality w javascript jquery dom

1584220
instances	self
unfortunately this won t work because the unit test only passes 0 to the methods instead of a class instances for the self parameter and the 0

1584227
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
all these statements are valid javascript that run on ie firefox opera google-chrome etc

1584227
attributes	properties
ie tries to map unknown windows level properties like mycontactform to elements by matching to their named attributes

1584235
uitextview	nsstring
defined a nsstring in the header of your uiviewcontroller make your uiviewcontroller a uitextviewdelegation interface myviewcontroller uiviewcontroller and set your uitextview s delegation properties to self

1584235
uitextview	nsstring
then in your methods set the nsstring variables to your uitextview s text

1584235
uitextview	nsstring
.when the user removes the focus from your uitextview you clear its contents and the nsstring variables will have been left with the text that was typed in before clearing

1584266
fadein	show
obviously you could tweak this to fadein out etc - this is just to show the overall concept

1584276
constructor	object
becuase structuremap is using di via the most gready constructor i hope i got that concept named right i m under the impression that it creates an instances of an object for each arguments in the most gready constructor

1584276
constructor	object
.so is it possible to tell a di framework in this case it s structuremap but i m curious if it can do it for any other .net di framework to not create the instances .when the constructor is called but to delay that object s construction until required

1584278
grouping	sorting
in apex 3.2 and later you can put your pages into grouping which can be useful for sorting the pages out and make it easier to find the page you re interested in

1584280
constructor	object
note that because in both cases we re only using the parameterless constructor i ve removed the explicit from the object initializer

1584292
javascriptmvc	sproutcore
i started using javascriptmvc sproutcore framework sproutcore.com and i found it impressive

1584320
double	int
where user can only input numbers like int double not any letter

1584328
double	int
now the question is why the original value 8224055000.0000000000 which is an int - and exactly representable as a double - ends up with extra data in

1584331
interface-builder	iboutlet
in xcode you need to create a view controllers subclassing or a view subclassing and create iboutlet and wire them to interface-builder s views and set the types of the view or vc to the subclassing you created

1584348
buffering	streaming
streaming in c++ are buffering

1584351
display	width
it s possible to achieve uniform widths for the menus using the css width properties but items with longer display text are cut off .when the menu is collapse

1584364
xsd	xml
this code in c# should do just that - it will scan the entire xml and validation it against the xsd provided and it will spit out all validation errors or errors in the schema too

1584365
nsmanagedobject	nsobject
note that a properties named cannot be the same as any no-parameter methods named of nsobject or nsmanagedobject for example you cannot give a properties the named â œdescriptionâ see nspropertiesdescription

1584380
buffering	streaming
i know what a buffering streaming is used for but i also would like to know how to implements that

1584390
security	owasp
specifically the owasp application security verification and testing development guides

1584395
asp.net-mvc	wcf	asp.net-mvc	webforms
and since principles are supported in most environment winforms webforms asp.net-mvc wcf etc this can make for a very flexible way to double-check security at the business layer without having to reference the specific security model

1584402
realloc	free
the c standards says straightforwardly that behavior is undefined if the value of a pointers that refers to spaces deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function is used

1584434
credentials	account
the long answer is that we ve got xauth and unless you re running as the same user on the same machine that s probably not going to work unless you export the xauth credentials from the account running the x server to the account running the x client

1584437
scheme	lisp
i would have suggested mastering lisp in .some relevant dialect .so even if you have lisp and scheme on your resume it might be worthwhile to really learn deeply

1584449
ruby	php
unfortunately i don t know quite enough about ruby to accomplish this task yet â modules classes in ruby are still above my head coming from php

1584475
kernel	mmu
and without returning the spaces all the way to the kernel the mmu will never be involved and .so a fault is not possible

delphi	c++
note that you should also adjust calling conventions stdcall or cdecl for them to match in your c++ header and delphi code

1584486
delphi	c++
also make sure that same calling-convention is used in c++ and delphi

1584501
contains	elements
then you ll have an arrays in the splitted variables it s second elements at the id 1 contains the value

1584512
delphi	c++
i suggest that you specify in both delphi and c++ to use the stdcall calling convenstion

1584512
variables	boolean
function scrapergetwinlist variables winlist arrays of twin boolean

1584512
variables	boolean
function scrapergetwinlist variables winlist arrays of twin boolean

1584516
dictionary	arrays
the other best option is just to create a wrapper methods that call the original methods you want with appropriate arguments perhaps given as a dictionary or arrays which matches the signature needed to perform after a delay

1584535
access-control	authentication
authentication access-control

1584535
internationalization	localization
internationalization localization

1584598
hide	show
the appropriate messages is inject into the #screen div and show hide is then applied

1584604
gethashcode	equals
you could overload equals and gethashcode but that is not recommended for mutable types

1584620
signals	sigpipe
it s also useful to setup signals sigpipe ignoring in reading and writing and handle errors as show above

1584698
repository	entity
personally i think that userpreferenceinfo is entity types since it has identity - it can be changed saved and retrieved from repository and still be regarded as the same object has identity

1584706
associations	model
it has limitations - it doesn t do many-to-many associationss or rather it does but your associations table will end up as a rather odd but necessary part of your model and the visual designer isn t particularly friendly .when it comes to reflecting changes to the underlying database

1584738
contains	elements
none is a tuples that contains an elements it s not empty and therefore does not evaluate to false in that context

1584742
contains	elements
because is a tuples contains a single elements none

1584749
font-size	height
the only problem is that i have to specify a height of 87 of the contains #menu div which only works for my combinations of screens size windows size and font-size

1584763
credentials	account
but i don t like the idea to enter the credentials of the root account in my settings.xml

1584765
entity-framework	nhibernate

are you localizing to a right-to-left language like persian arabic or hebrew

1584828
static-classes	class-members
also i m really curious as to the advantages to using static-classes over class-members that can be used outside the class

1584835
constructor	object
.when i compile the following code with g++ the object of class a seems not to be destructed .when the object of class c is construct and the b.ref_a reference is not broken .when accessed by the constructor of object of class c

1584858
constructor	private
the key is to make the constructor private .so that the class can t be construct anywhere but in getinstance

1584861
rmdir	mkdir
do i need to set strobes or busy signals i could do that with say mkdir and rmdir

1584902
right-to-left	hebrew
but for all other cases hindu-arabic numerals are used 1 2 3 4... and are written left-to-right even while the rest of the hebrew text is written right-to-left nml kjihg 123 fedc ba

1584983
sigaction	signals
see the sigchld signals and the sigaction function to hook up a listener

1584986

1585074
contains	any
next i go into my folder contains digit.rb and digit_spec.rb and fire up autospec without any parameter

1585114
value	field
this required different handling from a binary format encode using asn.1 1 where field can have a types indicator value usually a byte and a length can be 1 2 or 4 bytes depending on types before the actual data for the field

1585115
getter	setter
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585128
python	c++
you can write c++ code for the olpc but python is the preferred language

1585128
environment	building
as for smalltalk the olpc project does provide a squeak environment but it s intended primarily for kids to play with smalltalk programming rather than as a tool for building activities intended to be distribute for use on the olpc

1585131
checkbox	listbox
and let your view handle the types of each item and alter the form controls display of each item accordingly ie a range with have a start and end value a boolean will have a checkbox material might be a listbox etc

1585154
required	checked
i m with a few of the answerers who are saying that the regular algorithm that checked all the pairs of bit positioning and looks for the 3rd bit even though it would required o k 2 in the worst case in reality because the worst-case needs sparse-matrix bitstrings is o n ln n

1585161
any	set
if you re creating a regular .app then the aforementioned solution will work but you re going to have to stop assuming that your working directory is set to anything even remotely meaningful at any points in time and use the .appropriate methods for finding resources stored within your bundle

1585177
xelatex	latex
an earlier question led me to xelatex it was about latex and unicode

1585181
tcl	lua
i know they did this because there is no interpreter object passed around like lua or tcl does it was just not designed well in the beginning

1585186
calloc	malloc

rollback	commit
methodss on the dao classes are then distinct database operations for each methods call while the service methodss can do a single commit rollback for a series of updates

1585238
enterprise	platform
in modern applications enterprise level architecture you deal with probably 4-5 different language different platform and different systemd too

1585241

another way to design would be to identify the different tasks that will need to be performed reading from a network drawing the user-interface to the screens and create a dedicated thread for these tasks

1585245
selected	button
selected the register button without supplying any account info show this

1585245
selected	button
selected the register button without supplying an account info show no errors

1585249
double	int
note each built-in value-type int double intptr has overrides equals which is why it behaves different for value-type compares content then with referenceequals compares addresses

1585260
interpreter	runtime
i believe it is true at least as of python 2.6 that each process may have at most one cython interpreter embedded other runtime may have different constraints

1585284
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
if i have two classes one which inherited from the other and i use the same methods properties named in both how can i make that methods call the subclassing regardless of whether the current object has been cast back to it s base-class

1585386
value	field
for example use last named as the main autocomplete and send any characters in the first named field as additional value for the query

1585399
order	add
if you need a key to points to multiple object then your key will need to points to an nsmutablearray or nsmutableset if you don t care about order and then you add and remove things from the nsmutablearray rather than from the dictionary

1585401
macros	let
i use a template-engine with macros that let me easily re-populate the form input and mark the failures

1585417
identity-column	sql-server
assume the id is just an identity-column that is of types int and gets its value automatically sql-server

1585444
union-all	union
i d use union-all over union because it is faster due to it not removing duplicates

1585471
exception-handling	try-catch
put the assignment of servername in the constructor of chatserver where you either try-catch the exception-handling yourself and do something appropriate or let the constructor throw an unknownhostexception-handling if possible

i had to revert back to mouseover mouseout like this

1585643
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout

1585643

ubuntu	linux
if 10.5 is not enough for you you may want to consider installing linux since the stuffit you mention is easy to install with ubuntu

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
the hover methods is a convenience methods that bind event handler to the mouseenter and mouseleave events

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover
edit the difference between mouseenter and mouseover is that mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

1585666
mouseenter	mouseover
this means that you ll get a mouseover event if the mouse move into any elements inside the one you bound to which is probably not what you want whereas you ll only get a mouseenter event if the mouse entered that elements itself

1585668
textarea	textbox
is it possible to dynamically control the font-size in a textarea textbox .so it decreases while the user types

1585669
protected	public
you could store them as protected variables in your asp.net page s code-behind and then use databinding expression to store them as public variables in your javascript .

1585684
libavcodec	ffmpeg
you can take a look at ffmpeg cmd and open-source project which uses libavcodec libs

1585692
margins	padding
set 20 padding to the containers and -20 margins to the side

1585703
pointers	stack
they also believed that an automatic arrays occupies only a tiny amount of stack-memory for the alleged pointers while the large elements block is allocated elsewhere not in stack

1585704
textarea	textbox
no it s not possible in a textarea or a textbox

1585708
copy-constructor	constructor
also if we defined any other parameterized constructor for a class other than the copy-constructor do we also have to defined the default-constructor

1585711
defined	declare
if you still need the default-constructor you have to explicit declare and defined it yourself

1585711
copy-constructor	constructor
it is possible to write a copy-constructor or conversion constructor or any other constructor that is also default-constructor

1585724
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i am going to describe it in asp.net-mvc but the same can be achieved if you either write an asp.net web service or just put a few pagemethods in your code-behind to do the same - you ll also need a json serialization either a 3rd party solution or the one in wcf

1585729
arguments	default
.when not given an explicit arguments in the production code the collaborator can be default

1585766
javascript	dom
i think you are confusing definitions as in javascript for example my closures may often have non-local side-effects as i am changing the dom

1585780
webforms	asp.net
in my webforms applications i had been wiring my asp.net membership register controls event oncreatinguser to do my checked for whether the user named or email exit or if the user named is appropriate

1585790
javacc	yacc
you need something like compiler compiler compiler generator like javacc or yacc to handle that

1585816
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i don t think you can use the asp.net 2.0 membership webserver controls with the asp.net-asp.net-mvc because they rely on the webforms postback model which isn t supported by asp.net-mvc

1585824
firebird	mysql
you ll need to create the schema separately in mysql but it s not difficult there are lots of tutorials and you can probably find a firebird tool to export the ddl into a scripting that will either just work or be easy to modify

1585831
any	set
is there any query parameter or any option that i can set

1585834
mstest	nunit

1585917
pixels	line
the amount by which each line of text is offset from the baseline in device independent pixels

1585921
hashmap	arrays
now the hashmap uses this hash value to place the value into an arrays

1585921
arrays	map
it is possible for two different key to hash to the same value or two different hash to map to the same arrays index

1585921
linked-list	arrays	binary-tree	linked-list
the simplest is to use a linked-list or binary-tree for each arrays index

1585925
versioning	upgrade
if you perform the uninstaller after the install which gives you the best upgrade performance you might see issues if file versioning change to lower versioning

1585932
rollback	commit
a separate service-layer whose methods correspond to use cases that know about units of work should be the one responsible for acquiring the connection setting the transactional and isolation marshalling daos and business entities to fulfill the use case commit or rollback the transactional and clean up the resources

1585956
arrays	map
you can also use map or arrays

1585978
revision	updates
in the save methods of the page class i added this code to save a revision before i updates the field with the new data

1585998
qdialog	qobject
my main application object is a qobject that juggles a qsystemtrayicon a qdialog a qwindow and a few other components

1585998
qwidget	qobject

1586008
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
.so getting back to the heart of the question how do you develop php python ruby etc

1586008
sql-server	oracle
say you ve got a statement that should run on 3 rdbms oracle db2 and sql-server and for each of these you write a separate sql statement inorder to make use of all features this rdbms has to offer

1586016
unsigned	zero	memset	calloc
from the pedantic points of view though calloc as well as memset ... 0 ... is only guaranteed to properly initializer with zero object of types unsigned char

1586016
memset	calloc
formally in the current c language you can initializer only int types with calloc and memset ... 0 ...

1586020
directory	folder
this is because of custom permissions in the application dynamic files directory and physical files and folder mixed with different permissions files that the user should have access to are mixed with ones they should not

this link doesn t support linq queries but i consider it related and relevant permutation combinations and variations using c# generics

1586055
unspecified-behavior	undefined-behavior
as a result the code is said to invoke undefined-behavior or unspecified-behavior

1586067
any	set	qwidget	qobject
i m afraid you can t use connectslotsbyname for the parent-child issues with qwidget but if you really want it you have all the metadata available in qmetaobject .so you can write a function that works like connectslotsbyname on any pair set of qobject s

1586069
constructor	object	getter	setter
following the suggestions from brian agnew and nicky de maeyer use both setter and getter and an arrays or an object in the constructor

1586069
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
if you were to use setter and getter solely then you would have to set each individual properties in your code after the object is initializer

1586069
getter	setter
using getter and setter you get encapsulation of the logic that will drive each properties that you need to manage within these object

1586069
constructor	object
but .when a configuration object is passed to a constructor then it is immediately converts to an arrays and is used as such

1586069
getter	setter
additionally zend-framework provides the getter and setter .so that you can freely modify the object in code at any time

1586090
stdin	pipe
open a pipe the child-process can send a messages down the pipe to tell the parent that it is about to read on stdin

1586109
subtract	time
actually i subtract 1 day and time should be preserve

1586111
atomicity	lockless
lockless data-structures will one way or another use atomicity semantics from your architecture to perform its core operations

1586123
margins	padding
try resetting the margins padding on your ul then giving it value

1586126
value	field
however you should not store multiple value in a single database field

1586127
value	field
if i understand your question correctly you want the contents of the varchar field to be treated as a comma-separated list and test whether this list does not contains a certain value

1586129
arrays	loops
my thinking is that if i can convert colorarrays to an arrays i can loops through its contents

1586130
archive	backup
a debian-based distibution named univention uses this to backup several files in an tar archive

1586149
perl	ruby	perl	awk	python	ruby	python	perl
shell scripting are basically just a bunch of cmd pipe together you can simply call any scripting-language such as python ruby perl as you would sed awk grep

1586169
vba	vb6
is there a way to watch a file in vba which is essentially vb6 .so that i know .when the file has been modified

1586172
keyboard	mouse
what ever you do it is important to use the os standards keyboard and mouse event binding and preferable look-and-feel too otherwise users get confused

1586187
execute	declare
note that in your example colorarray is declare locally inside the function that execute .when the ajax request has completed and therefore will not be available outside of that scoping

1586187
case-statement	declare
the variables qty can be used inside of the callback for the getjson cmd in each case-statement as it is declare outside of the scoping of the callback

1586200
javafx	swing
docx4all is a cross platform wysiwyg editor for docx files using swing and javafx scripting

1586201
linux	unix
.when you run the tnameserv you ll have to kill it via the kill cmd linux unix or ctrl+c windows

1586201
linux	unix
if on linux unix this should do the trick

1586207
revision	svn
you said copying and fork which leads me to think that perhaps you haven t considered managing this fork as a branch in a revision control systemd like svn

1586219
traversal	parent
if i deny all request in which the input string contains . or a byte outside the visible 7-bit ascii range is this sufficient to prevent parent directory traversal .when the path is passed to php s underlying c-based file functions

1586223
tostring	equals
how does the tostring methods operators and equals methods work differently or similarly on reference and primitive-types

1586224
value	field
the field used in creating the hashcode value must be the same or a subset of the field used in the equals methods

1586224
implements	extends
one simply has to extends the test case and implements two or three factory methods

1586234
protected	public
in oop everything is public or private or sometimes protected or internal etc.

i d use apache-poi or docx4j to create a docx file on the server and add the header footer as part of that process

1586275
directory	folder
it s one of two reliable ways to find out whether a certain filename is actually a virtual directory of the recycle bin the other way being delete a file through shfileoperation explained here and checked whether it appears in the folder you have

1586309
apache	squid
squid varnish haproxy are good reverse proxy and even apache could do this for you

1586311
getter	setter
this class should have attributes such as title and director with getter setter

1586316
python	ruby
hashtable are simpler and usually part of your language s standard-library if not directly part of the language itself ruby python etc

1586319
strtotime	mktime
don t use mktime in your example use strtotime

1586324
copy-constructor	constructor	defined	declare
as andreyt said if you explicit declare any constructor including a copy-constructor the compiler will not implicit declare or defined a default-constructor

1586324
defined	declare
line in your example then you must declare and defined a default-constructor

1586327
jlabel	jlist
it looks like you have a bunch of jlabel jbuttons jlist and jspinners with some contains in jpanel

1586332
configuration	environment	configuration	logging
also last part of my question i swear it seems that .when ruby-on-rails is in development mode it ignore my logging level i choose in configuration environment development.rb

1586334
any	set
able to get a specific set of source onto any machine

1586340
primitive-types	reference-type
that is will compare the value for primitive-types as int but will compare the reference not the value for reference-type

1586348
children	nodes
maybe find the parent and iterate through the children until you find the nodes count along the way

1586367
configuration	environment
the log level in configuration enfironment.rb will overrides all environment development production etc - this could explain why your development settings are getting ignore

1586377
keyboard	mouse	low-level	hardware
gtge libs provides a complete routines for making 2d game from low-level routines such as hardware accelerated 2d graphics mouse and keyboard input audio support game timing to game specific routines such as sprite background collision-detection

javascript	dom
also note that most javascript libs use special code which works around the onload problem and uses custom event for this which gets fired once dom has loaded and doesn t wait for binary-data

1586387
rhino-mocks	nunit
something i find very useful is that if a class cannot be tested very easily using nunit and rhino-mocks it s probably not very well-designed

1586390
tostring	equals
equals and tostring are not defined

1586393
python	ruby	python	c++
having seen the advantages of metaprogramming in ruby and python but being bound to low-level languages like c++ and c for actual work i m thinking of manners by which to combine the two

1586393
c-preprocessor	macros
if i had some sort of typesful macros that would reveal to me what the types of a vector s elements were then it would be trivial to write c-preprocessor macross to create the function required to do the sorting

1586401
selected	button
only the selected button will have it s value posted back to the server

1586420
selected	cell
i m trying to change the header title for a section in a uitableview .when a cell from that section is selected

1586424
variables	boolean
thanks for the replies after giving it some thought i m going to go with an approach similar to what techzen said and and just keep the timers running with a bool variables and using that variables for checked events like pause and such ie changing the boolean vs stopping and starting the timers

1586445
punctuation	words
since i m studying malloc in class i ve lowercased every words removed all the punctuation in the article and string copy-paste them into malloc

1586449
.net	wcf
assuming you can use .net wcf with a named-pipes binding would be very simple

1586455
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if you add file extensions for your favorite scriptinging-language perl python ruby etc. to your pathext environment variables and add the scripting to your path you can execute them directly without a batch-file scripting

1586462
python	ruby
even in languages like python and ruby with native support for closures complex closures become quite unreadable anyway

1586480
dictionary	arrays
i would instead recommend you to create another arrays of char pointsers and have them points to the beginning of each words and assign these as you read the wordss from the dictionary file

1586480
while-loop	for-loop
at the start of the for-loop to get it to points to the correct words instead of using a while-loop to find the start of the next words

1586488
access-vba	vba
i m assuming you re writing your sql to execute in access itself as trim and len are access-vba functions both are provided by the access expression service using vba .so this wouldn t work via odbc or oledb

1586488
value	field
i also hope that the namedd of your field are fake as both named and value are access reserved-words and should be avoided in object namedd at any level in access jet ace

1586505
filehandle	stdin
that s like saying how can i printing text to the console without using the stdin filehandle

1586529
dictionary	arrays
my plist is an arrays of dictionary object

1586550
controllers	routes
but it seems less clear with asp.net-mvc as far as helpers controllers routes etc

1586569
shell	bash
depending on your exact use case it might be better to set the dotglob shell option .so that bash include dotfiles in expansions of by default

1586594
revision	svn
how do i get my svn revision numbers to appear on my website each time i commit

1586612
dictionary	arrays	double-quotes	single-quotes
this approach has some shortcomings though if for instances the strings are enclosed in single-quotes instead of double-quotes not to mention that it only parsing json object arrays which only coincidentally happen to shared similar syntax with pythons dictionary arrays

1586618
show	next
.so .when i visit the webpage next time if an annotations exists for a webpage it show up a small anchor link next to the text which on clciking should display the annotations that i typed in earlier

1586620
revision	svn
you must have something like in the file whose revision you want to tracking say foo.html and tell svn to tracking and substitute that keyword in the file

1586620
revision	svn
svn will then .when the file s changed change that expression into or whatever the revision numbers may be

1586636
dependency-injection	inject
if you want more security you could just use a dependency-injection framework and inject the compiled class that has the username passwd and just use that connection-string

1586655
innodb	myisam
i just found this article which provides an example of a converting a large table from myisam to innodb while this isn t what you are doing he uses an intermediate memory table and describe going from memory to innodb in an efficient way - order the table in memory the way that innodb expects it to be order in the end

1586658
robot	nxt
i am building a balancing robot using the lego mindstorm s nxt systemd

1586658
accelerometer	gyroscope
i am using two sensors from hitechnic the first being an accelerometer and the second being a gyroscope

1586675
error-logging	logging
you can also derive from the handleerror attributes to add error-logging as well as create custom action result filtering to automate certain types of logging

1586697
version-control	cvs
however once changes to the database structure are managed by a copy-merge version-control systemd like cvs or svn propagation and merging will be mostly automatic bar conflicts and

1586698
powerpc	arm
is this true for all modern cpus arm x86 powerpc etc.

1586699
debian	linux	debian	rpm
in the linux world of .deb debian and .rpm package i can list the contents of any package install using a tool such as dpkg or rpm

1586703
directory	folder
i am contemplating writing a program that will move some newly created directory to another that puts them into date-stamped folder

1586703
directory	folder	folder	dir
this is important because new folder are being created every day and if i always copy them all from source dir to month stamped directory i will eventually copy last month s file to this months folder

1586708
account	api
i m using twitter s oauth api to updatess a user s twitter account twitter status updates provided they give permission authentication my site with their twitter account

1586709
stdin	pipe
but i found a few functions in glib g_on_error_stack_trace and stack_trace that looks very close to what i want to do it fork a gdb process with the arguments basename argv 0 and the process id then writes to its stdin which has been redirected to a pipe the cmd backtrace followed by a quit

1586715
punctuation	words
you could read one words at a time with fscanf then eliminate any punctuation .so t other appears as wordss t and other and doesn t appears as doesn and t - if you like

1586722
xcopy	cmd
after parsing the cmd md f which becomes make directory 10 and using the we add another cmd to be execute ie the xcopy to the new directory

1586795
stderr	stdout
i have a server application that writes to a popen mycmd w file-descriptor in a separate thread and if the cmd passed to popen results in any output to stdout or stderr the my application exit

1586795
stdin	pipe	file-descriptor	stdin	file-descriptor	pipe
similarly .when my server application reads from a popen mycmd2 r file-descriptor in a separate thread and if the cmd passed to popen results in any output to stderr stdin is going to my pipe the application exit

1586796
rabbitmq	activemq
rather than re-inventing the queuing wheel via sql you could use a messaging systemd like rabbitmq or activemq as the core of your systemd

1586796
rabbitmq	activemq
all the worker connect to rabbitmq or activemq

1586801
jquery	.post
the easiest way to do this is to use jquery to send an .ajax or .post or .get to each scripting retrieving the result from each of them and doing what you will with the results

1586801
checkbox	textarea	selected	checkbox
it basically just takes the various input selected textarea checkbox etc in your form and puts them into a string like this

1586804
jquery	dojo
is this possible with jquery ajax yui or dojo other

1586822
centering	fixed
you could probably figure out an algorithm that would find a centering points based on a fixed radius

1586842
scala	java
object in scala are not class-level entities like statics are in java

1586855
google-chrome	safari
reliable in ff3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome 2+

1586872
teamcity	nant	teamcity	msbuild	msbuild	nant
is there a way to configure teamcity to execute mspec tests without switching to a nant or msbuild runner

1586891
theorem	proof
although all this above has indeed provided a proof for the expected theorem but it seems very unintuitive

1586899
python	ruby
if you look at some of the scripting languages like python and ruby there are some pretty good tools for doing pipe-like things from within those scripting

1586910
internet-explorer	firefox
the libs tab contains ecmascript built-in libs web project support for jsdt ecma 3 firefox and internet-explorer browser support libs

1586910
internet-explorer	firefox
all javascript settings are default with the exception-handling of the excluded path and addition of the firefox and internet-explorer libs

1586922
utility	manual
see the manual pages for the utility here

1586922
triggers	insert
basically it dump the sql-scripts required to rebuild the contents of the database including creation of tables triggers and other object and insert of the data it s all configurable .so if you already have the schema set up .somewhere else you can just dump the data for example

1586923
checkbox	textbox
as we know viewstate is not responsible for storing and restoring textbox checkbox and such controls value

1586923
textbox	button	textchanged	textbox
and we also know after load stage raisepostbackevent stage occurs and raise corresponding events such button click or if text changed in a textbox its textchanged event will be fired

1586923
textchanged	textbox
.so how does systemd tracking the text changed if viewstate is not responsible for that and which mechanism actually fires textbox textchanged event

1586931
quirks-mode	firefox
works in ie6 ie7 ie8 on windows and firefox 3 and 3.5 on windows and os x .when the page is rendering in standards compliant mode not in quirks-mode

1586931
contains	elements
while this approach works for something like a facebook status updates how well would it work in a form contains hundreds of standards input elements

1586935
constructor	object
you do not defined anything with a class keyword but you make a function that s used as a constructor to building new object with the new keyword

1586935
constructor	object
all newly created object are construct based on the core constructor .sometimes called classes by people coming from classical inherited languages or the core object such as object .so every object in javascript has access to object.prototype

1586938
constructor	object
in the derived constructor you create a base object instances

1586940
boolean	int
in practice the arrays of n boolean would probably be encode as a bitmap or bitset represented as a byte or int arrays

1586953
project-management	scrum
agile is a general philosophy regarding software production scrum is an implementation of that philosophy pertaining specifically to project-management

1586991

this applies not just to onclientclick but also to ondblclick onmousedown onmousemove onmouseout onmouseover onmouseup onkeydown onkeypress and onkeyup

1587007
64bit	x86
proces.sor actually do access memory in quantities of 64bit x86 did since pentium or .so

1587045
unique	words
difference of keyword sets - you can prune the document of the most common words in the dictionary and then end up with a list of unique keyword per document

1587046
subclassing	inherited
the fact that subclassing inherited static-members really doesn t make any sense from an object-oriented points of view

1587051
latex	tex
if you want to produce very nice-looking document with tex latex but without learning much about either i suggest you look into lyx a nice graphical editor that allows you to create document more or less like you do in a words processor but with much nicer results and access to the full power of latex albeit sometimes by embedding latex cmd in your lyx document

1587063
python	ruby	python	c++
i m open to objective-c c++ ruby python etc..

1587125
loading	gif
ie 8 and 7 still persistent with the loading gif animation freezing

1587134
data-structures	linked-list
in an application i was working on there were several linked-list data-structures that were being used to hold various instances of foo

1587134
data-structures	linked-list
i switched most of the linked-list data-structures to hashset which can do a contains x call in o 1 - much better

1587137
windows-vista	windows
this noise appears only on certain wave files and on windows-vista and i think windows 7 too

1587143
increment	average
this also can be good as a suitable average increment can likely be found

1587146
memory-access	numa
between l1 and l2 caching misses tlb misses numa cross-node access and even gpf that must fetch the page from disk the memory-access pattern of a modern application is the single most important optimization one can make

1587186
contains	set
if the set of user variables already contains a path entry edit that

1587216
vba	vb6
okay i put together a solution that is able to detection filesystems changes in vba vb6

1587290
stop-words	term
tokenize texts remove stop-words and arrange in a term vector

1587320
versioning	upgrade
.so you need the changes done in the data-structure in versioning 5 to successfully upgrade to versioning 6

1587367
arrays	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	arrays	updating	updates
but you can do this two ways jacobi involves updating each elements with its neighbours without considering updatess you have already made until the while-loop cycles to do it in loops you would copy the arrays then updates one arrays from the copy-paste arrays

1587367
arrays	loops
however gauss-seidel uses information you have already updatess for each of the i-1 and j-1 entries thus no need for a copy loops should essentially know since the arrays has been re-evaluated after each single elements updates

1587378
compact-framework	.net
where can i find the .net compact-framework sdk for developing compact-framework applications in visual-studio

1587386
dictionary	arrays
it retains each url connection in an arrays and passes back the delegation call using a dictionary of connection delegation

1587386
dictionary	arrays
.when it receives the delegation call for the url it messages the real delegation of the connection and removes the connection from the arrays and dictionary

1587395
constructor	object
you could make an object out of it using a constructor

1587410

if-statement	loops
it would still involve a loops to find the right constructor but one loops with a simple if-statement to find the right one is far preferrable to looking at arguments and attempting to match this way

1588378
json	xml
are there any possibilities to extraction contact in some of the following formats vcard hcard or json xml using the standards android api

1588402
dump	temp
the fastest way -- in any language don t know how it s done in ruby-on-rails specifically -- will be to dump your in-memory hash into a temporary table in the database which only has columns for your hash s key and value then issue a single updates cmd with a join that links your table to be updatess with the new temp table

1588445
constructor	object	event-listener	listener
example in a constructor you create an event-listener inner class it has an implicit reference to the current object and register it to a list of listener

1588445
constructor	object
.so your object can be used by another thread even though it did not finish execution its constructor

1588463
ruby-on-rails	rspec
at this points is the ruby-on-rails community in favor of rspec or shoulda

1588472
google-chrome	safari
in addition to ie not supporting it it seems like the webkit based browsers safari google-chrome despite claiming to have javascript 1.7 support actually execution scripting tags declare as being in javascript 1.7 do not actually support any of these features which means that for nowjavascript 1.7 with its very nice features is limited to geko browsers alone

1588487
ruby-on-rails	rspec
the ruby-on-rails community is in favor of both rspec and shoulda

1588512
itemscontrol	grid
this is an itemscontrol populate using the enumvaluesconverter from the wpf properties grid libs

1588517
default-value	default
for each column that has no default-value or you want to insert the value other than default you will need to provide the explicit named and value

1588517
sequences	unique
note that the triggers cannot reference the table itself .so you will need to provide .some other way to get the unique numbers like a sequences

1588532
filtering	grouping
in this instances you are filtering on the grouping column which could just be filtering using a where-clause instead

1588555
subtract	time
if you want to know date and time on client machine you can approximate that by adding subtract clients timezone offset

1588564
constructor	object
jcombobox is a bit simpler as the defaultcomboboxmodel class has a constructor that takes an arrays of object as a parameter

1588588
duplicates	contains
if i take the obvious step and add a unique-index on the columns which goven whether or not a row is a duplicates sql-loader will start to fail the entire file which contains the duplicates row - whereas i only want to prevent the duplicates row itself being loaded

1588589
google-chrome	firefox
this bug only happens in firefox it works fine in google-chrome for example

1588618
quirks-mode	doctype

1588660
base-class	inherited
inherited gives you all the functionality of the base-class without the need to write pass-through functions

1588709
stubs	tdd
regarding mocks and stubss and fakes double and whatnot - .when you re testing at the unit level either with tdd or after the fact the whole points is telling it to think it has the data you need using a stubs

1588720
directory	folder
a scripting iterates through that folder structure creating index.txt files in every directory listing the sub-items

1588727
any	set
edit i suggest subclassing uicontrol in the example below but if you don t need any special behavior on your button apart from the non-rectangleness of it then just subclassing a borderless uibarbuttonitem set up with your png will do the job and required less work

1588767
constructor	object
say your constructor creates an instances of an object which fork a thread and that object accepts your types of object

1588767
constructor	object	value	field
a reference to your object by the one you have created in your constructor can now reference you as a non null object but get null field value

1588767
constructor	object
your constructor can initializer every field in your class but if you allow this to escape before any of the other object are created they can be null or default primative .when viewed by other threads if 1

1588772
switching	screens
as with the screens grab approach this on it s own does not prevent an user from by passing it by using the windows key alt - tab or ctrl - esc to bring up the start menu or to switching to other tasks

1588788
constructor	object
constructor can retain their original arguments list but must return a pointers representing the object

1588793
expression	evaluation
my parsing evaluates pemdas expression by first converting from infix to postfix then uses the standards postfix evaluation rules

1588794
implements	extends
even if you were to implements a bin field you could just extends the models.charfield and cast it to hex in the to_python methods

1588794
value	field
also the same question has also been answered earlier storing a binary hash value in a django model field

1588799
msbuild-task	teamcity
teamcity from the same author as r# sets an environment variables - see the xunit.net msbuild-task in the source code for the details.

web-services	api
it doesn t appear that the exchange web-services api was intended for this as all underlying data ends up being stored in active-directory

1588858
multiplication	addition
by then combining the beads percentage and the simple rating by say addition certainly not by multiplication we are able to effectively use minmax in a fashion that is more akin to the way it is used in cases .when it is not possible to evaluate the game tree to its end

1588866
pixels	line
i would like to draw .some graphics to the gtk drawingarea widget but i want that widget to be resizable .so .when i draw let s say a line from 0 0 to 50 50 pixels - the drawing area should be resize to a square of size 50 50

1588866

grouping by what to aggregate over

1588882
aggregate	grouping
now each selected entry must be aggregate or in the grouping by

1588893
32-bit	64bit
however you have to change the setup on iis to allow 32-bit extensions which iirc disables 64bit extensions

1588900
put	get
my question is how do i get it to report periodically and why does it fail .when i try to put the report in a for-loop

1588907
base-class	inherited
if you are using a control that inherited another class the types passed must be the types of the parent not the base-class

1588918
profiling	debugging
you can t get a collections of live object implements the interface though - at least not without using the debugging profiling api or something similar

1588919
numeric	digits	numeric	zero	digits	zero
if your real data looks like your examples and has a fixed numbers of digits just store the data in a numeric field and use the format input mask attributes of the column in access table design display them with the padded zero

1588929
filtering	grouping
there are two selected on the page which filtering a list by types and age grouping

1588939

return-value	arguments
f is assign a function that takes a function as its arguments invokes it and display its return-value in an alert

1588960

your best bet here is to create a custom configuration section for your application set default for everything then if the users want to overrides anything they can add the configuration section to their app-config or web-config file

1588964
string-length	zero
you should make sure to checked the string-length before testing character zero

1588966
lwjgl	jogl
if you want to learn about the underlying mechanics of 3d graphics go straight to opengl using jogl or lwjgl

1588982
spring-webflow	grails
how can i use spring-webflow definitions in grails

1588999
exception-handling	try-catch
a caller that suspects that they might say be causing a path not found exception-handling by calling your code cannot wrap their call in a try-catch which catches ioexception-handling

1589043
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the codeigniter means case-insensitive - cs would signify case-sensitive

1589051
decompression	tar
have you tried decompression the tgz with a known good tool tar -xzf and seeing if that works ok

1589060
sql-server	oracle
the ansi-standard syntax for this functionality which works in both oracle and sql-server and should work in any ansi-standard database is current_timestamp

1589081
oprofile	strace	systemtap	oprofile	systemtap	strace
linux strace oprofile systemtap

1589097
put	get	keyboard	mouse
what s happening .when you put your polling in a loops is that you re never letting control get back to the dispatcher which does all of the windows messages handling messagess for drawing move minimize maximize keyboard mouse input etc... for the application

1589099
rhino-mocks	moq
i don t see how you can make this work with either moq or rhino-mocks

1589102
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	onmousemove	mousedown	onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousemove	mouseup	onmousemove	mouseover	onmouseup	mousedown	onmouseup	mouseup	onmouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseup

asp.net-mvc	wcf
i d probably change one thing today i d migrate from asp.net + wcf to asp.net-mvc

1589106
javascript	dom
should be exactly equivalent to this one using the javascript dom

1589107
arrays	loops	logout	login
but if i want to loops through an arrays of say 10 files the scripting will have to login publishing logout login publishing logout .

1589108
any	set
i have never set this flag on any of our live production servers and therefore don t want to just do it

1589114
any	set
any ideas for a scripting to set the directory path of the new terminal tabs to the directory path of the opening tab

1589122
decompression	tar
my guess is that the junk at the start of the file after decompression is infact the tar file header i see a file named there right at the start

1589122
decompression	tar
if you are trying to compress multiple-files and as a single archive then you would need to use tar and untar the files after you decompression them

1589130
checkbox	textbox	selected	checkbox	selected	textbox
whether it s a textbox selected list or checkbox .

1589146
web-services	api
microsoft have beaten me to it exchange web-services managed api s first release candidate is available for downloading here

1589155
derived-class	base-class
have you thought about an interface that what is currently your base-class and your derived-class both would implements

1589172
any	set
...and then setting the c o on each windows added as well as adding component listener to set c o on any components added to the windows at a later points

1589181
.when	ready
in other words each client would register its intention to issue request to the server and the said server would callback the next-up client .when it is ready

1589207
decrement	increment
turing-machines are the only one i can think of that doesn t even have increment or decrement and you can certainly have one that cares nothing about formalisms assembler c

1589227
arguments	default
if you want to checked whether or not you can initializer a class then use class_exists and pass true as the second arguments or leave it out true is the default

1589233
contains	any
this will ensure c_old is up to-date and does not contains any extraneous files building artifacts

1589264
uitableview	uiview
i have a uitableview as a subclassing in one of my uiview

1589264
selected	cell
.when the application finishes the last selected table cell is saved to nsuserdefaults and .when the aplication restart i want to set the seleced cell as it was before

1589272
any	set
any ideas why this wouldn t be being set in the actionmethod

1589297
button	popup
i have a html page with a button popup

1589297
button	popup
if i click on this button a new windows popup i do all of my changes in this windows and then click the close button

1589298

however subreport won t go into the header and neither will field value

1589299
ubuntu	linux
i was using ubuntu linux 9.04 with netbeans 6.5 and 6.7.1

1589314
strtotime	mktime
use strtotime or mktime and then checked if your date is between that value and todays timestamp

1589318
authentication	login
that tells the server to request windows login authentication from the browser

1589333
spring	grails
but this doesn t seem to work in grails if i use the spring xml files

1589337
contains	elements	contains	any
is interpreter as int arrays with elementss int cd 0 actually the second elements can contains any junk

1589339
decrement	increment
get rid of the counter_cache and implements after_create and after_destroy callback in your comment model that increment and decrement the count field in your .post model

1589339
any	set
or perhaps more reliable set them to the recalculated count for that scope. it looks less slick but it isn t likely to fail under any reasonable set of dependencies

1589381
http	ssl
note that this is not bullet-proof code as it assumes your for example running ssl http on the default ports of 443

1589403
project-management	project
i often add a reference to the specifc project in our project-management system.in a comment .so that the people maintaining can easily lookup the requirement at the time the code was written

1589424
contains	set
as i understand inversion-of-control is set up .so that the contains object is dependent on the containers .so it should be the contains object s responsibility to know all about the containers

1589433
multiplying	formula
once you pick an elements you adjust its weight downwards you ll need to experiment with downweight formula till you find one that works for you the simplest is just to multiplying it by some constants fractions each time and then renormalise and repeat

1589433
data-structures	tree
if it turns out to be an issue you could look into geometric data-structures like range tree to optimise the lookup

1589434
defined	declare
fortunately the compiler will provide warnings if you call a methods not defined by a class with no declare parent class such as those you would normally expect to inherited from nsobject

1589444
build-system	automake
i am new to automake autoconf build-system

1589457
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button
another issues is that in my save button function while it can retreive the value of textbox and the checkbox in code it cannot get the text from labels that have changed.

1589457
checkbox	textbox
i just cannot figure out the reason why the checkbox control hardcode into my page with other textbox would come back as null on a page-refresh

1589462
gridview	listview
the catch is that if you have any controls that create other controls like listview repeaters gridview etc

1589462
contains	elements
still the function provides a way to solve this problem by allowing you to specify a contains elements in the second field

1589469
contains	any
then again since objectlist is apparently an std list you don t need to do any of the above -- .when you destroy an std list it automatically destroy whatever object it contains

1589472
input-field	selected
there is a common feature of modern browsers where a user can selected some text and drag it to an input-field

1589475
attributes	properties
attributes can hide properties from data binding but just making them methods means you don t have to worry about it.

1589527
installation	upgrade
is it any way in wix to detection that a third-party application with a specified upgrade code is install and what is it s installation folder

1589532
environment	building
the idea is to building a silverlight-based game that uses social network information from facebook as part of its play environment

1589539
function-call	eval
function-calls they are the slowest thing you can do because the function-call required the debuggee process to be restart .so that the func eval can occur in the process

1589557
click	mouse
the problem is if the user is in the control area pushes the left button down and move out of the control area then release the button and reenters the mouseleftbuttonup event never fires and the process continue until the user click the mouse

1589558
bluetooth	usb
.when i debugging it bluetooth or usb cradle connect some of the web service call will break causing a the remote connection to the device has been lost... error and instantly closes the .app without any further debugging information

1589597
show	next
al.so there are ruby-on-rails plugins that will alter the behavior of caching .so that you show the expired result on the current hit and then regenerate the caching for the next hit

1589603
scala	java	value	field
i need to create an instances of that class in java i would get the field by it s named and then do field.set object value but i can t find how to do .so in scala

1589614
contains	set
the important thing to remember is that automake files can contains make rules .so you can create a set of rules to building the libs then add copy the output of that building where you need it for your building

1589619
contains	elements
the data object will be formed by key-value pairs contains the id value of the checked elements

1589624
value	field
you ll notice that the response.redirect does retain your value because .when that server based methods is called it goes through all the form field and gathers their value to store in the viewstate and repopulates them .when it come back from the server request

1589653
configuration	installation
you shouldn t have to do anything assuming your passenger installation is clean you ve reinstalled it and reconfigurationured the configuration files since upgrading to snow leopard and you haven t messed with the default

1589653
passenger	suexec
user switching is supposed to be enabled by default and the passenger process that runs your application should automatically suexec to your own user account

1589690
silverlight	wpf
i would be especially interested in using wpf silverlight for this since there are good ides available for both

1589699
google-apps	gmail
i m using delphi 2009 and the lastest indy 10 from svn to send email using smtp but it doesn t work with gmail google-apps hosted domain

1589709
arrays	loops
i think you are making some faulty assumptions while measuring as the memory allocation via gettotalmemory during your loops may be different than the actual required memory for just the arrays - the memory may be allocated in larger blocks there may be other object in memory that are reclaimed during loopss etc

1589719
value	field
any time the field that value is bound to changes i need to get the types

1589719
value	field
eta just to be clear here i want to know .when the bound field has changed not the bound field value

1589721
selected	button
i need to positioning an absolute positioninging button next to user s selected text

1589727
environment	building
we have gone one step further and used this assembly of 3rd party libs as the target-platform for our eclipse building environment

32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit dll is 1044 kb whereas the 64bit versioning is 1620 kb

1589743
amazon-simpledb	couchdb
i could imagine a gae compatible framework utilizing amazon-simpledb or couchdb to offer near 100 compatibility if needs be through an abstraction layer

1589743
python	java
i prefer python though java would be acceptable

1589753
revision	updates
just discovered switching branches is done using the updates dialog vcs - updates project âœ t where i can selected any branch tag or revision i want

1589801
sql-server-express	sql-server
i have two databases the source is a database from sql-server-express by client and the target is a database from sql-server 2005 database as backup initially

1589803
firefox	opera
it s not very hard to make the code work across firefox and opera -- you don t have to worry about ie

1589806
hash-code-uniqueness	hashcode
the words before the types pointers certainly has something to do with either the monitor or the hashcode calling gethashcode populate that bit of memory and i believe the default object.gethashcode obtains a sync block to ensure hash-code-uniqueness for the lifetime of the object

1589820
firefox	safari
ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari

1589820
google-chrome	opera
but google-chrome up-to-date as i types this at versioning 3.0.195.27 and opera up-to-date as i types this versioning 10.0 building 1750 don t

1589823
push	pull
from here you can setup subscription or publications with push or pull sync

1589839
silverlight	wpf
you can use wpf but not silverlight for this

1589869
subclassing	base-class
take the base-class and map it get that mapping work then add in a subclassing and alter your mapping as needed and keep working down that way

1589918
hash	md5
md5 returns 32-digit string hash sha256 ... return 64-digit string

1589919
getter	setter
scala turns variables into a private field one getter and one setter

1589950
double	int
obviously reordering things like int and double in the declaration is not too big a deal but bigger object and things requiring dynamic-allocation sometimes can be

1589963
dictionary	arrays
it appears that you are looking for a dictionary object or an associativity arrays structure

1589964
linux	unix
for a path to a web resource or file located on a unix based machine include macs linux use a slash

1589977
solaris	linux
at least on linux and solaris static-libraries are really just a bunch of compiled .o s tossed into one big file

1589980
onmousedown	onmouseup
the way i was able to get around this is by using the li elements onmousedown and onmouseup events

1589980
click	mouse
.when the mouse is click i changed my css class or whatever else .so that it falls out of the items list

1589986
for-loop	arrays
right now i m using 1 for-loop that goes copies arrayscolor then filtering the copy-paste arrays using an nspredicate

1589996
hash	md5
how would one calculate an sha1 or md5 hash within ireport at report execution

1590000
subtract	time
if you ignore the time and use your code to subtract one day from sat apr 04 1942 you get fri apr 03 1942 as expected

1590021
arrays	loops
fastest would required profiling but my inclination would be to make an nscountedset from the arrays loops over that and return an arrays of items from the counted set that have a countforobject greater than 1

1590029
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it will only work on firefox safari and google-chrome though .so it s a only a progressive-enhancement

1590043
contains	any
if you create a database you are the dbo of said database and as dbo you have absolute power in the database includding the power to create alter and drop any schema and any object contains in any schema

1590073
tracking	robot
me and my friend are building a line trackinging robot based on my previous question about how to tracking white line on a black surface

1590092
windows	ms-dos	ms-dos	dos
in fact if i recall correctly even ms-dos accepted as a path separator at the api level ever since it started supporting subdirectories v2.0 - but by that time the character had already been established as the switching character for command-line options .so the backslash became the defacto path separator on dos and later windows

1590092
command-line	cmd
useless trivia of the day - in .some early versioning of ms-dos there was an api to change the command-line option switching character generally from to - .so the cmd could look more unix-like and the cmd would accept as a path separator on the command-line

1590111
fault-tolerance	scalability
you already have a scalability solution vertically and horizontally no single points of failure except the load balancer but well... and very few applications life critical applications financial applications really need transparency fault-tolerance in other words many can live without

1590113
append	input
pressing enter append a platform-dependent line termination sequences to your input for example windows append a carriage return-linefeed sequences

1590123
sql-server	mysql
i don t use mysql but use sql-server and this is the process i use to handle a file of similar size

1590131
delphi	c++
the same technique could be implements in delphi or c++ easily enough

1590137
silverlight	wpf
there s probably something that wants to know about that. prism from ms patterns and practices provides a lot of architectural infrastructure for wpf and silverlight

1590137
silverlight	wpf
a common variant of asp.net-mvc for wpf and silverlight is mvvm mvvm

1590146

this is the same as the constructor issue is it better to raise an exception-handling during the construction or initializer a void object and then call an init method.

1590226
any	set
if i do not set any of the parameters then the page works great and pumps out a pdf well except for the fact that because the parameters weren t specified its not really the data i want

1590233
versioning	upgrade
if you have earlier versioning of ids then the facility is missing and you should upgrade to get it if it is important to you to have it

1590249
google-chrome	safari
if you re looking for general webkit issues safari 4 and google-chrome use fairly similar building of webkit

1590256
aggregate	grouping
you need to use grouping by plus an aggregate on all columns you re not groupinging by

1590268
queue	fifo
the regular arrays structure in javascript is a stack first in last out and can also be used as a queue fifo depending on the call you make

1590282
selected	button
i have a button on selected which i would like to show the friend selector pop-up and users can send invite to their friend

1590287
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	queue
you can implements stack with an arrays and a queue with a linked-list although there are certainly other ways to go about it

1590298
selected	cell
i d like to attach a closure to the table that fires .when a cell is selected but i can t seem to find the right hook

1590304
vba	vb6
in vb6 vba you need to use the set statement .when working with object

1590321
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	ingres	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	firebird	ingres	oracle	mysql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
it currently supports by order of appearance mysql oracle postgresql sqlite ingres firebird

1590328
environment	building
ultimately you want your building scripting and environment isolated from your production environment

1590335
revision	svn
the building are distinguished by the svn revision numbers they correspond to .so you might have a path like svnrelease librarya r1000 librarya.dll

1590335
revision	svn
i suggested including the revision numbers in the dll file named .when they are checked into the release svn repo .so multiple versioning can co-exist

1590351
private	self
in the instantiable subtyping reference the private methods in the supertype through self

1590351
constructor	private
a package-as-fatory only helps me solve the private common code problem for constructor not for other types of common code refactoring

1590359
duplicates	sorted
preventing duplicates is best keeping the list sorted is next best and the algorithm i gave above is probably the worst

1590377
credentials	security
include the -u switching with a username and passwd to login to the remote systemd if your security credentials do not permit you to obtain performance counter information from the remote systemd

1590382
32-bit	64bit
if i have a 32-bit application written in c# what do i need to do to convert it 64bit

1590390
32-bit	64bit
that is an instances of this types is expected to be 32-bit on 32-bit hardware and operating systemd and 64bit on 64bit hardware and operating systemd

1590405
contains	elements
both contains 9 equals elements say 1 to 9

1590406
random-seed	generator
at their core genetic algorithms are simple and this was about as simple of a use case that i have seen .so i didn t use a framework for generator creation and selection - only a random-seed and the signal-to-noise ratio function at hand

1590409
dependency-injection	inject
another alternative not mentioned above is to support dependency-injection and have the methods client inject a validation

1590430
keydown	keyup
i thought about subclassing an nstextfield and overrides keydown and keyup but it seems these overridess do nothing.

1590446
32-bit	64bit
you don t want to send a 64bit binary to a 32-bit user

1590446
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
.so even better choose the any cpu option and your .app will automatically jit compile as 64bit on a 64bit machine with the 64bit versioning of the framework install and 32-bit x86 everywhere else

1590464
32-bit	64bit
this means .when you run it on a 64bit machine it will run through wow 32-bit emulation this has the advantage that the unmanaged jet drivers will also run 32-bit

1590467
any	set
my advice to you is to set the project properties to x86 not any cpu and leave it there

1590467
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
windows 64bit can run 32-bit applications without problems it s 16-bit applications they can t run

1590468
installation	environment
see the the gem installation guide to ensure your environment is configure to use gem

1590468
scripting	shebang

many restrictive hosts and i don t know this about godaddy one way or the other won t let you futz with php options either via the configuration file or at runtime as you did on wamp

1590489
triggers	insert
taking on board najmeddine solution you could put that code into an insert and or updates triggers for the selection table in sql-server

1590491
cairo	gtk
i ve done something like that before for a different purpose with gtk on x which indirectly uses cairo

1590496
contains	any
.so basically you need to make sure that you don t call any methods that are contains in types that call methods that required your third-party libs

1590511
db2-connect	ibm
this is because ibm charges a rediculous 11 000 for a product called db2-connect which will then give me access to their datacontext

1590513
any	set
if you set your validated_date to reset itself to the current time on updates then a simple updates of any column given an index on code should be pretty quick

1590514
silverlight	wpf
i m trying to get up to speed with prism and how it works with silverlight wpf

1590520
kernel	mmu
your kernel or other low-level code manages the mmu settings for different situations .so that your devices aren t mapped to the same spot as the ram you want to use

1590544
contains	elements
both contains 9 equals elements say 1 to 9

1590544
arrays	loops
you could in principles simply loops through arr1 then iterate through arr2 until you run across an elements which was not hash from the first arrays

1590566
contains	set
then for each member of the second arrays if it is contains in the set remove it

1590584
windows-xp	windows

however .when you selected the checkbox and hover away the color doesn t change to the selecteded class s background-color until you do something like click away in white spaces or another elements on the page

1590636
selected	checkbox
go and unselect the checkbox and the selected color is again residual until you click away

1590636
google-chrome	firefox
of course this works as expected in modern browsers such as google-chrome and firefox

1590651

basically my plan is to set up any python webserver with my .app on it and the boundle everything together using py2exe into a single executable

1590662
derived-class	base-class
i have a base-class media and a derived-class photo

1590666
document-ready	.when
however .when i load content using ...html... for example from .ajax .. success data or from ajaxform target ... document-ready is obviously not called

1590678
any	set
that would ensure that the model had the correct value before closing the windows though it may be a bit overkill depending on what the effects if any are of the value being set in your datamodel

1590700
python	java
if you re looking for more of the builder design pattern the wikipedia article has a reasonable python example as well as java

1590703
value	field
i m having trouble pre-populating a field in a repeat table starting with a given value and then using a formula-derived default-value

1590703
populate	row	value	field
.when we first enter the detail view the yearlycost field of the first row of the fyspending repeat table should be populate with the currentfyspend value

1590703
value	field
i tried to set a rules on the summary s currentfyspend field to set the value of fyspending s yearlycost then set a default-value on the yearlycost field to set value totalcost - sum yearlycost

1590703
populate	row
populate first row s yearlycost from the previous view s currentfyspend

1590703

web-services	api
this process is also one of the j2ee standards - jax-rpc based api for web-services which defined standards mapping between java classes and xml types

1590765
default-value	arguments
now if you are trying to reference cmp_configs as a default-value of an arguments to the lambda then this is a different story

1590765
arguments	default
edit - this next part turns out not to be correct since the default arguments value will get assign .when the function is compiled and that value will be used even if you change the value of cmp_configs later.

1590781
lookup	any
if you see any bookmark lookup in the execution plan consider having other columns into the index .so the index itself covers the query

1590792
ref	out
that wouldn t actually need to call mymethod but you would need to provide dummy arguments - which could be irritating if there are any out ref parameters

1590813
.when	ready
as for managing access to the buffering signals .when data is ready and sharing pointers with the reader s will work but if you re using multiple threads some types of synchronized will be necessary c.f

1591245
data-members	constructor
most likely the author of the code was trying to avoid the potential conflict between the data-members named and constructor parameter named in the initializer-list

1591245
data-members	constructor
of course inside the body of the constructor parameter named will hide the member named thus making it necessary to use or qualified named to access the data-members

1591249
linked-list	tree	linked-list	arrays
most of the underlying data structure implementation seem to vary in how the data is stored linked-list arrays sorted tree etc. whereas synchronized deals with conditional locking conditional under which the data may be accessed

1591481
haskell	erlang
erlang just tends to be more pragmatic than languages like haskell which are rooted more in theory

1591492
signals	sigint
in the alarm_handler function the value will always be sigalrm as that is the only signals that it is a handler for but signals_handler might get sigint or sigquit as the signals numbers because the same function is used for both

1591492
sigaction	signals
i d also probably use pthreads sigaction instead of signals but that is another issue

1591492
double	int
you would have no problem interpreting this as a function that takes an int and a double as arguments and returns a double value would you

1591496
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
on which databases would this actually work most notably for me would be oracle mysql and sql-server

contains	any
the outer selected then uses the box table in which each boxid only appears once to get a clean return of individual boxes without repeat that contains any of the fruit selecteded

1593362
assign	add
all good answers thus far...i only have to add that by definition value-type are not nullable and hence are a good candidate for use in scenarios where you do not want to be bothered with creating a new instances of a class and assign it to fields-for example.

1593372
linked-list	hashmap
i need to insert-into a very large linked-list whose elements i hold in a fast-access hashmap

1593372
linked-list	nodes
i thought it would be possible to hash the linked-list nodess then insert directly on the nodes getting the nodes from the map + insert in a linked-list constants time

1593375
credentials	security
for security i store the credentials of the user upload the file .so .when the form is posted i can validation that the user that post the form is indeed the user that upload the file

1593376
performance-monitor	perfmon
for example on windows you can use the supplied performance-monitor perfmon to recording all the cf metrics that are display by cfstat

1593393
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
ie8 firefox 3 recent opera and safari google-chrome support postmessage which allows cooperating pages on different domains to talk to each other

1593405
selected	listbox
supposedly the combobox show the list of author and the listbox all books and i want to filtering the books by selected author or show all books unfilteringed

1593405
selected	listbox
the selected author is passed down to the viewmodel and the listbox is updates by calling collectionviewsource.view.refresh

1593417
contains	any
interfaces can not contains any implementation including default value

1593424
decrement	increment
the next step would be to have a next and previous button handeling the increment and decrement on the current index

1593427
any	set
if you re not getting any messages it s likely you ve inadvertently set a breakpoints in gdb

1593432
32-bit	64bit
are you perhaps running 32-bit while he is running 64bit

1593447
system.web	.net
if you have the choice to use .net you can convert between an html-encoded and regular string using this code required a reference to system.web

1593457
subclassing	superclass
the object on the first line is the superclass this says that myclass is a subclassing of object

1593457
instances	self
you access field members of the instances using the self

1593480
getter	setter
you just specify that there is a properties with a getter and a setter whatever they will do

1593480
getter	setter
the compiler will create a field and generator the getter and setter implementation for it

1593497
getter	setter
this could be achieved via __get and __set but the most common implementation is for getting and setting runtime generator properties and it d be a hassle to code pseudo getter and setter for each added properties as well as using __set is a no-no in my opinion

1593523
attributes	properties
i am trying to set up a custom styles for my newly made user-controls however i am getting the error cannot convert the value in attributes properties to object of types system.windows.dependencyproperties .

1593537
command-line	cmd
there isn t any officially supported stuff as far as i know but having done it myself i know it is perfectly possible to building symbian apps using ant by simply calling the command-line tools from ant cmd

1593537
environment	building
if this is a precur.sor to automatically buildinging symbian apps using a building-server of .some description remember that symbian buildinging have an annoying habit of polluting the building environment .so you will need to invest .some time into automated environment cleaning and environment setup

1593542
return-value	arguments
this will call a public static methods of a types that takes no arguments but does have a return-value

1593567
authentication	login
if you control both participating servers as well as the authentication third party which may in fact be part of one of the two servers you should be able to provide some implicit login easily

1593568
any	set
i ve tried setting a variables in the if-block which should then read after the if-block to see if any data should be returned but i understand variabless can only be set once .so they can t be used for this goal either

1593587
internet-explorer	firefox
this works fine with firefox but not with internet-explorer i get an error in internet-explorer 7

1593600
ftp	ssh
there i set my local folder and the remote ssh ftp folder and winscp keeps these folder up to-date while i m working locally on windows

1593615
bug-tracking	fossil
i d suggest looking at fossil - it s a single executable with no dependencies to run operates all traffic over http keeps its all repository data in a single file which can be named anything and include versioning controlled wiki bug-tracking and a webserver out of the box

1593668
16-bit	x86
the points is that in platform that use bizarre memory-models such as 16-bit x86 dos compilers that have segments with offset as their memory-model pointsers can be interpreter in many ways

1593684
treeset	treemap
use a treeset or treemap

1593726
javascript	dom	.when	ready
using prototype javascript you can have scripting called .when the dom is ready see the api here

1593735
.when	ready
then create a function which returns true .when dom is ready and use this function inside your form tag

1593738
xsd	xml
bizarly the xml produced does not adhere to the xsd generator from the same class

1593738
attributes	properties
i could explicit state an order of elements using the xmlelement attributes but i don t fancy doing that for 400+ public properties

1593759
contains	elements
this code makes the assumption that anything that can be iterated over will contains other elements and should not be considered a leaf in the tree

1593762
oscommerce	opencart	oscommerce	zen-cart	opencart	zen-cart
in my opinion if you re looking for lightweight which is hard to defined for e-comemrce zen-cart oscommerce or opencart would be a good bet

1593812
double-quotes	single-quotes
alternatively if the value contains only single-quotes or only double-quotes then you can use the other to delimit the attributes instead

1593822
attributes	properties
at least for my classes the compiler annotates those automatic properties backing field with the compilergenerated attributes

1593823
getter	setter
checked that it s a properties and that you have protected getter and setter privates will not work since nhibernate will want to proxy the collections for lazy-loading

1593827
consistency	acid
well in-memory databases generally lack the d durability in acid atomicity consistency isolation durability by their very nature

1593827
rdbms	acid
in contrast most of todays rdbms s have the full complement of acid as well as having many decades of development behind them

1593832
actionscript	mxml
the flex compiler generator a lot of intermediate code to convert mxml files into actionscript you can view those files if you compile with -keep compiler option

1593838
progress-bar	progress
i assumed you are doing something like progress-bar of install .app where some operation advances progress copying files and if user cancels install others operation make rollback deleting files

1593846
subclassing	superclass
the member variables in your subclassing hide the variables in the superclass

1593867
compatibility	platform
as mono is a subset of the real thing .net to maintain the best compatibility you may have to develop in a mono supported platform linux then once it works there you can pretty much be certain that it will work on .net

1593871
unique	words
the first wordss are not predictive no wild cards each first words is unique

1593897
logging	trace
you can replace the trace target with any other types of logging interface

1593901
contains	set
a mutable class implements the immutable interface and contains all the required set methods without having these specified by an interface

1593902
build-process	msbuild
i m using msbuild to customize the build-process of visual-studio wix sandcastle .

1593903
value	field
here s my non-working code - it s fine single value field but fails for radio buttons.

1593953
libtiff	libjpeg
to manipulate jpeg files use libjpeg the tiff files use libtiff etc

1593953
png	gif
another easy option is gd which allows manipulation of many image-formats png jpeg gif ...

1593979
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1593980
c++	lua
lua is very easy imo to embed in c or c++ at least

1593980
arrays	map	data-structures	map
lua s primary data structure is the table associativity arrays which is well-suited to sparse-matrix data-structures like integration with a world map

1593980
contains	any
and if there aren t any errors the lua_state in your server s code should contains the final state of their car

1593982
database-design	denormalization
doing it this way greatly simplifies your database-design allowing you to retain a sane amount of normalize and avoids you having to introduce denormalization duplication into the design a having an unregistered users table along with a registered users table i would consider to be duplication and overcomplicates the design and relationships of your database entities

1594000
contains	elements
apply a function to each elements in the list and return a new list contains the results

1594004
keydown	keyup
the technical answer is that the keydown and keyup event is intercepted before it reaches the javascript layer by the application

1594004
keydown	keyup
just as you can return true or false in an event to prevent propagation the application stops propagation of the keydown and keyup events to scripting interfaces outside of its trusted domain eg

1594013
writetofile	nsdata
the modern way is to create nsdata from the root object|dictionary then write that data to the desired path using writetofile options error or writetourl options error

1594035
lazy-initialization	eager
but aside from that i think that it is probably the most efficient lazy-initialization of static-members because if you want eager initializer you can just do it in the static constructor

1594038
expression	evaluation
you can postpone evaluation of an expression involving x by assign the string value of the expression say 3 x + 2 to a variables and then calling eval at a later points in your scripting

1594039
linux	unix
the linux kernel for example supports 29 other address families such as unix af_unix sockets and ipx af_ipx and also communication with irda and bluetooth af_irda and af_bluetooth but it is doubtful you ll use these at such a low-level

1594052
elementtree	lxml
i have to write an xml file using python standards modules not using elementtree lxml etc the metadata is a saml identity provider metadata and is of the form -

1594069
button	popup
after specifying the named and pressing ok button the first view popup as demanded but there s no new button although created indeed

1594070
any	set
the database does not have any primary- or foreignkeys set

1594081
cassini	iis
although this may be running on the same machine the server here is the iis cassini process that serves up your webpage to the client your browser

1594081
cassini	iis
inorder to stop this you ll need to stop shutdown the iis or cassini cassini small webserver used by visual-studio .when running a web .app on your local development machine or stop shutdown the sql-server process

1594085
callback	methods
you should probably use jquery s callback parameter and continue your methods code in the callback like this

1594111
compact-framework	.net
i am using c# .net compact-framework 3.5 and i want to convert a video file to byte arrays .so that i may upload it on the server

1594130
silverlight	wpf
the architecture of wpf silverlight is the reason why things are done this way

1594179
any	set
autoloader of custom classes doesn t required any extra work like in zf albeit it s not hard to set up in zf

1594179
zend-framework	symfony
google symfony tutorials versus zend-framework tutorials and you ll see a massive difference in the numbers of results

1594192
value	field
xmlserializer is a very simple process that saves field value and restores into a new object

1594200
scala	java	groovy	java	groovy	scala
languages with static-typing java scala are faster than dynamic ones groovy jruby

1594240
cargo	maven
to me cargo shouldn t fail and this is likely a bug in cargo s maven 2 plugins or in the core api that should handle this case gracefully

1594253
selection	highlight
how to highlight previous selection text again

1594278
scala	java
java is very fast scala almost as fast

1594290
subclassing	nsobject
the cpxyplotspace you re getting back as the graphing s defaultplotspace is a subclassing of cpplotspace which is just a subclassing of nsobject

1594298
associations	model
without taking performance into account - it s probably not an issue and anyway we shouldn t optimise for performance until we know we have a problem - i d say you might introduce a bookmaker model if only to store the named and start making use of activerecord associations

1594308
environment	building
obviously you would have to building yourself a valid connection-string for your environment hint construct one in ssis designer first and pick out its connection-string

1594320
scala	java
for example a language like scala can allow you to naturally express idioms and algorithms that you d probably take a longer way around to do in java

1594320
scala	java
that s not to say that you couldn t match scala s performance at doing the same thing - just that it may become an ugly workaround in one language to match the natural idioms in another note i m not saying i believe scala is actually faster than java at anything specifically - i have no data on that - other than that scala is designed with scalability in mind - hence the named

1594320
scala	java
.so use the right tools for the job applies here - whether that tool happens to be java scala jruby or whatever although i doubt there are any situations where a dynamic-languages is faster than a static one without being pathological

1594323
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera

1594346
selected	button
i know that the methods gets called and the right case gets triggers .when the button in question is selected

1594348
display	width
unfortunately part of the fix is to give the a width and make it display inline things you either can t do or have already done

1594357
hide	show
i have a control that i want to show hide depending on the value of a boolean

1594387

in fact this lambda will even fit a delegation that takes an int and returns a double because the result-of the lambda a is implicit convertible to double

1594399
javascript	dom
jquery is built upon javascript and the dom

1594408
xsd	xml
is it possible to validation an xml file using an xsd loaded at runtime from embedded application resources instead of using a physical file with .net 3.5

1594409
any	set
also i tried to set background-image for tab control there also i didnt see any option to set background-image

1594449
specifications	w3c
i wouldn t worry about the w3c site and specifications until you ve got a grasp of the basic

1594456
perl	php
perl php and the likes are good for some because they are relativly easy to learn and let the programmer do things his way lots of way to do the same thing but this comes with a major drawback

1594494
textbox	button
what you would need for support is an edit button on the view which would go to the edit view and edit action which would present the user an html textbox in which to edit the content

1594505
python	php
seems like netbeans ide supports jquery-ui-autocomplete for php project but not for python project

1594510
buffering	streaming
everything works as expected however i faced one issue i m allocation 4kb buffering to read from incoming streaming but wcf reads only 255 bytes

1594514
file-descriptor	stdin
in your case use fileno stdin to get the file-descriptor of stdin

1594540
multiplying	division	multiplication	multiplying	multiplication	division
as a fast alternative to multiplication division or on architectures that cannot multiplying divide look at example below

1594540
multiplication	division
in fact software multiplication division implementation are often based upon shifts

1594541
blitz++	boost	temporary	rvalue
but have a look at blitz++ newmat and boost solutions that eliminate temporary object thanks to expression-templates -- c++0x s rvalue references will simplify et solution

1594544
internet-explorer	firefox
and in firefox this works but in internet-explorer it doesn t

1594553
arrays	loops
the first loops building up an arrays arguments with the arguments to the scripting except it doesn t add -q to the list and recording its presence in variables qflag

1594559
value	field
you can compose a query dynamically in your application by concatenation all of the field that have value specified for them

1594559
value	field
field that don t have value just won t be include in the where-clause

1594559
value	field
you can pass in null value for those field that the user hasn t input a value for

1594560
silverlight	wpf
for wpf and silverlight apps you use more exception-handling handler application.dispatcherunhandledexception-handling and application.unhandledexception-handling respectively but these are not of interest to you in this scenario

1594565
delphi	c++
i recently install zeos 6.6 stable on bds2006 for both the delphi and c++ personalities

1594565
delphi	c++
inorder to do .so and since zeos is written in delphi i checked the generator all c++ builder files .when building the package

1594565
delphi	c++
i finally worked around it by first building only for delphi which worked flawlessly and then rebuilding for both delphi and c++

1594573
stubs	tdd
this is one of the first project im doing using true tdd in that i did no class-design at all and am just writing stubs code.

1594580

checked the passwd required md5ing them first also but i dont think thats a big hit

1594584
getter	setter
i tried a workaround with getter and setter

1594595
perforce	git
the interest of your idea is not .so much in the private commit as it would be in the offline development mercurial or git would allow you to work even if not connect to the central perforce repository

1594612
decimal	octal
decimal d and i unsigned octal o unsigned decimal u or

1594612
digits	zero
digits it is padded on the left with zero

1594624
domain-object	repository
a caveat around doing this is how to get the reference to the repository to the domain-object - in that case i utilized constructor-injection with an inversion-of-control tool

1594641
webforms	asp.net
any way to do this is asp.net webforms

1594658
any	set
it would allow you to get any numbers of samples in a fair manner even if you add or delete rows but the same query on the same data would of course return the same result set

1594659
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have tested the following in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

1594660
textbox	button

1594683
key-value	key
in contrast insert will only insert a new key-value pair if a key-value pair with the supplied key part does not already exist in the map

1594687
variables	boolean	boolean	int
- this allows you to use one int variables to store a numbers of boolean value in a compact and efficient manner

1594687
boolean	int
this can often be used to make code much more efficient pass one 32-bit int instead of an arrays of 32 boolean as a parameter

1594687
any	set
set clear toggle test any arbitrary grouping of flags in a single bitwise operation etc

1594691

1594745
click	mouse
the event will be fired .when the mouse is click

1594745
jquery	dojo
i advise you to use a libs to handle events such as jquery dojo etc

1594812
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
we d like to use the asp.net-mvc to extends and gradually convert an existing asp.net webforms application which we ve inherited

1594812
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know that we can add asp.net-mvc into a webforms project but the existing project is written in vb.net and we would much prefer to use c# going forwarding

1594818
.war	jar
a web containers required the web module to be packaged as a .war file - that is a special jar file with a web.xml file in the web-inf folder

1594818
meta-inf	jar
ejb containers required ejb modules to be packaged as jar files - these have a ejb-jar.xml file in the meta-inf folder

i believe you need to add some attributes like this to your project properties

1594840
configuration	installation
this way i will offer my software my codec + configuration and installation

1594847
return-value	arguments
htmlimage is the arguments of the function x object the return-value you could take the concrete types if you want to specify it

1594851
click	mouse
for .some rea.son the mouse click are not causing an interrupt .so the mouse click are never capture

1594855

1594875
google-chrome	safari
i am using above and it works fine with ie but not with google-chrome safari

1594903
value	field
and then on the form-submit event or input-field change event set the screen_name field value

1594914
administration	account
under vista this needs to be install by an administration account but this means that the regular user account s can run our program but it can t access the database it needs

1594927
deprecated	javadoc
i don t know if it has been deprecated according to the code in 1.4 it wasn t or if the documentation is not up to-date after all it s the alpha1 javadoc and i couldn t find a link for beta4

1594932
callback	methods
it can implements the callback contract and for each callback methods it can just raise a prism event locally to any subscribers in the client

1594936
perforce	git
git comes with a git-p4 front-end that allows you to create a new git repository that tracking all or part of a perforce sub-tree

1594936
perforce	git
essentially you git p4 clone your upstream depot path and then can git p4 sync to pull down new changes into your current branch or git p4 git-rebase to git-rebase your current branch on top of the upstream perforce path

1594936
perforce	git
if you have a separate perforce workspace adjacent to your git repository you can then git p4 submit

1594936
perforce	git
i use a separate internal tool at vmware for submission to our perforce servers .so i haven t used git p4 submit though.

1594936
perforce	git
unfortunately i don t know how well vs deals with git or git and perforce simultaneously

1594936
perforce	git
my guess is that any vs integration does not deal with the perforce side of git-p4 but you can do all your normals git operations the way you normalsly do and just use a shell to call git-p4.bat or some such to do your perforce operations

1594936
perforce	git
another option is to simply have a git or mercurial repository initializer right in your perforce workspace

1594958
input-field	selected
i am populating a drop down with the named of a user which i want to bind with jquery .so that .when the user changes the drop down this in turn updates the input-field with the current selected user

unsigned	short
the problem is cvcanny can only handle ipl_depth_8s or u signed unsigned short or at least that s what i suspect

1596691
unsigned	short
casting my float32 to unsigned short wouldn t help much since the value would loose their precision and i would miss edges with opencvs canny

1596743
smalltalk	forth
definitely try haskell or smalltalk or forth

it s important to understand the difference between the dom which javascript can read and modify but is not part of javascript per se and javascript the language

1597398
javascript	dom
if you need the idea of a dom server side that s a different story if you need the javascript language then the above options should help you out

1597420
stderr	stdout
tomcat intercepts all output to stdout and stderr and redirects them to log4j

1597420
stderr	stdout
any application code that uses stdout or stderr will therefore appear in the usual log4j log files

i was considering using clojure and invoking the clojure interpreter runtime compiler on clojure code but the clojure runtime takes a lot longer than i would need

1597522
double	int
why would you need to make a difference between int and double for the shunting-yard algorithm

1597529
perl	awk
if you were accustomed to something like awk or perl i d expect to finish a bit faster still -- though in all honesty this is sufficiently trivial that it mostly comes down to reduced typing.

websphere	ibm
this extension is commonly used by server-side java platform like ibm websphere

1597543
binary	hex
the end result is the binary translation to hex

1597547
groovy	java
al.so groovy s syntax is almost a superset of java s .so it should be relatively easy to pick up compared to clojure

1597547
groovy	java
calling between java and groovy code is seamless .so you can easily use all your favourite jdk classes within groovy code

1597547
groovy	scala
i d be inclined to avoid ioke on account of it s immaturity and for the purpose of a dsl i think a dynamically typed language like groovy or javascript is a better choice than scala

1597560
constructor	private	constructor	object
the constructor function is basically a standards javascript object - you defined private attributes inside of it and public attributes are attached to the this variables

1597576
defaulttablemodel	tablerowsorter
i have a jtable that uses a custom table model that extends defaulttablemodel and i ve attached a tablerowsorter to the table

1597576
selected	button
for some reason if you selected the last row in the table along with any other row .when you click the remove button it will remove all selecteded rows except the last row

1597576
selected	button
to see the behavior click the load button to populate the table selected all of the rows in the table then click the remove button

1597601
implements	extends
and if there is not there is a class you can extends or interface you can implements

1597603
attributes	properties
could you not make the logger an interface and pass it to either a properties in the attributes or through the constructor

1597605
contains	any
.so my guess is we need to trouble our customers for this information regardless of whether we use in-app purchasing or not given that apple doesn t give us any access to the vcard in their address book that contains this valuable information

1597628
listbox	textbox
the listbox has bound to it a list of textbox controls

1597869
any	set	contains	elements	contains	any	contains	set
in my experience once isreadonly is set you can t change any properties on the configuration elements contains in the section

1597878
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
it doesn t have to be python i ve seen it done in php and perl and you can probably do it in many other languages

1597881

1597888
perl	awk
i looked in to doing this with awk but it looked like you wouldn t really get anything clever out of it it would just be the same logic but with .some awk pain to go with it .so i did it in perl

1597892
textbox	button
how do i create a textbox and button in html .so that .when i click it it will fire a javascript methods with the value and output the result below the textbox button

1597892

ok the problem appears .when the autoscroll properties of panels is set to true and the scrollbar is not at its initial positioning 0

1597964
display	height
i am trying to styles a menu that has a static height and the content is display between the headers

1597977
databound	gridview
i can t seem to figure out how to sort my gridview with both databound and

1597983
positioning	embed
your best chance would probably be having your own embed iframe elements and have it be a sibling of the embed elements and give it a higher stack order with a positioning and index you could al.so try making it a direct child of the body elements .so it has a higher z-index than the embed elements s parent elements

1597986
value	field
remember that each field on a document is effectively and arrays with 1 or more value

1598007
credentials	account
if you re sending these email as a part of an automated scripting forum registration just use the no-reply account credentials

1598041

i m trying to echo the key of a custom field value such as a url set while editing a postback into the document

1598061
value	field
the custom field on the .post is already feature there s no css issues or javascript it s just not returning the value

1598077
arguments	undefined
it happens to work in this simple case because javascript is .so sloppy it allows zero arguments to be passed in in which case x and y become undefined and are assign to the prototype s this.x and this.y

1598077
constructor	object
.so what we need to do is find a way to create a prototype object which contains the methods and other members we want at a class level without calling the base-class s constructor function

1598077
subclassing	base-class
maybe we can move that out into its own helpers function .so we don t have to keep typing it for example instead of function.prototype.subclass turning it round and letting the base-class s function spit out subclassing

1598077
subclassing	inherited
if you are dealing with large numbers of subclassing instances prototypical inherited may serve you better

1598077
subclassing	base-class
also calling a methods of the base-class is slightly annoying as you can see we have to remember what the methods was before the subclassing constructor overwrite it or it gets lost

1598077
instances	self
if your instancess are done the closure way the binding is done for free by the closure over the instances variables usually called that or self though personally i would advise against the latter as self already has another different meaning in javascript

1598088
default	reset

hide	show
to ensure you execute something after an effect like hide or show use a callback

1598149
hide	show
show and hide are actually animation effects but .when no arguments are passed they use an instant duration

1598149
hide	show
thus what you really should be using is a callback off of the hide call to triggers a callback which call append and then show

1598172
children	nodes
which obviously only selected the one nodes and not all its children

1598176
32-bit	64bit

python	php
i should also add it was not my choice to use php for such a task i would much rather write desktop apps using c or python

1598214
python	php
i would however encourage you to keep going on your self-study once you grasp the concepts of the gtk bits that php exposes consider looking into python if you want to create applications that will be release to the wild

1598236
binary	hex
looking at the file in a hex editor they obviously have different regions which are delimited somehow looks like typical binary saved struct

for instances double is an alias for system.double and int is an alias for system.int32

1598371
buffering	streaming
no data will be lost anyway but with the default buffering 8192 bytes at a time data may end up overly chunks for real-time streaming purposes completely removing the buffering might hurt performance but you could try smaller chunks

1598377
sql-server	oracle
i have a requirement for a project to move data from sql-server to oracle in bulk mode

1598377
export	csv
there is oraclebulkcopy from datadirect and odp .net but to use that i have to first convert the data reader from sql-server into a csv file and then can export that using bulk copy.this is a very inefficient process and i was wondering if there is another way.we can t use linked servers

1598381
callback	methods	hide	show
you have to use callback if you want to queue the other methods run after the show hide thing like sixten otto has said

1598570
unique	words
in other words they re guaranteed to be unique

1598577
value	field
but the beauty of variables and function scoping is to allow you to defined rich closures one of the truly beautiful aspects of javascript -- if you example code is definedd inside some outer function and the outerfunction returns validatecardfield or an object having the latter as one of its value that inner function will get to access the non-global variablesiables definedd in its outer function while the rest of the world is shielded off from them -- a much better way to do private field than the java c++ approach of private as a keyword..

they basic cmd sets are very similar init clone add status commit push pull etc.

1598863
strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy
this is a good strategy - it has low overhead and it actually generator some efficient code compare to strcpy which has to checked for the end of the string and has no way of knowing how many iterator it must make and poor confused strncpy which has to checked both - both can be slower and either could be sped up by using memcpy if you happen to have already calculated the string s length for some reason

introduces a mutable field with types t and a default initial value

1599004
mapping	unique
this behavior normally show up if the primary key field that you ve defined in your mapping aren t unique at all

filehandle	freopen
freopen returns a filehandle but it s the previous value before we put it in binary mode .so don t use it for anything

1599093
32-bit	16-bit
as to your concerns however you may not be reading in 32-bit but if you use fread you will be reading in 4 char s which is the best you can do in c - char is guaranteed to be at least 8 bits but some historical and embedded platform have 16-bit char s some even have 18 or worse

1599093
null-terminated	c-strings

1599539
settings.settings	app-config
edit the contents of the app-config and settings.settings seem to make a difference though changing for example the web reference url in the dll project s app-config file on its own makes no difference but if you edit the url in the app-config and then open the settings.settings file the changes you made in app-config then get copy-paste into settings.settings

1599539
