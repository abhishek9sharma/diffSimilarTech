1702083
jython	pypy
for example .app engine is still using python 2.5 .apparently upgrading its specialized sandboxed python runtime and all it relies on is not a zero-effort proposition .so they prefer to keep putting their energy towards adding engine features instead -- .so i believe are implementation such as jython and pypy i think ironpython s in the process of migrating to 2.6 but the current production versioning is still 2.5

1702083
python	perl
at some points some attractive functionality will become available in python 3 only for example if and .when pynie release that might be the case for a parrot implementation affording smooth interoperability with perl c and that will provide a strong motivation for some project to go 3-only pragmatically stronger than pure issues of language quality

1702089
highlight	selected
the issue i m having is that .when all the text is selected and a new key is pressed - replacing all the highlight text with a new character - the new character is removed from the combobox .when the properties bound to itemssource is updates and i end up with no text

1702091
deep-copy	object
to perform a deep-copy of an object with arrayss of normals reference-type you need to create new instances of the arrays elements

1702094
textbox	button
i have an asp.net page with a gridview and a couple of input textbox and a search button

1702094
put	get
once i put something on both textbox and press search i get a result list gridview from a ms sqlexpress 2008 database

1702119
value	field
obviously editing the value within the textbox doesn t work because its value is derived from an expression rather than from a field in the table

1702119
value	field
that is i want to be able to enter a value into that field and for example in its beforeupdates event retrieve the entered value and do a custom-insert updates and then set cancel to true

1702131
scriptmanager	updatepanel
the button1 is inside an updatepanel and the scriptmanager is on the user-controls

1702139
32-bit	64bit
btw this works only if underlying javascript-engine stores int as 32-bit which is case in firefox 3.5 on my machine which is 32-bit .so it might not work on 64bit machine haven t tested...

worksheet	excel
a ssis excel datasource uses worksheet or range -- think table with column named

1702180
getter	setter
c# 3.0 offers us getter and setter with compiler generator backing field - this is really great but there are plenty of time that you still need to use a backing field

1702181
any	set
you should checked the returned set in the reader to see if there are any rows

1702190
.when	ready
one approach that is safe meaning you re enforcing that it really is treated as immutable is to replace the reference with collections.unmodifiablemap originalmap .when you re ready to make it immutable

1702191
value	field
i just came across null value in not-null field in our test database

1702214
exception-handling	try-catch
you may want to put a try-catch block in that methods and write out any exception-handling to the event-log this should piont you in the write directions

1702216
selected	button
alternative solution the selected elements is in your case only guessing a single-choice form-control and you could use a grouping of radio button instead

1702216
selected	checkbox
if you have a selected multiple you could do the same with a grouping of checkbox instead as they can both be seen as a multiple-choice form-control

1702235
callback	methods
introduction i have a function callback that receives a object as an arguments inside this function i have a methods or function i m note sure what is it which then partition that object

1702243
base-class	inherited
if .so then you could make both of them either a inherited from a common base-class or b implements a common interface

1702244
base-class	inherited
if the two object in the arrays derive from the same base types inherited then you can box all the object in your arrays as base-class object and you can use them with no knowledge of which particular object it might be

1702244
base-class	inherited
either inherited from the same base-class or creating an interface that both object support will suit in this case

1702274
constructor	object
you can pass in constructor in an object arrays for one one them

1702282
32-bit	x86
buffering is a pointers to-char and the size of a pointers is 32-bit on x86

asp.net-mvc	webforms
edit there seems to be some confusion on my question yes i understand asp.net-mvc has a built-in antiforgerytoken scheme this question is explicit about how to recreate this for webforms to prevent the usage of a csrf attack cross-site request forgery

1702324
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this article explains more of what the csrf attack is and how asp.net-mvc stops it however their solution isn t applicable to webforms which is why i went about implements my own

1702341
value	field
the last part is the value of the message-id header field again

1702347
value	field
can someone .post a complete concise example of x++ code that generator a dialog contains a single textfield performs simple validation if text abc on it and either closes the windows returning the field value if validation passes or generator an infolog warning without closing the dialog if validation fails

1702353
oracle	mysql
i believe using not in is a known performance problem in mysql oracle has the minus operators

1702372
triggers	insert
edit a triggers could enforce this but you d have to copy the default to your triggers and the triggers would overwrite any insert value with a default an example of where this might matter is the various tokens people use for a unknown but future date or an unknown but past date or it might matter if they use getdate which include time or if they use a default date with year month day and no time

1702373
triggers	insert
that triggers would just +1 or -1 depending on insert or delete statements

1702385
perl	c++
if i have a choice between coding up such a utility in bourne shell or perl in ten minutes that takes overnight to run and taking three hours to write an optimized versioning using sophisticated and difficult algorithms in c++ that runs in one minute.

1702387

1702401
entity-framework	ado.net
my model consists of an ado.net entity-framework entity-model

1702404
any	set
then perhaps more interestingly the db implementor can i don t know if any specific vendor actually does this start getting clever - they can look at the set of recording to be insert and rather than reorganising pages of data to accommodate single recording can make bulk reorganisations of the pages to allow for new insert likewise we can imagine that shuffling indic could be done more efficiently if we know that we are insert a set of recording

1702413
adobe-illustrator	photoshop
with blend you can import from expression design adobe-illustrator photoshop

http	ssl
i ve read that networkcredentials doesn t support ssl and i m hitting an http site

1702436
javascript	dom
if you expect your menu button to respond to the user integration for example changing color to simulate a button then you will need extra code attached to the javascript you will invoke on the tag this extra code could address the menuoption elements through the dom and change it s color

1702459
contains	any
since all data will always be contains in the same columns there won t be any need for different sort order unless users actually need different order by data or asc desc.

1702459
culture	locale
to make things even better i d normalize these tables by creating a lookup table with culture locale abreviations that other tables like this one i created would use by foreign key

1702497
value	field
checkout for the full skinny but basically a field like that is known as an set - it has a list of possible value which can only be one or more of those

1702522
display	height	display	width
the nwidth and nheight parameters must specify a width and height that are supported by the current display drivers because the systemd cannot create cursor of other sizes

1702522
display	height	display	width
to determine the width and height supported by the display drivers use the getsystemmetrics function specifying the sm_cxcursor or sm_cycursor value

1702523

the credentials set on httpwebrequest will only be passed through http s authentication header via basic digest or ntlm

1702535
triggers	insert
all we want to do is create 1-to-1 data mapping between several database tables and the xml file .so we can set up a triggers on the table where our web service .software package insert the file then automatically parsing it and insert the data into the database as we have defined

1702565
hashmap	arrays
what is the easiest way to convert a 2d arrays of strings into a hashmap

1702601
contains	elements
on extraction some html from a webpage i have some elements contains text that end in an unknown or non-matching whitespace character ie does not match s

1702604
javascript	dom
since javascript is mainly used in a web browser environment those libs deal with the dom html etc

1702617
udp	tcp
since the designers of boost took this into account for tcp sockets i have a hard time imagining they wouldn t do the same for udp sockets

1702624
worksheet	excel
we have built an excel 2003 templates that asks the user to selected an xml file which is then import into an xml map and used to populate a worksheet

1702626

1702630
seam	jsf
i don t need the list of possible options for gui or data-access or business layer but the easiest ones .when you know ejb3 jpa seam jsf etc

1702632
contains	any
i am not sure but i think that for a contains to work in linq-to-sql it must be an arrays of strings or int or ... and not any ienumerable

1702646
keyboard	mouse
i know about the getlastinputinfo methods but that would only give me the duration since last user-input - keyboard or mouse

1702666
javafx	swing
it depends of how complex is the application you have in mind but the in my opinion the easiest way is to learn swing or javafx since you already know java

1702666
seam	jsf
this way for the view you d use jsf seam

1702668
swing	swt	javafx	swing	javafx	swt

1702721
qabstractitemmodel	qtableview
one way is using qt model-view classes with base at qabstractitemmodel but they need that you widget inherited qabstractitemview this is widget like qtableview etc.

1702723
constructor	object
one thought i have had is to initializer employee object using a methods instead of a constructor

1702745
joomla	drupal
in my experience drupal is far more flexible than joomla

1702766
callback	methods

1702776
contains	elements
sequences contains no elements

1702785
constructor	object
you can of course implements the foo constructor and createfoo methods .so that they take additional arguments beyond id the datarow object that you re using to populate the foo object with

1702794
constructor	object
if the methods you want to access are not static then you will need a reference to the parent object i commonly pass the parent object-reference in as a constructor parameter inorder to access its methods

1702806
communication	messages
however by communication with the local web service from other server code in our application it seems to me that we re going through the rigmarole of wrapping the messages into xml soap and thru the html stack to the service and then back again and will end up adding a shedful of time and slow down the application

1702816
attributes	properties
the above makes as readonly by using the insert false updates false attributes the many-to-one but you can instead have as readonly the creatorid properties if you like

1702818
text-align	display
if the text-align of the elements containers is set to right a display inline doesn t float it on the left notice i m referring to inline elements .

1702818
margins	padding
the display inline force the browser to display block elements div on the same line respecting their default margins and padding

1702818
display	width
about the width the display inline applied on a block elements without a fixed width it force the width to collapse to the minimum value width of the content + padding because this is the normals behavior of an inline elements

1702818
display	width
.so .when you apply a float left the width is still set to 100 but the floating on the left force the browser to manage and display its width in an unordinary way

1702828

1702900
value	field
i have tried it in just some field with success but i changed all of it problems with the returning value appear

1702916
handler	service
the web service handler is akin to the user-interface in a standards page there to handle the integration with the outside world

1702928
background-position	background-image
instead of just setting a background-image with javascript you will need to set the background-position of the letter

1702928

1702940
value	field
i have many field in the page and the last field is a dropdown with list of value

1702957
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
open created solution in either visual-studio or sharpdevelop

1702976
contains	elements
common causes for this are the html form field not being contains within the form elements or the submit button having a nonstandard javascript function fire instead of submission proper

1702980
pointers	stack
since the arrays is defined on stack .when the caller gets the pointers that part of memory has gone out of scoping

1703026
listbox	textbox
i assign the validationgrouping vgfirst to the grouping of textbox and the validationgrouping vgsecond to the two listbox

1703026
listbox	textbox
do i have to disable validation for the listbox if the text in the textbox change

1703042
csv	xml
systemd into a csv file xml file or

1703052
amazon-ec2	vps
1. should we go for amazon-ec2 or vps considering our present requirements which i stated above and also considering that we may need to scale in the future

1703065
constructor	object
in perl oo this is the methods invocant -- typically a classname for constructor and an object for other methodss

1703071
selected	button
.when you click on the hyperlink button it is handling the click event .so the item doesn t get selected

1703081

if i leave them off i get sqlexception invalid column types but if i put around the variables i get a warning from groovy

1703152
arrays	map
how would i setup automapper to be able to map from these arrays s to set s

1703155
lookup	any
at any time the numbers of dcache lookup is much more than dcache updates .so

1703158
average	max	average	min
then perform the process for min max and average later on

1703182
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
there s a pretty substantial disconnect between the average asp.net-mvc data-access strategy and the domain-driven-design understanding of the repository-pattern

1703182
repository	entity
most of the samples you ll see for asp.net-mvc are just a slight step beyond activerecord using repository object per entity

1703206
any	set
if you don t have any cornerradius or other funny business you can just set a margins on the content and forego the transparency border

1703209
highlight	cell
however this does not address what happens .when the user taps the cell and it goes highlight - it will look squared off then

1703209
highlight	tablecell
you can get around this by setting the highlight image for your faked tablecell background-image

1703209
pixels	line
one note if you go this route the cell in a grouping table are typically 300 pixels wide in portrait mode but your plain table here would need to be 302 wide to allow for the grey line on each side of the table which is normally outside of the content of the table cell

1703211
python	java
python has jython and ironpython if you need to work closely with java or the .net clr

1703235
subtract	time
i thought i could create the time difference by getting everything in seconds and then subtract the two value but it seems like extra work to do something like

1703235
subtract	time
and then using these value to get the time in seconds do something similar for the second time and then subtract

1703240
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera

1703313
swing	swt
swing or swt aren t bad options

1703339
children	tree
in your case you will need to walk the control tree to find the children of each child probably in a recursive manner and then rendering it to excel using xml

1703366
click	mouse
i think i will change the id or class on mouse click .so that i can use the same button for both animation

1703406
contains	set
.so i got my information from this apple document set and arrays operatorss where it states the distinctunionofobject operators returns an arrays contains the distinct object returned by sending valueforkeypath to each item in the receiver passing the key path to the right of the arrays operators. i assumed that the returned object is an nsarrays because it says arrays .when it should probably say arrays or set

1703415
instances	private
you shouldn t have any accessibility higher than private exposed as direct instances field

1703416
any	set
practically this might be adding validation to the setter .so that it can t be set to any value

1703424
protected	public
the same arguments for can be made for using protected properties as can be made for using public properties instead of exposing member variables directly

1703424
getter	setter
if this just leads to a proliferation of simple getter and setter then i think the damage to code reliability outweighs the benefit of being able to change the code in the future

1703435
highlight	selected
.when selected the textblock and image are highlight

1703440
stateless	stateful

1703575
digits	short
anyway in short treat it like an odometer spinning its digits wheel

1703577
dictionary	arrays
.so the technique is to make sure your views register with a controllers which can store them by named or whatever you prefer in a dictionary or arrays

1703577
communication	messages
either you can have the controllers send a messages for you or you can get a reference to the view and communication with it directly

1703580
children	nodes
.when you get child nodess from another nodes you receive all direct children

1703580
contains	elements
getting the div s childnodess would return 3 nodess a comment nodes contains comment nodes an elements nodes of p and a text nodes of a text nodes

1703584
environment	execution
this kind of question is difficult to answer without knowing more about the expected usage and baseline execution environment

1703587
put	get
spreadsheetgear for .net will let you load an excel workbook put value in cell calculate get results as raw value or formatted text and more

1703598
z-index	overlay
then overlay my non-scrollable fixed elements in a separate div with a greater z-index

1703617
callback	methods	any	set
regardless if it produces a 401 any non-success status code should invoke the failure callback of the ajax request and you should be able to handle your situation in the methods set to handle failures

1703618
logout	login
an easy way might be to just have the page redirect after the timeout occurs to a logout login page

1703631
joomla	drupal
i think both drupal and joomla would be able to handle creating a basic versioning of what you describe

1703658
constructor	object
you can named your constructor anything you like have as many constructor as you like and even building bless object into any named spaces you desire not that this is a good idea

1703761
webforms	asp.net
its doubly hard in asp.net webforms

1703774
xlsx	xls

1704495
value	field
i fyou are close to or over which you can usually do if you have lots of field with null value the limit i would add a table with a one-to-one relationship for better performance and less of a likelihood of a recording that suddenly can t be insert as there is too much data for the row size

1704496
any	set
in an insert you are not choosing any rows you are generator a new row which required specifying a set of value

ruby	php
certainly do not completely rewrite a working php web application from scratch in ruby without a lot of thought

1704678
required	checked
i guess the proper way to actually checked if it s an mp3 file this required that the file be opened is to look for magic-numbers sequences of bytes within the binary-data that always occur

1704678
id3v2	id3
in this case you can use the id3-tag s magic numbers id3v1 tags are stored in the last 128 bytes of the file starting with the bytes tag hexadecimal 544147 while id3v2 tags are stored at the beginning of the file .so the first 3 bytes of the file are id3 hexadecimal 494433

copy the file to a temporary location probably starting with mkstemp

1704702
temporary	copy
load the temporary copy of the libs using dlopen

1704713

1704981
constructor	object
class constructor initializer object

1704981

the issue lies in that the value of this inside of the private methods default to windows and one of two techniques must be applied to ensure that this refers to the object that we are working within in this case the instances of someobject

1704997
display	height
the uitextview i have set to display 2 line by default and then as the height of the text goes beyond those two line i would like the box to grown which it does and the text to remain scrolled up .so you can see what you are typing

delphi	c++
it also means that you could write some dlls in another language c++ c# fpc another delphi versioning and still use object

1705053
delphi	c++
the main problem id that c++ cstring and delphi string are incompatible types

1705053
delphi	c++
other data types may be different as well in delphi words is 16-bit but may be different in c++

1705060
constructor	object
for example this points to the global object in a constructor called without new

1705063
delphi	c++
unless you re using a 16-bit c++ compiler the types unsigned int is definitely not a 16-bit types and yet delphi s words types is

32-bit	64bit
that s required since the 32-bit core can t be loaded into a 64bit hosts

1705110
32-bit	64bit
the developers very likely took advantage of this in their testing debugging in a 32-bit process without dcom getting in the way until the core was proven to work well enough to try calling it from a 64bit application

1705117
http	ssl
you can add as many http header parameters as you like without concern for ssl

the parent would then map each child.id to child in the children dictionary

1705354
any	set
the datacontext set at this level then is inherited by any elements in the windows unless you explicit change it for a child elements .so after setting the datacontext for the windows you should be able to just do straight binding to code-behind properties from any control on the windows

1705364
.when	ready
.when the consumer is again ready for more data it call resumeproducing on the producer

1705367
testng	junit
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1705379
.when	ready
but if you need a large numbers of threads then while your program is starting up in the initialization you could spawn a thread that just starts to fill in an arrays of threads .so you can finish setting up your application and the threads will be ready .when they are needed

but how can i add a progress column with a progress-bar inside

1705567
any	set
you can defined a base form with your processcmdkey handler implements and then make all your other forms the mdi parent the child windows of the mdi parent and any independent forms you create not children of the mdi form inherited from the base form. just make sure the ismdicontainer properties is set on the form you wish to be mdi and the child windows you add to the mdi form are not toplevel and have their parent set to the mdi form

1705571
python	perl
take the difference between perl and python

1705571
functional-programming	imperative-programming
oo paradigms will lead to drastically different program structures from program to program imperative-programming paradigms will lead to very similar program structures from programmer to programmer functional-programming paradigms will be somewhere in between

1705599
nswindow	nspanel	nswindow	nsmenu	nsmenuitem	nswindow	nsmenuitem	nspanel	nsmenuitem	nsmenu	nspanel	nsmenu
is the solution a nswindow nspanel nsmenu with a custom nsmenuitem

1705603
parentheses	operators
al.so be wary of operator-precedence -- the arrow-star and dot-star operators have lower precedence than function-calls .so you need to put in the extra parentheses as i have done above

1705701
spring	grails
grep the grails source tree for autowire to find a nice code fragment you can use to get it to autowire your controllers for you in integration-testing. this only functions in integration-testing where there s a spring application context around that has the beans that can be inject

1705734
defined	declare
any reason not to just defined those on a non-generics interface that s declare on the generics base then do a cast to t

1705750

.so far i can match any empty html tag that does not contains jstl with the following

1705766
contains	any
if you use a memory manager that clears the memory .when pointers to it are free it won t even contains the data any more

1705796

constructor	object
in c there are some time .when i emulate the object oriented approach by defining some sort of constructor with granular control over things like callback .when running several instances of it

1705858
arguments	default
you can specify default jvm arguments in windows preferences java install jres

1705864
put	get
there is difference to get local resources and global resources if you are trying to put your localized resources to global resources then you need to change your code as well to access resources like.

1705870
textchanged	textbox
the textchanged event handler required a postback to the server and posting back to the server before a textbox loses focus is impossible

1705889
key-value	key
you can consult the systemd catalog views to find out which columns make up the primary key but you can t just simply selected the primary key-value s with a function-call

1705892
value	field
everything appears to work fine except that the value for this one field isn t being passed to the function

1705904
ruby	php
that backend server language could be php asp ruby or anything really

1705904
zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
on the other hand there s php frameworks like cakephp codeigniter zend-framework or the one you mentioned akelos who just help you doing some tedious tasks in php like templating database access etc

1705973
sinatra	gem
a lot of people recommended using j.son_pure instead of the j.son gem .so i gave that a try by adding required j.son pure to my sinatra .app

1705979
value	field	required	checked
if you need to do this a lot then think about using the custom postmeta field to defined a postmeta value for offsite_url or something like that then you can create pages as needed enter the offsite_url value and then use a filtering like the one above to instead of checkeded the post_id you checked to see if it has the postmeta required and alter the permalinks as needed

1705986
value	field
u save in 0 value it might be your field is enter wrong or double checked ur careless mistake

1706001

1706019
django-forms	django
don t django-forms and the rest of django work for you once you upload your .app to google

1706060
versioning	upgrade
the full idea i hope to try is creating a paver scripting that controls management of the bundles making it easy for users to upgrade to newer versioning

1706070
deployment	install
for certain installation of eclipse there will exist the notion of a shared installation -- this may be in the case of a linux systemd where a base set of software is install via package perhaps rpms or may be in a maya deployment where shared profiling are defined in a central server

1706073
attributes	properties
the same holds for applying attributes to the properties

1706097
configurable-product	product
my question is how can i not echo product that are simple but belong to a parent configurable-product

1706108
firefox	safari
firefox and safari are case-insensitive in this regard

1706108
firefox	safari
however if your processing.js code has even one little syntax-error i can t really categorize which kinds but trying to use equals will do it your routine will probably fail silently in ie8 whereas in safari or firefox your rectangles may lose their outline stroke will quit working

1706108
firefox	safari
ie on vista and safari on the mac have both exhibited stronger syntax-checking than safari or firefox on vista which will blow by certain errors and rendering a defective graphic

1706108
firefox	safari
5 text invoked using the text function rendering in firefox in an unchangeable fonts of firefox s choosing but as far as i can tell not in ie8 or safari

1706120
bundler	gem
the idea is to use the gem that bundler downloading inside the .gem folder

1706122
pixels	line
because of that line getpixel will always read white pixels except for one and will recurse to the right

1706135
lighttpd	apache
if your webserver is lighttpd or apache with mod_xsendfile then you can send the file by specifying a special x-sendfile header

1706160
version-control	git
git version-control systemd

1706180
protected	public
note fxcop will not warn of unused public or protected members because these could be part of an api intended for use by external callers

1706181
instrumentation	debugging
instrumentation find-file for debugging and or instrumentation your init file for debugging

1706200
visitor-pattern	visitor
this indeed sounds like a case for the visitor-pattern visitor simulates a double

1706238
syntax-error	syntax
why do i receive a syntax-error as such incorrect syntax near the keyword as

1706239
getline	atoi	strdup	atoi
its much more straightforward and robust to use getline to retrieve a line of user-input then utilities such as strdup and atoi to extraction your value one per line rather than on the same line and checked for error value and such

1706253
strcpy	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memmove	strcpy
yes you can use strcpy memcpy memmove or std copy to do this

1706260

apache is used by almost everyone else java php python ruby etc

1706267
linux	unix
developers on mostly linux and unix servers

1706274
webserver	nginx
ideally you d do this in your webserver apache nginx etc. configuration .so that the request doesn t even touch ruby-on-rails at all

1706281
strncpy	strcpy
usually .when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

1706291

1706328
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit redhat box we have to compile and run a 32-bit application

1706328
32-bit	64bit
meanwhile i managed to compile the gcc versioning needed 4.0.3 and all required runtime libs in 32-bit and have set the ld_library_path to points to the 32-bit versioninging but now during the remaining build-process a small java program needs to be execute which is install in usr bin as a 64bit program which now finds the 32-bit versioning of libgcc_s.so first

1706328
32-bit	64bit
in general if i set the ld_library_path to the 32-bit versioning i break the 64bit programs and vice versa

1706330
linux	unix
iis is a webserver that runs on windows only whereas apache is a cross-platform server that will work on windows linux mac os x and various flavors of unix

1706330

php and python are more naturally paired with apache

1706330
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
you can downloading versioning of php perl and python to work with iis

1706346
solaris	linux
one of the issues i have had in porting some stuff from solaris to linux is that the solaris compiler expands the macros __file__ during preprocessor to the file named myfile.cpp whereas gcc on linux expandeds out to the full path home user myfile.cpp

1706370
ubuntu	linux
note despite the windows sounding named variant_type loadsharedlibrary and getfunctionaddress i am developing on linux ubuntu 9.10

1706389
highlight	selected
consider user has selected a words example in the webpage now i need to highlight this words and all its occurences

1706396

one note it s best to insert a sleep of at least 20-30 milliseconds after the triggers action to ensure that enough time is given for the event handler to kick in - sometimes i ve had race conditional develop

1706409
arrays	loops
using a string for-loops loops might not work for large arrays

1706415

1706494
enumerator	any
is there any arrays or enumerator built-in that allows me to search for an elements using a block and return its index

1706506
hash	md5
ensuring low collision is a design criterion for all hash and all mainstream hash do a good job of it - just use a mainstream hash md5

1706509
postback	ajax
because not all web browsers through .some strict security policies will allow ajax enabled postback to work .so .when buildinging a centralised application that multiple companies corporations can use changing this setting means the site will still work without partials rendering and will work for companies corporations or other users that do support full ajax without having to building two versioning of the site

1706560
expression-blend	wpf
i ve been trying to come up to speed on wpf and have been buser-interfacelding user-interface prototype here and there and recently i decided to see if i could use expression-blend to help with the design of these user-interfaces

in both cases you need to have field in backing bean to store the value or get it from request

1706607
treeview	listview
you can then fill your itemscontrol datagrid listview treeview ... with those dynamic databojects and wpf knows how to rendering them

1706607
expression-blend	design-time
to be able to design the datatemplates in expression-blend you need to provide sample design-time data

1706630
contains	set
will set fld to null if contains dbnull.value to its value if it contains an int and throw an exception-handling if it contains anything else

1706632
innodb	myisam
what sort of storage engine is best suited for my website do i use myisam innodb etc

1706716
enterprise	licensing
i have done similar database transformation tasks with sql-server integration service it does required that you have sql-server standards or enterprise not express but because it is part of sql-server there is no additional licensing if it isn t install you may need to re-run the install and selected integration service

1706724
credentials	account
.when you create a new directoryentry without specifying a username and passwd you re connecting to active-directory using the credentials of the execution user - in your case probably the local iusr_...-account on the webserver which is the default account used .when a new website is set up in iis

1706733
duplicates	contains
rescan the string assign the pointers in the allocated arrays and replace spaces with 0 if you can t modify the string contains the arguments you should duplicates it

1706749
selected	cell
but in one special cell you should be able to selected entrys out of a list

versioning	upgrade
ultimately i would take matt s advice and upgrade to the latest stable versioning anyway

1706938
innodb	myisam
what sort of storage engine is best suited for my website do i use myisam innodb etc

1706938
innodb	myisam
consider resorting to myisam only for a fulltext search and b specific cases where performance under innodb isn t good enough it s fairly rare that this is significant but some types of data can benefit from myisam s .profile

1706938
innodb	myisam
however innodb also typically performs better in write-biased access to a large table due to myisam s unfortunate table-level locking

1706950
buffering	streaming
bufferingedreader contains internal buffering that will read characters from the streaming

1706964
32-bit	64bit

1706980
linux	unix
there are a large numbers of ide s that run on linux and other unix systemd .

1706980
emacs	vim
small programs like id-utils vi vim and emacs plus the cli tools make the entire systemd into a sort of hybrid development systemd

1706980
linux	unix	netbsd	linux
but before and after that i used unix netbsd and linux for development

1706980
ruby	php
i m perfectly happy developing c++ php or ruby just with vi 1 and the other cli tools

1706993
emacs	vim	kdevelop	anjuta

now the transactional isn t being rollback and i can commit the changes to order

1707025
latex	tex
my best advice is to read lots of package sources clsguide.pdf it will be in your distribution as much of the latex sources source2e.pdf as makes sense to you as well as tex by topic and any other tex programming resources you have access to

1707031
keyboard	mouse
i like gvim because it enables me to do just about everything from the keyboard if you can touch types that saves you lots of time - while others are looking for their mouse

versioning	upgrade	versioning	migrate	upgrade	migrate
it s simply upgrade the database or maybe .when the new versioning is install there must be a way to migrate the existing database

1707156
spring	guice
i think spring would do this all out of the box while guice would need a 3rd party .lib to handle lifecycle and thread scoping

1707162

1707219
shell	bash
the shell offer some options to do that for example in bash you can treat unset variables as an error with set -u

1707221
nested	order
also the order might make a difference in case you are using nested queries

1707228
contains	elements	contains	any
therefore you should only use the text-align styles on elements that doesn t contains any block elements

1707228

1707251
multiplying	division
the multiplying by 180 over pi is just the scale from radians to degrees as in the question but with the division by a division simplified the +180 makes sure its always positive 0-360 deg rather than -180 to 180 deg

1707261

used py2exe to create exe file

1707352
itemscontrol	textblock
textblock s contains in an itemscontrol

1707355
execute	declare
i think you ll have to declare a string and then execute that sql string

1707382
derived-class	base-class
in think in java there is a sequences .when you create an object of the derived-class it contains within it a subobject of the base-class.this subobject is the same as if you had created an object of the base-class by itself.

1707392
constructor	object
3 constructor being called to create 2 object

1707393
constructor	object
you can note that the invokespecial cmd is invoked afterwards to call the constructor and also how class classa s constructor is called from class classb s constructor but no new object is created inside the constructor it is the default empty constructor

1707393
constructor	object
calling javap -c classa show an equally boring constructor which invokes the constructor for object

1707409
automake	cmake
it has automake support but i prefer to use cmake

1707409
kdevelop	kde
initially kdevelop was developed as a development tool for kde applications but it works fine for any c++ project

1707409

1707443
environment	restart
have you restart after changing the environment variables

1707466
checkbox	button
how would i add other stuff such as button or checkbox at the same time

1707475

1707505
required	checked
authentication was required to connect to the server by using the built-in feature of wcf that force the connecting per.son to call a particular methods first .so from a malicious client perspective you could easily add code to checked and ban their account if they do .something suspicious while disconnect users who do not authentication

1707518
put	get
users connect to iis via some http exposed service which is working fine and then iis needs to get some information from the windows service to put in the http response

1707521
macports	fink
of course macports or fink is always an alternative

1707528

json	xml
in each case you are getting the data from the view users in the names.nsf database in xml or json format

1707575
virtual-functions	base-class
however i want the actual implementation to be non-static .so i can use virtual-functions and reuse code in a base-class

1707580
processor	cpu
.when you re dealing with a cpu-bound operation using more threads process than you have processor will almost never 1 improve matters - if the cpu utilization is already at 100 more threads process won t magically increase its capacity - and will most likely make things worse by adding in more context-switching overhead

1707590
contains	elements
you can use a partials attributes selector to find an elements whose id attributes contains the id you ve assign to the control

1707606
scala	java
it s worth noting that if you were using scala rather than java some of the problems with 2 are avoided with traits and that it also has nicer syntax for 1 with pattern-matching

1707609
filehandle	seek
since compress zlib and therefore io zlib doesn t support seek on their filehandle there is little choice but to read the archive into memory

1707622
low-level	hardware
i come from a computer hardware background with all low-level imperative stuff i saw a jquery user-interface demo and al.so came across an ajax for dummies guser-interfacede points to jquery .so i told myself i d learn the minimum needed to do my damn job but that would be it

1707666
any	set
it s a little confusing since one event handler gets called .when the document is initially saved and itemupdated gets called .when you set any custom properties on the item at least if you re using the default sharepoint web user-interface

1707669
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is used as opposed to setinterval to accomodate for any delay that may occur in the ajax request

1707683
rollback	commit
of course i am of the opinion get an instances of the connection use it commit rollback your work and return it to the pool

1707706
decrement	increment
then you would have to attach an event handler to the propertieschanged event which would increment or decrement the totalpublicationsread properties

1707710
account	api
the same story applies to other decent credit-card companies just have an account and ask look for its webbased api s

1707726
simulator	platform
for exchanging apdus i had to create an apduconnection through connector.open api but this particular api throw up an io exception-handling stating jsr 177 is not supported on this platform i dont know whether this happens because i test this on simulator or whether it s not supported on blackberry devices as well

1707761
value	field
instead i need to get that value and then store it within an arrays and later that arrays will be field into the options.php file

1707787
constructor	object
although b extends a .when it gets created the constructor in a is execute but at the end only one object out of b is created

1707787
derived-class	base-class
.when you create an object of the derived-class it contains within it a subobject of the base-class.this subobject is the same as if you had created an object of the base-class by itself.

1707832
put	get
no you get the html code as a string and you have to put the string back after changing it

1707832
put	get
however that would not be efficient if you wanted to apply more than one change which is pretty much the points of chaining methods as it would have to get the html code and put it back for each change

1707832
put	get
.when you get the html code as a string you can do whatever you like with it and put it back .when you are done with it

1707844
any	set

1707869
shell	bash
a shell scripting only option is not a viable alternative as on windows platform there s no bourne shell bash or ksh by default and unfortunately powershell seems to be rare on xp machines

1707870
constructor	private	instances	private
or if what you really want to achieve is to only have one class instances then make the constructor private and provide with a static instances methods

1707880
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight apps are easy to program once you have a c# asp.net background and in addition to visual-studio expression-blend makes a great companion to create edit and animate stuff for silverlight

from jboss perspective it has to be a file placed in main deploy directory for tomcat is located in meta-inf folder

1707925
any	set

contains	any
it s a little bit of job but you should be able to draw the cell in a different way .when it does not contains any text

1708012
value	field
one difference is that if you had an assembly that referenced a const field in another assembly and you later changed that value the referencing assembly would still use the old value until it was rebuilt

1708016
textbox	button
.when i change the text in both textbox then click the click button the text in txttest is reverted back to the original value bbb specified in page_load but the dynamic textbox retains the value i just entered and not aaa despite this being specified at the same time as the other hardcode textbox

being a field this value should persistent through round trips to the server without viewstate enabled i could be mistaken on that count .so please checked it

1709239
default	reset
use a reset stylesheet to set all default value to 0 in all browser

1709243
32-bit	64bit
obviously the best solution in most cases would be to simply boot in 64bit mode but my question is strictly about how to make use of physical memory above 4 gb in an application running on a pae-enabled 32-bit kernel

1709252
order	add
i wonder if since the criteria-api call it addorder rather then setorder it just inherited the default order from the hbm file and then add the order value to the default

1709282
contains	any
don t know how well this sits with row_number for the subsequent paging but it would keep the actual query logic contains within myqueryfunction - you re still going to have all the join for any column to be retrieved duplciate in the sproc and the function

1709288
value	field
unlike verifytext the text elements you are searching for should be entered into the second field target not in value

use something unique to each user to seed the prng before the shuffle

1709358

csv	xml
you re probably going to be better off getting the csv because the xml they re feeding you is malformed

1709445
required	checked
.so checked any spaces or newline outside the that is probably where it is coming from using include or required will parsing that outside the scripting on the html document and before you parsing or execute anything else that came in .when you include the file .so it is before everything you are doing trimming is out of your power and scoping on this case

1709453
jruby	mri
i use jruby on windows currently but still fallback to mri on windows to checked behavior which is something you ll get used to

this will recursively exclude all .svn directory from the various source folder

1710938
32-bit	64bit
i have two applications running on w2k8 r2 x64 one is compiled as 64bit and the other one as 32-bit as it has com dependencies

1710949
global-assembly-cache	gac
if an assembly is install in the global-assembly-cache it s easier to go to c windows assembly and find it in the list of gac assemblies

1710953
contains	any
a visit from the inspectors is scheduling whenever any code is checked in contains unpleasant construct

1710959
stderr	stdout
you can use system.setout and system.seterr to redirect stdout and stderr to instances of printstream

1710963
shell	bash
bin sh is often a different shell interpreter than bash

1710968
deployment	install
we also use sharepoint install between the two a lot of the problems whether stemming from human error or otherwise in deployment like your problem have been resolved in our environment

1710976
.when	ready
it will work if execute .when the document is ready

1710990
aggregate-functions	sum
for aggregate-functions sum stdev etc.. you have to pull all data into application layer and calculate or maintain aggregate entities which updates on each data insert updates

1710994
radio-button	selected
i have an html form with a selected list and a radio-button both of which are initially set with disabled true

1710994
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and google-chrome but in firefox the elements remains disabled

1710994
click	mouse
it appears to be enabled but doesn t respond to mouse click

1710996
selected	button
selected the code parts and click on the code sample button in the editor toolbar

1711031
binary-operators	operands
infix and postfix are notations for binary-operators and their operands

1711047
primitive	int
the problem is that switching per the specifications only works with primitive int etc and strings

1711047
dictionary	map
note that string is handled via a dictionary map to an int

1711056
controllers	routes
it s hard to say exactly since you have posted very little supporting details for your question but my guess is that your routes file is set up such that the precedence of something matching controllers action id comes before the route you re aiming for controllers id action

1711056
restart	reload
i have seen some situations in the past where route changes reload in development mode confuse the router code which is usually fixed by restart the server

1711061
asp.net-mvc	wcf
should i close the service client proxy explicit as i do in my asp.net-mvc application calling wcf service synchronous

1711100
append	input
and subsequently checked the innerhtml of the append input it does not even contains a named properties at all

1711106
onmousedown	onmousemove
the one clever thing we do if i may say .so myself is to pre-populate two sparse-matrix arrays with snapping coordinates onmousedown .so that they are easy fast cheap to lookup onmousemove

1711124
textbox	button
for example it would be very easy to modify this textbox behavior to fire an icommand on every key press instead of click a button on enter

1711147
svnadmin	dump
use svnadmin dump to do a backup then libcurl to ftp upload

1711169
versioning	migrate
make sure you can migrate from one versioning to the next - think long-term backup

1711169
versioning	upgrade
for example if your server is upgrade from versioning 1.4 to 1.5 or to 1.6 it s interesting to make a dump then a load of your repositories to take full advantage of the improvements

1711187
virtual-method	destructor
it s worth noting that if you have even one virtual-method you lose nothing with most compilers making the destructor virtual as well but it will protect you in case somebody extends later

1711205
contains	set
consider an entity entry that contains a collections of another entity many-to-many category such that the entry can be associated with a given category no more than once implying a set and constrained by the database and the order of the category entities within the collections is fixed and is defined by an extra field on the mapping table implying a list

1711205
value	field
since a doesn t use an and we can easily maintain uniqueness of the category entities in the application layer as opposed to using nhibernate for this using seems to make sense since it will automatically handle the updates of the order value in the extra field on the mapping table which is the biggest feature i d like to use

1711205
mapping	unique	updating	updates
unfortunately .when updating the collections we encounter constraint violations due to the manner in which nhibernate performs the updates even .when the new collections value wouldn t ultimately cause a constraint violation since we have a unique on the database between the related object in the mapping table

1711205
contains	elements
on load of entry #555 its category list will contains the following elements

1711205
updating	updates
it seems that what really needs to happen is that the entryid and categoryid are left alone and the index value are updates instead of leaving the entryid and index value alone and updating the categoryid value

1711224
uiscrollview	subviews
personally i wouldn t use a uiscrollview - i would just subclassing uiview and deal with dragging myself positioning the uiview subviews as the touch move events occur

1711225
scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala
i m not sure if that s true for scala but coming from ocaml haskell it seems right.

1711228
selected	checkbox
if you updates a checkbox you need to selected another item before you can relocate the edited item in the list

1711243
boolean	int
a given value of enum int boolean or string types can only be one value .so it makes sense to switching on such a value

1711249
malloc	free
at least they overload malloc free to tracking leaks .so it seems as usable points to add anything you want

1711256
contains	any
it was then it occurred that perhaps a better solution to the problem would be capture a grid s table html markup and alter that - this would in effect mean that the solution could be applied to absolutely any control that rendering table markup and any templates controls contains within it would continue to work

1711256
contains	any
i originally wanted to make a templates server control that if any control was placed inside it would checked it s markup output and pivot any tables contains within it

1711263
debugging	trace
use xcode building settings to change the trace level which controls how much trace gets compiled into the product there are release and debugging building configuration

1711285
derived-class	base-class
the following example show an instances of a derived-class referenced through a base-class pointers

1711289
screens	tablet
it turns out that on tablet pcs you have to turn off hardware-acceleration for flash to go full screens

1711300
capitalization	capitalize
capitalization will be based on how you capitalize your directory named control named - but in either case should highlight appropriately

1711301
rar	zip
sharpziplib might help i m not sure if they support rar but you can compress the files in other formats i.e zip

1711307
put	get
but if you still want to avoid frame and put the contents into a div with the id externalconent you could request the stylesheets the same way you get the other contents and prefix every rules in them with #externalcontent

1711327
home-directory	tmp
.when i execute a scala scripting from the command-line a directory named tmp is created in my home-directory

1711328
contains	any
your class contains any virtual-method

1711328
protected	public
regarding public or protected - in general it is more question of how you intend to control access to destructor

1711342
contains	elements
the operations that must be made in the webpage are not all done at the same time .so we must get .some kind of snapshot of the interesting text elements we do this on the mac versioning of our .app by returning a string contains an xml representation of those elements

1711346
json	xml
could you tell me if there is a class i know oop i can use to read an external xml or json file

1711353
firebird	mysql
because we re using a few different systemd in a variery of versioning interbase versioning 4 and above firebird mysql my orm wrapper class not sure what to call it is bound to grow big

1711353
derived-class	base-class
write one base-class and write one derived-class per rdbms possibly per versioning if the features differ a lot between them

1711353
base-class	inherited
on the other hand with every rdbms using it s own set of php functions i m not sure how much there would be to inherited from a base-class

1711358
show	next
show a c# or vb .app next to the same .app written in ironpython

1711368
designated-initializer	initializer
the designated-initializer is - id initwithx andy and you call it from other initializer

1711369
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
to launchd a system32 located 64bit .app from a 32-bit .app at least on vista 2k8 7 doesn t work on x64 xp or 2k3 run it from the sysnative directory c windows sysnative telnet.exe alternatively disable wow64 but that is generally a bad idea

1711409
click	mouse
there s been some great stuff in the past like how making button bigger is directly proportionate to their likelihood of being click how mouse movement impacted design etc

1711413
xsd	xml
this xsd will only allow one transactional header and multiple transactional-items in an xml file

1711419
firefox	safari
the strange thing is that a it is not occuring at all in firefox or safari - ok is that really .so strange

1711420
value	field
also use square brackets instead of a period .when the field named is a value instead of the actual identifier like here

1711445
quirks-mode	doctype
the doctype needs to be the first thing after the http-headers or ie goes into quirks-mode and doesn t understand the margins auto jazz

1711447
linux	unix
but if you required unicode support you are out of luck on linux mac os x - the odbc drivers for sql-server in unix are in varied stage of unicode compliance

1711455
firefox	safari
this seems to work in safari 4 though i couldn t get it to play with firefox 3.5

1711479
buffering	streaming
typically any streaming will not read information from its source until it is requested by the user of the streaming other than some extra over-reading to allow for buffering to occur which makes streaming usage much faster

1711484
shopping-cart	cart
2 shopping-cart link checkout cart

1711484
logout	login
5 login logout you need to have a small bit of php code on every page to access the magento session and then depending on where it s at rendering the appropriate link

1711486
configuration	environment	any	set
i m trying to get an environment configure .so anyone who checked out the code will have the database automatically instead of having to spend time configuring it before they can write any code basically a situation like ruby-on-rails has where you can have .somebody new checkout the code and maybe with .some minor configuration types rake db create and rake db migrate and have the entire working environment set up

1711490
boolean	int
.so far i ve been returning either nothing an int or a boolean to java via the jni interface

1711491
fwrite	fopen
you can use fopen and fwrite instead

1711506
tuples	set
superkey - a superkey is defined in relational-model as a set of attributes of a relation variables relvar for which it holds that in all relations assign to that variables there are no two distinct tuples rows that have the same value for the attributes in this set

1711514
profiling	trace
i got the following trace using sql profiling

1711532
firefox	safari
however .when testing on safari and firefox the service always returns -1

1711558
contains	elements	contains	any
then you can defined a new elements of complex types that can contains any numbers of transactional headers

1711559
32-bit	64bit
turns out my c# .app was 64bit which is c# visual-studio default and my c++ dll was 32-bit which is c++ visual-studio default

1711575
updating	updates
.when i realize that a pending updates will be updating both sql recording and recording in the third party sdk i am creating a transactionscope with a 0 presumably infinite timeout although i ve also tried 12 hours as a timespan parameter

1711582
sql-server	mysql
this is what i would do in a ms sql-server but i guess same optimization can be used in mysql too

1711583
order	join
do you have all the obvious single-column indexes on the field you join on the field in your where-clause and the created_at field you order by

1711588
.net	wcf
i have a .net c# class-library dll that call a wcf web service

1711589
push	pull
then you copy your work into it and hg push and hg pull to sync between the google repository

1711590
javascript	dom
it basically boils down to letting the javascript code fire an asynchronous request a request in the background .so that the client don t see any flash of content to the server side and eventually traversal change elements in the html dom tree which is accessible through the document object in javascript after receiving the response

1711590
javascript	dom
let those javascript functions fire an asynchronous request to the server with the messages id and the vote status up or down and change the elements representing the numbers accordingly by traversal the html dom

1711595
.net	wcf
use the wcf svcutil.exe utility with the dconly switching instead of xsd.exe - this will attempt to create a class based on the wcf datacontractserializer which can handle a few things better than the standards .net xmlserializer

1711597
logout	login
i d start with only monitor the audit login and audit logout events that can be found under the security audit event category

1711605
joomla	drupal
if your site is contrarily a small-scale one with standards functionality plus a few custom bits maybe wordpress joomla could fit your needs better not because they are less powerful but because drupal strengths would be unused in this case while wordpress joomla simpler architecture would probably represent an advantage in this scenario

1711605
cakephp	django
other options would certainly be frameworks like cakephp or django for example but that - imo - is a totally different approach to the matter i would say

1711607
chown	sudo
i hate to accept my own answer after kyle gave such a good response but i don t need the pythonpath fix to make it work now that i did sudo chown -r +r opt google_appengine google_appengine_1.2.7

1711622
push	pull
for #3 to updates you local copy hg pull -u and to commit your change hg commit followed by hg push

1711648
alignment	layout	alignment	spacing	spacing	layout
i don t think any of them can be considered as being correct but they will give you a good baseline idea as to what is expected in general as far as basic theory such as alignment spacing and widget layout goes

1711655
version-control	git	perforce	git
a good file-wise organization would allow you to tracking changes to it using version-control software such as subversion perforce git etc

1711658
internationalization	translation
translation systemd - this is pretty complex simply because internationalization is fricking hard to do

1711658
postgresql	mysql
database restrictions - as of drupal 6 database support is mysql or postgresql only using a drupal specific abstraction layer which obviously isn t one

1711663
.when	ready
inside your meaning it is execute .when the document is ready

1711664
object-reference	instances
the following code that s supposed to create an object for connection to a database throw an exception-handling saying object-reference not set to an instances of an object. and points to conn .when i try to run the program

1711698
value	field
you could use hidden field on the calling page to store any value you need for your callback

1711698
value	field
the popup can use window.open to store the value in these hidden field

1711699
strtok	atoi	strtok	strdup	getline	strtok	getline	atoi	strdup	atoi
getline strtok strdup atoi

1711705
restart	reload
if you re using a standards wsgi module such as apache s mod_wsgi then you don t have to restart the server -- just touch the .wsgi file and the code will be reload

1711725
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout functions are being called inconsistently .when a user move the mouse quickly through the list over the child elements

1711725
mouseover	mouseout
here are the mouseover and mouseout functions

1711730
base-class	inherited
at its heart it is a content presenter that we dump the viewmodel into and it handles the wiring for closing the windows - for example on data context change you can checked if the new viewmodel is inherited from your base-class and if it is subscribe to the relevant close event the handler will assign the dialog result

1711741
revision	svn
if you use svn you might want to have a look at the svn revision labeller

1711753
type-parameter	return-type
the in angle brackets is known as the generics type-parameter whereas the t directly preceeding the methods named is the return-type

1711757
python	java
you can write your query in python or java then use the task-queue to execute it across a very large dataset and pick up the results asynchronously .when they re done

1711761
attributes	properties
the examples i have found use properties in the page class for the dependency marked with an attributes which the injection framework resolves

1711762
linux	bsd
try netem for linux or dummynet for bsd

1711772
hashmap	arrays
this class should use less memory than an hashmap since it uses a primitive arrays no boxing needed it needs only for double s or for float s

1711801
value	field
i need to turn a date object into a calendar in java and try to access its field value for hour_of_day

1711811
calayer	uiview
the rea.son this is .so is because uiview assumes that if a calayer s delegation is a uiview then that calayer belongs to the uiview and the uiview is part of the hierarchy

1711811
calayer	uiview
however if you create your own calayer and assign the delegation to be the uiview the uiview will end up calling itself as part of the recursion

1711840
selected	checkbox
if you right click on the database in the object explorer panels and selected the delete task from the context menu there is a checkbox which to close existing connections

1711856
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i assume it may be possible via a pagefactory implementation but since most on the edges right now are moving to asp.net-mvc rather than webforms that may not happen

1711856
webforms	asp.net	attributes	properties
however autofac a di containers i like a lot has an integration module for asp.net webforms that does properties injection without attributes - your code would look like this

1711917
base-class	inherited
in our homegrown mvp-framework we had a typed base-class that all pages inherited from

1711920
selected	cell
.so the myobject cell .when selected pushes the myobject viewcontroller

1711920
selected	cell
the yourobject cell .when selected pushes the yourobject viewcontroller

1711930
stax	sax
then eventually stax came out which is definitely an improvement over sax in that it works in pull mode like compilers always have

1711932
put	get
but if i take acts_as_taggable and put it into a module that class a include i get an error

1711964
jquery	.post
i was using this serialization as a jquery data arg for a .post and one of my hidden form field was empty

1711972
defined	declare
if the child class is not fully defined before the owner class it would have to be forwarding declare and can only be include as a pointers

1711999
progress-bar	progress
a while ago i asked for some help about setting up a progress-bar to show to the user how much progress has been made on the given set of files and folder

1711999
mta	sta
i also tried changing the attributes also from sta to mta

1712007
revision	updates
to fix it use the updates to revision menu item in tortoisesvn and selected the depth fully recursive

1712020
django-haystack	xapian
my advice is mostly related to django-haystack in general since i don t have experience with xapian as a backend

1712020
django-haystack	xapian
installing xapian from the django-haystack

1712026
contains	any
it does not appear to contains any delimiters that would enable one to reliably locate the pickle diff boundaries

1712036
required	checked
files include with required are only loaded at runtime whereas package loaded with use are subject to earlier compile-time checked

1712052
output	cat
the backticks execute the cat list.txt cmd and use the output of that cmd as part of the cmd-line to cp

1712052
output	cat	spaces	output
newline in the output of cat are collapse to spaces before command-line substitution

1712076
updating	updates
also the -_redisplay methods disables reenables screens updates updating geometry and the background while this occurs

1712078
sql-server	mysql
the rowcount variables is a microsoft sql-server feature and is not supported in mysql

1712078
triggers	insert
this often has unintended effects like creating a new auto-increment id violating references from dependent tables and firing delete and insert triggers in a confusing way

1712118
javascript	dom
back in the days of 56k modems i used to write javascript functions client side and then used ajax before it was called ajax to pass down just the value not the description and then use the client side to building up elements in the dom this proved about 20 more efficient but left me thinking if anyone would invent html shorthand

1712126
getter	setter
in firefox you can use javascript 1.5+ s getter and setter to defined x and y properties that square their value on assignment eg.

1712159
implements	extends
then your real class simply extends your mystream class implements the two or three remaining methods that you really need

1712160
margins	padding
if you get rid of absolute positioning and use other methods of elements positioning margins padding floats its likely that your page will rendering better in ie6 ie7

1712163
show	next
i need to show an image next to about 6 textboxes...i dont want to use div tags as these vary in positioning with ie firefox etc

1712175
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
if you want to show hide the validation marks maybe you can have them all declare in the html next to you textbox like this

1712175
hide	show
and show them or hide them with this jquery code

1712176
javadoc	doxygen
here s a question comparing javadoc and doxygen

1712183
contains	elements
then everytime you add an elements that contains a classname of mypanels the mouseover event will be attached to it

1712219
nested-class	inherited
what s the proper way to inherited from a templates class with the templates arguments being a nested-class within the inheriteding class

1712230
nested-class	inherited
if you really have to inherited from you ll have to move the nested-class declaration out of someclass

1712247
contains	any
replace the usages of any with contains in your query

1712247
contains	elements
it looks backwards but it s correct- it ll generator an in operators for each field inside a contains with all the elements in searchterms

1712250
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
google-wave did this and came up with a great product that works cross browser firefox google-chrome safari opera

1712282
fopen	fread
i tried fread and fopen for file2 but neither work

1712339
document	editing
editing document with multiple users

1712344
browser-cache	caching
you cannot reset browser-cache even if you would sometimes it will not be sufficient because caching can occur not only on the server and or client but also on any numbers of nodes your response goes through on its way from your server to your client

1712347
haskell	python	stderr	stdout
i want to do a popen python subprocess.communicate from haskell - start a program give it stdin and get its stdout stderr

1712366

1712383
where-clause	sql
if i paste the full sql statement with the where-clause into a regular query like .so

1712398
administration	account
.when i run this using the administration account it works ok

1712398
administration	account
i want to create a windows user account for impersonation that will only execute these web provisioning procedure without being identical to a server s administration roles

1712400
contains	set
then in the second snippet jquery.fn is set to be an extended versioning of the jquery object itself contains all the actual methods

1712413
return-value	arguments
you d want to specify your arguments your return-value etc

1712421
ftp	scp
scp ftp upload this zip to the remote-server

1712421
directory	folder
unzip the files or upload individual files folder to directory configure by iis management

1712442
any	set
basically the magic for what you want to do comes down to the following methods that i use in our image class any class properties are set elsewhere but you can just hardcode these value if you need to

1712444
arrays	loops
this is my loops but i have trouble formatting the arrays properly

1712446
spring.net	ninject
other good di frameworks include spring.net and ninject

1712455
aggregate-functions	aggregation
if you want to use aggregate-functions min max count you need to provide mysql with information on which columns to perform the aggregation on

1712467
perl	php
i know google-analytics and the big named in php and perl based traffic analysis

1712469
revision	svn
we have a history of release and can explicit control versioning for each solution project by setting the revision numbers on each svn external

1712486
web-services	api
for web-services in java sun came out with their initial api where everything was very manual then apache came out with the axis project which initially could create only static stubs then jax-ws came out which supported annotations

1712497
bison	yacc
because c syntax is context-sensitive it very difficult if not impossible to parsing using traditional parsingr-generator tools such as yacc bison whereas pascal syntax is easy to parsing using the same tools

1712504
z-index	overlay
the only remaining issue is to set the z-index to overlay the input and change it after click .so it s underneath the form input not sure if that s possible - i don t like reading docs

1712511
environment	execution
it s currently only supported by firefox 3.x and other mozilla-derived javascript execution environment

1712516
jquery	.post
whenever i move this jquery .post inside the click function it sometimes works but most of the time does not

1712532
division	modulo
after performing the division you will need to store the result back to the timeval probably making use of the remainder after division or modulo x y

1712552
double	int
.when you re working with plain old data types int double you can divide

1712554
value	field
once you know what field to look at pull one of the value from that field from the properties data and put that in-place

1712562
getter	setter
i mean i get why they do it maybe later on they want to validation the data in the setter or increment it in the getter

1712562
getter	setter
why are getter and setter .so loved .when they are unneeded

1712567
firefox	safari
that native json encoder decode is already available in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and ie8

1712569
getter	setter
here s a nice long .so discussion on the subject why use getter and setter

1712585
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
this means that just like the majority of programmers do not look at assembly code on a regular basis but instead rely on compilers to convert from languages of a higher level of abstraction several javascript frameworks and libs such as gwt dojo extjs or jquery etc

1712592
put	get
i gather that this may have something to do with the arrays size being a variables i don t get this messages .when i put an int literals there like

1712597
getter	setter
if you don t need validation then you don t need a getter and setter you re absolutely right

1712604
ubuntu	linux
i m imagining something like a website where you can input rudimentary code or a browser add-on or even just a standalone application that step you through lisp something that runs on linux ubuntu

1712613
platform	gpl
for game opengl is a c api and is the standards for 3d graphic programming in multi-platform development not uniquely microsoft platform and quake 3 which the engine id tech 3 is available in gpl is also writen in c

1712624
updating	updates
this updates appears to be updating the primary key as well

.when i return various other datatypes longs int boolean ...etc to the ie javascript it works fine with the propertyget methods

1712842
hash	md5
and why are you doing an md5 hash on it

1712849
32-bit	64bit
this should provide a way to modify the 64bit key from a 32-bit process but you will need to write code wither in c or c# or do it through wmi

1712852
core-animation	core-graphics
for this one definitely core-graphics and core-animation

1712862

suppose i m writing assembly code for a cpu whose only atomicity operation is an unconditional swap -- no ll sc no compare-and-swap just plain swap

1712863
decrement	increment
an arm9 would be an example of such a beast. is there a way to perform atomicity increment decrement operations using the swap operation

1712863
decrement	increment
there is a relatively easy answer which is to use the swap to building a spinlock and use that to provide a critical-section around ordinary increment and decrement

1712871
common-lisp	lisp
i stole the brackets key because they re used .so infrequently in emacs lisp and common-lisp

1712934
binary	hex
however since the character data in there is actually just a hex representation of a 160 bit numbers i thought it might be better to store it as binary 20

1712936
value	field
for me ajax is useful .when you what to error trap some field to get concrete value a disadvantage is people can see your code through javascript pages

1712946
binary	hex
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text-editor etc

1712947
python	java
i can do it in java python haskell.

1712957
short	base
even with the alphanumeric and case-sensitive restrictions base 36 obviously provides a much more compact representation than decimal allowing for short and arguably clean-looking ids

1712997
silverlight	wpf
there is also the nuigroup forum c# .net silverlight wpf section that should help you out a lot

1713005
spaces	output
since the hashing algos all output a fixed length you can save yourself some spaces there

1713020

freebsd	linux	opensolaris	freebsd	opensolaris	linux
what are some of the major pro con of freebsd vs gnu linux vs opensolaris

1713221
linked-list	nodes
because a linked-list has to navigate nodes by nodes to get anywhere in the list save the front and probably the back depending on implementation it makes sense that the numbers are .so high

1713221
linked-list	nodes
for add insert remove in a large linked-list you would have a lot of hopping from nodes to nodes to get to the correct spot

1713221
linked-list	nodes
because of the speed of not having to hop from nodes to nodes i always default to arraylist instead of linked-list

1713226
getter	setter
getter setter are of course good practice but they are tedious to write and even worse to read

1713226
getter	setter
how many time have we read a class with half a dozen member variables and accompanying getter setter each with the full hog param return html encode famously useless comment like get the value of x set the value of x get the value of y set the value of y get the value of z set the value of zzzzzzzzzzzzz

1713231
xsd	xml
the xsd describing this xml will have a complex types with the mixed attributes set to true

but rather than starting with an xsd perhaps i should be defining my data as a typed dataset first and then let the readxml writexml methods take care of what the xml looks like

1713235
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
the last place i worked was primarily a c++ shop and before i was hired my boss who was the director of research and development had issued a decree that dynamic-memory-allocation is not allowed

1713893
libavcodec	ffmpeg
i would use ffmpeg libavcodec actually to do the video decoding

1713902

getter	setter
as an alternative you could create your own registry .so that you can make it s content more explicit by defining your own getter and setter

1714074
cvs	git
we still use cvs i use git and hg for my personal use though i m still a novice at both but i realize they re much more modern and better faster distribute etc

1714074
cvs	git
it s just everyone is .so accustomed to cvs that i feel a whole slew of issues could arise if i were to be the one that recommended and actually did the upgrading porting transitioning of our current cvs server to git or hg

1714077
web-services	api
programmableweb has a whole list of api s web-services you can play with

we cant use it like what we normally do on sql-server-express for example managing data using sql-server management studio

1714097
constructor	object
if you use new and an explicit classname the wrong approach above 1 you must provide initialization data sms-gateway address for the object in each methods 2 you have to edit your controllers code in case-classname or constructor signature changes and 3 your cannot temporary replace sms object dependent on a conditional dummysms for testing on your local machine

1714098
version-control	git
i came across this great site why git is better than x i thought i d add it to this answer for other people thinking of switching to git for version-control

block elements can contains block and or inline elements while inline elements can only contains other inline including inline-block such as elements

1714181
deployment	install
other options if you really want clients to run executable would be to look at something like .net click once deployment where you can publishing an executable to your site and clients can then downloading and install from the site this comes with the advantages of things like automatic updates

1714185
firefox	safari
.so either your clients trust you and install you firefox ie safari etc. extensions or .

1714200

a side benefit is that it allows you to deploy application updates to all users simply by updating the repository copy on your site - updates are pulled automagically

1714247
contains	any
all runtimeexception can be throw by any code without the contains methods needing to declare it in the throw clause

1714247
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception exist .so that you don t have to declare every single methods to throw nullpointerexception etc

1714257
required	checked
the exception-handling unintentional pun is runtimeexception-handling which is a subclassing of exception-handling that is not checked and any classes you subclassing from runtimeexception-handling or its subclassinging will not required checked

1714273
actionscript	mxml
i suppose the reasoning probably has more to do with editing as the mxml editor validation your code against a schema to checked syntax and provide context help as well parsing your actionscript code for syntax and context help

1714282
country-codes	iso
your natural key ought to be stable never change ok with iso country-codes this is almost a given - except .when countries like yugoslavia or the ussr collapse or other like the two germanies unite - but that s rare enough

put	get
the best guess i have is that maybe the index fell behind although i had assumed that if i get a successful return from put then the indexes are updates

1715181
swing	awt
for an awt swing application you need to use non-standard applicationcontext class which could change at any time

i m not quite sure if this is what you re asking but md5 is 128 bits 32 hex digits while sha-1 is 160 bits 40 hex digits .so it s fairly easy to tell the difference between them providing of course that you know that your hash will be either md5 or sha-1 and not .something else

1715259
hash	md5
if you re asking whether you can determine if a given md5 hash is a hash of a hash or a hash of some other data then i believe the answer is no .

well an md5 hash is really just binary-data - if you ve got a string then it s presumably encode in some fashion base64 or hex

1715457
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
.so you most likely have had issues with firefox opera google-chrome and safari you did not know about

it feels like ms is trying to phase out support for vba in powerpointsince they dropped macros recording in versioning 2007 and the object-model lacks some key features support

1715496
google-chrome	firefox
even if it doesn t work in every browser though that would be ideal even just firefox google-chrome would be excellent

1715500
value	field
the cause of it is that by default asp.net verifies that the submitted value in each form field are the ones it sent to the page originally

1715503
children	nodes
now we have to keep tracking of all the children of nodes a b c and d

1715503
children	nodes
if each nodes has exactly 2 children off of it and each nodes has the same cost then the equation is 2 n where n is the depth of the search .so far

1715503
children	nodes
at the worse case with a depth of 4 the equation is 2 4 where 2 is the numbers of children each nodes has and 4 is the depth of the search

1715508
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
if you want to bind all items in the collections you need to use an itemscontrol with an itemtemplate and itemspanel

in subviews 1 i load the dataobject from the nsuserdefaults and present the information this works then the user can edit the data in this case a nsstring describing a company named .when the user presses the back button in the topbar to return to view 1 it triggers a save this also works

1715552
multi-module	subproject
while it would be great if it would go down to the javac level our multi-module project would benefit from being able to distribute each maven 2 subproject to a different machine

1715552
packaging	building
tying into maven might actually be better as that would make it possible to distribute tests and packaging which often take a significant portion of our building time.

1715563
return-value	arguments
this is a pointers to a function that takes unspecified arguments and has no return-value

1715566
.when	ready
this is called building automation and yes it s very desirable if the best bits of the project get ready to ship .when someone makes a change but no necessary

it is a known issue that document.implementation.createdocument isn t implements on safari google-chrome webkit .so you ll likely have to re.sort to loading the content in an iframe and accessing the contentdocument object of the iframe

1715613
msbuild-task	msbuild
we re using cruisecontrol.net 1.4.4.83 but .when an msbuild-task fails we don t get the msbuild results missing file or whatever reason the compile failed in the email notification

1715632
filesystems	file-io
the filesystems looks ok but we get the same problem with the files and directory if we include a java class which uses the basic java file-io

1715634
asp.net-mvc	wcf
you could then shared both your dal and bll between the asp.net-mvc site your model would be a facade to the bll object and your wcf service thus centralizing all of your logic into a central location

1715665
default	reset
our bugged users reset their ie8 prefereces to default

1715667
nstextview	nswindow
thereâ s really no complication except mapping positioning properly which is easy to do with the coordinate-space conversions available on nstextview and nswindow

1715692
xsd	xml
cxf would impertinently try to wrap the xml into a javax.xml.bind.jaxbelements invoke the service and fail with an illegalargumentexception in the reflection api because the service of course does not accept a jax-rs-specific elements but rather the searchrequest elements that i defined in my xsd before

1715716
panels	grid
i ve tried this with many different kind of panels grid etc

1715728
.when	ready

1715745
joomla	drupal
have a look at drupal or joomla expect a learning curve nevertheless

1715766
pixels	line
the hard and slow way to draw a line would be to evaluate the line equation at each x value on your arrays of pixels

1715766
pixels	line
first ddas take advantage of the fact that at least one pixels is known the start of the line

1715766
pixels	line
from that pixels the ddas calculate the next pixels in the line until they reach the endpoint of the line

1715766
pixels	line
second ddas take advantage of the fact that along either the x or y axis the next pixels in the line is always the next int value towards the end of the line

1715769
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
use may want to use an inspector tool like firebug for firefox or the one include one in safari or google-chrome

1715791

selected	button
after click on the button it appears selected the ellipse turns into an ugly blue rectangle

1715807
scheme	elisp
the current pre-release supports ecmascript as well as scheme and there is apparently an elisp branch also but i haven t looked into it

1716002
progress-bar	progress
i want the tabs styled the way they are currently but want to have the progress-bar styled differently full border solid progress meter

1716006
contains	elements	display	width
if you dont want the line break you can change the display properties to inline which should align them horizontally as long as there is enough width in the parent elements to contains both divs

1716009
32-bit	64bit
now even if you are talking about 10 .net char elements than if it s in memory you have .some object overhead that was already mentioned and a bit of alignment overhead on 32-bit systemd everything has to be aligned to 4 bytes boundary in 64bit the rules are more complicated .so you may have .some empty bytes at the end

1716013
printf	scanf
i guess it s a scanf issue and i know this function could be replace by a safer one but this example is for beginners knowing just about printf scanf if-else and loops

1716041
triggers	insert	value	field
using the database use a triggers on the insert to increment a field value

1716049
google-earth	arcgis
anyway it seems like it does everything that s required it will import a kml file meaning that you can use any arcgis shape or anything exported via google-earth it allows to use that as map base .so no need to connect to an external tile server it allows to draw on map and handle events.

1716080
contains	set
in the control we have set a field that contains the default language and a proprety lang that set the language

1716083

1716083
windows-server	windows
ie8 on multiple machines at home work fine both windows-server 2008 and windows 7

1716089
contains	any
you will have to iterate on rows columns keeping in mind the max rows columns the spreadsheet can hold and checked whether the cell contains any value

1716096
append	input
in each state you can append the characters you read to a stringbuilder and that way find each types of string in your input

1716097
strtol	strtok
it s a better idea to just read whole line in with fgets and then working on them with functions like strtok and strtol which btw will correctly parsing int and tell you exactly where the invalid characters begin

1716106
environment	building
since you can still target .net 3.0 or .net 3.5 having .net 3.5 install on your building machine should not have any impact on the target environment

1716153
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
yes if the superclass s code changes drastically by altering methods signature you ll have to revise the subclassing as well -- that s part of the price of inherited

exception-handling	try-catch
i have a blog entry that show how to properly use transactionalal and try-catch blocks including nested transactionalal to revert only the failed procedure call work .so that the calee can resume a different path and continue the transactional if it feels like exception-handling and nested transactionalal

1716241
scala	java
as far as i do understand the intent of this language is to replace c++ not java scala viewmodel languages

1716250
base-class	inherited
assign the css class to the inherited cssclass properties instead and let the base-class handle the rendering

1716251
.net	wcf
see my related question nunit tests that call .dlls that call wcf web-services .net c#

1716254
parser-generator	antlr
if you want to understand compiler-theory use antlr and concentrate on the principles leaving the implementation for the parser-generator

1716255
virtual-machine	vmware
you should really consider just install a virtual-machine using vmware if possible

1716255
put	get
although if you get start properly with a good book pragmatic defacto ruby-on-rails book 3rd edition is a good choice you will never put that one down even after .so long as the references are just too useful

1716257
sql-server-express	sql-server
as far as i know you cannot do this inside visual-studio however - you will need to use sql-server management studio or the express versioning of it for sql-server-express databases

1716294
compact-framework	.net
i want to downgrade a windows-mobile application made with .net compact-framework 3.5 to .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2

1716297
firefox	safari
now that works fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

1716312
channelfactory	wshttpbinding
ps i think you should be fine now - you create the wshttpbinding and it uses all the default as in the configuration and you defined your endpoints address to points to the server where your service is hosted and in the channelfactory you specify the contract being used - that s all there is

1716314
user-controls	ascx
while i understand and respect the use of user-controls for enabling code-reuse entire pages built-in an ascx just feels incredibly wrong

1716322
fflush	stdout
to immediately fflush call ffflush stdout or ffflush null null means fflush everything

1716324
fflush	stdout
or you can fflush stdout .when you want to

1716329
value	field
why not embed the total-page count field into a formula field then get the value of the formula field

1716334
any	set
alternatively i d be happy if i could get those recording into a sqldatareader or any other way to read them and do more with them other than just display in my repeater again looking for the recording from that page that i set as the datasource on my repeater

1716349
selected	cell
to make the usedrange properties valid again simply selected all the rows and columns after your last cell .so all the blank cell and go edit- delete

1716365
value	field
but your transaction_id field should be long enough to store value generator this way some char ... types

1716370
contains	elements
that is the destination should contains elements which are to be overwrite by the source list

1716394
rollback	commit
since you can look at the jmsdeliverycount .when the messages has entered the bean before you process it -- consider commit scoping and you can see that it has had a couple of rollback already send the messages around to a staging queue but attach the destination queue named in the jms properties .so you can use it later

1716403
contains	elements
how can i create a new arrays that contains all elements numbers nth to n+k th from an old arrays

1716413

the user-input his her gmail login information inside a form i then send this information to an ajax page where i authentication and fetch all the contact if the login is invalid they can try again but if it authentication i need to send them to the next page where i parsing all the email and checked if they match any users on the site

1716439
subclassing	base-class
with regards to problem 3 you cannot overrides a methods returning a base-class with a methods returning an subclassing

1716443
filtering	sorting
also sorting and filtering are two completely different things

1716443
filtering	sorting
you talk about sorting in the question title and first paragraph but your question is about filtering

1716456
python	lua	lisp	lua
is there a viewmodel for lisp like lua and python or am i in the wrong mindset

1716473
updating	updates
the syntax for updating one table from another table is describe in detail in the updates chapter of the postgresql documentation

1716483
any	set
i ve not had any problems like you describe .so i d really like to see a bare-bones set of code that repros this

1716509
getter	setter
the retain assign copy qualifiers on the properties declaration are about how the memory for the properties value is managed in the getter and setter that the compiler synthesizes for you

1716513
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 firefox and google-chrome do not do an options request and therefore never have a problem

1716542
value	field
even with auto_increment_increment 1 you are not guaranteed that the autoincrement field in the table will have consecutive value what if the rows are deleted hmm

1716542
triggers	insert
edit2 anyway this can be solved by an on insert triggers

1716552
scheme	lisp
unless you need the whole of lisp you may want to settle rather on a scheme implementation like guile which is meant to be incorporated into another program

1716553
constructor	object
luke beat me to tell you about copy constructor to answer your other questions passing a large object by value has a performance impact .when compared to passing by reference make it a const if the function won t change it as in this case

1716560
contains	any
i haven t done this myself .so i m not ab.solutely sure it would work the class cannot contains any other data that s for sure

1716560
updating	updates
and the file is really not updates until you fflush it thus writing data and updating the file length

1716561
value	field
we are using a custom api in our project which provide an attributes for class field members which lets the interface to present a pop-up of some range value like on off and pass the corresponding value of the choice to our code

1716561
value	field
however as we know the field declaration do not allow dynamic value in the declaration

1716563
key-value	key
it seems it more confusing to then remove the static text add a key add the key-value in a properties file etc

1716601
value	field
then i got to thinking how if this were java i d probably set the initial field value .when declaring the instances variables or within the constructor

1716612
xsd	xml
i m leaning towards using the following regular expression extraction from the xsd for xml schema itself for identifying a time literals

1716615
put	get
if i screens scraper a form from a site secured with ssl and put that form on my site which is also secured by ssl do i still get the benefits of ssl

1716621

1716621
fflush	stdout
fflush stdout whenever you need it to using ffflush

1716632
callback	methods
if an after_initialize methods is defined in your model it gets called as a callback to new create find and any other methodss that generator instances of your model

1716632
callback	methods
also note you cannot use this callback like the others you must defined a methods named after_initialize like above for it to work

1716639
getter	setter
once i saw good java programmer article called .something like why setter getter are evil well i found it easily there is not .so much based on java itself

1716647
libxml2	lxml
currently i have 2 varieties lxml and libxml2 that both seem to work

1716647
libxml2	lxml
while pure performance based tests indicate that lxml comes on top applying stylesheets specifically libxml2 seems to have been used as defacto-standard for many other languages

1716653
http	ssl
nsurlconnection works by default with ssl and can access http sites

1716654
function-call	inline
don t worry about function-call overhead with optimizations turned on the compiler can inline them if they meet various criterion which i leave up to you to find out

1716654
contains	elements	contains	any
this is where you have to be careful of pointserss if any contains in an object that was pass-by-value because the pointsers will have been copy-paste as well .so it s very possible that more than one object will points to one elements in memory at a given time which could lead to memory-leaks corruption etc

1716673
credentials	security
i don t know if that s possible at all but do you really plan on hardcoding value like the url of the endpoint or stuff like security credentials and etc

1716692
radio-button	textbox
just wondering if there is a quick code short cut to get all textbox combobox and radio-button value in the current html page using php

1716707
32-bit	64bit
if you create two aix archive one 32-bit and one 64bit as follows

1716724
interpreter	runtime
this could be achieved easier with form inherited rather than attributes something is still going to have to interpreter the attributes at runtime to achieve the desired effect

1716730
any	set
my question is what is the purpose of defining a variables in the class definition in python if it seems like i can anyone set at any time any variables without doing .so

1716730
instances	self
as a purely stylistic matter it s shorter code as you don t have all those instances of self

1716730
python	c++
python classes don t have class static-variables like c++ does

1716741
bluetooth	usb
is there a mac os x bluetooth or usb api that s easy to work with specifically if you want to be able to access a connect iphone and send receive information

1716746
value	field
i m trying to set up an advanced search systemd on the client such that the user can say i want field properties foo1 to have value bar1 etc

1716747
callback	methods
if an after_initialize methods is defined in your model it gets called as a callback to new create find and any other methodss that generator instances of your model

1716749
windows-media-player	embed
1 page.aspx include an embed tag that puts a windows-media-player on the page

1716751
arp	tcp
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp messages is shorter than the arp refresh time

1716758
versioning	upgrade
they offer a free basic versioning which is really all that you need to begin and to even publishing a website but at only 79 i upgrade to their ultimate edition to show my support and i am still loving it

1716782
instances	destroy
if the classic pages are not requested again before the session-timeout has been reached the instances will be destroy

1716786
midi	osc
you can google up a better description of osc but suffice it to say that it allows you to send control data to synths built-in these environment similar to how midi works but way more extensive

1716786
environment	building
this does not solve the problem of actually building synths in python per se but it allows you to drive these other environment without having to know the ins and outs of the language

1716804
contains	lookup
this will allow to get rid of the key lookup since the index contains all data which will make order by datetime as fast as that on id

1716816
expression-blend	silverlight
i am trying to modify a datagrid in expression-blend 3 using silverlight 3 tools

1716823
contains	any
also printf 3 page contains even better example of va_list based call infrastructure around vsnprintf 3 you can get to this page using any of printf variants named

1716826
background-image	transparency
the solution is not to use transparency on the background-image

1716841
value	field
if your datetime field contains a lot of distinct-value and those value rarely change defined a clustered index on the datetime field this will sort the actual data by the datetime value

1716853
python	c++	python	java
there is a growing rebellion against cumbersome type-systems like those of java and c++ pushing people towards dynamically typed languages such as python and javascript

1716857
directory	folder
there you can tell which folder from your project should be copy-paste live to what directory on your machine the tomcat webapps yourapp

1716862
show	next
.when a tab is click i want the tab to show the tab title along with a spinner animated-gif next to it

1716873
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 was comparable to google-chrome

1716884
python	c++
it s fairly easy to add native extensions to python and there are lots of c++ libs for xmpp that would ports easily

1716886
exception-handling	try-catch
further try-catch catches c++ exception-handling not os exception-handling

1716927
any	set
we can grab any points on this line to do the math we need and we usually pick the easiest one that way we don t have to do any multiplication just set

1716953
constructor	object
passing database object to every methods or constructor is not a very good idea use singleton instead

1716961
meta-inf	jar
.when adding a file to the jar archive using the above code the meta-inf directory with its manifest.mf disappears and i get the newly added file

1716974
python	c++	python	java
i d call it a trend not a rebellion but i see the same in our company moving from c 25 years ago over c++ 20 years and java 12 years to javascript and python 2 years

1716990
vbscript	vb.net
there are a numbers of ways to do this using appcmd and c# vb.net javascript vbscript

1717003
packaging	building
indeed the maven-ejb-plugin doesn t provide any parameter to change the location of the deployment-descriptor which is expected to be available at meta-inf ejb-jar.xml the location is hardcode in the ejbmojo or the building will fail at packaging time .when buildinging ejb-2.x which makes sense

1717023
downcasting	upcasting
i have to actually use downcasting and upcasting from a to aimpl and vice versa

1717027
key-value	key
i need hops to be a list of key-value pairs where the key is always a string and the value can be a string int or float but i can t see anything in that would allow me to do that in the properties classes

1717051
constructor	object
i have a containers object where i measure how long it takes to run the constructor object below timing code in the public constructor

1717072
jquery	.post
whilst jquery can serialization form field and .post them to the server using ajax it can t do that to a file field

1717073
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i implements the router tecnique used in asp.net-mvc router in my webforms instead which allowed me to use below code

firefox	gecko
gecko firefox

1717083
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome

1717094
selected	button
what i would like that button to do is wrap selected text with my own custom span tags just like click the bold button wrap selected text with strong bold tags

1717098
attributes	properties
.when a child properties with the attributes changes the parent s arrangement is invalidated

1717104
silverlight	wpf
this is working great in wpf but .when i put this code into silverlight it is not happy

1717108
credentials	account
.when you are opening excel are you using the same credentials as the account you login to the computer with

1717147
versioning	upgrade
best part of using zodb was the fact that i never had to worry at all about how i am going to save data and how things would change .when i upgrade my software from one versioning to next one

1717147
authentication	login
in main skins one is redirected to a different login page in case of authentication failure

1717152
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

1717162
user-input	output
to control the actual user-input parameters and output the results and the destination and to execute actual business-logic you should use a servlet

1717167
integration-testing	webtest
integration-testing - ensure that the logic is correct and that issues don t come up across tiers or with realistic data look at cactus dbunit canoo webtest

1717167
testng	junit
unit tests - both defined the usage and expectations of a class and provides assurance that breaking changes will be caught quickly look at junit testng

1717175
display	height	display	width
two of these left and right have fixed width height and should display an image or shrink to 0 .when no image is present

1717175
margins	padding
and i have no idea what s happening as the margins padding is already turned off by default and border 0 and border-collapse collapse doesn t help

1717183
rhino-mocks	moq
i first grok d why i needed a mocking framework .when i compared writing test double by hand for a set of unit tests each test needed slightly different behavior .so i was creating subclassing of a base fake types for each test with using .something like rhino-mocks or moq to do the same work

1717204
constructor	object
there s more to initializer an object than just running its constructor

1717204
constructor	object
.when you call new you re asking the runtime to allocate spaces for an object handle whatever internal bookkeeping the runtime needs call the constructor for each base types in this case just object and finally call your constructor

1717219
display	height	display	width
if you want to display something inline and with a specific height and width use the display inline-block rules that s the correct option instead of just display block

1717224
downcasting	upcasting
since you talk about upcasting and downcasting i assume you want dynamic polymorphism meaning that you ll have functions which pass around pointers or references to a and at runtime the referands will actually be of types aimpl

1717224
protected	public
that s also fine except that a s destructor should either be virtual and public or non-virtual and protected

1717224
member-functions	pure-virtual
of course you ll need to actually defined the interface a by adding some pure-virtual member-functions to it that you implements in aimpl

1717235
communication	messages
the question i have though is why aren t you just using transport security ssl instead of messages security if all you care about is securing the communication and not providing identity

1717240
groovy	java
although it isn t strictly a java framework it depends on groovy if you haven t seen this before this is a dynamic-languages that runs on the jvm

1717240
groovy	java
most valid java is al.so valid groovy .so it is pretty easy to learn

1717240
groovy	java
groovy is a joy to use .so much more fun than java

1717240
stripes	wicket
but +1 for wicket and stripes two excellent frameworks

1717253
constructor	object
the reason i advise switching to using timespan object instead of doing something like datetime.now - starttime .totalmilliseconds is that although it should make very little difference technically in the latter case you are first calling getting the time and then getting the totalmilliseconds properties which i am almost certain is a calculated value in the constructor

1717258
textbox	button
it has very little code a gridview a couple of images and a couple of textbox and a search button

1717265
google-chrome	firefox
pls checked the scripting below it worked fine for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

1717279
constructor	object
in the constructor of windows iâ ve checked and verified that the item that itâ s attempting to bind to exists and is an object int

1717279
constructor	object
and in the constructor of the viewmodel i initializer the object

1717280
session-cookies	cookies
of course this is not infalible and in particular if you have lots of people who arrive and click off its not going to be a good statistic for you nor if you have predominance of people with cookies turned off in our case they won t be able to use our shopping-cart site without session-cookies enabled

1717285
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
autoresetevent manualresetevent might have slightly more overhead since these can be shared by different process whereas a monitor belongs to a single process

1717288
decrement	increment
what i mean by that is where the ptrs would increment or decrement instead of grabbing value out of the array..by which i need to up the efficiency level in that way for this method..any suggestions

1717291
children	nodes
i am rebuilding a nodess children by saving them out to an arrays as strings trashing them in the xml insert a new child nodes into the arrays as a string.

1717291
arrays	loops
now i want to loops through the arrays and write them back out to the original nodes

1717294
triggers	insert
we need to write a triggers .so that .when rows insert into a sql-server table meeting certain conditional they are then written to a windows os flat-file in csv format

1717300
positioning	slider
this code creates a string of 10 sliderr in which each next slider s 2 shapes numbers 1 and numbers 3 are nudged a bit in relation to similar shapes in the previous slider while one shape numbers 2 remains in the same positioning throughout

1717304
value	field
i was having issues with an int field where there may be no value a zero value or an int above zero and since

1717304
difference	zero
is this a good way to deal with a difference between no value and a zero value

1717310
value	field
nulls are the correct way to specify that a field has no value

1717315
webserver	upload
if your webserver will be serving these upload files over the web the performance will almost certainly be better if they are stored on the filesystems

1717316
hash	md5
what you can store there is id named types possibly md5 hash of file and date insert

1717335
aggregate-functions	sum
sorry forgot the top 15 in the query above - it needs to go just befor the sum aggregate-functions

1717351
value	field
if you set identity to off for the field you can set the value in the insert

1717355
put	get
what i would like to know is .when does a new project templates get pulled from it s zipfile and put into the item tempate caching in visual-studio

1717361
keyboard	mouse
i m creating a ddr-like game for an assignment and my keyboard seems to respond and trace it but only if i press on the screens with the mouse first

1717363
deep-copy	object	copy-constructor	deep-copy
implements clone to perform a shallow object copy deep-copy is more involved is trivial compared to implements a copy-constructor or a factory-method to perform the same operation

1717369
triggers	insert
looks like there is no identity in this particular table .so i d first checked to see if you have any triggers defined on the table in question and see if there is an attempted insert taking place in another table that uses an identity.

1717387
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
currently my object hierarchy looks like this uitabbarcontroller - uiviewcontroller - uiview

1717387
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
are there examples of containers controllers other than uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller that i can use for this case

1717389
triggers	insert
you introduce several possible classes of errors file i o errors write-fail means triggers fails means insert fails etc.

1717396
versioning	upgrade
if you have different versioning users need to re-download the whole thing if they want to upgrade

1717398
interrupt	delay
the only weakness of this methods is possible cpu interrupt delay but if is your code inside disabled interrupts short and fast than this delay normaly isn t critical

1717405
expression	evaluation
if those old expression are not removed it just keeps evaluation them and since they don t exist for current program they keep throw nullpointerexception

1717420
content-disposition	content-type
+ easy to add correct content-type and content-disposition headers from the serving scripting

1717467
handler	service
i have a asynchronous web service using axis2 which i call two different time using the same callback handler as follows

1717472
databound	gridview
in each user-controls there are databound controls gridview for example

1717486
sqldatasource	gridview
i display all the files in gridview control with sqldatasource

1717502
function-call	inline
you should look at all the places where it is being used and see if there may be some logic to how it is used otherwise just get rid of the function and inline this function-call

1717509
lgpl	gpl
there is no doubt that programs that link dynamically to dll s from libs with the lgpl or with the gpl with special provisions are gpl free if you decide .so

1717510
solaris	osx	solaris	linux	linux	osx
we have developers experienced in solaris osx and linux

1717513
webrequest	webclient
it seems you found a bug in webclient webrequest though perhaps microsoft put that in intentionally who knows

1717513
webrequest	webclient
since webclient webrequest parsing strings into uri your

1717534
contains	any
if you don t get any error but resultset with one column contains 1 then the table exists

1717536
decrement	increment
are you sure that the functions increment and decrement execute without any error

1717536
decrement	increment
.so change increment al.so decrement to the following

1717540
lgpl	gpl
i m considering to release the code under lgpl gpl styles license does this rules out protocol-buffers or boost libs

1717555
strcmp	strlen
just like strlen strcmp and others in gcc

1717567
updating	updates
this code uses begininvoke to updates the user-interface instead of directly updating it

1717568
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i know you tagged your question with mysql but if folks reading this question use other branding of rdbms they might want to look into bfile .when using oracle or fstream .when using microsoft sql-server 2008

1717592
data-structures	tree
i m guessing that the points of your assignment is to learn about tree data-structures

1717597
.when	ready
.when you are ready to initializer the application you can call createcomponentsfromdescriptors on the containers

1717605
compatibility	platform
the compatibility settings are merely preprocessor macros that block out parts of the win32 api in the header-files that are not available on the selected platform

1717620
bug-tracking	mantis
take a look at how the mantis bug-tracking software handles internationalization

1717626
publishing	release
.so other than changing all of the path named used in the project before we publishing and release it not a realistic .solution i don t see how we can continue to work in this way

1717629
firefox	safari
plugins under firefox safari and in mac osx don t exhibit the same slowdown

1717633
groovy	java
one good reason for not using something like the groovy console wonderful though it is is .when you want to test what something would be like in java without actually going to the trouble of a boilerplate class and main methods to run snippets of code

1717633
groovy	java
there are some difference between what groovy does and what java does

1717637
contains	set
this blog .post contains instructions on how to change the location of the systemroot temp folder used for this as well as instructions on how to use reflector to determine the setting in web-config to set for a situation like this

1717642
click	mouse
.when the mouse is click on nf1 followed by a tab

1717642
click	mouse
now if the same actions were repeated mouse click on nf1 followed

1717642
value	field
to hardcode tabindex value to field nf1 and nf2

1717647
required	checked
or you could checked the schema table directly probably required additional permissions to be set by admin

1717658
numeric	digits
this should be read as at least one numeric digits followed by at least one character that isn t a numeric digits followed by at least one numeric digits

1717669
any	set
if it supports unicode character classes like .net for instances matches a letter character in any character set

1717691
python	php
if it more a question of getting real time data from devices i would look into snmp but you will probably need to write additional stuff in php or python to query the devices for you

1717766
average	minimum
i ve got a table of temperature samples over time from several sources and i want to find the minimum maximum and average temperature across all sources at set time intervals

1717766
aggregate	grouping
i think it should be possible to create the results i want by doing a self-join on the samples table where the time from the first table is greater than or equals to the time of the second table and then calculating aggregate value for rows grouping by source

1717769
python	java
python to libstatgrab but not to java

1717802
arrays	loops
take your first example where you loops over an arrays of strings and printing out each words - sure i could translation this into c++ using an iterate over the vector and output each string to stdout

1717809
key-value	key
.when you need the value again you just find the key in from the perstent medium load the key-value pair and then access the value by ususally putting it back into a variables of sometype

1717821
entity-framework	nhibernate
in your repository you could use an o r mapper like nhibernate or entity-framework

1717821
sql-server	oracle
this is a not a good approach as this would force you to updates your domain model if you were to move from sql-server to oracle or xml files

1717825
basic	vba
anyone could potentially write a virus in vba visual basic for applications in the office document

1717830
linked-list	arrays
that allows for example a merge-sort or a linked-list versioning of a quicksort contrary to popular belief quicksort isn t necessarily unstable even though the most common implementation for arrays is

1717830
quicksort	heapsort
with that proviso the short answer is that in most current standards libs std sort is implements as a intro-sort introspective sort which is basically a quicksort that keeps tracking of its recursion depth and will switching to a heapsort usually slower but guaranteed o n log n complexity if the quicksort is using too deep of recursion

1717852
push	pull
version-control systemd deal with all these issues plus they centralize your code into a single location to pull from and push to

1717862

1717938
attributes	properties
i rarely use the tabindex attributes .so i haven t encountered this properties

1717945
default-value	default
if you use curlopt_post then use curlopt_postfields and curl_postfieldsize curlopt_postfieldsize_large to provide the actual xml data but then you al.so have to use curlopt_httpheader to overrides the default content-type header .so you can change it from the default-value of application x-www-form-urlencoded to text xml instead

1717964
constructor	object
however because the clock has finite resolution using the parameterless constructor to create different random object in close succession creates random numbers generator that produce identical sequences of random numberss

jquery treeview plugins is nice but doesn t have d d re-order but i m pretty sure it s possible to hack something with jquery user-interface draggable droppable

1718090
xsd	xml
i m still stuck with using arrays in xsd generator classes as my xml schema is too complex for xsd2code which created generics-based generator classes

1718094
mod-rewrite	mod-alias
as i understand it mod-rewrite runs before mod-alias which would surely cause this not to work and in truth my alias line is in the apache conf while the rest is in .htaccess

1718095

.so i thought it would be convenient to put hashcode equals and tostring into the interface to make sure that i remember to overrides the default-method for these

1718126
innodb	myisam
how would i show all tables in mysql with a given engine innodb myisam federated

1718127
tostring	equals
but in the case of equals hashcode and tostring as well as a few others that you didn t mention the implementation already exists

1718134

1718156
textbox	button
in my html1.erb file i have created a textbox and button

1718166
tostring	equals
as far as a solution for your particular problem you might consider creating your own methods maybe getstringrepresentation getcustomhashcode and equalsobject and have your object extends a base-class whose equals tostring and hashcode methods call these methods

1718166
tostring	equals
this is one of the reasons that some people have suggested that equals tostring and hashcode should never have been include on the object class in the first place

1718170
implements	extends
it is a bad idea to force classes that implements your existing interface to extends a specific abstract-class

1718170
implements	abstract
by adding their own abstract subclassing that implements the methods with a call

1718170
superclass	inherited
the methods implementation can be inherited from a superclass

1718170
superclass	inherited	implements	abstract
unless the class being declare is abstract all the abstract member methodss of each direct superinterface must be implements â 8.4.8.1 either by a declaration in this class or by an existing methods declaration inherited from the direct superclass or a direct superinterface because a class that is not abstract is not permitted to have abstract-methodss â 8.1.1.1 .

1718171
abstract	extends
if you want to force overrides of equals and hashcode extends from an abstract superclass which defined these methods as abstract

1718207
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
.so the former might be case-insensitive while the latter is case-sensitive

i looked at errno.h and it really doesn t have it declare which is confusing because i was under the impression that this is where it is defined

1718337
any	set

1720419
attributes	properties
my attributes are set with retained properties

1720569
python	c++
it s licensed under the gpl and written in c++ and python if i m not mistaken

1720577
file-descriptor	stdin
for this you fork a child-process and close the stdin or stdout file-descriptors 0 and 1 and then you do a dup on another file-descriptor of your choice which will now be mapped to the lowest available file-descriptor which is in this case 0 or 1

1720577
file-descriptor	stdin
using this you can now execute any child-process which is possibly unaware of your application and whenever the child writes on the stdout or reads from stdin whatever you configure the data gets written on the provided file-descriptor instead

1720577
stdin	pipe
shell use this to implements commandos with pipe bin ls | more by connecting the stdout of one process to the stdin of the other

1720654
rhino-mocks	moq	rhino-mocks	nmock	nmock	moq
i started out with nmock .when that was the only option back in 2003 then migrate to rhino-mocks because of its type-safety and now use moq because of the simpler api

1720655
linked-list	queue
defined the aforementioned servlet and defined a linked-list or any queue implementation

1720682
arrays	loops
to do this you need to loops iterate throughout the arrays and write the current rows name-value

1720687
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with this architecture its working very well with just a few.ashx scripting i dont feel any need to use a fancier setup like asp.net-mvc i dont even think that would fit but i m not using webforms either

1720691
handler	service
i made a testing windows service which have the same code in the onstart event handler and it worked both on win xp and win 2003 server that is driving me crazy i dont know what is wrong with my original service why it cant start the thread

1720743
command-line	cmd
i can manually types the cmd in the command-line and it will work

1720747
subtract	add	margins	padding
one way to make this approach easier is to add your top field to a separate panels that is autoheight true then after showing or hiding field simply measure the height of that panels and subtract it from the windows height plus margins padding to get your html-editor height that s what i ve done in the past .when i couldn t rely on a layout to manage it

1720766
interpolation	splines
the splines interpolation and smooth from scipy.interpolate are quite nice and might be quite helpful in fitting peaks and then finding the location of their maximum

1720778
python	java
i m getting a list of strings from python code and need to read it in java

1720834
wamp	php
i think there is something wrong with the path and then i use the absolute-path which is c wamp bin php php5.3.0 pear image graphviz.php

touch	drag
you can rename variables the generator code is relatively readable drag and drop is supported and you can always manipulate the screens manually although you cannot or better - shouldn t touch the generator code

1720864
linked-list	arrays
this might not be what you are looking for what you want is another types of dataset than just a simple arrays maybe you want a hashtable or just a linked-list on each row

1720868
constructor	object
anyway .when this does not apply because you do not have constructor returning autoreleased object your pattern 1 is definitely correct

1720870
arrays	map
you cannot store multiple value at the same key your output arrays doesn t really make sense the key 1 does map to the value 2 in the sorted arrays

1720914
defined	declare
i say similar because the twos have very different semantics for instances in haskell i can use function named which is not declare yet and defined it later with where while in c# with function reference assignment i can t do this

1720928
put	get
i have tried a variety of other forms for the class but can t get the deserialize to put the data in without proper key

1720930
filesystems	file-io
in a previous life non-python or twisted but very asynchronous we ended up abstracting file-io out into a separate daemons that was essentially our filesystems worker

1720931
implements	extends
the rea.son i am doing what i am doing above is to extends secondclass for every class that needs it - doing .so statically while the second class cannot extends more then one class thus i am using implements

1720943
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you had high priority bug fixed for example would it be wise to perhaps mix webforms with asp.net-mvc and instead replace the view with a code-behind web form until you make the next proper release which isn t a web form

1720943
directory	folder
i ve also seen other solutions on the same server of having the same web application run side-by-side and either change the root directory in iis or change the web-config to points to a different folder but the problem with this is that you have to do an entire building and deploy even if it were for a simple bug fix

1720952
click	mouse
i think they i have been assign id on every comment of user and systemd used that comment id for any function by ajax call .when user press mouse over it click over that list tag etc.

1720984
nstableview	nstabview
just create a tabless nstabview with two tabs put one nstableview in the first tab and another nstableview in the second tab

1720990
arguments	default
by default you can tell arrays what to populate the new elements with by providing the second arguments

1720990
contains	elements
edit apparently this way it populate the arrays with references to passed object .so once you do every first elements of contains arrays will change

1721016
defined	declare
const value declare and defined in-place are exactly what you need here the compiler can and will optimise them away completely .so they end up being exactly the same as using the #define in the first place but with the benefits of strict scoping

1721032
duplicates	contains
many of these adress line contains duplicates postcodes with differing steet adrresses

1721032
duplicates	contains
i need to seperate out each of these duplicates onto different spreadhseets .so that no one spreadhseet contains the same postcode

1721035
any	set
it won t cause any problems you won t loose data and if you use the translation behavior according to the cook book than your pages will be fetched in the correct language since the results will be fetched making a join of the tables contents and i18n or the custom table that you have defined and the data field will be updates corresponding to the language you have set

1721058
contains	set
the file gets looped through and may contains multiple grid of data the headers and rows are set in the file

1721058
any	set
the idea being to make it generics .so that it can read in any xml file i pass to it set up as below and put the data in a .sortable datagrid

1721088
opacity	shadow

uitableview	uiview
if segment 0 is click it show a uiview contains a uitableview

1721182
uitableview	uiview
if segment 2 is click it show another uiview which contains a uitableview as well

1721190
constructor	private	value	field
you need to set the private field to the value send to your second constructor of logdetails

1721195
base-class	inherited
do you let each class inherited from a base-class that implements the crud operations

1721208
global-assembly-cache	gac
in the case of shared .net assemblies that means you should put them in the .net global-assembly-cache gac

i have a asp.net asp calendar and a 2 button on my page on my first button s text is 1 month and second button s text is 1 year now .when i click on the 1 month then in my calendar the one month later date from now is selected and highlight with different color similar .when i click on the 1 year button now that date is selected in my calendar which is after one year come from now

1721400
buffering	streaming
as bytes from the streaming are read or skipped the internal buffering is refilled as necessary from the contains inputstreaming many bytes at a time

1721400
increment	reset
subsequent call to read will continue to increment the current positioning but a call to reset will set the current positioning back to its value .when mark was called

1721449
derived-class	inherited
creating a non-generic derived-class just as a sort of type-alias feels like an abuse of inherited to me

1721458
keydown	keyup
any keydown or keyup event is raised at panels level

1721464
buffering	streaming
java s bufferinging i o streaming read and write data to their own memory buffering usually a byte arrays

1721471
contains	any
the composite itself can t contains any useful code and any code that uses a composite will need to know what types are in it which you re currently not storing anywhere

1721472
bluetooth	usb
we were wondering if we could use a hid wr.apper drivers that simulates the usb identifier and pnp in a way that the .application thinks that a stick is connect and then links the bluetooth virtual comport data to the .app

1721474
put	get
somehow get a shared secret passwd random generator string etc onto both the server and the iphone client - this must be done out of bounds and not as part of the request ie hardcode it into each component or put in a configuration file

1721486
triggers	insert
do this using a triggers on insert and updates

1721509
sql-server	sql-azure
just create the structure in your local sql-server and use sql-azure migration wizard

sql-server	sql-azure
.when you are creating an entity-framework model use your local sql-server and later change the connection-string in web-config file to sql-azure connection

1721528
attributes	properties
in fluent you can call the readonly properties which maps to the attributes

1721529
contains	set
the answer about using the jar bundler tool is correct but if you want to use a .sh file make sure the unix permissions are set properly to something like 755 with chmod and make sure the first line contains the path to a shell install by default on mac os x

1721544
buffering	streaming
.so this streaming could be sped up by using a bufferingedinputstreaming as it s .source such that the bytes for the line are read from the in-memory buffering instead of directly from disk

1721545
linux	unix
this already poses one problem since most platform linux unix consider

1721571
python	c++
this would typically be done by writing an xpcom component in c++ which is possibly painful or more recently by writing it in python and using pyxpcomext

1721586
perl	c++
it s tempting to use simple text-manipulation scripting tools such as perl however thse don t understand the c++ syntax and .so you get into confusions such literals strings versus variables named

1721618
contains	elements	contains	any
if your panels does not contains any child elements even using will not fire the gotfocus event

1721618
keydown	keyup
instead most of the time like if the child elements is a button control will even eat up the keyup keydown events

1721635
firefox	opera
it works fine on firefox opera and webkit based browsers but as usual ie is giving me headhaches

1721639

1721653
version-control	git	perforce	git
source code goes into a version-control tool subversion csv git perforce ...

1721660
tokenize	parsing
typically you would split the work into a tokenize which splits the inputstream representing the expression into a list of tokens and a parsing which takes the list of tokens and construct a parsing tree ast from it

1721660
tokenize	parsing
.so how does one write the lexical tokenize and the actual parsing

1721660
parser-generator	antlr
or more commonly use a parser-generator like coco or antlr or lex yacc

1721679
credentials	account
the issue i m having is that .when i try and install a user service using installutil it asks for a username and passwd now i ve tried my own credentials i have an admin and non admin account but it isn t having any of it plus i want the user to change depending on the person logging on and not to be fixed

1721727
phpmyadmin	myisam
in phpmyadmin v2.8.2.4 for myisam tables the relation view appears under the structure tab

1721727
phpmyadmin	myisam
by phpmyadmin versioning 3.2.0.1 this page relation view no longer appears for myisam tables

1721744
decimal-point	digits
you can only rely on up to 4 digits after the decimal-point with your numbers as three significant digits are already before the decimal-point

1721744
decimal-point	digits
if result is a single this will be downcasting to single and the error in the 16th digits after the decimal-point is simply throw away since it can t fit into single anyway

1721760
hide	show
.when your planeprojection rotation is greater than 90 degrees hide the front elements and show the back elements

as you may have noticed this is hierarchical-data using the nested-set-model

1721798
scheme	let
i don t understand your bucketing scheme but let s make it 50 buckets and see what happens

1721804
scheme	lisp
i also heared about scheme and lisp compilers but i don t like this language

1721811
entity-framework	ado.net
hi i am using the ado.net entity-framework for the first time and the staticcode analysis is suggesting i change the following methods to a static one as below

1721834
put	get
as long as i can t get it working since if i put in my class

1721849
any	set
is there any way to get c# to actually read the new value that the arg is set too

1721850
udp	tcp
at the risk of just points you back the comments to that .post explain that udp doesn t block on the tcp ack but you could still block on a kernel buffering overflow

1721858
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome but doesn t move a little in firefox why

1721868
32-bit	64bit
some jvms i believe bea jrockit for some time and recently added to sun s use compressed oops which is 32-bit which gets shifted left a few places to enable access tens of gb of memory on 64bit systemd

1721881
flash-cs4	fdt
context i m working on a flash application developed with fdt and compiled with flash-cs4 i need a huge libs

1721886
malloc	free
never mix malloc free with new delete

1721886
boost	stl
there are const references to avoid copy construction of object passed to functions and stl containers and strings for the other storage requirements and use smart boost shared_ptr pointers if you really need pointers and don t want to tracking them by hand

1721898
.net	wcf
with wcf 4 - to be release with .net 4 presumably in march 2010 - things will get a lot easier since wcf 4 will already include a base routingservice class - see a endpoint.tv video interview by ron jacobs on this topic

1721908
malloc	free
call the correct deallocation routine is for arrays allocated via only delete for pointers to single object only and free ... only for memory allocated via the c api such as malloc ..

1721911
arrays	map
not sure why map won t pickle the arrays but process and pool will - i think perhaps it has be transfer at the points of the subprocess initialization on windows

1721923
value	field
the field value is instead set within a methods

1721923
value	field
this is not only important for my functionality but for testing as well since i will need to mock out the value that is set in that field in my test

1721929
fbconnect	facebook	facebooker	fbconnect
im trying to integrated fbconnect to my application and want to know if the facebooker plugins is still applicable now that facebook has made some revision to its api

1721956
.war	jar
for any one else tripping up i put a jar with my handler in domaindir .lib extjs as well as in my .war s web-inf .lib directory

1721970
value	field
if you have control over the securitymanager or there is non in-place you can use reflection to make the field accessible and then change its value

1721988
value	field
if you cannot do this then you could potentially use reflection to modify the field s value assuming that your securitymanager is configure to allow it - but this feels like a bit of a code-smell

1721993
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
you could set the derived-class to take a base-class object as a parameter in the constructor and then copy the properties from that

1721997
put	get
i want to draw rectangle to positioning what i get from startpoint but now it places my rectangle to middle of picturecanvas .when i want to put it in startpoint positioning

1722005
while-loop	arrays	put	get
do you think should i put that out of the while-loop and get all the email from an arrays

1722007
contains	elements
let me try to recap what i understood from your question you have a database-table countries that contains columns id and named that you would like to bind to a selected elements in a view

1722015
worksheet	excel
for reasons best left unsaid i have to substitute an excel worksheet for db_1 - as far as

1722024
triggers	insert
in this triggers i want to selected some recording from table user besides this one i insert to table but then i receive error about mutating table

1722046
webforms	asp.net	resource-files	resx
there is also the asp.net standards built-in way with resource-files just right click your project and click add items resource file you must create a resource file for each language like for example mui.resx that s the neutral one mui.fr.resx mui.es.resx and you are going to use them in the webpage like this mui.keyword that s if you are going to have one resx per language for all pages you could also have one resx per language per webforms

1722076
buffering	streaming
i think the output streaming s buffering is making you interpreter what you see wrongly

1722084
derived-class	base-class
if you delete base-class this will ensure that destuctor of derived-class is called

1722099
implements	extends
however you can implements an interface in you model by extends the doctrine-generated model and implementss the interface in the subclassing

1722123
python	java
it contains implementation of diff and patch algorithms in different programming languages cpp c# java javascript python

1722134
typedef	struct
struct typedef union members of union and struct and enum value typically are in lower case in my experience rather than the c++ java c# etc conventions of making the first letter a capital but i guess it s possible in c too

1722153
cucumber	webrat
webrat within cucumber is only for html and cannot do .post

1722155
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking for updates and innodb uses row-level locking

1722155
innodb	myisam
.so as i understand for tables with frequent concurrent updates several updates per second it is better to make them innodb and for other tables if we don t need transactional and foreign key of course it is ok to be with myisam engine

1722167
stax	sax
a cursor stax or event sax based approach

1722167
stax	sax
typically dom parsing are built on top of sax stax parsing anyway

1722167
stax	sax
they required more process and typically required you to have an entire document in memory before you can do anything whereas sax stax can be much more efficient and quicker to respond

1722180
innodb	myisam
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722181
dsa	rsa	private-key	rsa	private-key	dsa
i d like to know at least the certificate types x509 rsa dsa and whether it s a public or private-key

1722186
innodb	myisam
i am a newcomer to mysql myself but .when i install it it explained that innodb is optimised for transactional operational systemd and myisam is great for report dw systemd

1722187
asp.net-mvc	webforms
after reading steven sanderson s book pro asp.net-mvc i am convinced about the benefits of using asp.net-mvc over webforms

1722217
printf	scanf
improper format control string in printf or scanf statements

1722217
printf	scanf
make sure the format control string has the same numbers of conversion specifiers s as the printf or scanf has arguments to be printed or read respectively and that the specifiers match the types of variables to be printed or read

1722219
children	tree
.when you traversal the tree youâ ll read the children of payload_block and expect a list that you can iterate over and collect your data

1722221
put	get
but honestly the right way to handle this would be to get rid of that singleton and to put the data in 2nd level caching and to invalidate the caching if you updates the table manually

1722237
numeric	digits
i want to checked whether the numbers starts with 8 contains 10 digits all of it is numeric using regular expression

1722243
hardware-acceleration	text-rendering
in the worst case scenario you ll probably want to disable hardware-acceleration at all ugly wpf text-rendering - can #39

1722263
while-loop	loops
the do while-loop reads through that file one line at a time myfile.readline and puts the result into the textline variables which holds a different line of text from the file every time you go round loops till the file is finished

1722266
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the asp.net-mvc package don t specifically incorporate any orm technology because microsoft s effort in those areas have been aimed more widely at webforms developers and desktop .net software

1722268
implements	final
as long as the temp table contents represent the final set of unique key to be output and no further trimming of the resultset is done afterwards then it is a very efficient way of implements your requirements

1722268
contains	set
problems will only arise if the temp table contains an intermediate set of key which is cut down further in subsequent queries

1722281
calling-convention	function-call
that assembly was insert by the compiler in-place of the function function-call based on the calling-convention being used

1722305
private-key	rsa
i m trying to find a way to read a private-key created using openssl pkcs#8 rsa in c# without use external libs

1722332
mac-address	packets
the mac-address will change at each hop in the network as the packets contains the udp messages is routed from the sender to the receiver

1722362
object-reference	instances
.when i try to create a new silverlight project it gives me error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1722402
implements	extends
extends and implements are very well tested by mootools developers themselves

1722402
implements	extends
i d suggest having a good read up on what extends and implements do on the mootools docs clientcide website mootorial etc

1722408
shell	bash
.when i run the mingw bash shell i can no longer open the right-mouse menu

1722422
scala	java
using java s string class from scala this could be a dense but effective one-liner

1722437
any	set
footers would tend to be not close enough to the bottom of the page i had to do a lot of guess work and brittle calculations about how big text was going to be to decide on insert page break i could only support a restrict set of page formats and any changes to the report resulted in a cascade of code changes and yet more brittle calculations

1722438
perl	php
php serialization - simple flexible means of converting the output of php s serialization into the equivalent perl memory structure and vice versa

1722456
selected	listbox
i have a listbox in wpf and .when they selected an item it show an ugly colors

1722463
hotmail	gmail
whilst i was testing i used a friend smtp server to test on and my socket worked fine but .when i tried the same thing on a big email provider gmail hotmail etc it had none of it

1722463
credentials	security
now i have come to the conclusion that this is authentication and security related .so i tested sending a messages to gmail using .nets built-in smtpclient and various mail object using sslenabled and giving it the credentials it asked for this proceeded to work

1722478
macros	vba
this is based upon the vba code that words generator .when you recording a macros

1722478
document	editing
opening words editing 2 document with 6 field and closing the .app takes 4 seconds on my pc

1722504
authentication	login
usually the login controllers doesn t actually have a view it just authentication and forwarding you to either the login form if you are not authentication or a logged in page if the person is authentication

1722512
lan	wan
i read somewhere that you should use the address of your lan wan interface but i don t how to obtain that address

1722518
typedef	struct
struct named and typedef s in camelcase gtkwidget trackingorder

1722528
selected	listbox
now i want to selected two tasks in a listbox

1722537
webforms	asp.net
from your code i am guessing your using asp.net webforms

1722560
javascript	dom
that javascript file then sees if there are elements with the css class foo_draggable in the dom and if it finds any it will attach the required event handler

1722562
wlan	lan
usually you could have multiple network interfaces on one machine wlan lan ..

1722593
firefox	safari
this will fire a click event in safari but not firefox or the versioning of ie i tested

1722606
constructor	object
downside not all object have a parameterless constructor

1722606
constructor	object
downside not all object have such a constructor

1722616
javascript	dom
your javascript has to checked the dom only once for foo

1722644
base-class	inherited
absolutely a class can inherited from a single base-class and implements any numbers of interfaces at the same time

1722645
arrays	loops
i m using asp.net-mvc and i m trying to loops through a arrays of checkbox but how do i exclude the ones that are false in that list

1722649
primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	icefaces
but there are lot of ready-to-use jsf component libs with an ajaxical sauce for example richfaces icefaces primefaces etc

1722654
pipe	tail
create the pipe in java read the output of netstat -i and connect it in java to tail -n +3 .

1722664
single-sign-on	cas
which cas implementation should i use to enable cas single-sign-on to my django .app trusing a specified cas server i m not interested in creating a cas provider

1722674
click	mouse
if the showdropdown methods is called by anything other than a button click then the first mouse click in the dropdownform is ignore

1722679
contains	any
this way any object that gets touch will contains the correct information

1722700
decimal	hex
it looks like he s using hex for strings and decimal for numbers

1722707
16-bit	8bit	binary	hex
generally it makes sense to use hex .when the numbers being represented is more of a technical computer or hardware limitation parameter as these types of value are often based on base-2 construct because the internal limitation is tied to the numbers of potential value that can be represented by some binary numbers a value that muist be stored in an 8bit byte or in a 16-bit unsigned-integer for example

1722726
scala	java	python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
not that i think scala was ever likely to be the next java or c++ c# - i don t believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but i think it is was certainly feasible for scala to become the next ruby or python to gain a significant commercial user-base

1722727
asp.net-mvc	webforms	castle-monorail	asp.net-mvc
spark required either asp.net-asp.net-mvc or castle-monorail .so i guess mixing asp.net-mvc and webforms would be the only way to start using spark in a webforms-project.

1722727
asp.net-mvc	webforms
start by combining webforms and asp.net-mvc with spark in the same project

1722742
vxworks	linux
every piece of hardware has to have a piece of software that operates it be it embedded firmware smaller and relatively fixed like vxworks or an operating systemd software that can run complex arbitrary code on top of it like windows linux or mac

1722742
low-level	hardware
if it s a low-level c program that can talk to hardware then you dont need anything other than your program and the hardware

1722745
selected	cell
if i selected the cell put the cursor on the formula and press enter the formula doesn t change but starts working

1722754
any	set
since you can easily set any service methods to be synchronous or asynchronous

1722766
constructor	object
finally for the step i would say that a particular instances of a messages should know how to building itself and should required the necessary object as part of its constructor

1722772
user-controls	ascx	required	checked
for some reason .when adding it into an ascx user-controls to be used as a templates it does not rendering the required tag and thus generator a javascript null reference .when checked to make sure the control exists before validation continue

1722772
user-controls	ascx
but .when in an ascx user-controls in an aspx

1722774
lightbox	colorbox
i m using the colorbox lightbox plugins to display lightbox with outside html ajax on my page

1722774
directory	folder
the page i m trying to load is in the same directory as the page i m calling it from and both are in a folder one level deep from my web root on my remote-server

1722794
basic	vb6
addins written in vb6 for vb6 use a reference to microsoft visual basic 6.0 extensibility

1722822
scala	java
more seriously i hardly spent any time with 2.7 it won t inter-op with a java libs i am using and started using scala just over a month ago

1722836
spacing	layout
one more key thing - make sure that everyone is using the same rules for use of tabs spacing for layout and for formatting this is good practice anyway but the more consistent you are the less likely you are to find difference between code files that don t really exist

1722836
continuous-integration	build-server
in addition i d recommend you look at continuous-integration having a build-server this provides considerable benefits in terms of confidence that your committed code will built-in a clean environment and if you are suitably equipped with tests will give you futher confidence that it still works - even after a complex merge process

1722838
any	set
my question is if i enable ssl on one of my dotnetnuke portals are there any gotchas or settings i need to be aware of assuming the server is set up correctly

1722847
webforms	asp.net
i d go the other route find some crappy asp.net webforms sites to show them

1722855
jlist	jtree
jlist has a jtree

1722858
versioning	upgrade
to enable the dollar safe mode upgrade your versioning of mootools and make sure you include mootools after prototype

1722882
autopostback	checked
if you do then checked their autopostback properties and if it is set to true then set it to false if that is what you want and need

1722882
postback	ajax
as mentioned above if you have sorting enabled in your gridview that will also cause a postback which you can hide by adding ajax to your page

1722882
updatepanel	gridview	scriptmanager	updatepanel
a simple not the most efficient way to do this will be to add a scriptmanager control to your page to enable ajax controls in it then add an updatepanel control and move your gridview inside this updatepanel

1722887
for-loop	arrays
another answer for the first question is to use one for-loop and perform linear indexing into the arrays using the function numel to get the total numbers of elements

1722888
selected	button
.when a press a button i want the currently selected row in the first table to be copy-paste but not removed to the second table

1722892
properties-file	jar
if you ve packaged your application to a jar file which in turn contains the properties-file you should use the methods below

webserver	upload
even if you could work out these client-side problems as far as i know any generics webserver is going to wait until it s received the entire .post ed file upload before passing it on to the server-side web .app .so there s no opportunity for a server-side component to updates status as it receives each chunks

1722925
environment	building
but if its for an internal site you have to actually make a more considered judgement forms works you can produce very good results and if you know the environment its going to be deployed into you may find that you re more productive with the building blocks it provides than with asp.net-mvc

1722925
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as an aside there s nothing to stop you using the strengths of the asp.net-mvc model in webforms - the fault we tend to be most guilty of is failing to separate the logic correctly because its too easy not to but from a clean slate you can be aggressive in what you allow

1722935
javascript	dom
you need to give javascript a bit time to updates the dom

1722958
division	modulo
edit ok now i see what could go wrong with trying to do a division by 2 in a non-prime modulo as it is similar to a division by 0

1722985
buffering	streaming
you have a bunch of erroneous .read statements that assume that read actually reads the full buffering - it doesn t it wait until at least 1 byte is available and just returns what s immediately available or returns 0 if the streaming is finished

1722993
restart	reload
my problem is that these servers might read will be running on the same machine as my python scripting and i had planned on opening a udp ports and just sending the heartbeat waiting for the reply and voila...i could restart servers .when if they weren t responding by killing the task and reload the server

1723009

1723030
python	java
for example i would like to call a function from java and implements the function in python

1723045
environment	execution
1 in a freestanding environment in which c program execution may take place

1723058
serialization	marshalling
if you want to reuse your structure after marshalling you need to play games with moving the children you don t want serialization into an un-annotated properties and then moving them back into your main properties after the marshaller is done

1723061
selected	button
an instances of the uitoolbar class is a control for selected one of many button called toolbar items

1723061
selected	button
the uitabbar class implements a control for selected one of two or more button called items

1723071
valarray	std
just for fun a slightly different route to the same result using std valarray instead of std vector and various algorithms

1723078
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari have long standing bugs in their issue trackers about this if anyone feels strongly enough to vote on them

1723081
32-bit	x86
it s only known to work on 32-bit windows-xp with clr2 on x86

1723088
textbox	button
i m using a modified form of treeview for the treeviewitem there is a templates to show a textbox with a done button in a pop-up

1723090
extends	sealed
the problem with option 2 is that you can t extends a sealed class which i would expect a third party to do

1723104
execute	declare
if you need to access properties set by another target you could declare that target as a dependency to ensure that it gets execute before your target

1723105
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i ve tried to call the imagepicker from the viewdidload viewwillappear or awakefromnib nothing changes

1723106
filtering	sorting
i created my own collections inheriting from bindinglist which supports sorting filtering etc

1723106
filtering	sorting
i found this codeproject article with an implementation of ibindinglist which supports sorting filtering etc

1723114
filtering	sorting
is a good option but note that it doesn t support sorting or filtering out of the box

1723114
filtering	sorting
datatable is probably your best option if you need sorting and or filtering capability

1723146
keyboard	mouse
my solution to this was using cordinates and simulate key klicks im using global mouse and keyboard libs for this found at this location

1723152
implements	extends
although a bindinglist does not support sorting out of the box you can extends it by creating your own list that derives from bindinlist and implements your own sorting

1723164
order	join
the dataset contains several tables one of which the order table receives the results of a sql query that join recording from two different tables

1723164
value	field
instead of returning 30.00 the value of the sum field is something like 50.00

1723168
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
edit i noticed a comment about sets contains duplicates elements

1723168
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements	contains	set
.when i say set i m referring to the mathematical definition which means among other things that they do not contains duplicates elements

1723176
exception-handling	try-catch
like some others have said you want to use try-catch block around code that can throw an exception-handling and that you are prepare to deal with

1723177
show	next
the best you can do is prompt the user to set it next to a video panels to show them if the camera they ve chosen actually works

1723180
jquery-plugins	jquery
i know that results in a jquery object but i often see especieally in jquery-plugins the use of return this.whatever what is the general rules

1723223
vb.net	vb6	vb.net	vba	vba	vb6
there is a lot of confusion on this topic but to answer the ops question yes logical evaluation is the same in vb.net as it is in vb6 as it is in vba

1723226
scala	java
i find i can use scala as a java without semicolons i write similar-looking code to what i d do in java and benefit a little from syntactic brevity such as that gained by type-inference

1723226
scala	java
if i scan the fora and see how many developers are still struggling with the finer points of java i cannot conceive of scala ever becoming a mainstream language

1723226
scala	java
no company will be able to justify sending its developers on a 3 week scala course .when formerly they only needed a 1 week java course

1723230
qgraphicsview	qpainter
i ve tried with modifying the osciloscope example of qwt tried to use qgraphicsview and qpainter to reach high frame-rate drawing

1723238
.when	ready
install trac using sqlite to the pendrive then .when you add it to the systemd have a batch-file or something to run tracd.exe and you are ready to roll

1723242
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you have a sqlconnection opened and attach a sqldatareader to it and then try to run another query using the same sqlconnection then it will throw an error

1723251
simulator	platform
i think you would have fun writing toy kernel that are designed to run under simulator like qemu or virtualization platform xen + minios is one of my favorites

1723263
silverlight	wpf
this is targeting the reduced generics support in wpf 4 and future silverlight

1723263
silverlight	wpf
wpf ignore custom types descriptors and typesdescriptor does not even exist in silverlight

1723263
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight have to hardcode a fixed set of supported typess in wpf can use the ixamltypesresolver interface to get the actual types that sys double corresponds to

1723304
aggregate	grouping
.when you grouping in sql you get key and aggregate only

1723304
aggregate	grouping
.when you grouping in linq-to-sql if you ask for the child object more than aggregate linq-to-sql will re-query each grouping using the key to get those child object

1723316
python	java
while some languages such as java c# and python are good for learning oo concepts such as classes object inherited and polymorphism - javascript is not one of those languages

1723326
fireworks	photoshop
you could merge them together using photoshop or fireworks

1723340
setinterval	settimeout
avoid eval and avoid passing a string in to settimeout and setinterval

1723341
hide	show
if not is there a plugins that hide selected .when a modal-dialog is show

1723365
user-input	output
if the validation plugins detection there is an error in the user-input then you can output the error in the same tag like .so

1723370
default-value	arguments
an intermediate way would be to return a reasonable default-value null .when required arguments are missing

1723371
constructor	private	instances	private
the constructor of the class in question sets a private field to an instances of another class from the same assembly and then reads some configuration settings from an xml file

1723381
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
.so inside the uitabbarcontroller i ve added about 10 sub uiviewcontroller object as tabs

1723403
value	field
we do not allow nulls because programmatically accessing a field from a datatable with a dbnull value causes an exception-handling while an empty string has a value and therefore does not error

1723429
multicast	packets
i know how to set the ttl on the sending multicast socket but i want to know the remaining ttl of the arriving packets

1723455
selected	listbox
you can handle selectionchanged event of listbox and unselect the selected item in the event handler

1723472
aggregate-functions	sum
also as bill karwin mentions nulls behave specially in aggregate-functions count sum avg etc. calculating avg temperature on the above data would give you -14.5 as the null row is ignore

1723480
overwrite	import
sequential import overwrite

1723520
constructor	object
the important question is this is the object is ready and usable after construction and does the compiler enforce that you pass all necessary data to the constructor or do you have to remember to call a bunch of setter after construction who s numbers might increase at any time without the compiler giving you any hint that you need to adapt your code

1723529
feedback	account
edit i ve updates my answer to account for lists being unhashable as well as some other feedback

1723554
conditional	operators
orelse is the short-circuiting operators which terminate the evaluation of the conditional as soon as the runtime knows what the outcome will be

1723558
any	set
in a component based architecture where a large numbers of decoupled components communication through a set of standardized interfaces - are there any guidelines for where-to-store how-to-group the interfaces

1723561
contains	any
what it does is it pads each row .so that any given caching line is entirely contains in one row

1723562
constructor	private	constructor	object
functional using constructor functions to create a private scoping and return a new object grouping a set of methods with privileged access to the private variables

1723564
duplicates	elements
if it isn t then your last option is to make sure that there can t be duplicates elements in either list

1723567
conditional	operators
the shortcuts operators means the rest of the if conditional won t be execute if the first is true

1723594
duplicates	elements
gnud s implementation would probably be the best solution since it solves both problems without changing the order of elements or removing potential duplicates

1723602
fluent-nhibernate-mapping	nhibernate
is there a fluent-nhibernate-mapping for the nhibernate trigger-identity methods of generator primary key

1723608
sql-server	oracle
now i need to building a query to selected the top 5 of every employee in the loan_movements table i know i can do it in oracle by selecteded selecteded rownum and rownum 5 but i cant manage to find a way to do that or something else with the same result in sql-server 2000

1723609
versioning	upgrade
the file versioning is also important for windows-installer .when you upgrade an existing versioning over a previous one

1723617
create-table	insert-into
i know about selected into outfile cmd but i want to have the file like the one which is generator by phpmyadmin in export windows .so all the create-table and insert-into

1723622
selected	textbox
currently i m pondering over orphan recording single-table-inheritance leaving the systemd table links in-place but making that data non-editable coping the data into a field in the policy table making it a textbox on edit selected box on create or creating two tables one for live one for the templates

1723626
platform	gpl
yes gpl code translation to another language or platform is still subject to the terms of the gpl

1723660
swing	awt
i think swing awt cannot do this without a guest program specific jni

1723695
buffering	streaming
local buffering of the input output streaming

1723709
textbox	button
i am trying to fix .somebody elses code and this is my first asp.net dataview experiance basically i want to checked that a textbox has a value the dataview has been coded .so that on the add updates an ok cancel button is used

1723719
security	owasp
the open web application security project owasp

1723766
contains	set
the often suggested set wont work here because the two lists contains lists which are unhashable

1723779
abstract	extends
if it doesn t make sense for karakter to have a getrace for instances if there is another types alien extends karakter that doesn t have a getrace you could abstract with an additional interface

1723785
cassini	iis
since you are running iis 5.1 you may need to use the visual-studio development server aka cassini to hosts your visual-studio project

1723796
virtual-functions	abstract-class
the way i usually separate key components in the code is to defined interfaces via abstract-class and pure virtual-functions

1723796
any	set
2 i want to be able to specify easily some set of features and being able to pass in any pointers to object that have this and usually extra functionality

1723808
order	add
now suppose you want to add an order without a customer id whether that should be possible is another question you would have to make the foreign key null.

1723831
value	field
.when you set a value of a dependency properties it is not stored in a field of your object but in a dictionary of key and value provided by the base-class dependencyobject

1723831
value	field
it s a huge dissipation to store a field for each properties .when you think that over 90 of the properties of a user-interface control typically stay at its initial value

1723838
specifications	w3c
i know oninput isn t part of the w3c dom specifications but all of the browsers i ve tested this code with mdash

1723838
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
google-chrome 2 safari 4 firefox 3 opera 10 ie6 ie7 mdash

1723842
void	main
int main void

1723859
dependency-properties	attached-properties
the dependency properties systemd handles things like attached-properties in a consistent manner as standards dependency-properties

1723860
subclassing	superclass
if it doesn t make sense for this to return a value in the superclass then you can make the superclass abstract which means you cannot construct an instances of it directly you can only construct one of its subclassing and declare the methods abstract in karakter too

1723872
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome works same as safari

1723877
triggers	insert
i tried using insert triggers but it doesn t work as it is statement level triggers not row level

1723885
oracle	mysql
if you re using mysql or oracle then try concat function

1723901
declarative	imperative
i would recommend you though to always use linq instead of writing for or foreach loops because in the future it will become .so intelligent that it will actually be capable of distributing the work over proces.sor and take into account hardware specific things see plinq and it will eventually be faster than if you wrote the loops yourself declarative vs imperative programing

1723912
highlight	cell
highlight the cell

1723912
highlight	cell
highlight cell in a column where the second row has 5 in it

1723912
highlight	cell
highlight the cell

1723918
copy-constructor	constructor	getter	setter
the more code means constructor copy-constructor assignment-operator and destructor which is a fair amount and of course the getter and setter

1723947
display	width
to create the scrolled string i simply add remove characters as the come into outof view using panels width character sizes to determine the time to add remove characters from the string on the display panels

1723958
value	field
now following on from the above i found that .when i was working with a discussion grouping the only place i could change any field in the list item was in the itemupdating methods where i could assign the new value into the properties.afterproperties hash corresponding to the item named as mentioned previously

1723975
click	mouse
.so for example if i click on the drag handle div and then move my mouse upwards out of the div as the div only move left and right it then doesn t catch the onup or onmove events

1723976
contains	set
on server 2 i also have c configuration with the same set of files but of course they contains their own settings that i do not want to overwrite

1723983
any	set	order	add
if you are only adding the order temporary with no customer id until a customer is defined would it not be simpler to add the customer and order in a single transactional thereby removing the need for the null foreign key entry and avoiding any constraints or triggers you ve set up being violated

1723987
.when	ready
main contains all our ready-to-release code and we tend to think of it as basically stable. dev iterator or dev feature or dev riskyfeaturethatmightbreaksomeoneelse are branches from main and are merged up .when the iterator feature is ready to promote up past the dev environment

1723987
versioning	upgrade
as for vss- tfs - microsoft supports an upgrade path which should keep your versioning history but if you don t need it the history i would just get the latest versioning from vss checked it into tfs and archive the vss repository

1723989
qlistwidget	qtreewidget
i ve created a child class of qtreewidget that i want to be able to drag items from another tree widget too i want to handle the insert myself though as well as from a qlistwidget

1723998
value	field
multiple value for the same field are effectively ored together and then anded onto the criterion for other field

1723998
value	field
i generally detection input into a single field of comma-separated lists translation to in dash-separated ranges translation to between wildcard value translation to like and any combinations for example customer id 1-10 50 52

1724001
click	mouse
any idea how i might be able to discern in an application which mouse a click came from

1724006
updating	updates
this is the file that the user will open to do their work in. they ll call the code to updates the other workbook from within this workbook and they ll still be able to work in this workbook while this one is updating

1724011
highlight	cell
even your second example which is missing the btw has strange behavior since not all the cell in the column are highlight until i minimize and restore the windows

1724015
moss	wss
i m in a positioning of evaluation product approaches to building business intelligence dashboards on top of sharepoint wss no moss at this stage

1724015
ssas	ssis
the bi platform is currently built on sql-server 2005 ssis ssrs and we re currently investigating adding ssas to the mix .so we re very micro.soft centric at the moment

1724025
double	int
some are string s some are int s and some are double s

1724027
display	height	display	width
setting the height and width to auto will make the control use as much spaces as is needed to display the contents of what is in the control

1724038
dependency-injection	inject
bonus points for this setup since somemodule would likely be a nested-class inside the constants file you could easily use dependency-injection to inject either somemodule directly into classes that depend on it

1724038
configuration	environment
you could also even extraction an interface on top of somemodule and then create a depenedency to isomemoduleconfigurationuration in your consuming code this would then allow you to decouple the dependency to the constants files and even potentially make testing easier especially if these settings come from appsettings and you change them using configuration transformation because the settings are environment specific

1724057
protected	public	compile-time	hardcode
do not use across assemblies public or protected if value might change in future because the value will be hardcode at compile-time in those other assemblies

1724062
lighting	shading
i am it student and i have to make a project in vb6 i was thinking to make a 3d software rendering but i don t really know where to start i found a few tutorials but i want something that goes in depth with the maths and algorithms i will like something that show how to make 3d transformation camera lighting shading .

1724069
web-config	app-config
another vote for using web-config or app-config

1724071
windows-server	windows
if you know your target-platform is going to be windows 7 vista or windows-server 2008 then you should be using the iazmanapplication3 interface and this is a lot better defined roledefinition has it s own collections types

1724071
windows-server	windows-xp
if you re developing on windows-xp you will need to install the windows-server 2008 administration pack and this will come with the updates azman dll

1724074
authentication	login
i need to know .when tomcat accepts a login using realm authentication for a given context

1724079
base-class	inherited
one option for doing this is making all of your pages inherited from a base-class that contains a relativeurl properties that can be overrides for individual pages

1724096
.net	wcf
i assume you re hosting using wcf in your .net .app

1724101
vbscript	basic
i hate the lack of data typing in vbscript i would like a numbers of different containers object - rather than just a dictionary object and .so on - in fact i wonder why having move from basic to c in the 80 s and then c++ a while after that i managed to move back to basic in to 00 s

1724106
any	set
anyone would have any idea on how to set that ibatis properly .so it works for both the .app and the junit

1724146
subclassing	inherited
i am using fluent-nhibernate with table per subclassing inherited mapping

1724168
jquery	dojo
- jquery and its associated plugins dojo script.a.licious and other such libs include built-in animation that you can plugins without understanding the underlying javascript -- however as everyone else here has said understanding javascript will make your coding experience much more pleasant and effective

1724174
updating	updates
elsewhere within the systemd i ve got other updates queries that are working just fine but i suspect the problem with this one is that as well as updating the recording i m al.so trying to manipulate the date-format as well .so that i can enter dates in the british dd-mm-yyyy format and then use the php to convert back into the mysql-friendly yyyy-mm-dd format

1724195
arguments	undefined
incorrectly differentiate between arguments declare const and ones not declare .so and you can get errors about undefined functions

1724196
click	mouse
gtk seems to have had some work put into allowing you to detection which mouse click gdkevent.gdk_event_get_device but i don t know what the timetable is for getting this into a full stable release

1724206
value	field
depending on how your cakephp is set up you d probably want to create a route that passed this slug value into the controllers .so you could then lookup the right entry in the database using that field

1724226
javascript	dom
there are javascript dom jquery animation

1724226
javascript	dom
animation are done by manipulating html dom elements using javascript + time

1724231
32-bit	64bit
as well as adding the 64bit attributes the 32-bit and 64bit package should appear as different product

1724231
32-bit	64bit
64bit windows you can easily prevent 32-bit files being install on a 64bit pc by not including them in the 64bit install

1724235
operators	keyword
section 14.5.12 of the c# language specifications explicit enumerate all the operators on which the checked and unchecked keyword can have an effect

1724364
hide	show
all that said it looks like you are wanting to show hide divs

1724376
executable-jar	jar
it s definitely not the botton_color problem it s a string like this silver or pink .so if i change the above line to dir_icons key_1_silver.gif it still works fine in the ide while not be able to run from an executable-jar file the problem seems to be why after jar the project it can t find the re.sources

1724376
executable	jar
the jar file was generator by netbeans and is executable

1724380
versioning	upgrade
the downside is that .when they went along and discontinued the free versioning i was in the positioning to either pay for an upgrade or stick with what i have

1724382
syncfusion	telerik
to see a simple example of this take a look at the source code for syncfusion s wpf samples and compare them to telerik s

sql-server	oracle
i am dealing with sql-server and oracle through qt .when using qsqldatabase transactional on a database connection

1724408
administration	enterprise
depending on the windows os you have i have windows 7 enterprise you might want to try giving administration rights to the regtlib.exe located in c windws

1724412
revision	rcs
the usual way to get revision history on a file is not to examine the repository-wide history file but rather it is to run the cvs log cmd which will extraction the rcs revision information for a given file or subtree

1724418
contains	set
listbox.itemspanels - set the itemspanelstemplate which contains a panels .so that the items get laid out by the panels

1724420
contains	any
and since the rm prescribes that there must be a value in every cell of a table any thing that possibly contains nulls is not a relational thing and thus the question of 1nf doesn t even arise

1724420
value	field
nulls do exactly that because they combine the boolean value this field is is not really present with the actual value

1724426
stretch	styles
something in the listbox or listboxitem styles or controltemplate is causing a control to have horizontalalignment not set to stretch at some level

1724574
getter	setter
my suggestion is to use one of the already existing orm implementation which already supplies facilities for getter and setter methods of related model

1724574
getter	setter
in the other case you have to write specialized getter and setter by yourself for every model

1724580

1724866
buffering	streaming
the second example is reading the streaming one byte at a time which is great for streaminging incoming or outgoing data - meaning if you can process portions of the streaming you are receiving without first buffering it all entirely into memory this is a more efficient approach

1724870
queue	fifo
in contrast to a queue fifo a stack means you can handle the most recent data first while leaving old data last

value	field
and in addition to these i wanted some other field in the same content-type to be dependent on a particular value in the drop down

1725095

the process could not recover from the exception-handling because it was not handled no try-catch around your read etc. therefore the only thing it could do is restart the process

1725103
jax-ws	cxf
if you re looking for a web-services stack which is my understanding consider jax-ws ri or cxf if you are looking for a jax-ws compliant stack both support contract-first or java-first or springws only contract-first or maybe axis2 i don t like it personally it because of its development and deployment model and its performances

1725103
jax-ws	cxf
you might want to checked apache axis2 cxf and sun jax-ws ri in comparison for more details

i hope you haven t paid 50000 pr cpu for oracle enterprise and then only used the least common denominator inorder to switching to mysql any minute

1725279
required	checked
this would be my first idea on it the only question this would leave me is if we move from solely web based and added any types of api that required authentication on the service level that there would end up alot of duplication of access checked or is that perfectly acceptable to verify twice and should be designed for up front

1725280
checkbox	button
.so 1 button + 4 checkbox instead of 5 checkbox

1725287
account	api
i can t really use a secret-key for authentication because it would be really easy to discover and the applications that use the api would be deployed to many different machines that aren t controlled by the account holder

1725289
click	mouse
the mouse click event only fires if the mouse is pressed and release in the exact same spot

1725289
click	mouse

1725363
factors	primes
i have recently been reading about the general use of primes factors within cryptography

1725363

everywhere i read it states that there is no published algorithm which operates in polynomials time as opposed to exponential time to find the primes factors of a key

1725394
show	next
now .when i generator the report everything looks beautiful - but if i page to the next page it doesn t show the headers

1725399

i was hoping this was possible without touching the existing html and just somehow changing the dom with javascript with jquery assistance

1725409
contains	elements
i m trying to identify an empty elements that might or might not contains a comment tag and or white spaces

1725422

1725433
cryptography	security
relies on the foundation of quantum mechanics in contrast to traditional public key cryptography which relies on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical functions and cannot provide any indication of eavesdropping or guarantee of key security

1725447
oracle	mysql
for production however i d rather use a dbms that writes each change to disk in multiple places which for my means oracle although mysql probably works just as well

1725457
ubuntu	linux
we observed this rapid cpu spikes only on ubuntu linux where as windows it runs without on itch

1725464

msbuild	nant
any reason you can t move them inside your nant or msbuild scripting

1725488

1725511
sql-server	sql-azure

sql-server	sql-azure
the sql-server 2008 r2 november ctp has just had such an announcement - the ssms for that versioning will be supporting sql-azure

1725514
constructor	object
i think that would be tricky in this case since observerss and subjects are 10-a-penny in my application and it would very awkward to have to pass a queue thread map object into the constructor of every single observers

1725566
contains	any
you can use gspot to inspect your file and see if it contains any p-frames

1725568

if i then tap and hold on the cell as if i was selected it it refreshes to the correct content again

1725616

1725629
google-chrome	opera
working correctly in ff3 opera google-chrome and even ie8

1725646

i like c++ but i look at the progress c# java and even python and ruby have made over the last 5 years and i increasingly question whether c++ is worth the effort

1725702
sql-server	oracle
it is relevant to olap cube and not to regular relational databases such as oracle or sql-server although some sql-server editions come with analysis service which is olap

1725731
python	php
some people sub out some of those things for something else for example python for php but in essence it means a free application stack

1725745
sql-server	oracle
in datbases that support output clause sql-server oracle i think db2 is easy

1725766
contains	set
in the past i ve set up a zipfile that contains some of the contents of the debugging tools for windows like cdb and adplus which can be install just by unzipping it on a users machine

1725778

another way that i have seen is to get the max from the table and increment it and put it into the new row

1725807
internet-explorer	firefox
it seems to work fine in firefox but is invisible in internet-explorer 7

1725815
append	input
i would try triggers an event on form-submit before the validation which append the value from the individual day month year input together into a separate hidden input and then validation the hidden input instead

1725829
value	field
i m not completely sure how you required the different pages part to work but if everything else works with a non-taxonomy dropdown - and you don t have time for the issues with conditional field to get shaken out - then you may be able to set up a view page that filtering on the value of the cck nodes

1725843
selected	cell
this assumes you ve namedd your range of cell mynameds for example by selected all the cell in your range and setting a named in the naming box

1725852
nsuserdefaults	nsstring
in my other apps i don t usually save nsstring in nsuserdefaults

while i agree with and want to second the other two at the moment answers that proposed using a standards tool such as dom4j or jdom i d like to posit an off-the-wall suggestion

1725991
selected	listbox
how to insert combobox selected item into listbox using c#

1725999
versioning	upgrade
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726021
selected	checkbox	input-field	checkbox	input-field	selected
the val accessor works like the value properties except that it s extended to work nicely even with input-field like selected and checkbox

1726023
margins	padding
removing whitespace from between tags or explicit setting margins and padding does not help

1726031
push	pull
the amount of overhead needed to use dynamic data-structures extra memory use extra instructions needed to pull and push the data from sram keep tracking of which dynamic variables resides where moving memory blocks around .when variabless in between get deleted.... just doesn t justify the merits

1726036
highlight	selected
now right click on that highlight elements and selected inspect in dom tab

1726042
binutils	gmp	gmp	mpc
according the the gcc building instructions you can building binutils concurrently with buildinging gcc as well as gmp mpc etc

this works fine for gmp mpc mpfr but i can t seem to get it to building all of binutils

1726046
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu at least seems to have much better support here using utf-8 and providing a fonts with broad grapheme support

we used scons for continuous-integration run by a central build-server

1726067
configuration	logging
each one puts its logging configuration in a different place though most nowadays use common.logging as a wrapper around either log4j or java.util.logging

1726067
configuration	logging
in either case you need to find or create a configuration file that defined the log level for each package and each place the logging systemd will output log info typically console file or db

1726079
margins	padding
to make empty spaces between elements use padding margins styling via css

1726084
margins	padding
if you re just using brs to add spacing it s better to use margins and padding

1726089
value	field
if you want a dropdown in your datagridview you re going to have to dispense with the automatic route and start writing the code to bind the dropdown value to one field in one table while telling it to display value from another or use the designer

1726090
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i found this one the other day which doesn t seem bad but it doesn t work in google-chrome works in firefox and opera but i didn t get chance to checkout ie

1726098
xsd	xml
as far as i know such types systemd is used in xsd xml schema definition

1726120
constructor	object
aside from the fact that it s not clear if b is a class a typesdef or a namespace it s also not clear if c is a types and c an object of that types or if c is a function or constructor taking c as an arguments or even if c is an object with operators overloaded

1726122
bmp	png	tga	png	tga	bmp
i used this image because i ve found it in various file-format tga tif jpg png bmp

1726137
click	mouse
in a gwt .app i would like to tracking and display x y mouse coordinates and intercept click over the whole browser page

1726137

1726142
circular-buffer	queue
you have to manage 2 pointers head tail which work over the queue in the same way as a circular-buffer

1726149
selected	listbox
the selected item of the combobox is a datarowview and the listbox is calling datarowview.tostring to work out what to display

1726149
any	set
set the displaymember and valuemember value of the listbox .so the listbox doesn t just use tostring any more

1726155
compatibility	deprecated
ie was able to work with css expression but since it s entirely proprietary and deprecated as of ie8 it won t unless the browser is ie5-7 or running in compatibility mode with ie5 or 7 be execute interpreter

1726188
ruby-on-rails	django
it is supposed to be an answer to ruby-on-rails django etc and is asp.net-mvc based

1726197
font-size	width
problem i am wondering how i can find out what the width of a given char is for a given font-size in arial

1726218
tlistview	tdbgrid
tlistview is not a data-aware component and there isn t afaik a vcl tdblistview - if you need a grid of data you can either bind to a tdbgrid or use a 3rd part tdblistview which you can find with a quick google

1726222
decimal	hex
decimal 65279 is hex feff which is the unicode byte-order-mark bom

1726223
any	set
finally in xpath 2.0 the selection may also be a sequences of items of any types possibly mixed and having a predefined order and there is potentially unlimited set of item typess if user-defined typess are used including all built-in xml schema typess

1726233
javascript	dom
however learning jquery is probably the best way to learn javascript these days as it takes care of the big hurdles that trip up those new to javascript the dom and the event model and makes ajax a breeze

1726273
zero	nan
it correctly handles nan and signed zero

1726274
margins	padding
i will generally always set appropriate margins and padding on elements using css - it s a lot less messy than loads of s all over the place apart from being more semantics correct

1726274
margins	padding
probably the only time i would use a in preferences to the margins and padding set by css even if it s not strictly technically correct is if it was an isolated incident where slightly more spaces was needed

1726276
order	add
now add a column to your selected clause like this case-when t_data_cashierschecksissued.dateissued is null then 0 else 1 end and make that column first in your order by clause

1726276
cursor	row
now in the procedure fetch just one row from this cursor

1726307
punctuation	words
note that this arrays will hold bytes of data not necessarily characters letter numbers and punctuation marks as we typically understand the words character

1726323
attributes	properties
the vertical-align css properties doesn t exactly map to the valign attributes

1726331
hide	show
i ve found great workaround for this - hide table before populating and then show it .when done

1726348
populate	row
notice that doing the updates in a single set-based statement populate each row with a different guid

1726360
fadeout	fadein
if your request is to have a text fadein effect you just have to apply the fadeout to the black layer over it and vice-versa

1726361
selected	checkbox
i d suggest though that in many cases it might be easier to use checkbox to allow for multiple items in the same list to be selected

1726366
checkbox	listbox
you can also do this using javascript if you want to keep the listbox rather than use checkbox

1726375
callback	methods
if you re using jpa via hibernate-entitymanager it s rather trivial to do this via prepersist preupdate callback methods

1726377

eigen	boost	blitz++	boost	blitz++	eigen
but it d be a tragedy if the c++ world revolved around that one libs and boost and poco and wxwidgets and clutter and blitz++ and eigen and and 101 other wonderful things yes gtkmm and ace even were stifled at birth because the gatekeepers of the standard-libs didn t see fit to admit them

1726393
malloc	free
i wouldn t be .so worried about the quantity but the frequency of memory which you leak but if you leak even just a few bytes very very often your malloc s data-structures will grow and might make it dramatically slower to traversal them to allocate new memory and free

1726393
freebsd	linux
does not apply to even remotely dlmalloc-based systemd freebsd linux etc there it s just don t care all you loose there is memory perhaps a few time more than the amount you think and not performance

then your implementation of foo can wrap the call into try-catch to detection exception-handling and do whatever you want to do and then rethrow using throw

1726458
reserved-words	where-clause
i ve tried using a where-clause but i think it chokes because default is a reserved-words

1726468
methodology	waterfall
its major failing is not that construction phase coding is delayed but that design more or less stops .when coding begins because of the impediments to change that the waterfall methodology creates

1726476
order	join
looks like this is what you were trying to do in your where-clause but since join are process before the where-clause during query process following the proper logical order of statement process you re getting an intermediate resultset that is strictly based on preferences combinations as opposed to customer and preferences combinations

1726567
command-line	cmd
grails cmd also run just fine from the command-line

one solution is to use the css styles display inline-block - the link will then work much like an image - flow inline with text but also allow you to set a width height

1726787
put	get
if you were planning to put some bounds-checking in then i d say replace the conversion operators with getpointers functions since in general you don t want to implicit convert a safe thing to an unsafe thing or do what std vector does which is that users get a pointers with

may do something like pass over the params you want to pass into the constructor as a json object and call the constructor with it.

1727098
basic	vb6
imho learning vb6 could be fine if it for learning basic programming concept but it would be better to learn c++ to get concepts even if it s more difficult

1727102
primitive	int
however it just seams really dumb to me that we are forced to work with boxed primitive just because no collections exists to work on primitive int for instances

1727137
contains	set
this table contains restaurant data for nyc - .so the real distribution is not as per the result set

1727138
python	java
i am looking for an enterprise tasks scheduling for python like quartz is for java

and in the last run of loops where 14 as per your other comments here you increment it to 15 and use that which is beyond the end of the arrays

1727254
arrays	loops
and just to clarify that clarification - your loops is correct if you have howmany set to 14 one less than the numbers of arrays elementss since as you points out in a comment elsewhere you load up elements zero before entering the inner loops

1727263
where-clause	sql
use the edit top 200 option then click on show sql panels modify your query with your where-clause and execute the query

1727594
fragmentation	ram
should allow to move the loaded data around as with individual files 1 3 the ram size fragmentation might be an issue

1727602
linux	unix
for network-programming using the c programming language in a unix-like unix linux etc. platform you might want to consider unix network-programming by the legendary richard stevens

1727606
function-call	inline
by letting the compiler know we won t change the reference can it inline the function-call without needless copying of the int

1727608
linux	unix
how i can get hardware information from a linux unix machine

1727624
32-bit	64bit
int is the same size as pointers reference on common 32-bit platform and smaller on 64bit thus you could get yourself a performance disadvantage instead of a benefit

1727629

1727682
.net	wcf
i have a recurring problem .when passing serialization object between non-.net clients and .net wcf service

1727686
radio-button	textbox
in general key-events are not position-specific like mouse events and they target a focused nodes like a radio-button or a textbox

1727690
hash	md5
i m almost certain the answer is no but if you want to be extra paranoid you can precalculate the md5 hash before upload compare that to the md5 hash you get after upload then .when downloading calculate the md5 hash of the downloading data and compare it to your stored hash

1727692
player	movie
don t use nsurlconnection to downloading the data yourself just pass the url to the movie player

1727695
selected	button
we added a button next to selected which change selected s width to default-value .so it becomes non-limited in width

1727697
xsd	xml
question 2 - this demonstrates the danger in starting with the xml xsd in mind and trying to convert that into a dataset

1727725
implements	extends
basically i don t see any benefit in using public class newfunctionality t extends oldfunctionality extends t in comparison with public class newfunctionality extends oldfunctionality public class filterbytype t extends list extends t vs public class filterbytype t implements list t

1727726
configuration	environment
the server configuration file rwp.conf ccrc.conf can be modified to add environment variables using the setenv cmd

png	gif	tiff	png	tiff	gif
how can i checked to see if the image is a png gif tiff and jpg and if .so create the thumbnail and save it to the thumb file

1727739
attributes	properties
you can use the isrequired properties of the data-members attributes to specify that the elements are required

1727748
punctuation	words
basic words splitting uses whitespace and punctuation .

1727748
punctuation	words
make sure you skip sequences of punctuation whitespace instead of count extra words between them

1727768
32-bit	64bit
however even after looking in reference assemblies folder and using the assemblyfolders registry key for 32-bit and 64bit i am still unable to locate some assemblies such as unity p p and office assemblies .when searching for them programmatically

1727772
contains	any
in my case i am assuming i know the types of the columns ahead of time the table does not contains any column headers or row named and does not have any pathological characters that i have to worry about

1727794
setinterval	settimeout
you can do this using settimeout or setinterval

1727796
abstract	extends	implements	abstract	implements	extends
assuming you know beforehand what the variables portion of the query is going to be you could use the template-method-pattern extends the plsqltemplate class and implements a set of abstract variables provider methods to return the specifics of the query

1727796
constructor	object
a preferred approach here would be to construct the plsqltemplate instances with the variables passed in the constructor to ensure a consistent object state

1727802
buffering	capture
you can use named capture buffering

1727821
template-engine	velocity
you can use template-engine like freemarker or velocity

1727825
constructor	object
the idea is that from an object of an unknown types inheriting from a given set of functionality we can create an object of a known types that forwarding all operations to the first object which it takes in its constructor

1727831
hash	md5
what is the probability that the first 4 bytes or first n bytes of a md5 hash computed from the byte sequences will be the same for distinct files

1727831
hash	md5
in case this can not be computed specifically for md5 hash then what is the probability that any hash-function that generator uniformly distribute m-byte hash will compute hash with collision on first n bytes for given range of input

1727859
direct2d	gdi
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net spaces

1727863
textmate	gedit
i d also give a gentle nudge into trying a text-editor instead a full blown ide - i like textmate on os x and gedit on linux

1727865
webserver	upload
but the example doesn t show any way to upload a file to the phone s webserver itself

1727865
webserver	upload
.so how do i handle the user selected a file in a browser and upload the file and the .app running the webserver handling it properly and handing it off to it s own methods

1727868
hash	md5
md5 hash algorithm is designed .so that a small change in the input results in a completely different hash .so i would say that md5 hash bytes are distribute with equals probability i would not bet anything on it anyway

1727868
hash	md5
anyway you can apply a post-processing to your hash for example you can use keyed md5 to increase its randomness and to make it more secure by the way since plain md5 hash have been proved to be insecure

1727871
hash	md5
md5 hash are typically hexadecimals .so there are 16 possible value for each byte

1727887
callback	methods
the basic behaind idea is that callback class methods can be of any named and the callback is not required to derive from some class knowned by callback executor

1727887
return-value	arguments
the only restrictions on callback is input arguments and return-value

1727912
value	field
note the total field has an initial value of 0

1727915
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
set itself doesn t need any quotes except .when its arguments contains special characters like | which the shell itself aready handles

1727918
order	add
if you want to be able to add remove value and keep the distinct-ness you could building a which is basically what i expect distinct is doing under the hood but distinct will obviously return new value as it finds them maintaining order

1727918
dictionary	map
it s simpler than using a dictionary and conceptually cleaner as well as you don t really want to map key to value

1727955
json	xml
then write a class to parsing the xml and generator the grid javascript in the view and a second action to parsing the xml again and generator the json result

1727958
32-bit	64bit
edit i forgot i m running a 64bit processor but was wondering if it would be possible to also disassembly into 32-bit assembly

1727968
linux	unix
under your home-directory on linux unix c users loginname under vista win7 c document and settings.

1727990
ruby-on-rails	rspec
that pretty much means targeting mri 1.8.6 7 ruby-on-rails 2.3.4 consider learning at least haml and rspec in addition to erb and testunit and mysql in an apache nix world

1727990
linux	osx
building on windows by all means - i do without too much pain - but be aware that the visible part of the ruby ruby-on-rails community the people who mostly develop the libs and frameworks and most of those who write about it online are predominantly osx or linux users .so there s often a delay in the trickle-down to windows-users especially where os integration is called for or where there are compiled elements to libs

1727991
safari	opera
safari and opera don t like it

1727994
webserver	upload
if i m understanding your question properly you re not trying to upload a file from the phone to a webserver but the other way round

1728011
put	get
to put it a different way implicit in the concept of callback is that you re going to seem to be called back in-the-same-thread how does this happen how does it get synchronized

1728035
value	field
and all was working fine until the json that came back had a null value for one of the field

1728036
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsarray is a immutable types - .so if you want to add remove value you should use nsmutablearray instead

1728044
primitive	int
c arrays hold primitive int but are quite troublesome due to the limitations of c

1728065
put	get
i would get all the results put them in an arrays of ids and value

1728080
required	checked
i created a lookup to checked this caching for an image each time it is required

1728100
contains	elements
on the other hand childnodes will contains both elements and textnodes

1728122
required	checked
as in every time the user tries to do something which required authentication it will checked to see that this attributes matches before it proceeds

1728136
click	mouse
a submenu required extra click or mouse movement and should be your last resort

1728136
contains	elements
for reference my firefox context menu contains 14 elements and i can find what i want real quickly

1728149
nagios	munin
coming from an all windows environment we had to bite-the-bullet and install linux on vmware to run munin and maby nagios later on

1728160
python	ruby
for dynamic-programming in languages like python and ruby

1728166
blacklist	whitelist
due to limitations i need to write one regex and i would like to blacklist instead of whitelist certain strings or sites

1728169
constructor	private
it typically handles events of arguments passed to its constructor in its private methods and does not raise any events or expose any public methods

1728169
constructor	private
all integration occurs inside them in private methods and events of arguments passed in constructor

1728195
radio-button	selected
this i have achieved by just placing a radio-button control from tool box in the selected this column

1728195
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
the page also has a link button and i want to call a controllers action on this link button click which will receive the index of radio-button selected

1728195
radio-button	selected
.so if i selected 5th radio-button how can receive 5 in the controllers action

1728229
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if file-extension is .html then you should rename it to .php or add addhandler x-httpd-php html definition to httpd.conf or .htaccess

1728254
put	get
use regular expression to get the named value from the json string and put them in the html

1728266
python	java
i m open to either java or a python based libs

1728269
constructor	object
to attach an object types to a simpleformcontroller you need to use the setcommandname and setcommandclass methods i used to call them in the constructor

1728782
required	checked
it doesn t strike me as any different than testing using fixtures it still required that your .yml file be correct and won t checked to make sure you ve created them correctly but it does help you checked that you ve properly used them in your code

1728796
defined	declare
for example if you want to avoid your object being copy-paste you can declare as private the copy-constructor and the assignment-operator and do not defined them then anyone including you who tries to copy the object will have linker errors

1728802
dsa	rsa
finally the pkcs #8 format is not too difficult to parsing and the rsa dsa key-pair object are as per pkcs #11 and relatively easy to convert to a .net x509 once you figure out where all the bits go -- i actually did this in vb.net a while ago but unfortunately am not able to shared that code

1728830
any	set
in this case please ensure that in case of any error then al.so the flag is reset by you .so that the other timer does not wait infinite in case timer task is not able to set the flag for other timers due to the error occurred inside the task .sort of final block should be added to ensure error is handled and flag is always reset

1728874
binaries	install
f php php-cgi.exe or wherever the php binaries are install

1728892
hash	md5
at this hash size the weaknesses in md5 are pretty irrelevant since the best known attacks on md5 take roughly 2 32 computations while one can generator a collision in even an ideally secure 32-bit hash in around 2 16 computations since by merely choosing random input you have 1 in 2 16 chance of a collision .so after roughly 2 16 random guesses you ll probably have found a colliding pair of input

1728899
operators	keyword
there is a like keyword but it is used for something different. instead you need to use matches or contains operators

1728900
instances	self
calling test returns main .when what i intended it to return is - an instances of dummy which was the value of self at the points in the code where i called

1728902
player	movie
the notification trace for both a premature finish initiated by the user and the player naturally reaching the end of the clip appear to be the same the only clue is that you do get access to the timecode at the end of play .so if you know the duration of your movie you can make a pretty good guess

1728906

the provider allows for mongrel thin passenger fastcgi webserver which seems very flexible but i honestly don t know the difference between them

1728978
webserver	nginx
i have looked at passenger on the surface - which does seem very appealing to me - but i was under the impression that passenger wasn t the actual webserver and instead was more like a layer on top of apache or nginx and managed spawned instances of the application like a mongrel cluster

1728980

1728992
interpolation	splines
i presume these are polynomials splines functions therefore you can actually interpolation your dataset near the edges with actual polynomes

1728992

any	set
i would suggest you set your application to be the default virtual hosts in server.xml .so your single virtual hosts can respond to request addressed to any hostsname

1729070
value	field	getter	setter
however .when i removed the getter and setter methods from an entity to have persistent field the value for the corresponding instances variables was not retrieved from the database

1729070
getter	setter
does that mean we must have getter and setter methods even though we have persistent field

1729072

i can recording all things happening onkeyup onkeydown onmousedown onmouseup using textarea cursor positioning and key information and make it cross-browser some time later but i can t handle things like pasting using mouse right button and selected paste or pasting from the menu i can handle onchange but i will have no information is it paste or already recordinged as pressed key and it fires only after focus change

1729104
contains	any
is find any with a child who s value contains the value of the child

anyway just create protected getter and setter methods as a workaround if your provider needs that

1729137
worksheet	excel
i have an excel 2007 worksheet open-with 5 colums and + -5000 rows of data

1729140

1729215
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_15-b03

1729247
nhibernate	ado.net
if you are after a simple crud site then the decision doesn t matter too much but the ability to separate the business layer from the data-layer is quite difficult to accomplish in ado.net where as it s a lot simpler in my opinion with nhibernate

1729251
protected	public
or is there another way to do what i want to do have a public superclass and a set of public base classes that are all in the same assembly and use internal types from that assembly in their common protected code

1729266

the show passwd button can hide the passwd field and show the textfield and copy the value of the passwd field into the textfield

1729275
htmlspecialchars	explode
have you tried adding htmlspecialchars to the explode

1729275

sex explode boom htmlspecialchars s

1729290
pascal	delphi
and free pascal is a delphi compatible pascal compiler for amongst others linux platform

1729303

1729336
thickbox	jquery
inside each block i have some tags with thickbox jquery plugins attached class thickbox

hashtable	set
i m working with a set of legacy dao code that returns an ilist where each hashtable represents the row of a dynamically execute sql query

1729412
meta-inf	jar
normally the files should be in the spring jar springframework.jar meta-inf and on the classpath .when spring can be initiated

1729413
export	csv
if you re export in csv that should be an option

1729479
put	get
simply put its good practise but i would say don t get too hung up on getting 100 right all the time brain power is better spend on other problems than arguing over weather a dl is better than a ul for a given problem etc

1729492
search-engine	seo
semantic html enables effective search-engine optimization seo

1729498
vba	vb6
learn vb6 if you have to deal with legacy application or one of the microsoft office applications that still use vba

1729498
vb.net	vb6
even then the syntax between vb.net and vb6 is close enough to make the transitions easy

1729498
vb.net	vb6
the main issue of switching between vb6 and vb.net is the support libs

1729502
simpletest	phpunit
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729520
contains	elements
you could modify the contains html form elements action properties in the button onclientclick

1729545
json	xml
yaml is more robust about embedding other serialization formats such as json or xml within a yaml file

1729548
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
.when using the mainframe db2 adaptor for microsoft biztalk 2009 is there any way to get the generator schema to contains all the columns in the result set

1729548
contains	elements
we get a simple-schema generator the response contains a recording elements called resultsets with a data structure of xs anytype

1729590
event-listener	listener
the reason is that i have to under infrequent circumstances carry out some lengthy process which delay the thread firing the event and other events listener after this event-listener

1729602
order	add
if order is important you should add a field for that

1729609
one-to-many	entity
instead you ll have two entities with one-to-many associationss to a third entity representing the associations

1729615
defined	declare
that s one of the main reasons that you ll find that templates classes tend to be declare and defined within the scoping of a header file

1729636
contains	set
div with an explicit width set contains a span with

1729636
display	width
available width entire body via display block

1729656
contains	set
similarly it seems you have a types called asb and an entity set contains many instances of that types by the same named

1729662
listbox	textbox
i am writing a user-controls that will act kinda like a dropdownlistfor basically a textbox with a listbox that popup underneath it.

1729675
spaces	output
this is most often because the underlying html that is replace by the sifr output is too small and thus too little spaces is reserved for sifr to use

1729678
arrays	loops
then you can loops through this arrays and do stuff with the internal properties of each like .so

1729705
return-value	arguments
an identical function with the same zero arguments and int return-value but different named works just fine

1729708
gwt-rpc	gwt
server-side integration is supported in gwt using gwt-rpc etc

1729711
base-class	inherited
i have managed to serialization a class that inherited from a base-class to xml

splines interpolation

1729755
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1729782
lighting	shading
after this you d also need some kind of shading based on lighting

1729791
ironpython	ironruby
the specific example i have in mind is writing an application in c# but using ironruby or ironpython to write the tests

1729791
ironpython	ironruby
as i see it using ironpython and ironruby have several advantages over c# code as a testing language

1729806
innodb	myisam
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and insert than myisam

1729806
innodb	myisam
we know that myisam is faster than innodb .when we don t have many concurrent updates insert

1729806
innodb	myisam
1 but .when it is time to change from myisam to innodb

1729818
arrays	loops
before the input loops to make sure the arrays is clear rather than the nested for s to zero out just the sums

1729853
any	set
the databinding methods basically wipes out any previous state you have set on the combo-box

1729853
listitem	selected
it is the index of the listitem in the dropdown s collections of items such that dropdown dropdown.selectedindex will give you the item from the list that is marked as selected

1729854
callback	methods
this takes advantage of the callback methods that the .load function allows you to implements

1729860
hide	show
it should hide or show tooltip on each button click

1729860
hide	show
now the weird thing going on is .when i click on the hide button it hide itself and .when i click on show nothing happens

1729897
hide	show
if you hide it with code placed in an external css file you will not be able to show it again with javascript

1729938
sql-function	in-clause
i was using sql-function projection for applying the substring on the required column and added that projection as part of an in-clause restrictions

1729944
json	xml
i do think that developing separate json xml or classic viewresult actions is not the best way to go

1729946
abstract-class	subclassing
if you leverage abstract-class and methods you can force subclassing to implements the missing methods

1729948
python	ruby	jruby	mri
similarly with ruby you could ask about the difference between ruby and python or jruby and mri but the difference between ruby and jruby doesn t make sense

1729959
json	xml
this filtering is based on the the onactionexecute methods which is run after the action methods is execute inorder to json or xml serialization the returned model

1729963
executable	jar
the a directory seems to contains the headers and the binary executable javac jar etc

1729990
contains	any
any class contains an abstract-class in php required your parent class to be abstract too

1730017
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
as a general rules you should let the database management systemd handle filtering grouping and sorting that you need

1730021
strategy-pattern	factory-pattern
you may use strategy-pattern combined with factory-pattern

1730035
arrays	loops
although java 1.5 instroduced a for-each loops which will loops automatically over arrays like .so

1730039
python	ruby
testing ruby python with ruby python works great you can fake object in any numbers of ways

1730039
python	ruby
but testing c# with ruby python can lead to more complexity than may be desired

1730039
python	ruby
mocking libs like pymock or mocha will not work for tests like this because the code under test has strong-typing dependencies and the fake object generator by ruby python frameworks will not conform to those dependencies

1730039
ironpython	ironruby
i would love to see the situation improve as both ironruby and ironpython mature but right now the testing c# story isn t .so good

1730060
value	field
in a certain table i have a vartext field which include comma-separated value of country-codes

1730072
any	set
the sequences is separate from the table and a single sequences can be used to populate any table and the value in a column in some table may mostly come from a sequences or set of sequencess except for the value manually generator

1730083
value	field
in a certain table i have a vartext field which include comma-separated value of country-codes

1730104
jeditorpane	jtextpane
a jtextpane or jeditorpane will do this for you automatically without the need for the above code

1730105
attributes	properties
throw an error saying invalid attributes value templates for properties properties

1730147
triggers	insert
one approach that i ve used successfully before not on mysql though is to place a triggers on the table that splits the value based on a specific delimiter into discrete value insert them into a sub-table

1730147
triggers	insert
it involves a bit of work in the triggers too as every change to table means that associated rows in cc_list_table have to be deleted updates insert as appropriate but is an approach that works in situations where the original table table has to retain its original structure but where you are free to adapt the query as you see fit

1730150
value	field
the first rules of normalize says you should change multi-value columns such as cc_list into a single value field for this very reason

1730161
checkbox	textbox
.when the contact changes there are several textbox and checkbox that will updates to allow editing of that contact s details

1730167
common-lisp	scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme	lisp
my first lisp learning experience was with scheme i ve never touch common-lisp felt it was too complex and am now starting on clojure

1730167
python	java	contains	elements
on the other hand if you have good java and python knowledge you might not mind diving straight into clojure because unlike scheme it contains elements of these other two languages data-structures reminiscent of python and jvm java-api centric tutorials and the familiar terrain might help

1730167
python	java
since i did come from all three java python scheme i find myself in a good positioning to appreciate just what clojure brings to the table that is different from scheme

1730167
scheme	lisp
i m no experienced schemer but i d say that if you immediately start with clojure you will still get the general lisp experience .so you definitely won t be missing that by forgoing scheme

1730192
exception-handling	try-catch
one is to have try-catch block inside my test case but even if i do this my junit test case does not say caused an error though the exception-handling is posted to standards output

1730206
swing	gwt
i use gwt frequently and i believe it is quite easy to migrate from applets swing to gwt

1730206
swing	gwt
but you can only use a subset of the java libs .so don t expect that you can just compile a swing .app and run it with gwt

1730218
value	field
during a field read operation a reference cannot be collected from the time the value is pushed onto stack until the .ldfld cmd has completed

1730226
javascript	dom
since placing javascript dom methods in the bottom of the html page after body is a lot faster than using the jquery ready event shouldnt we be forcing it by doing

1730242
fclose	fopen
i think this is because you re opening closing file within loops try moving fopen before foreach and fclose after it

1730263
innodb	myisam
2 with only 2-3 tps you will not see any significant difference between innodb and myisam

1730284
autoit	vba
i have successfully worked around this using sendkey inside vba or autoit .when sendkey is not enough and selected the control via keystrokes and sometimes mouse-clicks as necessary

1730293
textbox	button
i have a textbox and a search button on the form and it does a wildcard search of whatever the user enters in the textbox and display the recording in other controls text and combo boxes

1730317
innodb	myisam
say you have 16g of ram you would probably want to use about 12g for an innodb buffering pool provided you have no myisam tables

1730317
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have only myisam tables you probably want to turn innodb off completely and give a bit less than half say 6g to your myisam key caching

1730317
innodb	myisam
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you find that innodb is much slower for insert updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1730330
dependency-injection	inject
one common approach is to use some form of dependency-injection to inject a dialog service and use the service

1730340
value	field
for example if you want to customise field2 below you make the field named the key and the options arrays the value

1730352
directory	folder
i think you can just #include the files that you need from the main folder you will have to make it accessible from all the sites using soft links will cause the server to think they are in each site s directory

1730373
sql-server	mysql
this will work on ms sql-server you may need to lookup syntax for which dbms you are using for example it looks like mysql uses end case instead of just end

1730375
jquery	dojo
flex that are alternatives to javascript as the primary implementation mechanism but i am seeing an awful lot of interest in jquery and dojo

1730399
silverlight	wpf
btw just in case yes general richness of triggers as found in wpf is not supported in silverlight but the loaded event is a special case

1730407
debugging	trace
please note that i am referring to debuggingging information like line numbers in stack trace not the debugging level of loggers

1730416
any	set
yes set the selectionstyle for any cell that shouldn t be selectable to uitableviewcellelectionstylenone

1730417
digits	zero
if it is because you want some report that queries the table to display one digits value as 3 digitss add the padding zero .when you display it

1730418
numeric	zero
it lets you defined a numeric column that is padded with zero

1730452

firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730453
google-chrome	opera
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730495
show	next
being a block i can t simply put another elements next to it and hope it show up there -- it show up just below it

1730495
checkbox	button
.so what i m looking for is the checkbox to appear immediately to the right of the elements but without having to completely muck up the styling of the button

1730495
checkbox	button
absolute positioning of the checkbox using the known size of the button seems wrong and dirty

1730507
constructor	object
alternatively you can stubs the log object in your junit test and inject it into the dao via an alternative constructor

1730512
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730512
google-chrome	opera
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730528
scala	java
although the solution is in plain java but you can still modify to scala syntax to just use it

1730536
constructor	private	constructor	object
in particular i suspect that the private or protected constructor pattern that is controlling construction through the companion-object or another class or object s methods might not have an obvious implementation

1730551
webforms	asp.net
if you were to do this using asp.net 3.5 sp1 webforms you would have to create a seperate imagehttphandler that implements ihttphandler to handle the response

1730553
execution	jobs
you mitigate that by execution your programs with the least privileges required to do their jobs

1730554
administration	account
the local account has effectively full administration privileges on the local machine

1730568
administration	account
if your service has a bug which can allow attacker to execute arbitrary code like buffering overflow he can do everything with your computer if service is running under local systemd account which is equivalent to administration account

1730596
contains	set
now the problem in your original case is that .when you set a variables to a string that contains double-quotes the double-quotes are later not interpreter as shell quote symbols but just as normals letters

1730621
msbuild	nant
i m interested to hear about people working with building .net applications using msbuild nant or similar tools

1730636
visual-studio	sharpdevelop	sharpdevelop	monodevelop
if you feel that visual-studio is expensive you can try the express editions or go for monodevelop or sharpdevelop

this code works fine in ie but it doesn t work in any other browser tried it in google-chrome firefox and safari

1730672
msbuild	nant
i tend to use a hybrid of msbuild and nant .when working with asp.net project

1730672
msbuild	nant
.when this is the case i ll have nant call msbuild and pass in the project file to handle the compilation and then use nant for everything else

1730676
scrollable	panels
or you can create a custom panels and implements the scrollable interface

1730677

1730695
msbuild	nant
i don t know anyone that is using nant or msbuild instead of the ide

1730697
32-bit	64bit
to answer your second question if the code has been compiled into a fat binary with both 64bit and 32-bit you can use otool -arch i386 -tv to disassembly the 32-bit splice of the binary

1730702
common-lisp	scheme
with this in mind the direct translation of scheme into common-lisp gives

1730740

1730761
32-bit	64bit
4 bytes for 32-bit and 8 bytes to 64bit

1730784
strong-typing	types
of course the new dynamic types can be used to achieve much the same but this is still not the same â implicit interfaces still allow strong-typing which i find important

1730786
abstract-class	subclassing	abstract-class	pure-virtual	pure-virtual	subclassing
from you question it is not too clear what the problem is - looking at the title using non-abstract-class as base i can tell you that using an abstract-class non pure-virtual - .when you talk about interfaces in c++ i am assuming pure-virtual abstract-class as base makes sense only if there is common functionality you can shared between subclassing - meaning that a numbers of classes extends the same abstract-class inheriting the common implementation

1730789
beyondcompare	svn
for instances if you have graphics stored in svn beyondcompare can show you an xor-based difference of the images

1730795

reflection	runtime
with dynamic clients cxf generator sei and bean classes at runtime and allows you to invoke operations via apis that take object or by using reflection to call into full proxy

1730863
postgresql	mysql
my general thoughts on foreign key is that they re great but not usable in mysql and that postgresql handles them much better

1730865
virtual-functions	base-class
if the other developer has written a base-class with no virtual-functions then those functions do not need to be overrides and it is correct to defined them in a non-abstract base-class

1730868
identity-column	sql-server
here s the trick you can use sql-server s alter table...switch statement to change the schema of a table without changing the data meaning you can replace a table with an identity with an identical table schema but without an identity-column

1730871
nsstringencoding	nsdata
- nsdata datausingencoding nsstringencoding encoding

1730915
order	add
this is not automatic you have to add a foreign key constraint on the customer_id column of the order table

1730915
innodb	myisam
as others pointed out note that both tables need to be innodb tables foreign key constraints are not supported by the myisam storage engine that will ignore them

1731046
defined	declare
you want to declare methods in the .h file and defined them in the .cpp file

1731060
pure-virtual	base-class
inversion-of-control and has-a relationships is a more common way to do that nowadays split the functionality of the base-class into a numbers of interfaces -- pure-virtual base-classes -- and then have the object that currently derive from the base-class instead have member variables of those interfaces

1731075
accessor	ivar
if there is no accessor then the ivar will be set directly using the objective-c runtime functions to find it by named

1731075
accessor	ivar
the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

1731075
accessor	ivar
the main reason why you would want an accessor for an outlet is the same as for any other ivar or properties you want to publishing

1731076
any	set
i can ensure that any request to an administration feature has to have admin in the subdomain but how can i make sure that if the admin click anything else on the site such as a link to mydomain.com about_company that they would get off of the admin hosts domain and gets set back to the regular www.mydomain.com

1731302
double-quotes	single-quotes
mysql s default mode allows you to use single-quotes and double-quotes interchangeably and back-quotes for delimited identifier

1731302
value	field
that way if you reference the same field in both clauses one to search for an old value and the other to set a new value you won t conflict

1731302

1731517
arrays	loops
you can put the time and arrays to use in an arrays and loops them to selected

1731527
droppable	draggable
this works because the event is fired first droppable rather than draggable

1731529
subroutine	scoping
i m wondering if anyone if aware of a language that has support for variables that could be considered global and subroutine functions but without a concept of parameter-passing local scoping etc

1731546
linked-list	nodes
ok but nodes structure you show seems to belong to double linked-list not a stack

1731555
display	height
an iframe display the chunks and embedding foundation.css would help but i fear for the user s workflow .when 5-10 iframes have to be rendering and then adjusted in height via javascript once they are loaded

1731561
pointers	stack
if you are implements a stack to hold typess like char and double why not declare an arrays of each types and hold a pointers to the last valid elements in the arrays

1731570
data-structures	dictionary
it may be that the actual types put into that dictionary are entirely within your control but it is worth bringing up because simpler and more controlled data-structures are generally speaking easier and faster to serialization

1731587
superclass	inherited
have you considered creating a superclass for all widget .so that there will be a common set of methods they will always inherited

1731592

1731832
scala	java	perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java	erlang	scala	erlang	perl	erlang	python
to start off with clients using this protocols will be written in ruby java and .net and then possibly branch off into python perl scala erlang etc.

1731871
constructor	object
.when you use placement-new you re essentially telling the compiler i know this memory is good skip allocation and use this-pointers for my object. your object s constructor is then called using the pointers provided by operators new whether or not it was memory that was just allocated or specified by using placement-new

1731877
attributes	properties
the function you used to highlight the error control sets the css properties background-color to red using the jquery.css function which puts the rules in the styles attributes on the elements

1731880
triggers	insert
i would use a triggers on table a which updates table b with the sum of the field after any insert updates deletes in table a

1731889
sql-server	mysql
therefore my question is if you can checked the recursive with query using other databases like mysql db2 sql-server and others

postback	ajax
updatepanel intercept the postback and make a request back to the server using the xmlhttprequest object they use ajax

1732056
textbox	button
you might want to have the updatespanel updates together on a button click as opposed to having the updates attached to an event on each textbox it sounds like you have them attached to the blur event

1732060
selected	button
i was able to set the text color of a selected linkbar button by disabledcolor styles of linkbar

1732060
selected	button
accordingly i expect to set the background-color of the selected button by backgrounddisabledcolor styles however it didn t work

1732062
contains	elements
in this case nodes will contains all of the menuitem elementss that are a child of the top-level menu elements

with this scheme i have fine control over the html as djangoâ s templates handler lets me control idâ s and classes for the div elements that contains the sketches as well as the canvas elements

1732121
required	checked
i ve checked the java libs a bit further and i think that its providing everything required for client-side and server-side code

1732153
localization	translation
personally i would keep anything national outside the java source and use the localization features to lookup translation strings for simple key and they are placed in your java code

1732171
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
i am a developer with extensive experience in java ruby php python etc

1732173

apply this background-color change mechanism for all invalid field - preferably combined with a mechanism that display some error messages if the user submit anyway

1732222
linux	unix
almost every versioning of unix including linux and mac os has a cmd called file that recognizes a huge range of file types by their content

1732229
contains	set
if you want a file that contains only this information rather than having it written to your console you can use this switching with logfile set to some path

1732238
paintcomponent	draw
really what you should be doing is have your own jpanel overwrite paintcomponent and draw the images into the appropriate dimension using java graphics

1732274

on the other hand a java virtual-machine implements in python

1732383
perl	ruby
and don t expect ruby perl etc.

1732383
contains	any
virtual machines contains precompile routines which are general enough to to execute any combinations of logical operations

1732383
python	java
the java virtual-machine the python virtual-machine and all the other general-purpose virtual-machines out there are equals in the sense that they can be coaxed into performing any logic you can dream up but they are different in terms of what tasks they take on and what tasks they leave to the programmer

1732383
python	java
by a python interpreter virtual-machine implements in java running on a java

1732385
checkbox	button
however as the other answers have stated you might want to consider using checkbox instead since radio button aren t really meant for this sort of thing

1732396
highlight	selected
i recall seeing a website that .when you highlight selected text on their page it produced a small balloon just to the upper right which was clickable and would perform some action .when click

1732411
fatal-error	crash
if you need to shut down allegro earlier than this because of a fatal-error then you could just call exit in which case no destructor get run but your program still won t crash

1732434
exception-handling	error-handling
you might also take the opportunity to wrap the service call with some error-handling - maybe catch the specific exception-handling being throw system.net.webexception-handling

1732437
configuration	environment
i ve always put it in configuration environment test.rb and the put the debugger at the breakpoints in my app-code as opposed to the specifications

1732441

i work with .net website .so for most sites i d have a different configuration file for each environment

1732452
json	xml
typically i like to building restful server-side interfaces where a url maps to resources that spits out data in some platform independent context such as xml or json

1732452
python	php
if not django any other python framework that s already built with this in mind .so i do not have to reinvent the wheel as i already have in languages like php

1732455
groovy	java
either a java or groovy code example would be fine

1732465
children	tree
i have a parent child table simple tree table structure id parentid where i want to delete and get the id of all children for a given parent id - similar to this .post sql-server cascade delete and parent child table

1732475

1732523
value	field
making sure a field s value is always read or written to memory and never optimized by reading or writing

1732537
contains	any
but without showing any notifications to the user and immediately deleting the messages that contains for example some keyword

1732537
communication	messages
what i need is to have some communication between android phones one to one and i thought that sending sms messages would solve the problem but the sms notification are not needed for that maybe the wap push messages would better for that but i have no idea how to send them from android phone

1732539
synchronous	.when
2 even .when it would be synchronous you are only giving a return-value from the inner function .so the sessionstatus would return nothing

1732553
updatepanel	ascx
the ascx control is in an updatepanel

1732593
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i love asp.net-mvc - never going back to webforms - this is how web development should be

1732598
triggers	insert
you could emulate such functionality with triggerss but you would need to create both an insert and an updates triggers for it to work

1732601
contains	any
that is if my input string is aabcdef i don t want any of the permutation to contains more than two a characters

1732611
value	field
if the field is used by more than one user then you probably should automatically format the value in some standards way that accommodates the majority of your users but that should be done .when the value is stored on the backend not .when focus leaves the field

1732611
numeric	zero
an exception-handling would perhaps be changing blank to 0 for numeric field in situations where obviously blank none zero but again this probably should be done .when storing in the backend not in the field itself

1732618
getter	setter
the only thing i can see that i would change is to remove the private field in foopresenter and stick with just the properties with a public getter and private setter

1732644
value	field
i iterate through each field in the current recording and copy that value to the new table

1732644
value	field
it works fine until i get to my lookup column field that allows multiple value

1732644
value	field
i believe the value of a multivalued field are stored in an arrays but i cannot access the value in vba code

1732644
value	field
i don t understand how access stores multiple value in one field

1732680
output	cat
output all messages what contains at least one words from that tuples .so my cat is in the car cat is not allowed in the cinema i will drive my car to the cinema

1732705
macros	vba
basically you can t return a value from a vba macros called from your c# code using application.run .so you have to re.sort to passing an object by value that has a methods or properties that can be called from vba to set the instances

1732709
required	checked
i am running into crc checked failed error i guess because the gzip crc field appears at the eof and it required the entire gzipped file to decompression

ie mobile generally uses a user-agent with something like windows-ce or windows-mobile

1732738
set	bag
this would happen if you didn t have cascade save-update on your set bag

1732745
selected	button
if you need to adjust the selected color or if you need something more advanced than just skinsning the button background you ll need to write a custom skins class

1732745
selected	button
this isn t too difficult - the button class has a whole set of selected styles - selecteddownskin selectedupskin selecteddisabledskin etc

1732769
administration	account
you can change this easily with control panels regional-settings for the current user and if you are an administration also for the default user which is used for systemd account that are often used for windows-services

1732780
selected	checkbox
you can include exclude dynamically in both sql and c# using bitwise logic which lets you instantly hydrate checkbox lists and selected lists in asp.net while still only storing a single 64bit numbers to hold any combinations of selectedion

1732804
bison	yacc
project that use flex lex for tokenizing typically use yacc bison for the actual parsing

1732808
any	set
the problem with running any set of partials syntax checked against the properties files is that they ll always be inadequate by definition unless you capture every partials variation acceptable by the logging systemd.in which case you ll have recreate a portion of the logging systemd

1732817
appkit	nsbox
in the appkit several view subclassing such as nsbox and nstext also implements -sizetofit

1732818
put	get
you can use a guid to get 128 bits which will put the problem off for a while but ultimately you will need to add additional field

1732825
credentials	account
there are no user credentials to steal or nefarious things to do with people s account and privileges because there are no account or privileges

1732834

that being said i want to have the views have the types specific field on it and the model binder to bind against a hidden-field value

1732880
key-value	key
for a column declare as a primary key if you attempt to delete the row or change the primary key-value it must be true that no foreign key columns linked to that primary key contains that value

1732881
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
adding that at the end of your svg and adding the appropriate elements ids works in opera 10 firefox 3.5 and safari 4.0 at least

1732881
font-size	height
and while you re at it you could use getbbox too to get the text elements s bounding-box .so you can set the height of the rectangle to match the font-size too in case you ever decide to change the font-size

1732886
plugins	add-on
because u might have to spend equals time in finding out about the tool settings plugins add-on for the tools at same time while you are doing your development .so keep your main work of development relatively easier and less complex

1732906
pylons	django
.when serving static pages i d rather avoid having django or pylons handle the request and handle it with the webserver only

1732910
.when	ready
.when you are lazy-evaluation to think you can use ready structures

1732920
traversal	parent
traversal visual tree of logical parent

1732930
put	get
for starters you ll get a large degree of code-reuse since you ll be able to put other front ends on top of the restful service

1732942
dynamic-programming	memoization
i am surprised nobody mentioned this yet because dynamic-programming seems a better approach rather than recursion + memoization

1732952
highlight	selected
this is designed to work inside of words and allows you to export xhtml based on what is highlight or selected in the document

1732955
show	next
this code creates a div within a div and then on mouseover show the internal and therefore topmost div changes the background of the lower outermost div to the next one in the cycle and then fade out the upper image

1732971
any	set
at any rate is your sharepoint logging level set to an appropriately verbose level to debugging weird stuff like this

1732983
buffering	capture
however since it can take time to process stuff especially if you re using delayed capture and most people get replacement cards months in advance i m thinking you would want to err on the side of giving yourself a buffering

1732992
duplicates	contains
if i am joining 3 tables each contains a duplicatess column named the order of the tables in the selected statement will determine what data i am getting for the duplicates column

1733009
export	report
suggestion you can export your report to pdf and open it using the browser i believe this would be better than loading an applet each time

1733018
margins	padding
other solutions padding margins are more tedious in that you need to calculate the right value based on the image s dimension but also don t effectively allow the containers to be smaller than the image

1733028
.when	ready
.when poll or equivalent has signaled that you re ready to write issue the write

1733032
msbuild	nant
we use nant instead of msbuild but the problem is the same

1733045
version-control	cvs
while it seems silly to break with well known developer-tools such subversion or mercurial zope was developed in the late 90s .when the only free version-control systemd was cvs

1733045
version-control	cvs
zope 2 had it s own simple version-control capabilites and they were as good as cvs which is to say they were limited and sucky.

1733053
json	xml
i have remote cmd in plain text and might want to have the data back in xml json

1733073
python	java
it s been used as python list.sort and is now going to be the new array.sort in java 7

1733102

then you can handle the contextmenustrip s opening event checked to see if there is selected text in the textbox and modifying the menu s items just before it is show change your search google item s visible properties

1733109
web-crawler	seo
for seo i don t think this would hurt anything since web-crawler aren t run on mobile-devices

1733129
for-loop	arrays	arrays	map
i am having some trouble creating a for-loop within a constructor to iterate over a map and an arrays at the same time

1733129
arrays	loops
the var-arg expression evaluates to an arrays of int .so i tried to put both enhanced iterator in the same loops but didn t work

1733163
python	c++	python	java
in more modern languages such as java python c# this is a trivial matter but not .so for c++

1733186
jquery-plugins	jquery

1733196
duplicates	contains
before the insert you look for the numbers if it already exists you updates the line contains the duplicates phone-numbers

1733218
arguments	default
different prolog implementation could potentially index different numbers of arguments by default

1733218
arguments	default
according to the swi reference manual it only indexes the first arguments by default

1733230
png	gif
you could simply make your logo a gif png with transparency and set it as the background and then animate the backgroundcolour css attributes between these value building off the previous scripting

1733248
constructor	object
a constructor gets called .when you create an instances of an object new

1733260
build-process	release
as of dojo 1.4 not yet release but the code is in the subversion trunk of dojo you can now use closure compiler as an option for the dojo build-process

1733268
thickbox	jquery	put	get
but now i m curious if i can get the html normally given and put it in something like the link from a jquery thickbox overlay.

1733270
nested	order
i have a form with a nested object customer order and it works except that it keeps creating a new customer recording

1733273
oracle	mysql
we use oracle on a project and would like to also support mysql

1733273
oracle	mysql
would we need to maintain two different sets of ibatis sql resource-files one for each dialect or is it possible to have a single set of sql supporting both mysql and oracle

1733273
oracle	mysql
the oracle sequences the mysql limit vs

1733287
contains	elements
i ve checked this using firebug and i know for sure that elements equals #linea and data x .inlinecontent contains the correct data but i keep getting the same

1733299
oracle	mysql
a good rules of thumb is to try and stick to sql-92 which most dbmses support in particular both oracle and mysql

1733299
oracle	mysql
limit is a famo.us one to limit the numbers of rows to retrieve in the results list mysql uses limit n at the end of the query oracle uses rownumbers in the where-clause which is pain for you also need to reference it in the selected list...

1733300
oracle	mysql
to start mysql uses auto increment value and oracle uses sequences

1733310
export	report
i want to export these report as rss or atom-editor feed

1733310
rome	feed
i can easily create feed with rome .lib for java

1733310
push	pull
i need some kind of proxy-server where can i push my feed and clients will be able to pull content from that server

1733314
oracle	mysql
i believe that maintaining a single set of sql resource-files with mysql and oracle has several disadvantages as being caught between backward compatibility and solve a particular problem

1733325
post-build-event	pre-build-event
this will cause msbuild to import your file after the microsoft.common.targets file gets import and it will overrides the post-build-event and pre-build-event targets and make them do nothing

1733329
any	set
but that would pass on any of the other email related errors ive set validation up to catch incorrect formatting blank etc

1733333

1733399
directory	folder
i assume the directory you are trying to delete is within the website folder

1733409
ubuntu	debian
from what i understand though i m not sure exactly why at all debian from which ubuntu is derived uses a dist-packages naming scheme instead of site-packages

1733409
ubuntu	debian
terminology python has package and debian and .so ubuntu has package

1733417
selected	listbox
.when you rightclick in the listbox that the rightclicked item will be selected

1733443
database-table	mysql
i am working on some php mysql 5 web project involving a database-table that uses not indexed guid strings as its identifier for rows

1733458
output	cat
.when one reads a file lets say a dd image or we read from a hard-drive itself with cat dev sda the output is usually mush in some form of hex

1733458
binary	hex
since these are actually binary files is there a way to see the binary instead of the hex

1733458
binary	hex
i instead would like to see the actual binary instead of a interpretation in hex

1733465
arrays	loops
to loops through the accumulator arrays required that the accumulator divide the hough spaces into a discrete grid

1733470
integration	payment
the actual pattern of integration could be the same user x specifies the payment user y changes it

1733475
unsigned	bigint
alternatively you can also explicit cast your unsigned value to be signed bigint value and then do the subtraction

1733486
relational-database	schema
in an abstract kind of way you might consider the relationships between tables in a relational-database schema a kind of design pattern 1-to-many many-to-one many-to-many one-to-one

1733512
controllers	routes
i went back to simply creating my named routes and spent a little more time in the controllers .so that i could keep my routes simple

1733519
background-color	display
i am trying to implements an application in which i display a color image as background-color of the custom view.once the user touches a particular area on the image display as background-color of the view the pixels where the touch has occured should be retrieved and the corresponding color should be created using uicolor

1733552
compact-framework	.net
i m developing a windows-mobile 5.0 and above application with c# .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2

1733555
output	cat
most data on a hdd is binary-data not meant to represent printable characters .so if you use cat a cmd meant to output text not binary you get meaningless mush

1733555
binary	octal	binary	hex	octal	hex
hex and octal are close enough to binary

1733587
arp	tcp
your description suggests that the peer arp entries expire between tcp segments and cause some subsequent segments to fail due to the lack of a current mac destination

1733638
required	checked
then again this does required constantly checked if a header is no longer necessary

1733646
hide	show
i want to hide or show a column based on variables data from a users selection

1733651
put	get
i have put effort in and completed everything in the form that the instructor taught but i must have misunderstood .when he went over the part of the lecture covering the set and get methods

1733651
implements	extends
public class readpayrollfile extends jframe implements actionlistener windowlistener

1733655
textures	fbo
one way to do this is to create an fbo frame buffering object with a rendering buffering attached rendering your minimap to it and then bind the fbo to a textures

1733669
local-variables	class-variables
for all of the settext methods you have local-variables that overrides the class-variables

1733676
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
could it be possible to use it with mono sharpdevelop and express editions of vs instead of visual-studio itself

1733682
aggregate	grouping
first of course you should try to aggregate all your measures grouping by surrogate key involved

1733708
children	nodes
an alternative to the xslt approach is to write your own utility methods which sorts the children of a specified nodes in descending or ascending order using a specified comparator

1733720
key-value-store	redis
lookup redis - it s a key-value-store written in c and operating as a server db

1733721
contains	set
setwitharrays receives an arrays contains the object to add to the new set

1733729
constructor	object
now our paginator is an aggregate instead of a composite meaning it does not initializer object inside itself but required them to be passed to it in the constructor

1733736
associations	model
there are only two options model the attributes as associations with the boolean data types or use an ocl constraint

1733741
compatibility	platform
my question is there a tool which given a .net-assembly can present some kind of silverlight compatibility report which would indicate the changes that must be made to the .net codebase inorder to bring it as close as possible to the silverlight platform

1733754
push	pull
another advantage of mercurial is that you can push and pull updates from your peer without disturbing the main repository

1733754
push	pull
a common scenario is .when 2 developers are working together on a story and they can push pull from each other while the story is work in progress

1733756
decimal-point	digits
this gives you 38 digits to the left of the decimal-point 1e38

1733783
directory	folder
i have this piece of code which copies a plist file to the applicationsupport directory in the users folder

1733784
hide	show
you can also use the show and hide functions rather than play with the css of the elements or even toggle if you show hide the same elements

1733789
transitions	coverflow
i think there is just a fade transitions between the tabbarcontroller view and the coverflow view

1733797
linux	unix
you have to use the right case-when manipulating files on linux unix

1733797
linux	unix
this is a bad habit taught by spending too much time on windows rather than a linux unix problem

1733803
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
then to do a case-insensitive file open you split the pathname into components search the in-memory tree using case-insensitive search bulid the real case-sensitive pathname and use that to do the file open

1733834
interpolation	contour
but this would mean that i have to go extra miles to create such a matrix by using griddata interpolation first before talking about contour generator

1733854
rvm	gem
.when using rvm you will need to install gem separately for ruby 1.9 and 1.8

1733870
innodb	myisam
frm files for myisam or v3.idb v3.frm for innodb

1733873

i have a xml and xsd i want to add a recording to trck table with dataset i m also write that code but need tracklistrow..

1733880
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
wikipedia told me to use mergesort as it s the only one of the three common general-purpose sorting algorithms heapsort mergesort and quicksort which performs well .when random-access is slow and even provided a link to simon tatham s implementation

1733882
implements	extends
you can extends the extension points org.eclipse.ui.startup and implements org.eclipse.ui.istartup to checked the cmd-line arguments and invoke your own cmd

1733890
msbuild	nant
i m considering writing my own delivery code using powershell and or c# maybe shelling to nant or msbuild

1733890
msbuild	nant
endeavor compared to using nant or msbuild

1733890
msbuild	nant
however i don t understand why not use c# and simply call nant and or msbuild tasks as needed

1733890
environment	building
nant is far far easier to set up your building to do automatic testing deploy to multiple production environment integrated with cruisecontrol.net for an entry environment integrated with source control

1733890
msbuild	nant
we ve gone through .so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripting etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box

1733890
msbuild	nant
while you could do all this with regular scripting using nant or msbuild give you a solid framework for doing all this

1733901
instance-variables	local-variables
your local-variables in writerecord have the same named as the instance-variables and thus are hiding them

1733908
stderr	stdout
the errors probably go to the error streaming stderr not the output streaming stdout

1733911
virtual-machine	virtualbox
you can run android in a virtual-machine virtualbox using a android iso

1733916
any	set
it any control within the form but not the form itself to access the form itself set control to this

1733917
malloc	free
i would call malloc and free only once

1733922
packaging	building	environment	building
if you see your project or environment staying somewhat static then there s no reason not to pen your own building packaging and deployment scripting

1733922
build-process	nant	build-process	msbuild	msbuild	nant
some of the advantages msbuild nant and other commercial product offer is pre-baked support for integration with common service or concepts say zipping up files and it costs considerably less time to bolt it into your build-process

1733924
sql-server	mysql
it needs to connect to different databases like mysql en sql-server and odbc

1733945
malloc	free
using malloc you simply call free with exactly the pointers

1733951
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
this approach will support mysql sql-server oracle etc as per the .net libs has security auth can use custom routes to do your a b c -

1733961
msbuild	nant
if you are xml friendly then go with msbuild or nant

1733963
constructor	private
if the class does not have one i.e the zero arguments constructor of the class you are trying to create has been explicit declare private or package depending on where the methods is called from you will get an illegalaccessexception

1733966
stderr	stdout
you must read out the stderr and stdout streaming of the started process else it will hang .when the os-specific bufffer for it is filled

1733967
msbuild	nant
at the end of the day both msbuild and nant tasks can shell out to the command-line .so ultimately they could support non-ms stuff

1733968
collabnet	svnadmin	visualsvn	collabnet	visualsvn	svnadmin
i had both collabnet svn server and visualsvn install and was getting errors until i made sure i was using the versioning of svnadmin that came with visualsvn which i had used to create the repositories

1734012
msbuild	nant
nant was nice msbuild is ok i guess but i feel more and more draw to write code in well a language instead of some xml-based procedural stuff

1734021
stderr	stdout
you need to read stdout and stderr to capture all process output and do this concurrently to prevent blocking of the spawned process

1734033
webforms	asp.net
what is the recommended way of designing asp.net webforms using div and span

1734045
contains	elements	contains	set
.when you run python src test python test_power_estimator.py the first elements in sys.path is set to the directory contains the test_power_estimator.py scripting not the current directory

1734050
double	int	unsigned	short
several convenience types definitions are declare qreal for double uchar for unsigned char uint for unsigned int ulong for unsigned long and ushort for unsigned short

1734055
duplicates	lookup
if my .app conquers the world i can still add a db lookup to avoid duplicates but for now i will stick to it

1734097
scala	java
what do you think about scala and should i use it instead of java

1734097
scala	java
edit and do you think google s noop fan or scala can take the leadership from java in the near future which one have chance in your opinion

1734117
.when	ready
anyway -- .when i say programming language and minimally useful i the core language ready working ffi for calling c code and an emacs ide at least as useful as quack

1734120
scala	java
.so you may want to encode the lower-levels of your .solution in java and then wrap these in scala to provide a more flexible and agile .solution in terms of rewriting business-logic at a higher level

1734123
jquery	.post
you can attach that to the elements using jquery s data methods make all changes to both the â realâ elements.style and the lookup object then retrieve all set styles from the lookup .when you re about to .post

1734142
listbox	textbox
it doesn t work listbox is filled in with one item textbox is filled in with this system.data.datarowview

1734153
internationalization	localization
gettext is the gnu internationalization and localization i18n libs

1734153
internationalization	localization
it has been developed as a tool for i18n and l10n internationalization and localization but - exactly because of this it has plenty of functions to deal with plural forms given that other languages might have much more complex ways of forming plurals than english does

1734162
jquery-cycle	slider
i ve been using the jquery-cycle plugins malsup.com jquery-cycle and it s doing exactly as i want except that it doesn t seem to recognise the first slider as slider one

1734167
any	set
means that all my configuration can go into there then i checkout the live branch on the live server and merge changes into it any time i need to set things live

1734171
haskell	scheme
there is a haskell tutorial where you write a scheme in what they claim is 48 hrs

1734182
logging	trace
the bug is almost bound to be in the calling code rather than the methods itself which means we can t really help much more than suggesting things like breakpoints logging stack trace etc

1734183
attributes	properties
now an instances can t have a different object assign to the properties named and attempts to assign to the properties will raise an attributes error

1734186
udp	tcp
all of us who still do some kind of network-programming tcp udp dns or client-server in c repeatedly use some code-snippets again and again

1734189
transient	entity
but things work just as well if you specify a class and defined arbitrary getter methods for any transient properties without declaring it in the object-model as long as the entity is linked to that class in the model

1734196
value	field
.when i write a value into a field what guarantees do i get regarding .when the new value will be saved in the main memory

1734228
scala	java
the fact that scala is built to run on a jvm means that java developers get a head-start in the language if you re interested i could expand on why this is .so

1734237
contains	any
for a list of filenames that do not contains any of the procedure case-insensitive

1734237
contains	any
for a list of filenames that contains any of the procedure case-insensitive

1734240
environment	building
i would still recommend not doing it since having experience with commonly used building environment is a good thing to have on your resume

1734240
environment	building
now our environment is a little more complex than most since we do embedded systemd development .so it is not uncommon for a single product building to building with two or three different toolchain on windows-shell out to a linux machine via ssh for a linux only target and psexec to a remote windows machine to utilize a node-locked compiler

1734249
file-descriptor	stdin
all your program a.out is passed from the shell is an open file-descriptor stdin

1734276
mergesort	timsort
the business-end of timsort is a mergesort that operates on runs of pre-sorted elements

1734276
in-place	timsort
timsort finds a descending run and reverses the run in-place

1734289
instances	private
.when you implements the entityâ s custom class there is no need to add an instances variables for the attributeâ you can use the managed object s private internal store

1734289
attributes	properties	transient	entity
a quick test new project with a simple foo entity with a named attributes save a file with several foos add a transient properties run again and the foos all load add a new foo save close re-open show transient properties in fact are not considered by the versioning systemd

1734293
file-descriptor	stdin
an fstat 0 sb 0 is stdin file-descriptor will give you details on the input file size permissions called mode and inode of the device it resides on

1734294
file-descriptor	stdin
as pointed out in the above answer all you see is the open file-descriptor stdin

1734296
qlistwidget	qwidget
the easiest way is to subclassing the qlistwidget and qwidget that you want to be able to drag and drop between and handle the events in those implementation

1734306
decimalformat	string.format
it can probably be done with string.format ... but you could use decimalformat

1734319
contains	elements
that will return you the index of the elements you want or nil if your arrays doesn t contains the value

1734329
callback	methods	hide	show
you can set callback for jquery show and hide methods

1734337
arrays	loops
of course you can refactor that again further by storing all named in an arrays or just by getting and calling checked in a loops

1734357
spring	jsf
may be using jsf spring struts

1734364
required	checked
if it is a user defined methods finding out the meaning of 0x0a required checked that methods itself or its documentation though it is possible that it is just a stubs to the real disconnectclient and simply passes on the parameter

1734364
decimal	hex
take each hex digits write its decimal versioning down

1734364
digits	zero
multiplying each digits with 16 pos where pos positioning in hex numbers right-most positioning is zero

1734364
binary	octal	decimal	octal
now you can types hexadecimal numbers hit f5 and switching between decimal f6 octal f7 and binary f8

1734373
cvs	git
i use neither cvs nor svn i use git

1734377
modifiers	final
the class is designed to be immutable .so as a result has final modifiers and no setter

1734377
modifiers	final
is there a way around this issue or do i have to remove the final modifiers from _r _b and _g

1734377
derived-class	base-class
yes i know that the base-class if-ily contains a static instances of a derived-class

1734390
final	super
therefore you can not assign super s final field in the subclassing

1734395
any	set
is there any way in a outlook-vba macros i can in a single macros both flag an item for follow and set one of the above category on it

1734399
abstract	super	final	super
you can t have an abstract constructor in java .so unless you can put all the calculation into the call to super you can t do what you d like to do with the current design as a final variables must be assign by the time the declaring constructor has completed

1734399
constructor	object
an alternative would be to factors out some methods for the creation of color object a factorsy-pattern which takes the argumentss does the calculations external to the constructor and then you can can call super as the first arguments

1734399
constructor	object	protected	public
you could then make the constructor not public maybe protected and then the only way the object can be created is via your factory methods

1734403
superclass	inherited
if all you need to do is to manipulate a color interchangeably you might find that you don t benefit at all from inherited and it just creates an overhead of mapping hsv back into rgb for the superclass .

1734404
contains	any
one more suggestion this is a trick which i used to checked if my url path or slug do not contains any urlencoded string

1734405
push	pull
since all of them have process running using those settings i never want to push instead i d like for each of them to tracking the other two and pull only .when i m logged in

1734417
formatting	printing
.so while printing things that aren t going to be read especially formatting floating-point numbers can be a big performance problem you may in fact have other bigger performance problems that you should get rid of first

couldn t find a way to change the value of the lookup itself .so i put a static field next to it that updates any time the lookup is changed

1734444
ubuntu	linux
j3ll3 in ubuntu or any dpkg-based linux os you can ask the question what package provides xyz by typing

1734448
any	set
if any of these conditional aren t satisfied it will simply return return a httpunauthorizedresult which in turn will set the response code to 401

1734459
getter	setter
you could write an interface which exposes all properties of your class with getter and setter and a second interface which only exposes the getter for all your properties

1734465
xsd	xml
validation a xml file in the ide editor against its xsd or to checked its well-formedness

1734465

1734515
z-index	overlap
you can also use a z-index something to make the original content of the parent elements overlap the child elements with the absolute positioning

1734521
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
it is hard but not impossible to achieve full separation-of-concerns with asp.net webforms it is lot easier to do it with asp.net-mvc because of cleaner generator html...anyway you have few options here.

1734521
webforms	asp.net
-you can create user-controls with field that you need maybe generator input and labels dynamically on certain conditional and then put it on your pages where you need it...for asp.net webforms world it is fine separation

1734528
specifications	w3c
from the w3c specifications

1734535

1734726
onresume	onpause
a trick i used in one scenario was to have each activity notify the service in onpause and onresume

1734726
onresume	onpause
the service would monitor these and if it got an onpause without a subsequent onresume in some period of time it was assumed the user was gone home incoming phone call incoming text messages responding to some .app via a notification etc.

1734728
32-bit	64bit

1734828
base-class	inherited
again if you inherited from a base-class that does implements the interface and you don t implements it yourself in your class you ll be using the base-classes equality calculation

at the time in late 2009 it was a massive pain to geocode - reverse geocoding was possible via core-location apis but forwarding geocoding was not possible until ios 5

1735106
strategy-pattern	command-pattern
if the only thing the algorithms have in common is that they execute you should be thinking about command-pattern rather than the strategy-pattern

1735107
asp.net-mvc	webforms

1735136
sql-server	postgresql
i think that timestamp postgresql is the equivalent of datetime sql-server - it s not what i m looking for

1735137
derived-class	base-class
my understanding of the liskov substitution principles is that some properties of the base-class that is true or some implements behavior of the base-class should be true for the derived-class as well

1735137
derived-class	base-class
i guess this would mean .when a methods is defined in a base-class it should never be overrides in the derived-class - since then substituting the base-class instead of the derived-class would give different results

1735139
python	ruby
f# or ruby or python they are very good for calculations and many other things

1735142
json	xml
the web-services uses text oriented protocolss like xml json to implements the rpc protocols

1735145
deep-copy	object
instead you might consider creating a clone methods that returns a deep-copy of the object

1735145
pure-virtual	base-class
this could also be a pure-virtual methods that returns your base-class such as

1735156
postback	ajax

1735318
subtract	time
.whenever you need to display for how long your program is running get current date time and subtract the .when application started

1735332
subtract	time
instead of having a variables you have to worry about updating every second just initializer a variables on program start with the current time and then whenever you need to know how many seconds have elapsed you subtract the now current time from that initial time

python	java
you ll need a jmx client and consequently you ll need to spawn off a java jmx client from your python process

1735336
python	java
i think regrettably there s a non-trivial mismatch between a quartz instances in java and your python code

1735349
debian	linux
i m running under a debian linux 2.6.26 kernel

1735350
subclassing	base-class
subclassing overrides methods in the base-class are totally allowed by the liskov substituion principles

1735350
superclass	abc	subclassing	superclass	subclassing	abc
if a client is using a superclass abc with a methods something int i then the client should be able to substitute any subclassing of abc without problems

1735350
base-class	abc	subclassing	abc	subclassing	base-class
if our something methods in the abc base-class above has a relaxed precondition that permits any int then all subclassing of abc must also permit any int

1735350
subclassing	abc	base	zero
in reverse if the base abc class something methods has a postcondition - such as guaranteeing it will never return a value of zero - then all subclassing must also obey that same postcondition or they violate the liskov substitution principles promising less

1735355
constructor	private
at most it should double checked that the construct member is still valid which is where you might want to pull the constructor validation code into a private protected validation methods and call that in both places

1735355
constructor	object
the constructor is responsible for creating a valid properly initializer member object

1735356
subtract	time

1735374
dsa	rsa
is there a small libs for rsa or dsa without any dependencies like gmp or openssl

1735378
malloc	free
if all your application does all day long is malloc one 8 byte chunks in thread a and free it in thread b and doesn t need to handle anything else at all you could probably write a memory allocation that beats the pants off any of those listed .so far

1735378
malloc	free
most of the other allocation mentioned are designed as drop-in malloc free new delete replacements that can be ld_preload d

1735378
malloc	free
if you re constantly malloc free ing object that are all the same size you might want to just write a simple slab allocation

1735379

perl	awk
with the sample-data size the performance difference between perl and awk was negligible 1 millisecond out of 7 total

1735408
perl	awk
with a larger dataset 100x100 matrix entries 6-8 characters each perl slightly outperformed awk - 0.026s vs 0.042s

1735408
perl	awk
representative timings for perl 5.10.1 32-bit vs awk versioning 20040207 .when given -v vs gawk 3.1.7 32-bit on macos x 10.5.8 on a file contains 10 000 line with 5 columns per line

1735408
perl	awk
note that gawk is vastly faster than awk on this machine but still slower than perl

1735622
json	xml
for the ajax interface xml and json libs are available by default also

1735623
value	field
if the class implements serialization contains a field which you d like not to be stored on the disk filesystems for example private string passwd bad example but it should give you the idea then you can just declare it transient to avoid its value being serialization to disk

1735624
any	set
it has a 200 pixels high header div that fills 100 of the view ports horizontally and then below it is the main div that fills 100 of the remaining empty spaces horizontally and vertically with scrolling set to auto to account for any overflowing content

it s a very fundamental feature of c-preprocessor -- for example a directive such as #ifdef makes zero sense except .when used with an arguments that s possibly a macros if you had to know that the arguments is not allowed to be a macros what could the purpose of #ifdef possibly be

1736675
django-staticfiles	pinax
this is the approach taken by pinax and django-staticfiles which use static_url and static_root settings

callback	methods
in that callback methods i need to interact with the ui-thread

1736677
callback	methods
.so how do i interact with the ui-thread from the callback methods

1736683
interop	vsto
-rhetorical question. if i don t need to mirror or interop with legacy com like vsto does using system.addin is it possible to just create some classes that load load in a new appdomain

1736688
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	openvms	solaris	linux	openvms	freebsd
it is extreamly portable i work with it on windows linux openvms solaris freebsd

1736692
linux	unix
i think running linux unix in a virtual-machine is much less hassle if you are looking for a nix environment

1736694
show	next
now the following code will show you the timer only working work one next positioning

1736698
sql-server	mysql
i knew that there is no equivalent to mysql s limit clause present in sql-server either 2000 or 2005

1736702
emacs	vim
there is no limit to the size of a systemd that can be developed in vim emacs unix in fact there are fewer limits than there are in ide s

1736707
expression	evaluation
here s its quick start guide expression evaluation #3 on that page is the part you re interested in

1736728
persistent	transient
sometime developer might intent to persistent only top level object and forget to mark member variables as transient

1736729
groovy	scala	python	ruby
you could use the scripting engine in java6 and the choose any of the popular scripting languages like scala ruby python groovy and javascript

1736733
web-config	app-config
without an app-config or web-config

1736738
sql-server	mysql
i knew that there is no mysql limit clause present in sql-server both 2000 and 2005 should support .how can i retrieve some particular recordinging recording 20 -30 from db

1736742
directory	folder
i have all standards python modules in python31.zip which is basically an archive of the .lib folder in the python install directory

1736747
put	get
i changed the term module named to ansiterm but i can t figure out how to get cucumber to load my modified gem which i ve put into rails_root vendor gem term-ansicolor

1736755
derived-class	base-class
you need to provide a constructor for derived-class ldi which in turn call the correct base-class constructor

1736755
derived-class	base-class
but by default the derived-class constructor will not call appropriate base-class constructor

1736755
derived-class	base-class
inorder to call correct base-class constructor you need to invoke the base-class constructor from derived-class initializer-list

1736786
smartgwt	gxt
please exclude gxt or smartgwt like other heavy weight frameworks just want to use core gwt

1736812
compact-framework	.net
this article on msdn consuming web-services with the microsoft .net compact-framework has an example

1736821
grouping	sorting
using row_number you are numering and sorting the inherently unsorted grouping the table

1736821
show	next
you will have to use asp code to keep both the upper and lower elements .so you can ask for the next or previous subset of rows to show

1736828
keyrelease	keydown
the problem is that .when i hold the keydown i get lots of repeated keypressed keyrelease events instead of just the single keypressed

1736831
emacs	vim	bbedit	vim
vim emacs bbedit wing-ide or my favorite - eclipse although i don t think this is very lightweight

1736833
g++	gcc
the following compiles in c but not c++ all compilations done with gcc g++ -ansi -pedantic -wall

1736835
punctuation	words
suppose two line of text correspond to each other words by words except for the punctuation marks

1736840
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
now i certainly can see some benefit to that from a design pattern but why would i want to use a document-oriented dbms instead of just building it using a traditional database like sql-server oracle or postgresql

1736847
emacs	vim
vim and emacs for non-ide editing work

1736848
gentoo	linux
imo i d say virtualbox + gentoo linux + kdevelop4 gentoo will give you the control you need over your environment

1736860
emacs	vim
having a good cmd on a powerful editor like vim or emacs is something i would consider as an essential skill for any programmer

1736886
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this all works in firefox safari and google-chrome

1736886
internet-explorer	opera
where it break down is in internet-explorer and opera

1736900
wordpress	blogs
i have two wordpress blogs

1736909
callback	methods
i had to backup and restore the execution context before and after integration with the ui-thread from my async callback methods

1736909
callback	methods
then the exception-handling disappears as mysteriously as it appeared and you can read write properties call methods and do basically anything you like with the ui-thread synchronous from your async callback without having to use delegation or invokes

1736913
glut	glu
one time i started netbeans up it just underlined all my call to opengl gl glu and glut and i couldn t get rid of the errors

1736943
updatepanel	gridview
i am retrieving downloading urls from a database on button2 but .when i put my gridview inside the updatepanel it gives me following error

1736952
postgresql	mysql
however i would like to use another database technology such as mysql or postgresql for my authentication role management

1736956
emacs	vim
emacs vim can be used for any sized project

1736973
background-image	width	background-image	height	background-repeat	background-image
i will use a simple div elements with the width and height that the animated image will have the png sprite as background-image and background-repeat set to no-repeat

1736973
background-position	background-image
the trick is basically to scroll the background-image sprite up using the background-position css properties

1736973
height	frame
we need to know the height of the animated image to know how much we will scroll up each time and how many time to scroll how many frame will have the animation

1736973
any	set
edit you can al.so set the css properties programmatically .so you don t have to defined any styles on your page and make a constructor function from the above example that will allow you to show multiple sprite animation simultaneously

1736981
build-tools	toolchain
while there are alternative toolchain out there i don t know how good those are you will almost certainly not be able to distribute your application to the app-store if you use those build-tools

1736983
file-descriptor	fclose
calling fclose here after dup ing its file-descriptor blocks until the child-process has ended presumably because the streaming has ended

1736983
file-descriptor	pipe	execvp	fork
however by manually performing the pipe fork execvp of the popen and then dup ing the pipe s read file-descriptor closing the original does not block

1736993
environment	execution
execution environment description

1737014
python	java
secondly these tools offer interfaces in developer-friendly languages like java python etc

1737023
ubuntu	linux
i have a subversion repository on my laptop in my room windows-vista but i want to checked it out to a computer upstairs ubuntu linux

1737024
revision	svn
if you look what the comment on bottom-right says right now it would be svn revision 5404

1737042
setcontentview	oncreate
next create a listactivity as you would normally but add a setcontentview call in the oncreate methods .so we use our recently declare layout

1737065
specifications	w3c
from the w3c s html5 specifications the video elements

1737066
postback	ajax
really fails in .some ie7 browsers meaning that it has become an unreliable methods of preventing direct postback in an ajax form since the release of ie7 .so we need to be very careful about using it

1737073
defined	declare
firs of all you must defined and declare constructor for ldi string _name int _value

1737074
spaces	output
it looks like extra line break in the html code may add unwanted spaces in the final output

1737078
any	set
any field with the auto_now attributes set will also inherited and therefore will not show up in the admin panels

1737080
put	get
it doesn t matter what the actual request methods is - it could be a put and those superglobals would still get populate

1737088
put	get
i loops on the linq query result and for each i open the file do some operation get value and put the result in myfileino.contentpart

1737125
contains	any
e.g. mappedbytebuffering s .force forces any changes made to this buffering s content to be written to the storage device contains the mapped file. and .load loads this buffering s content into physical memory. i ve never needed these personally

1737130
internet-explorer	firefox
this loads fine in firefox whereas in internet-explorer 7 the spinner keeps spinning and never loads

1737145
attributes	properties
sharp-architecture framework use attributes to decor properties which should be taken into the equals methods

1737149
value	field
i have a lifecycle choice field in another list and only a subset of document should be visible as per the value of that choice field

1737149
value	field
the suggestions on sharepoint.se points to a jquery-based approach where i tends to like a event receiver approach iterate through the content-type in the document libs .when the value of the lifecycle field is changed

1737164
literals	hardcode
are you actually using literals hardcode in the query

1737166
selected	button
i want to selected column 1 then .when i click a button column 2 column 3 .

1737190
arrays	loops
i need to loops through a 2d arrays the methods i am working on takes an int

1737226
value	field
a basic rules for designing databases is that data should be in the field value not in the field named

1737226
value	field
you should consider redesigning the table .so that you store the value in separate rows instead and have a field that specifies which item is stored in the row

1737241
static-initializer	static-block
the static-block is called a class static-initializer - it gets run the first time the class is loaded and it s the only time it s run footnote

1737243
jquery	.post
if you don t want to use jquery i describe an alternative libs in an earlier .post

1737258
arrays	loops
loops through the arrays calling model create then model save

1737278
constructor	object
the primary use of static initializer blocks are to do various bits of initialization that may not be appropriate inside a constructor such that taken together the constructor and initializer put the newly created object into a state that is completely consistent for use

1737296
any	set
what you should do is to set float right and width on your elements and leave #content without any float or width just set margins

1737317
textbox	button
i have realised after .so long of coding directx opengl applications i don t have the faintest of ideas how to create windows with basic form object like textbox labels cmd button etc

1737337
show	next
unfortunately for scheduling purposes you probably need to be able to show the next several occurences and this is the points at which things get interesting - two choices calculate on-the-fly i think this is probably better - especially with some smart caching or precalculate which is less overall load but more data to manage and keeping it up to-date is more complex quite apart from considerations of how far ahead to create scheduling entries

1737369
touch	drag
i want to resize an image with touch and drag only the height

1737385
jquery	.post
while the dragging dropping works i can t get the jquery .post to fire

1737416
codeigniter	kohana
quick question about general asp.net-mvc design principles in php using codeigniter or kohana i m actually using kohana

1737435
integration-testing	system-testing
unit-testing automated - integration-testing automated - system-testing automated -- functional-testing manual

1737437
static-initializer	static-block
.so if your static-initializer relies on .some static variables it must be initializer before the particular static-block

1737449
difference	zero
i understand this is something to do with arithmetic logical shift difference and the negative sign not being introduced as a result-of the msbs staying at zero

1737462
push	pull
alternatively thinking a bit more - and allowing that i use svn much more - the key would be that i could commit to my local wip repository all i want broken code or not and therefore would pull or push my current wip to the laptop and back safely

1737477
associations	model
i have model represent associations rules body head

1737480
click	mouse
is it possible to pass mouse click through an overlapping elements

1737502
selected	button
my play button then kicks off some code which causes one of these beat events to be fired every second or 5 seconds depending on the speed selected

1737504
click	mouse
you could try to retrieve the mouse coordinates in your click event and then retrieve an elements by hiding your overlay use document.elementsfrompoint x y and then redisplay the overlay

1737508
click	mouse
you could assign a mouse click event to the covering div then iterate through all elements that you know might be underneath inspector their positioning width and height to see if that location of the mouse click was within their borders and if it was call their onclientclick event

1737537
push	pull
in other words a pull mechanism versus a push mechanism

1737547
python	c++
for example there is a way to bring your application to the foreground the examples given in answer are in c++ but equivalent methods are available in python and the code would be very similar

1737547
pyside	pyqt
another python qt porting is in the works with a lgpl license pushed by nokia following the refusal from the pyqt author to change their license pyside but it is still in its early development

1737590
web2py	django
here is a document showing the difference between django web2py and some others

1737590
compatibility	legacy
since you have legacy code if you really want to keep it there is a fair compatibility between the two although you should double-check

1737592
selected	button
i have a requirement to click on multiple links selected them and then click a button that will open all selected links in new windows or tabs

1737592
selected	button
my plan is to use javascript to add the selected links to an arrays and then upon click the submit button the javascript will run through the arrays and open a new windows for each item

1737595
windows-xp	windows
unfortunately it is completely impossible to prove that your software is working bug-free the windows-xp commercials always annoyed me by announcing the most secure versioning of windows ever that s impossible to prove at release

1737615
scala	java
one advantage of scala is that you can building it alongside java in the same project

1737615
scala	java
but you can find lots of java programmers who are interested in learning scala

1737615
scala	java
if i were to guess scala and clojure might be the front runners for supplanting java

1737618
hide	show
the best way to accomplish the desired affect is to move the larger thumbnail images outside of the div that is clipped and show hide it with javascript

1737624
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
how to put qgraphicsscene s 0 0 to top-left corner of qgraphicsview

1737643
double	int
with the scanner class you are able to request specific types double int ... string

1737646
decrement	increment
constants expression shall not contains assignment increment decrement function-call

1737646
environment	execution
as to why they don t like side-effects in constants expression the whole points of constants expression is that they can be evaluated at compile-time without requiring an execution environment - iso makes a distinction between translation compile-time and execution runtime environment

1737646
environment	execution
the clue as to why iso decided against requiring compilers to provide execution environment information other than stuff contains in header-files such as limits.h can be found a little later in the rationale document

1737646
environment	execution
however while implementation are certainly permitted to produce exactly the same result in translation and execution environment requiring this was deemed to be an intolerable burden on many cross-compiling

1737646
environment	execution
in other words iso didn t want the manufacturers of cross-compiling to be burdened with carrying an execution environment for every possible target

1737688
margins	padding
you can then set margins padding border to zero and do something like this

1737714
scala	java
the usual way of defining main in scala as show below can be used to run classes with scala but not java since the created methods is not static

1737714
scala	java
how do i write a scala class object that can be execute with java

1737720
typedef	struct
as far as i know it shouldn t work without a typedef in c99 either as this is simply the way c works but it does work in c++ as a struct in c++ is just a class with all members public by default

1737721
typedef	struct
you have to either say struct points or use a typedef in c

1737722
event-viewer	log4net
if you have log4net log to the local event-viewer you can mine these logs on a windows 2008 box see this centralized auditing article

1737731
partial-trust	xbap
with regards to the first question note that you can only use remoting under the full trust mode while xbap applications work under partial-trust by default

1737733
mousedown	mouseup
if this is the case then it might be best to stop hide the animated on mousedown and then get the activate your function on the underlying elements using mouseup

1737739
panels	grid
i m wondering why use a grid but not a simpler panels such as canvas

1737740
textbox	button
i need to provide a validation button near the textbox

1737740
contains	set
on click the button the user should get the feedback as to whether the directory path contains the required set of files like few images and other files in certain format

1737753
buffering	streaming
have a look at wcf messages streaminging - you basically create one parameter as types streaming - and optional the return-value as streaming as well - and then you don t have to buffering the whole multi-megabyte file but you ll be transferring the file in streaminging chunks

1737779
typedef	struct
you can use typedef to alias it to another named - typedef struct points points

1737780
partial-trust	xbap
if you are running your xbap under partial-trust you are only allowed to write to the isolatedstorage on the client machine

1737780
partial-trust	xbap
finally under partial-trust xbap you have webpermission to talk to the server of your .app origin only

1737786
case-statement	declare
you should declare it at your query before use it at your case-statement

1737787
ubuntu	linux
i have a mixed windows and linux dev environment and the server is linux ubuntu

1737797
push	pull	rollback	commit
option 2 commit on the sending side push to the receiving end or pull from it or put a hg bundle on a flash drive bypassing the work server updates on the receiving side and then hg rollback on both sides to eliminate the changeset but leave the changes

1737797
push	pull
pros using push and pull to move over changes like mercurial intends

1737797
push	pull
push to a developer-repo that only you access and pull on the receiving end

1737806
cassini	iis
my .solution was to switching to using iis instead of cassini -- just configure iis to points to the development folder and then change the startup url to be cassini has a bunch of other annoying features too like no support for compression .so this works better for me

1737809
execute	declare
the way your currently have it declare it ceases to exit after the if-statement execute .so return length is always undeclare

1737832
any	set
for any more useful application a first touch may change state and that state can be reflected by changes in an object s image by tooltops even transient tooltip that go away after a set time or by other means

1737844
web-services	webserver
for example if h1 is a webserver which uses a web-services located on h2 to produce a particular webpage

1737844
traceroute	packets
in that case and assuming that the icmp packets associated with traceroute are not filtering stopped on the way a simple traceroute would answer the question

1737847
checkbox	button
menus checkbox radio button spring to mind

1737847
keyboard	mouse
you ll see some of this in dedicated devices such as the iphone simply because that s a platform that neither has a mouse pointers nor a keyboard and only touch

1737864
turbogears	pylons
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1737871
emacs	vim
emacs is a great tool .so is vim for programming and i use them to develop my code for physics research

1737891
frame	width	height	frame
width and height of this frame generator by width and height of image

1737891
height	frame
and must to have possibility to change height of frame through the javascript

1737895
mousedown	mouseup
this problem is caused because you filtering the mousedown messages but not the mouseup messages

1737906
subtract	time
then time the resolve perhaps with an i don t know response and subtract ping time to h2

1737908
.when	ready
.when i m ready to compile i hit ctrl+f7.

1737916
push	pull
then you can push pull docs around and the separate different parent repo will keep tracking of what points on docs they ve been updates to

1737917
contains	set
i know intel provides an android-emulator to test software contains these instructions see this question but since i don t want to manually write hex code the question arises as to which assemblers currently know the avx instruction set

1737955
increment	average
which generator new positioning for each axis each run to colour the rendering i need to take the distance between two successive results if i just do this with a distance calculation between each run then the colours fade back and forth in equilibrium .so i need to take running average for each points and store it using a 3dimenrsionl arrays is too coarse a colouring and i m looking for advice on how to store the value at much smaller increment

1737959
constructor	object
well we could pass in an object implements idbconnection to the constructor constructor-injection

1737989
uilabel	uiview	any	set
any uiview subclassing like a uiview uilabel or uiimageview that you want to respond to touches must have the .userinteractionenabled properties set to yes

1737997
comet	chat
using the comet chat demo as templates i have a cometactor that rendering both an ajax form and the search results from the following templates

1738009
directory	folder
i found that mucking around with the .project file can lead to the entire directory being considered a source folder which is not what you want

1738056
configuration	environment
what is the configuration and code required to use mysql within a blazeds turnkey environment

1738063
midp	cldc
it enables for cldc and midp 1.0 and 2.0

1738067
updating	updates
now in terms of updating a winforms object .when something is received i believe only the thread that created the winforms control can updates the controls

1738071
derived-class	base-class
i often have a ultratable and getaobjects returns a list of derived-class which extends base-class

1738074
value	field
.whenever i have a variables in php 5.3 that is of types double and i want to insert it into the database mysql 5.0 in a field that is of types double the value always gets rounded down to 6 digits behind the points .when i m using pdo

1738077
execute	prepare
as soon as you want to execute more complex queries you had best be prepare for some frustration

1738081
any	set
it doesn t seem to make any difference whether i set in html either

1738121
widget	button
button to be pressed while pressing another widget to get the tooltip which should be show in a slightly separated place inorder not to be too obscured by the finger

1738134
frame	width
this methods will allow you to change width of #top #bottom and #left #right to increase the size of your frame

1738150
arrays	loops
if loops assign characters to a character arrays the last arrays item should be 0

1738161
constructor	object
the issue is now i do have an object which required a custom object as a constructor arguments

1738172
while-loop	loops
you re using a do - while-loop which means that you re execution loops body before testing for eof .so you end up putting eof in your buffering as well

1738180
double	int
i have a double-pointer data- mono_channel where i would like to cast all the double to int and put them in an arrays

1738180
double	int
the purpose is that alsa takes an int arrays of samples and my samples are in double

1738180
double	int
.so .somehow i need my double to be casted to int

1738198
minimum	max
the samples probably need to be scale from -1 1 to min max where min and max are minimum and maximum int value for int samples

1738204
buffering	streaming
the first problem is the cause of your ã character .when the streaming ends you add the eof character to the buffering then loops terminate

1738206
arrays	loops	double	int
if is an arrays of double s the casting is correct although your code is overly complicated -- you should just use index i as the control variables in loops and use it to index the input arrays of double s as well as the resulting arrays of int s

1738214
protected	public
while inside a section of class a code it will always call the versioning from class a even if the class b versioning was protected or public

1738214
protected	public
as noted by others if you change the definition to protected or public it will be visible to class b and it will do what you want

1738234
treeset	treemap
you are almost there if you use a treeset instead of a treemap you can use your comparator on one of the field of the animal class

1738249
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
it is possible to run all the binary representation 8bit 16-bit and 32-bit of cmd on the simulator and see which one s are valid and which are not

1738271
arguments	default
to see examples and other alternatives of passing arguments and setting default value checkout this .post and its comments as well

1738289
silverlight	wpf
there are very big difference in our team on its estimate as we don t have prior experience on wpf or silverlight technology

1738307
variables	boolean
proceed the boolean variables ok will

1738313
double	int
i get cannot convert â double cls_lasvm int int void â to â double int int void â

1738339
physics-engine	box2d	physics-engine	chipmunk	chipmunk	box2d
what you need to search for are tutorials on collision detection. cocos2d-x is a great place but you will also need a physics-engine - box2d and chipmunk are both physics libs that can be used

1738350
sql-server	oracle
will oracle 10g and sql-server 2008 work

1738351
javascript	dom
if you intend to do it through javascript i guess you will have to loops through dom entries for grid and validation

1738354
filesystems	symlink
what you really want is a symlink which points to a specific path in the filesystems but unfortunately this doesn t exist on server 2003

1738373
arrays	loops
right now you re resetting the arrays to all zero each time through loops over and over which is absurd

1738377
order	add
i suppouse you would like give possibility to .sort images to user anyway if you want .sort it via time add best way is order it by id .so if there is model like gallery of images maybe you should store tuples of ids of images from the gallery in db as a text object

1738393
typedef	struct
you can defined struct like after defining one more typedef like

1738412
contains	elements	contains	any
but it doesn t yet contains any of those elements you need to add something to the vector using put

1738416
contains	elements
the capacity is equals to or larger than the amount of elements it contains

subclassing	inherited
they are not inherited by any subclassing and only classes no interfaces can have static-members

1738438
member-functions	inline
for example -- forwarding member data and member function references can be dealt with in inline member-functions are dealt with during the parsing phase alone

1738444
pixels	line
a three pixels outside line and a one pixels inside line will appear as two one pixels line

1738461
versioning	upgrade
the windowss 7 upgrade isn t as important as the upgrade to windows s 7 s .net versioning 3.5 i think...

1738471
put	get
.so i guess you ll still have to put .some brainpower into making sure you get the appropriate indic in-place to make your systemd perform well

1738477
nsapplication	appkit
the documentation for deactivate methods for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this methods directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

1738489
macports	fink
you have -i sw include and -l sw .lib which are standards location for fink not macports

1738489
macports	fink
in general it s not a good idea to mix package from fink and macports

1738513
row	col
assuming all the images are in the current directory and named from 1.jpg to n.jpg and row col n

1738518

.when i set up my proxy object with an instances of uitableviewcontroller or a stubs subclassing it doesn t seem to ever receive any of the uitableviewdelegate or uitableviewdatasource messages that i expect it to

1738541
windows-vista	windows
in windows-vista windows 7 the uac forces you to read the msdn documentation in more detail to write to location that are allowed

1738547
constructor	private
you could make the constructor private protected thus overrides the default-constructor

1738549
constructor	private
maybe you can give the class only a private constructor

1738549
abstract-class	pure-virtual
iirc abstract-class are abstract precisely because they have at least one pure-virtual function.

1738550
abstract-class	pure-virtual
make it pure-virtual and you ve got your abstract-class

1738550
constructor	private
if you don t need a virtual-destructor ie the class is not used polymorphically you can make the constructor protected not private

1738559
any	set
you can set the logical focus to the control .when any of the child gets the keyboard focus using

1738559
any	set
you can use uielement.iskeyboardfocuswithin to set the focus of the control if any of the children has focus

1738596

i have the need for sql based libs that will allow me to create product order items order etc to support e-commerce on a .net asp.net-mvc site

1738629
ready	live
now it s ready to go live and i am trying to move it to www.example.com

1738634
double	int
as others have said you should probably declare n and num to be double not int

1738637
duplicates	elements
.so after my first effort a pretty good original heuristics i thought and my second effort a really sneaky exact combinatorial .solution that worked for shortish dataset and even for sets up to 100 elements as long as the numbers of unique value was low i finally succumbed to peer pressure and wrote the one they wanted not too hard - handling duplicates entries was the trickiest part - the underlying algorithm i based it on only works if all the input are unique - i m sure glad that long-long is big enough to hold 50 bits

1738660
spaces	output
i have tried different garbage collectors different sizings the parts of the memory spaces writing data output to non-raid drive and putting all data output in threads separate the main worker threads

1738661
show	next
in other words if moving to the next size up or down will result in more than 50 product show them all - don t stop at 50

1738669
duplicates	elements
to use merge sort to remove duplicates you would ignore elements that are repeated in the merging process

1738692

there are fancy answers involving higher-order-functions or lambda leave-it-to-the-compiler answers refactor-the-whole-outer-routine answers .

1738720
postback	ajax
one is by postback to the server the other is ajax call

1738720
postback	ajax
ajax may not be the easiest even though there are plenty of frameworks like jquery and lots of information on the .net about how to make an asynchronous postback

1738722
put	get
if we put it all together in the outer query using these two lists we get

1738743
malware	website
it s designed to protect the computer from malware rogue website etc etc. and .so without developing a custom extension for the browser there s no way to make the hop to any applications that run in tandem with the browser

1738772
key-value	key
the key or value for any key-value pair doesn t need to be in any particular format it just needs to evaluate out to a primitive types a numbers or string

1738785
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
here i am not talking about trivial runtimeexception such as nullpointerexception and .so on

1738785
messagebox	alert
the only alternative i see is using javascript to display some alert messagebox to inform the user about the unresolveable error but the user could dismiss it and continue with the page while that should not be possible

1738795
automake	cmake
kdevelop4 from subversion or rc1 from their site + cmake makes life .so much easier automake should just die

1738796
stringbuilder	streamwriter
.so yes you can create that in memory - inside a stringbuilder and then save it back out to disk using a streamwriter or .some other means

1738813
scons	cmake	scons	jam	cmake	jam
i like cmake a lot for the whole building process but i have almost no experience with scons or jam

don t bother with a hd upgrade just get an external usb disk and put all your viewmodel s and extra necessities on it

1738887
radio-button	hidden-field	radio-button	selected
my code gota datalist with radio-button and iv made it single selectable onitemdatabound....now im trying to evaluate a hidden-field on basis of selected radio-button

1738890
arrays	loops
here your loops needs to know about all the classes that could be in the arrays

1738890
arrays	loops
here your loops would need to know about the behavior it depends on of classes in the arrays

1738891
controllers	routes
my question is should i just have 1 route with default and then return different views depending on how much the url is filled in or should i create multiple routes going to the same controllers different actions

1738897
controllers	routes
it doesn t seem wise to create a strategy that will required you to add new routes controllers methods and or views every time you add a product category

1738903
haskell	lisp
before taking on haskell you may find it easier to learn something that isn t purely-functional like a lisp or ml

1738910
codeigniter	kohana
if you re going with codeigniter note maybe take a look at kohana too the php5 fork of codeigniter you can always use libs out of zend if theres something that fits your needs

1738916
python	java
users of a procedural or object-oriented language like c java or python should beware however you ll have to forget most of what you already know about programming

1738920
haskell	ocaml
haskell s learning curve is somewhat higher than other functional languages like ocaml though it is my personal favorite

1738932
value	field
you could use ajax to call the web service and return currently available value and then use javascript to updates the field

1738937
protected	public
iirc that is the error one got .when trying to use visibility declarations private protected public in php 4

1738958
value	field
adding a new field to indicate that the user has approved this data your scripting will only write to the database .when it sees this confirmation value

1738981
python	perl
in this case trying to do it all in bash is probably a worse choice than something like perl or python because

1738985
64bit	x86
but on 64bit server the environment variables processor_architecture is returning x86 instead of amd64

1738994
implements	sealed
even if you made the return-type readonlycollection it still might delay the evaluation and throw for example readonlycollection is not sealed .so a subclassing could explicit implements the ienumerable interface and do wacky things

1738997
64bit	x86
x86-64 more precisely which is the 64bit extension of x86

1738997
32-bit	64bit
this knowledge base article show you how to determine if your systemd is 32-bit or 64bit

1739002
instances	self
regardless of whether you need the current_user behavior above award_badge should just be a regular instances methods acting on self instead of acting on the passed user arguments same goes for check_if_badges_earned

1739020
32-bit	x86
if you are running 32-bit windows on a 64-bit-capable cpu you will still get x86

1739030
hide	show
on a button click my form1 hide itself creates a new form2 and show form2

1739038
duplicates	sorted	duplicates	elements
or just use any sorting and .when it completes scan over the sorted list and remove duplicates elements they naturally will be next to each other

1739041
any	set
.so for any given .app it will look for existance of the jad parameter at .app startup time and set it otherwise it will use the default value

1739055
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
if your application is a 32-bit application running on a 64bit os the process versioning of this environment variables will return x86

1739059
contains	any
the other collections utilities classes in google-collections com.google.common.collect.lists and com.google.common.collect.collections2 don t contains any concatenation methods

1739076
ftpwebrequest	ftp
i keep getting this error .when i do some ftp request through my c# code using ftpwebrequest

1739086

this means that inorder to read a fixed numbers of bytes from the streaming there should be applied some custom buffering

1739089
callback	methods
you can dynamically change the queryset on a form using functional methods currying closures or callback

1739098
getter	setter
and in the myclass action class you can declare a variables variables named arg with getter and setter

1739101
children	nodes
replace the way nodes and value are accessed in arrays meaning replace with how you would access children nodes and the value in arrays calculating the indexes of where in the arrays you store the value

1739101
children	nodes
you will probably not need to pass around because you ll be operating on an arrays and probably you can pass around index to the current nodes and then just add to it to get the index for left right children

1739101
linked-list	tree
the most inefficient way of generator tree would be to order elements and insert one by one because you would end up with linked-list .so traversal would take o n instead of o logn

1739111
click	mouse
.when the mouse is click the textsize freezes

1739111
click	mouse
however .when the styles is set to the styleswrapper styles that inherited from swellingtexblock i get the following exception-handling .when click the mouse in dutch

1739132
ruby-on-rails	django
i m not sure what server you re using ruby-on-rails django ... but that should work out of the box on any normals systemd

1739135
core-animation	core-graphics
if it is simple enough you could use both core-graphics and core-animation along with coredata and create your own engine

1739161
checkbox	button
to do this with older versioning of windows-installer you ll need to create a customaction that launchdd the website and then tie the execution of the customaction to a button another common use is to create a checkbox saying launchd blah blah... and then tie a customaction to the finish button which execute based on the value of the checkbox

1739190
parentheses	operators
these tokens represent things like identifier parentheses operators etc

1739192
uiimage	nsdata
instead get your image as nsdata and turn it into uiimage in your main thread

1739206
activation	account
have you tried adding the iusr and iwam account to the local activation and launchd permissions for the com+ application in question

1739216
contains	set
it works fine until i set item templates that contains another listbox in fact i have 4 nested listbox

1739225
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	web-inspector	webkit
use the firebug extension for firefox or the built-in web-inspector in any webkit browser google-chrome or safari

1739231

1739236
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu these manpage are in the manpages-dev package which can be install using synaptic or with

1739237
.when	ready
that promotes code-reuse for one but a potentially more important benefit is having other developers ready to step in and make changes to that module if the original developer leaves the company or even is on vacation .when a critical bug is found

1739240
macros	vba
if you already have your ribbon button hooked up to some vba macros in the document then you just need to add a reference in your vba project to your com visible .net-assembly

1739241
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
setup a virtual-machine virtualbox vmware etc which is aggressively firewalled from within the hosts os with a minimal allocation of memory and diskspace and run the untrusted code there

1739253
credentials	security
it delegation the specific security implementation to windows which in turn secures the data to disk using the user s windows .profile credentials

1739259
subtract	time
then to find the amount of time passed i just subtract the function s return-value from the startingticks and .when i reset the timer i just call the function again and assign startingticks to it

1739283
invokerequired	begininvoke
i want to detection this conditional like with invokerequired and then perform the equivalent of begininvoke to give control back to the ui-thread

1739283
invokerequired	begininvoke
the problem is the class that is receiving these input events is not derived from control and therefore doesn t have invokerequired or begininvoke

1739289
contains	elements	contains	set
the set contains twelve elements and while this does not sound like a lot it was .when used with the tests

1739290
foreground	z-order
that windows will now be the foreground windows your second form will not get the focus and appear lower in the z-order

1739292
selected	checkbox
now if the checkbox is selected the image column should show a green tick image and if checkbox is not checked it should show a wrong image icons in consecutive rows

1739298
selected	listbox
remember that each listbox is a selector and has a concept of which item is selected

1739298
selected	listbox
i would suggest changing the inner listbox to simple itemscontrol .so that the nested-lists can t have selected items

1739312
hide	show
i want to have a checkbox that allows you to hide show inactive recording

1739324
fwrite	fread
using fread fwrite you have to make many call to the os

1739334
authentication	login
is there a way i can globally authentication since we re using integrated-security there is no login and you can t access any page if you re not auth .so we wouldn t have to put authentication tags on every controllers

1739360
qsqldatabase	qtsql
the compiler can t find the qtsql header and therefore doesn t know about qsqldatabase

1739398
pointers	stack
stack contains the return pointers for the function that allocated the buffering

1739398
pointers	stack
.so if you overflow a buffering on stack you can set the return pointers to .something arbitrary

1739398
contains	set
stack - or rather the page contains it - is often set not to allow code execution

1739399
bison	yacc
that is typically done with lex if you are using yacc or flex for the .l file if you are using bison for the .y file

1739400
calling-convention	function-call
the rules for how a function-call is implements stack variables allocated value passed and return value returned back is called the calling-convention

1739404
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m looking to migrate webforms .app to asp.net-mvc

1739428
contains	set
given a particular setid and userid we need to generator a list of all the items in the set with a column contains the given userâ s relationship to each item if such a relationship exists

1739428
contains	set
the reason for this is that the second where-clause eliminates the row contains item 6 because for that set of results from the various tables returns false

1739443
contains	set
add returns a new wrapped set contains the merged and unique combinations of this and the given set

1739449
braces	macros
btw general conventions is that you should use braces rather than brackets for your macros

1739453
put	get
i think you have to escape the dash or put it last because dash defined range of characters and you may get a very unexpected side-effect of dash

1739464
web-services	webserver
the most obvious approach is exposing your .net libs as web-services on a webserver either iis or apache mono

1739485
webforms	asp.net
if you are looking for a good place to start with web-services json and asp.net webforms dave ward s post on encosia are really top notch

1739494
perforce	git
not strictly related but make sure you get them used to using source control perforce subversion git rcs etc as quickly as possible

1739495
triggers	insert
i m using a before insert triggers for this

1739496
filtering	sorting
a search page with paginator column header sorting and multiple filtering filtering are in checkbox

1739496
filtering	sorting
i have no idea how to make the three functionalities paginator sorting and filtering work together...want i want to achieve

1739496
filtering	sorting
user gets to filtering the sorted table or if he she did not do any sorting then the current table will be filteringing

1739503
exception-handling	try-catch
the try-catch has no effect because the exception-handling is being throw by code that is outside of the try block

1739518
json	xml
then this handler will look after json output by default and can also do xml and yaml

1739532
unique	words
the conventions i use is to use a unique words salza skippy zs3 etc

1739538
emacs	vim
emacs and vim are available on os x using xcode just for its editor is not ideal

1739552
contains	any
i suppose the most ideal solution would be to preserve the contents of any tag that contains enabling much more than the limited exclusives

1739569
moving-average	minimum	short	zero
my current plan is to allow a short amount of time once a signals is detected 1 second or 24-30 frame to measure the maximum and minimum numbers of samples between zero-crossing levels using a moving-average filtering to prevent spikes dropouts affecting decoding and the maximum and minimum recorded voltages to determine the zero crossing points dc level

1739591
put	get
neither project get put into jar files at the moment

1739607
contains	any
if that is .so then don t trust anything that contains any of the words entity-relationship mapping .net micro.soft sql linq object

1739624
textbox	button
.when i click my fill out textbox button nothing happens

1739633
low-level	hardware
if you like low-level as in close to hardware you could work on gnu compilers collections

1739648
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
but greasemonkey would only be an option for firefox opera and google-chrome

1739653
value	field
the problem is that this table has a autoincrement field and the value saved may not correspond the the value the bindingsource gives in edit time

1739657
put	get
.so naturally .when i put those value into my object and try to save that object to the database which has zip as a varchar i get errors because zip is recognized as an int

1739671
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
unit tests in dynamic-languages php ruby python etc. provide assistance where static-typing in other languages java c# would typically allow you to more safely refactor

1739674
document-ready	.when
if i do that triggers .when document-ready the second box show

1739676
exception-handling	error-handling
i hold onto the throwable or exception-handling in the asynctask instances itself and then do .something with it in onpostexecute .so my error-handling has the option of display a dialog on-screen

1739680
hide	show
showclosebutton - option to show hide close button

1739683
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
php variables named are case-sensitive but the named of functions are case-insensitive

1739703
double	int
i would think that you have two options multiplying by 1000 and store as an int and divide on the way out or just store as a double

1739708
multiplication	division
this is equivalent to using an int 4 bytes and performing multiplication division to take care of the fractions digits

1739749
oracle	mysql
in addition to the stuff others have mentioned oracle and mysql handle outer join quite differently

1739749
oracle	mysql
actually oracle offers a syntax that mysql won t cope with but oracle will cope with the standards syntax

1739749
oracle	mysql
mysql and oracle

1739773
versioning	upgrade
obviously the default rubygems and ruby-on-rails versioninging would need to be upgrade but i m specifically wondering about the default versioning of ruby that comes with 10.5

1739783
exception-handling	try-catch
you could put a try-catch exception-handling ex block around sections of code and move it around tighten the block and have it log the exception-handling being throw

1739794
configuration	installation
the page itself can be as simple as an empty page and as complicated as running a self-check of the installation file folder permissions db configuration etc. and would only return a http 200 if everything is ok

1739818
contains	set
.when you defined the relationship in the datamodel the set is definedd in the header of the contains object

1739847
kerberos	ssl
step 2 use sspi to get credentials via kerberos or ssl

1739854
binary-search-tree	tree	binary-search-tree	nodes
if you re going for a complete binary-search-tree which is the main reason for using an arrays you can append new elements to the arrays and move elements that break the tree order invariants left descendents nodes and nodes right descendents up the tree

1739859
data-structures	tree	data-structures	dictionary
building libs that implements sophisticated data-structures like binary tree dictionary and such

1739885
serialization	casting
what may be useful to remember though is that once the serialization object has been received by flex and an instances of mx.utils.objectproxy has been created for it this relates to the flex remoteobject class and amf based service but i imagine that a protocols buffering extension would follow the same pattern the process of casting the proxy to an actionscript class isn t all that complicated

1739889
contains	set
finally defined a variant wrapper that contains this-pointer and definedd templates get and set functions

1739894
subtract	modulo	subtract	add
if this isn t working in whatever language the simplest way would be the add or subtract the numbers that would be on the right side of the modulo until the solution is between zero and that numbers inclusive

1739918
exception-handling	try-catch
a try-catch block that catches exception-handling or throwable or

1739928
configuration	installation	32-bit	64bit
with a typical 32-bit python installation of course the total memory you can use in your application is limited to .something like 2 or 3 gb depending on os and configuration .so the longest strings you can use will be much smaller than in 64bit installation with ridiculously high amounts of ram

1739930
titlebar	icons
if you have you ll notice that on the top-left of the windows s titlebar are a few icons save undo-redo

1739937
implements	extends
the main difference between extendss and implementss is that implements changes the class s prototype while extends creates a copy

1739937
implements	extends
this means that if you implements a change into a class all instances of that class will inherited that change instantly while if you use extends then all existing instances will remain the same

1739937
implements	extends
there simply is a difference in the order in which mutators like extends and implements are brought in

1739937
implements	extends
you can implements and extends but you need to declare extendss first for it to work

1739937
implements	extends
you need class human to implements ninja instead and class badass to simply extends human

1739940
contains	any
my connection-string does not contains any infromation about charset even if should how to provide it

1739948
contains	elements	contains	sorted
convince yourself that if you re merging 2 sorted lists a and b and if both lists contains the same value x then it will happen that the two identical elements will be compared with one another

1739952
python	c++
i think it s a lot of fun trying to come up with the shortest code or highly optimized code to compute the results though i generally use c++ or python not c

1739983
compatibility	legacy
this is a legacy design and i must maintain backward compatibility

1739987
windows-hosting	hosting
if you are using a hosting company windows-hosting with asp.net is typically include at little or no additional charge

1739996
plugins	add-on
checked if your open-source cms has plugins add-on module to do this automatically there must be generator somewhere too

1740007
joystick	mouse	joystick	hid	usb-flash-drive	hid
question by usb stick do you mean a usb-flash-drive that contains a file with the instructions or some types of hid device like a mouse or a joystick as the title suggests

1740020
vba	vb6
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6

1740020
vba	vb6
there is no perfect way to work around this but what i personally do is create a public friend sub call initializer with the parameters i want in vba vb6 you use optional-parameters for overloading and then put a quick checked in all exposed members of the class that throw an exception-handling if you try to access them without running the initializer methods

1740020
vba	vb6
it s not great but it s about as good as it s going to get with vba vb6

1740021
perl	php
php and perl are free

1740026
sql-server	oracle
i m planning a data-warehouse migration to sql-server 2008 and trying to think of ways to replicate the lag lead first_value and last_value analytic-functions from oracle in sql-server 2008

1740026
aggregate-functions	analytic-functions
looking at the documentation for user-defined aggregate-functions it is conceivable that the same code structure could be used to provide user-defined analytic-functions

1740027
contains	set
you need to set the appropriate character set in your http content-type header for the html page that will ultimately display the data contains in your json

1740045
click	mouse
however i m a bit lost as to what api libs to use for simulating mouse button click

32-bit	64bit
i know that 64bit windows 7 ships with 32-bit and 64bit versioninging of ie and i d like to send them both the 64bit versioning of my downloading

silverlight	wpf
in other circumstances with wpf silverlight i ve had child controls swallow messages that it would have been nice for the parent to handle

1741978
32-bit	64bit
they could be downloading it for another machine to put on a flash device or just may simply want the 32-bit versioning to run on their 64bit box

1741988
32-bit	64bit
they both do not work because of the same problem as you suggest - 32-bit ie on 64bit windows will wrongly identify the platform as 32-bit

1741988
32-bit	64bit
as most people run 32-bit ie on 64bit windows many plugins flash are not available in 64bit there will be a lot of innacurate identifications

1742351
where-clause	sql	contains	any
note however that the insert updates tables can always contains multiple recording just like any sql table .so you ll need to be sure your logic handles multi-record possibilities for example your insert within your if block should likely contains an additional where-clause .something like this

1742353
contains	elements
edit i have edited the statement above .so it test if elements first-name with id 14 have a body or its body contains a data or return true if first-name event don t have a body

i created a getter-setter on my return function then on the document-ready just called the setter with that value

1742392
annotations	mapping
alternatively you can use the jar-file elements quoting from the jpa specifications 6.2.1.6 if specificationsified these jar files will be searched for managed persistent classes and any mapping metadata annotationss found on them will be process or they will be mapped using the mapping annotations default defined by this specificationsifications

1742393
dependency-injection	singleton
but .when you look at code and can say this singleton here completely spoils dependency-injection and makes testing this impossible you start to develop an appreciation for what patterns make your testing life easier

if both classes are able to let you set an outputstream you might validation that while the classes itself write to printwriter or filewriter or whatever you need in your cases

1742520
buffering	streaming
writer and streaming usually buffering some of your output data in memory and try to write it in bigger blocks at a time

click	mouse
i attach a mouse hook to the form to determine .when the mouse is click out of it .so that i know to close it - by setting

1742578
arguments	undefined
for pure convenience yes - example of it is in the jquery libs where if you invoke an event handler methods such as bind or click internally it maps them to two distinct methodss in this case bind or triggers depending on whether a function was passed which evaluates to true and call bind or if no arguments was passed then undefined is false and .so it triggerss the event handler

1742611
contains	elements	overlapping	padding
setting an appropriate padding might be a reasonable option but you ll likely run into issues with the elements s background overlapping other elementss inside the contains block

1742618
javascript	dom
i understand that you can use an updatepanel to do partials page updates and such but if html content depends on data received by asynchronous call or even .when new content needs to be added to the dom tree because of that where would i insert the javascript necessary to parsing that data and add the required html in such a scenario

1742632

1742665
dictionary	arrays
my boss asked why are you using a dictionary you can just use an arrays it s more efficient

1742668
constructor	object
of course the whole behavior of object classes etc is quite different in c++ and c# garbage-collection autoboxing behavior static constructor etc

1742668
constructor	object
c# is single-inheritance only and will only call the first constructor in the hierarchy or the object ctor

1742668
constructor	object
in c# if no constructor are defined new x is equals to new object

1742679
put	get
instead of doing a lookup to get the abbreviated named of the month just put that as the dropdownlistfor value

1742681
dictionary	arrays
on the other hand an arrays won t let you use a string key as you ve got for your dictionary

1742706
triggers	insert
another tactic rather than a mirror table populate by expanding your stored procedure s try an insert triggers on the table that populate a log table

1742725
dictionary	arrays
it s true that the dictionary will have more extra overhead but if it s accessed frequently you should actually save clock cycles in the long run because you won t have to be looping through an arrays every time you want to lookup a value

1742725
dictionary	arrays
dictionary looksups are much easier to follow in code that arrays lookup

1742729
arrays	loops
put the urls into an arrays loops over the arrays and fetch the urls .

1742750
python	c++	python	java

here note that the union is actually a field in the surrounding structure value

1742776
32-bit	64bit
note your example might be dangerous as sizeof long could be 32-bit whereas sizeof double is always 64bit

1742798
put	get
my way would be to get d restofstring ++ the match then put together numbers with restofstring

1742804
click	mouse
the problem with that is that after the scrollbar is re-enabled it doesn t keep tracking of the current mouse state .so if you hold down the down button with the mouse or click on part of the scrollbar it stops scrolling after it has added the new recording and you have to click it again

1742806

one of the bits of info being loaded here is a jquery-tabs setup .so the onshow function of the simplemodal is used to initiate the tabs which are within the simplemodal

1742944
simplemodal	jquery
if i do multiple consecutive autocomplete on the same page it all works fine unless i have selecteded a different tab on the tabs in the simplemodal ....if i selected a different tab close the simplemodal and then do another autocomplete i get a jquery error which seems to relate to a selectedor doing something with the old selecteded tab that was on the closed modal

1742953

1743148
checkbox	textbox
however changing an already valid checkbox types input to the invalid textbox may not work predictably

1743157
attributes	properties
attributes seem to be harmless until you see a large list of attributes on each class and each properties because every layer adds its attributes

1743170
initializer	eigenclass
the simplest answer the eigenclass can t be initializer

1743175
compression	streaming
this provides streaming and compression that is best suited for a user s connection and reduces load considerably

1743189
switching	screens
in the lighting of your edits i m thinking that perhaps the moment you should switching data sources depends on the state of your live data - .when you ve got enough data in it to be able to show enough of it on the screens

1743201
display	width
you could leave off the overflow properties and simply use min-width in-place of width i can t remember how cross-browser compatible this is to defined the normals width in such a way that the content will force the div to be larger as required to display the content

1743211

1743303
double-quotes	spaces
i ve tried putting the field named in single and double-quotes and even using #20 as the spaces character but those don t work

1743313

that s a fair question and also exactly why i said almost purely for presentation typical computers are limited to 32-bit or 64bit wide numbers which are usually plenty big enough

1743488
arrays	loops
you will likely need to loops over the arrays

1743492
windows-vista	windows
first of all windows-vista and windows 7 both have wpf preinstalled which account for 35 of the market automatically

1743492
windows-xp	windows
.so the bottom line is you probably don t need to worry about whether people will have wpf install on their machines or not unless your target market consists primarily of dial up customers on windows-xp who don t run much third-party .software they just run windows and your application

1743495
lightbox	jquery

1743582
exception-handling	try-catch
there are a bunch of application wide event handler in that file like application_error that catches every exception-handling that isn t caught within your application .so you don t have to use try-catch all the time

1743582
exception-handling	try-catch
but ultimately you don t want to wrap your entire application in a try-catch nor do you want to catch a general exception-handling

1743582
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catches generally slow down your application and a lot of time if you catch every general exception-handling than it could be possible that you wouldn t know a bug exists until months or years later because the try-catch caused you to overlook it

1743587
json	xml
now that there are json encoders and decoders for most languages there s no reason not to use json for uses where it makes sense and that s probably 90 of the use cases for xml

linux	bsd
any os kernel like uhm linux or bsd kernel

1743665
getter	setter
however i only create explicit getter and setter if i need to place some extra code there

1743665
getter	setter
there are some who say it break encapsulation if you don t use getter and setter

1743665
getter	setter
however with a language where you can add getter and setter later without changing the interface i don t think that this is true anymore

1743665
getter	setter
and also bear in mind that if you make a variables bindable without an explicit event named the compiler creates getter and setter for your variables wihtout you even noticing it except there are already getter and setter of course

1743665
getter	setter
this is btw a quick dirty way to implements interfaces that declare getter and setter functions

1743683
environment	building
i m building an android application and would like to maintain a few environment variables that i can tweak depending on whether i m in development mode or release-mode

1743723
quirks-mode	firefox
usually the styles which doesn t work in firefox but do in ie is after all ie s fault because it s either too forgiving or rendering in quirks-mode

1743725
json	xml
then you see json start to fall down but if you just need a serialization format for your data json is smaller lighterweight more human-readable and generally faster than xml

1743775
json	xml
this will launchd firefox with a proxy configure and then let you pull the request info back out as json xml plain text

1743782
web-applications	web-services
json is best for consumption of data in web-applications from web-services for its size and ease of use especially due to the built-in support in javascript

1743782
json	xml
imagine the computation overhead for parsing an xml fragment compared to the instant lookup in json

1743785
hide	show
the particular page is using an updatepanel and hide show dropdownlistfor based off of a selection in a dropdownlistfor

1743785

1743790
revision	svn
one of the things i recently discovered about teamcity is that you it has systemd variables that you can insert-into your building scripting - .so i have the teamcity building numbers comprising the svn revision and teamcity count of building as my identifier - our release package are building artifacts created by teamcity .so my ability to identify a specifc building is fairly good

1743790
teamcity	msbuild
more pointers to answers than a real answer but the tools are there already msbuild with community tasks teamcity others... its just a question of stringing them together

1743797

1743828
portrait	screens
caveat i wasted the lower part of the screens .so that nothing special was needed to address square screenss and landscape portrait orientation

1743839
include	ssi
you probably know easy way to do that is to using static custom user-controls at your website master page file just like old ssi include files right

1743849
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
the problem is that in this case for all of the charts i know i have to provide xml json csv as a source of data that will contains 24 hours 60 minutes points of data with only 29 24 hours every 50min containss meaningful data

1743894
hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
i have hierarchical-data in a nested-set-model table project

1743900
archive	backup
the application we have takes large amount of data most of which is called transactional which is mostly clock in and clock out information of employees most of which is process and stored in an other table.over years this data may grow.i was thinking of backup data to text files and export them if ever from those text files export will clear the data from the database.well now the data is in textfiles that can be archive etc...this is a idea from an other software i saw...what about you suggestions..

1743912
value	field
as for the month you might try a 6-digit value like 200911 .so you can easily .sort them but keep them in an int field

1743925
datepart	to-date
you could now selected these new computed columns use them in a where-clause grouping by those columns - and they ll always be up to-date based on start_date and end_date - they re not computed everytime you access them -- much faster than just using datepart in all your queries

1743931

1743953
contains	any
if any relationship contains a numbers that s too big it s invalid

1743991
versioning	downgrade
even .when is allowed the database versioning is extremly important as the engine is capable of upgrading a database but it cannot downgrade the versioning .so your development versioning can be at most the provider s versioning not newer

1744013
json	xml
i find that a big benefit of json over xml is that i don t have to decide how to format the data

1744013
json	xml
xml may have its merits but for basic data interchange json is much more compact and direct

1744013
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	dictionary	map
this may apply more to people coming from a dynamic-languages background as the basic data types lists dictionary etc built-in to javascript json directly map to the same or similar data types in python perl ruby etc

1744027
data-annotations	xval
i need a data-annotationsmodelbinder that is going to work with system.componentmodel.data-annotations v 3.5 i have found one on codeplex but is for the v 0.99 of data-annotations and it doesn t work with v 3.5 and my xval doesn t work with data-annotations v 0.99 .so i m kinda stuck

networked rdbms with or without dba -- sql-server oracle mysql etc

1744037

i ve started creating the database-schema and external mapping xml file but i m running into some issues with model the entities relationships and associations

1744074
temporary	rvalue
lvalue are value that are stored in an addressable memory location which implies they are assignable assuming they are non-const of course. an rvalue is basically anything else e..g literals constants or non-addressable temporary value

1744074
temporary	rvalue
however a function which returns by value would be an rvalue expression because it returns a non-addressable temporary value and is therefore not assignable

1744078
daemons	systemd
i believe the solution is to make a systemd call to launchctl since that s the daemons responsible for starting stopping systemd service

1744176
python	c++
an example in python which doesn t have that problem and show something i wish c++ had ndash

1744177
exception-handling	error-handling
imho exception-handling should be used .when you want to provide a sane default in case the caller neglects to write error-handling code or if the error might best be handled further up the call stack than the immediate caller

1744181
python	c++
interoperability you can t interface c++ libs with c python modules atleast not easily if you are using exception-handling

1744192

xlib	gdk
it should be possible to do that using only gdk cmd because they map more or less into the same call of xlib

1744314

on the save button i would like to loops through the controls for that particular tab to checked whether all required field have been filled in

1744431
authentication	login

1744487
configuration	logging
if that s the case you can have your framework read for a configuration file that specifies validation and logging levels

1744487
configuration	environment
that way your configuration file can differ between environment and still be running the same codebase

1744514
restart	reload
also specific for server.xml the only way to reload it is to restart the server

1744695
display	height	display	width	hide	show
i don t believe the javascript runtime in any browser has an event you can hook into in between calculating the layout and display the elements .so you can add it in a way that it can t be seen and doesn t affect the height doesn t cause additional scrolling and then show hide it based on the width at this points

1744699
hide	show
maybe you can append it invisible then checked it s width and then consider to show or hide

textbox	button
.when you have an accept button enter in almost any control will triggers that button and it would be best to stay away from handling it separate in textbox

1745190
textbox	button
reversely if you do want to handle it one or more textbox don t use an accept button

1745193
primitive	int
according to the oracle documentation we can map it to either oracle.sql.number or a straightforward int primitive

1745210
contains	elements
i had the same symptom and remedied it by setting the contains elements s font-size to use pixels instead of em

1745217
constructor	object
a url such as foo.webservice dosomething would then create an instances of the same concrete controllers class but pass that instances s constructor a repository object that uses a web service for data-access

1745217
arguments	default
there are several ways to overrides structuremap s default auto-wiring behavior for constructor arguments

1745225
any	set
that way you can set up a timeout-bound read like you were wanting but without pulling any data off of the receive buffering

1745230
administration	account
the way i see it i d give one master administration account maybe 2 or 3 user-accounts and then one application-based account

1745239
coalesce	isnull
the following would be much preferred over a isnull or coalesce approach

1745246
javascript	dom
if you wrap everything in call it won t matter because it wait till the browser is ready for javascript to start acting on the dom

1745260
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
you can set datatrigger for the hierarchicaldatatemplate and have different properties binding

1745266
.when	ready
this should go in the head section of the page and will then run .when the document is ready to run dom

1745270

highlight	cell
how to disable cell highlight in a datagridview

1745272
highlight	cell
highlight should not happen even if i click on the cell

1745288
cursor	row

1745292
declarative	imperative
they can help us implements complicated business rules that may be difficult to express in the declarative form of sql but it then brings us to use the procedural imperative form of sql which is a general feature of sql which is neither very friendly expressive programming-wise and often less efficient performance-wise

1745294
contains	elements	contains	set
the dynamic-programming solution to the subset-sum problem generator a table that contains this answer ie a boolean table of v by n where v is the max numbers of elements and n is the max numbers of items that can be in a set that satisifies the constraints

1745298
json	xml
uxxxx is used in json but not in xml

1745309
credentials	account
account are just sets of credentials that authentication against the server whereas users are sacks of meat

1745330
cassini	iis
i get it working easily on iis but using same configuration it doesn t work with cassini

1745334
contains	any
the given string however doesn t apparently contains any white spaces characters according to python unicode database

.so new users will be redirected to forms login page and once logged in redirected to your silverlight application which will use same user authentication context and therefore will be able to interact with your database

1745352
background-position	background-image
combine your background images into a single image and use the css background-image and background-position properties to display the desired image segment

1745373
put	get
you can put the socket in nonblocking mode then you ll get case ssl_error_want_read or ssl_error_want_write from ssl_accept

1745380
private-members	object
code with reflectionpermission and the appropriate reflectionpermissionflag flags can access the protected and private-members of object

1745382
highlight	selected
however by letting the browser decide what to do on mousemove you get this effect where the browser thinks the user is trying to selected something eg the elements as opposed to moving it and proceeds to frantically try to highlight the elements or text therein as the mouse crosses in or out of the elements during the drag

1745398
.when	ready
everything is pretty much ready to go except while testing i noticed that .when the date rolls over from december 26th to december 27th the year changes to 2010

1745400
directory	folder
that should show you the root directory folder in and the contents of those folder

1745411
webforms	asp.net
i ve got a multiple step webforms written in c# asp.net

1745412
external	embed
if you do not want to call external cmd whether by execute popen or systemd etc but do not want to modify the source of these utilities and compile them into your code relatively easy just change main to main_cut etc then the only remaining option i see is to embed the utilities inside your code and either extraction them at runtime or dynamically create a filing systemd by points at the data inside your code eg using a floppy or cd image and writing a fuse module that pick up the disk image data from a ram address

1745439
windows-server	windows
i have a windows service running c# .net 2.0 on windows-server 2003 r2

1745459
http	ssl
perhaps you include a styles sheet that refers to some image which is without ssl or you reference some javascript which in turn references some other content over http

1745467
any	set
also what about any iframe tags on the page with the src attributes set to an unsecure page

1745479
yaml	ini
but this is quite messy as the configuration file lives outside my python-path and i would rather use a standards configurationuration approach such as using ini files or yaml

1745482
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
if that can t work then it looks like you are facing a roll your own xml json or just plain csv depending on the complexity of the data

1745485
git-status	git-add
it s always wise to do a git-status before either git-add or git-commit to see what s changed and staged as well

1745494
getline	istream
istream getline istream is string str char delim

1745495
order	add
calling add in a different order will produce the same resulting pattern or else it s a bug i d like to know about

1745511
order	add
.so far .when i wanted to validation items i would always create add all the items to the respective order and then the order would call validationitems and take care of all the validation

1745521
perl	ruby
for an example of an ancient 2005 coding practice that demonstrates how taint was tracked without such perl and ruby modules read some good old joel

1745537
ftpwebrequest	ftp
i m trying to use an ftpwebrequest to get the size of a file on a company ftp

1745539
value	field
the current solution uses the two required field to return a list of object that i then filtering and eliminate based on any optional form value

1745539
put	get
should i just put all the form value in a monster query-string and keep making database call from the get request

1745561
32-bit	64bit
64bit vista will run 32-bit executable just fine

1745566
authentication	login

1745569
selected	cell
assuming you want to extends the range of cell in a namedd range and assuming excel 2007 then go to formula tab and click named manager and selected the named you want to updates

1745573
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
64bit assembly programming is quite different from 32-bit assuming your talking x86

1745573
32-bit	64bit
oh and yes 64bit vista will run 32-bit programs just fine iirc you can detection that you are in 32-bit mode from a 64bit os

1745575
databound	gridview
is there a way of having true lazy-loading in combinations with a databound gridview

1745594

second still only in fx2 you ll notice from time to time that you can t anymore neither selected text inside the -moz-inline-stack ed elements nor click on links it could contains

1745597
margins	padding	floating	padding	floating	margins
in addition if you have multiple divs floating that come close to equaling the width height - padding margins .when added together it will crash ie 6 but not ie 7

1745605
triggers	insert
i ve been looking at the possibility of creating a clr triggers for insert but every tutorial found gives me examples of using ado.net object to do the logic - this is not very convenient way.. i don t think i have to convince anyone about that

1745608
environment	restart
as the environment is generally inherited then restart your .app from within itself isn t going to help as it will get your current environment block

1745625
text-editor	editor
direct from the horse s mouth for observation open and never save with either an hex editor or various text-editor

1745633
constructor	private
the only real distinction made by the c++ standards is pod types and non-pod types where non-pod types have features like user-defined constructor member-functions private variables etc. and pod types don t

1745633
constructor	object
apart from and overlapping with c++ the concept of an instances in object-oriented programming usually refers to allocation spaces for an object in memory and then initializing it with a constructor

1745644
hide	show
is there an offset option to the show hide cmd

1745686
interpreter	runtime
it s not an interpreter vs compiled issue per se - matlab has a jit - but matlab s looser typing and syntax may mean more work at runtime

1745686
value	field
rather than having an arrays of object each with field holding scalar value defined object which are themselves arrayss and have the methods take arrayss as input and make vectorized call on the field and input

1745686
arrays	loops
java c++ classes are typically built such that object are the smallest building blocks as specific as you can that is lots of different classes and you compose them in arrays collections object etc and iterate over them with loops

1745690
jruby	mri
things work perfectly .when running under mri but i m getting strange results .when running the same code using jruby

1745696
fontfamily	font-size
it seems that the penalty i am paying is the time it takes to actually rendering the fontfamily for the given font-size and save it into the fontcache

1745712
xsd	xml
i ve been encountering difference in conceptual thinking with my counterparts in .net land specifically because they re just using the xsd xml libs in .net without thinking much about that whilst i m finding myself having to bend over backwards because of xsd s limitations

1745717
any	set
if you do this you will need to bear in mind that any new threads that are created in your service will also need to have their currentculture set as well as threads do not inherited their culture from parent threads

1745740
order	add
i would also add that using a fixed order makes the xml files more user friendly to work with

1745752
linux	bsd
linux bsd and c99-compatible systemd do this

1745761
toolbar	tabs
if you want to switching content what you really want is a toolbar because that is meant to alter an-place view in various ways - tabbar is meant for switchinging between multiple unrelated views and as such you are fighting against it .when you try to use the same view across multiple tabs

1745777
value	field
res is a json object passed to the function and we need to dynamically building form field namedd and assign value to these field the form field named that are dynamically building will exist in the form

1745795
derived-class	base-class
i ve successfully used this approach it to call the base-class s implementation of a methods .when all i have is a reference to a derived-class which overrides that methods

1745798
push	pull
you could either pull or have the .app register for push notifications .when active and be told .when updates are available you can opt to receive notifications only .when the .app is open notification data packets are not large enough to hold the data updates themselves

1745803
selected	textbox
create a numericupdown or textbox control to allow users to selected a refresh time period you can decide whether you want this to be in seconds minutes or something else

1745803
textchanged	textbox
create a timer object and using the textchanged event of the textbox or the valuechanged event of the numericupdown control set the entered value equals to the interval of the timer

1745805
any	set
using this car id is it possible to set person s car to that wanted car which we have it s id without loading selected any car from db

1745806
any	set
i was just wondering is there a way to set up gitosis .so that a user would have their own directory to which they could push any numbers of repositories that they want and essentially have admin privs on that directory

1745806
gitorious	gitosis
i guess i m open to trying to set up gitorious or .something if it allows this but gitosis works pretty well for me right now and it was dead easy to set up and i ve heard that gitorious is not .so easy

1745806
gitolite	gitosis
i ve heard of other fork clones of gitosis that have per branch permissions like gitolite but i m not sure whether i want to use one of those unless they have other compelling features and are as well documented and easy to use as gitosis

1745811
python	java
at cisco we use c and i sometimes run into something that would be easy to do in java or python but very difficult to do in c

1745822
contains	set
even better would be if the form field had their id attributes set to the named contains in the json object

1745823
carbon	cocoa
please note that all of the above techs allow pretty seamless integration with both their native language libs as well as the libs and frameworks found in cocoa and carbon

1745824
hide	show
should i use the viewstack navigator to show and hide different screenss within the .app or is it better to create a new .mxml file for each input screens

1745829
haskell	perl
pyobjc camelbones perl jscocoa javascript cocoa# hoc haskell etc

1745844
export	report
note though the excel-automation suggested is actually against a query as export report to excel makes them exceedingly ugly

1745860
contains	sorted
as you can imagine this .app will contains recording of financial transactional that must be sorted in various ways by date by amounts by recipient by account etc

1745860
ruby-on-rails	django
i m looking for something like django s orm layer or ruby-on-rails activerecord

1745861

not until i close the tab tested in google-chrome and opera

1745872
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
after looking around everywhere i did a cookies test and realized that cookiess are not working .when i use any versioning of ie but works fine with google-chrome firefox safari .

1745876
printf	strcat	buffering	streaming
it could be as simple as strcat on a pre-allocated buffering or a printf to some streaming like a memory streaming i learned about today in creating a file streaming that results in a string -

1745904
python	ruby	python	java
see objective-c++ python or ruby the java bridge is deprecated

1745906
subclassing	base-class
if your subclassing needs custom drawing code it is recommended you use uiview as the base-class

1745909
put	get
if you want to put it in a string though things get more complicated

1745909
linux	bsd
if you have a c99-compatble printf linux bsd not windows the following untested uncompiled code should work

1745917
access-vba	vba
there is no vba equivalent of eval not in excel anyway...there is in access-vba

1745931
value	field
i checked it with my other form which does work but on a different website and the shipping_1 field is identical - with different value of course

1745951
attributes	properties
that said i would use the .value properties rather than the .innertext properties .when retrieving attributes value

1745993
linux	osx
ive setup lighty and php .so many time on linux but i struggled to get the php fastcgi-.socket working under osx

1746049
selected	cell
the approached discussed in the article is to subclassing the datagridview to overrides the processdialogkey event to handle the logic of selected the next cell in the same row or wrapping to first the column on the next row

1746056
where-clause	sql
the situation is not quite as bad if additional predicates in the where-clause allow sql to filtering out a significant amount of recording that would otherwise be process

1746061
assign	add
.when i add a bug workitem in tfs and assign it to a user i want an email sent to that user

1746063
javascript	dom	.when	ready
.when your javascript is loaded and the dom tree is ready then you can replace this messages .so it is never seen with the rest of the webpage

1746084
getter	setter
the author notion of relational is quite off and the code they show is not object-oriented by any means they just show a couple of struct glorified with getter and setter

1746095
double	int
note that your coordinates are all double not int these are not precise units

1746095
rendering	redraw
if you redraw to the wpf rendering context by hand you can use the guidelines systemd to make things line up

1746097
callback	methods
i m not sure if it s possible that you could get a proper return-value from that methods even if the flash player is somehow disabled but in that case i suppose you could simply try and embed a swf with swfobject and see if it worked there s a callback that tell s you wether the embedding was successful or not checked the api docs for more info

1746116
assign	add
and since python strings are immutable and unless we want to monkey-patch our function into string module to add it as a methods we must also assign to the result-of the function

1746122
double	int
rules of thumb int can be cast to and back from double

1746122
double	int
with double you can use much larger int

1746122
double	int
assuming an ieee 754 underlying floating-point systemd you will be able to accurately cast int of 23 bits to and from float and 52 bits to and from double

1746122
double	int
actually you get one more bit because of the hidden bit .so you can fit an int up to and including 1fffffffffffff or 9007199254740991 in a double

1746122
double	int
.so every single 32-bit int has an exact representation in double

1746130
selection	cell
to allow multiple selection of rows and columns and cell

1746130
highlight	cell
this will let you highlight contiguous cell

1746130
highlight	cell
you can highlight arbitrary cell as well see qabstractview.selectionmode

1746130
selected	cell	selection	cell
to determine which cell are actually selected following an action ask the table view for its selection model note the l view.selectionmodel .selectedindexes

1746143
getter	setter
the author seem oblivious to this as evidenced by the fact that the operations in their class diagram are exclusively getter and setter of state information which is why the state optimization data normalize techniques fit .so nicely

1746150
autotools	gnu
chapter 4 covers a minimal gnu autotools project

1746179
configuration	environment
use the same database named usernamed and passwd in both development and server environment .so that i don t have to modify configuration database.php obviously

1746179
httpd.conf	hosts
add virtual hosts in httpd.conf

1746179
hosts-file	hosts
add to your hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts if under windows

1746189
groovy	java
then you can call methods in the stubs from groovy just as you would have called them from java

1746189
groovy	java
the bottom line though is to let java do what it already does well and use groovy where it makes your life easier

1746191
delphi	basic
the basic rules of communication through dlls is to not use anything specific to delphi .so no delphi strings and no tobject descendants

1746204
nsmutablearray	nsarray
edit i know that nsmutablearray can be modified but i m looking for specific reasons performance etc.. why one would use nsarray instead

1746207
communication	messages
how can a php scripting send and receive messages or use a unix socket to communication with the daemons

1746207
while-loop	infinite
most examples of daemons i have seen use an infinite while-loop with a sleep conditional inside

1746207
lookup	any
the actual lookup of the data structure is very fast i don t need any complex multithreading or similar solution as i believe handling the request in a fifo manner will be enough

1746207
twisted	gevent
examples for python twisted gevent

1746208
dependency-injection	singleton
using a static properties - making it a globally accessible singleton - hide your application s dependency on it which is one of the things you re trying to get away from by using a dependency-injection containers in the first place

1746209
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
bufferedreader and bufferedwriter are the most efficient means of writing to and reading from the console as well as any file

1746223
system.out	system.in
in general system.out and scanner on top of system.in are usually enough

1746224
instances	private
private instances field to hold a copy

1746238
show	next
during parsing need to show the next level filtering options if neccesary

1746243
linked-list	heap
there is also another possibility if your code contains other uses of new and delete then it is possible these other uses of allocated memory are corrupting the linked-list structure which defined the heap memory

1746254
double-quotes	single-quotes
the problem is a column string will contains double-quotes single-quotes

1746254
double-quotes	spaces
each column is enclosed in double-quotes followed by comma and no spaces and written into a file

1746265
cassini	iis
i can t give any insight to what s causing your issue but i can say that it works fine for me both in cassini running on localhost and deployed to iis

1746276
service-locator	inject
in other words try to avoid making the containers globally available singleton static properties or even inject to use as a service-locator

1746278
factors	primes
the idea would be to decompose the numbers into its primes factors

1746278
factors	primes
in the example 50 would give 1 2 5 5 50 and then you d need to enumerate all the combinations of these primes factors excluding the trivial 1 and 50

1746278
factors	primes
the primes factors decomposition should generally be straight forwarding think of the way you learned it in earlier math classes but the enumerator of all possible combinations may cause you to pause a bit this is however the types of algorithms that keep coming in a fashion or another in cs applications

1746281
uilabel	uiview
i drag the uilabel to the uiview and then i try to connect the file owner which my custom uiviewcontroller but all that i can selected .when i try to connect to the uilabel is view which is obviosly wrong

.so i m not able to connect iboutlet to their controls in interface-builder

1746291
contains	elements
which should be applied to a document contains the following elements within it s

callback	methods
the worker will callback whatever methods you pass in as the asynccallback in this case-when it s finished to let you know that it s finished and to obtain the result

1746347
silverlight	wpf
i know that there are some easing functions for silverlight and wpf 4.0 coming out

1746352
derived-class	base-class
i cannot just make the overloads of f accept the base-class because i need the derived-class types

1746355
firefox	gecko
updates firefox 3.6 gecko 1.9.2 added support for using the gpsd gps daemons service for geolocation on linux

1746356
nsmutablearray	nsarray
behind the scenes they re secretly the same thing - nsarray and nsmutablearray are both implements with cfarray s via toll free bridging a cfmutablearrayref and a cfarrayref are typedef s of the same thing

1746356
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsarray and nsmutablearray should have the same performance complexity access time being o lg n at worst and o 1 at best and the only difference being how much memory the two object would use - nsarray has a fixed limit while nsmutablearray can use up as much spaces as you have free

1746377
contains	any
what i want to add in is a checked to make sure that request.post contains data in any of those input-field

1746386
build-server	teamcity
i write a lot of little project and i d like to use something like teamcity for my build-server s

1746388
32-bit	64bit
the apple docs state that the cgfloat types is a float on 32-bit and a double on 64bit

1746388
32-bit	64bit
do i have to write a conditional macros .so that -numberwithfloat is called on 32-bit and -numberwithdouble on 64bit

1746388
32-bit	64bit
what h.appens if a user running the 64bit versioning of the .app saves a file where these value are encode as double and the file is opened unarchived on a 32-bit systemd

1746391
postdata	request
with django request object the postdata is stored like a dictionary .so if you know the key in the dictionary you can search for them and checked if they re empty or not

1746402
order	add
the templates also allow me to quickly add and remove arbitrary elements while keeping the list order by weight like a qmap

1746402
binary-tree	nodes
i could implements a data structure like this myself as an arrays of lists of increasing size or as a modified a binary-tree having a count of n elements below each nodes

1746412
export	report
christian has suggested a cmd button on a form but you could also create a toolbar for the report with a button on it that would export the report to excel

1746412
export	report
i would say that more useful would be a button that export the data display in the report to an excel spreadsheet

1746412
export	report
for that you d use docmd.transferspreadsheet and a saved query as your export source equivalent to the recordsource of the report

1746416
click	mouse
for those skipping the previous link the overlay is purely cosmetic must be overlay and should ignore click all mouse events should pass right through it .

1746416
google-chrome	safari
works google-chrome and safari 4 -

1746429
command-line	cmd
it appears that the access command-line arguments are being ignore both cmd mystring and decompile

1746454
.when	ready
you can even sink dwebbrowserevents2 to get notified .when the folder view is ready

1746454
.when	ready
basically you need to handle the documentcomplete and beforenavigate events and be careful not to access the folder view .when the document is not ready

1746470
value	field
there should not be any issue if a field value is missing one or more field it is just normals and should work

1746474
callback	methods
.when a response is received or an exception-handling occurs the callback you passed into the beginxxx methods will be invoked

1746474
callback	methods
inside of this callback methods you need to call the corresponding endxxx methods passing in the iasyncresult that is handed to you

1746476
hash	md5
a single nvidia 9800gtx can calculate 350 million md5 hash second

1746476
hash	md5

1748311
mobile-safari	safari
you might feel smug like i originally did and simply copy-paste the slider from the safari side over to the mobile-safari side and notice that it seems to work you ll see a slider attributes etc

1748311
mobile-safari	safari
after some digging here is what is going on the code generator looks something like this the is an html5 thing and desktop safari just knows how to rendering it but mobile-safari does not

1748353
substitution	replace
i ended up doing a crude string substitution replace n with n

1748363
contains	any
there shouldn t be any difficulty if you mean export the data you meant something like show create-table some_table and selected from some_table ...the only thing i can think of is if the data contains binary...it might be better to base64 on the binary-data to guarantee compatibility...other than that you should be ok

1748374
value	field
what is a good value for this field

1748382
moss	wss
edit1 reading your comment above now you have a editing + upload to ftp types of setup this works for moss and wss by the way even if you don t know the difference

1748414
bison	yacc
ok...you need to add a semi-colon as a token as well in your language specifications...as a fyi do a google-search on this ...there are a few lex yacc files for c programming language as well...and there are plenty of tutorials on this...flex bison are not exactly forgiving on program specifications errors...you really need to understand the elements of how it works...look for jack crenshaw s famo.us tutorial on how to building a compiler

1748446
required	checked
rather than putting emphasis on stuff like that checked for the subtleties that required real understanding of the language should be far more relevant buffering overruns strncpy not append a final 0 .when hitting the limits asking someone to make a safe truncation copy to a buffering of limited length etc

buffering	streaming
the usual way to deal with streaming protocols is to buffering receives until you know you have an entire recording to process

32-bit	64bit
al.so since two answers points in the directions of 64bit vs 32-bit problems my application is a 32-bit executable compiled in c++ builder 5 .so it should be a 32-bit process if i m not mistaken

1748613
contains	set
try replacing the imagebutton with a menu which contains a single menu-item and set the imageurl properties thereof

1748618
32-bit	64bit
you can t load 32-bit dlls in a 64bit process and visa versa

1748618
32-bit	64bit
you can sometimes work around this by getting the 32-bit activex to load as an out-of-process server - its then hosted in a seperate 32-bit or 64bit process as appropriate

1748618
32-bit	64bit
this required that the activex onlyuses interfaces the systemd already knows how to marshalling and or the project built 64bit and 32-bit versioning of the proxy stubs dll

1748618
32-bit	64bit
of course as a 32-bit application on a 64bit os you need to know that 32-bit applications do not get access to systemroot system32 and also do not read and write from hkcr directly

treeview	listview
the treeview viewmodel provides a .profile id that can be used to lookup .profile information in the listview

1749460
treeview	listview
-the treeview s viewmodel could call a static methods in the listview viewmodel that updates the .profile

1749462
getter	setter
a related question would be if we should only set parameters in an object using getter and setter methods

1749472
contains	any
make sure the file named does not contains any of the following characters

1749499
virtual-method	destructor
either because you have rtti enabled or any virtual-method including the destructor will add a vtable

this has the visual effect of making parameter conditional lists look kinda like code blocks but with parens instead of curly-braces

1749537
getter	setter
there are no true setter and getter in the commonly implements javascript versioning .so if you want to emulate the effect you have to use .some different syntax

1749539
contains	any
you wouldn t need to have excel install or use it s object-model at all you could start with a templates .xlsx document which would contains any static items and page layout types stuff then just insert yout content in the right places

1749542
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to rewrite all of your application logic to you can link a mysql mssql postgresql table in access using odbc right click link table

contains	set
these items are contains with an observablecollection in the viewmodel to which a listbox in the view is databound the viewmodel is set as the datacontext of the view

1749555
getter	setter
as for getter and setter it somewhat depends on the language you use

1749555
getter	setter
personally i only provide getter and setter for public properties and or if changing a properties involves logic beyond simply setting getting the properties

1749564
updatepanel	datapager
i have a single listview with a datapager that loads datasource a within an updatepanel

1749571

.so i took a look at drupal django and ruby-on-rails

1749824
ruby-on-rails	django	drupal	django
i hope that some of you people can help me with the choice here since you may already have experience with drupal django ruby-on-rails that i don t have and i really hate it to having start over after being half way though a project only because there is some little thing that can t be implements with technology xyz

1749832
contains	any
if it is contains i don t want it to say true i want it to say yes the words hello is contains here any ideas

1749837
any	set
search only in files of any of a given set of types search only .cs .aspx and .ascx files

1749841
onkeydown	onchange
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for paste data where onchange is probably better

1749842
implements	extends
however i think replacing these abstract-class is a pretty easy refactoring make them interfaces and replace extends with implements where you get compilation errors and i really can t see what could get broken .so i would go for it

1749843
keydown	keyup
keydown keyup keypress

1749907
logging	trace
set the logging level to trace maybe can help

1749907
jdk1.5	jdk1.4

direct3d	directx
after find yourself some books on direct3d for directx 9 sdk game engines and architecture multithreading applications and design-patterns

1749915
direct3d	directx
i would suggest directx 9 graphics the definitive guide to direct3d from alan thorn for direct3d

1749918
click	mouse
the easiest way to get the coordinates for the click relative to the canvas would be to handle one of the mouse events mouseleftbuttondown or mouseleftbuttonup

1749918
click	mouse
using the mouseeventargs.getpostion methods and passing in the canvas as the arguments will give you a points that corresponds to the exact positioning of the mouse click relative to the enclosing canvas

1749924
exception-handling	try-catch
in this case you ll see the exception-handling before it is passed to the try-catch

1749927

16-bit	x86
on a 16-bit x86 segmented memory architecture four registers are used to refer to the respective segments

1749975
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit and 64bit architectures memory model are using segments differently or not at all

1749983
32-bit	x86
i assume you are on 32-bit x86 any other architecture wouldn t work without -fpic

1749989
varchar2	clob
if you use varchar2 then you need to convert the input to a binary datatype or a clob for instances

1749994

1750015
content-disposition	content-type
although this should not be happening because you ve set the content-type and content-disposition i believe that ie s built-in mime sniffing handling is what is causing the problem here

1750019
double	int
unless you know what to expect int double etc you need to use the long case-statement

1750038
order	add
then all i had to do was add the parameters in the order they appeared in the supplied value list

1750043
pascal	basic
you can get an overview of the difference between basic pascal and basic c here

1750043
delphi	c++
but you tagged this as delphi and you mentioned c++ which implies that you ll need information on oop techniques

1750043
delphi	c++
try this article or this one which compare object-oriented programming in delphi with c++ and other languages

1750052
hide	show
from what i understand is you want to show or hide portions of the page depending on what the user selected in a dropdown

1750090
memcached	apc
you can also use apc much like you d use memcached for storing arbitrary user data

1750090
memcached	apc
better to serve a gig of data from one memcached box to four servers than to have 4 copies of that gig of data in apc on each individual server

1750090
memcached	apc
imo concurrency is tricky -- let memcached apc the database deal with it

1750102
python	c++
edit languages i am most familiar with c++ and python

1750154
binary	hex

selenium should be easy enough to get started with just downloading the selenium-ide and click through the form

1750167
drupal	django
it also seems that your break down of the site and what s required fits the django way of thinking a lot more than the drupal way

1750167
drupal	django
drupal doesn t use object the same way django do and it s use of oo programming is a lot different too since it doesn t use object that often

1750167
drupal	django
it seems to me that for you it will be a lot to use django but if i should choose right now between django and drupal both of which i use for different project drupal would be my choice since most of what s needed is already made .so all that s needed is setting up a few things

1750167
ruby-on-rails	django
disclaimer i haven t worked with ruby-on-rails .so don t know how that would be but from what i ve heard it s a lot like django in many aspects

1750183

1750930
touch	drag
granted this is for pretty simplistic controls and you may reach a points where this will not give you enough functionality but this has worked for all my purposes for custom-controls to this points and is really easy to use since i typically care about the same control events that the uicontrol already supports touch up drag etc...

1750958

1751415
versioning	upgrade
latest versioninging first - this one is rather obvious and always stressed in the upgrade guides but nevertheless worth mentioning upgrade core and all modules to their latest current versioning first before doing a major upgrade as the upgrade code is highly likely to depend on the latest table data-structures to work correctly

1751441
lgpl	gpl
open source libs not gpl but lgpl will be ok

1751713
xsd	xml
at any rate it s not at all clear from what you ve posted that you re bending over backwards because of xsd s limitations. the limitations are most likely in the systemd that s using the xml not in the schema that validation its messages

you can hide the tr just as easily al.so if you hide the tr or div the content wont show .so why try to hide the children

1752039
contains	elements
i also notice the tostring underlying implementation issue and about the elements contains the separator but i thought i was being paranoid

1752040
contains	sorted
i types acv in the textbox and all strings contains acv are sorted to the top

1752047
output	mode
you just need to explicit append a n each time you want a line break -- if you re append to the output file in text mode this will expand to the proper line separation where needed windows

1752047
output	mode
you could use os.linesep instead if you had to output in binary mode for some reason but that s a pretty unusual use case -- normally text mode and n are much better

1752054
associations	model
it will submit a blank templates for each associations but the reject_if clause in the model will discard them leaving only the user-created field

1752055
oprofile	vtune
to find out performance and to drill down to your bottlenecks intel vtune or oprofile are extremely helpful

1752071
chromium	mozilla
mozilla and chromium also give the arch named eg

1752099

1752140
multiplication	division
i did some speed testing to figure out what is the fastest .when doing multiplication or division on numbers

1752140
multiplication	division
i got nonsensical results such as a massive loops operating in 2 microseconds or that multiplication was the same speed as division if only that were true

1752140
multiplying	division
multiplying to divide using double seems the fastest way to do a division followed by integer-division

1752142
google-docs	spreadsheet
i recommend google-docs and spreadsheet

1752150
order	add
the thing is i m unable to find a way to add the order details to an uncreated order because it throw an exception-handling of insert null value to the db

1752151
expression	brackets
the answer is to enclose the inner expression in brackets .so that it will be parsing before the outer one is

1752159
colt	svd
colt is another java maths libs with matrix and svd

1752164
frame	width	height	frame
note that even though i cannot see the video .when i listen to the onmetadata of the streaming i can get plenty of information about the video such as width height fps changes during playback as if a video is show numbers of decode frame

1752165
multiplication	division
there are lots of ways to perform certain arithmetic .so there might not be a single answer shifting fractions multiplication actual division .some round-trip through a logarithm unit etc

1752171
slidedown	slideup
.when slideup slidedown animation only work one way it is often a positioning bug

1752178
directory	folder
if you need the directory to be within your solution folder somehow maybe you should refer to the directory your executable resides in ... solutiondir bin debugging which you can get using

1752207
.net	wcf
you cannot have two methods with the same named in wcf - wcf is not .net and you cannot have two methodss by the same named being different only by their signature

1752209
64bit	x86
it looks here like you re interested only in the platform you happen to be on which guessing from your execution time seems to be 64bit x86 either intel core2

1752257
methodology	waterfall
i ve had the privileges of working with less-than-optimal teams using a scrum-like methodology and found it more successful than a traditional waterfall methodology would have been with the same people for reasons including

1752257
methodology	waterfall
in traditional waterfall methodology it s more acceptable for a developer to go dark for weeks on end-- and with a bad team this is the worst possible thing that can happen

1752263
stringbuilder	printwriter
it looks like the simplest thing is to call printstacktrace x where x subclassing a printstream or printwriter and gathers it to a stringbuilder and can return a string

1752289
contains	any
edit the contains application is in java .so any recommendations for which there are free or cheap java-based apis for would help

1752320
ubuntu	linux
the example i m thinking about is libnotify which enables for notification of messages with or without image and title this can for instances be found in ubuntu linux 9.04

1752325
push	pull
note that you ll likely want to perform these operations in a local branch .so that you don t inadvertently push them to your friend s master branch or your friend doesn t pull them into his master branch

1752352
python	ruby
there is nothing exactly like ruby s stringscanner in python

1752353
set	bag
to handle more than one level deep for eager fetching you ll need to use a set instead of a bag or list

1752355
filtering	sorting
currently we are filtering and sorting data with a datatable

1752355
filtering	sorting
is there another collections containers that is optimized to do this types of filtering sorting

1752378
hash	md5
using a hash like md5 or sha on the id is not a good idea

1752378
increment	reset
a better approach if you reset on avoiding increment ids would be to use a guid or just a random value .when you create the id

1752388
value	field
if you stick the data within a field you could use decodeuricomponent to decode the value

1752390
buffering	streaming
building a component that reads the com streaming in in say a 1024 buffering

1752412
versioning	packaging	packaging	building
with sun model you should solve this at building packaging time create and assemble two versioning of the component each using a specific local resource ref named

1752413
double-quotes	single-quotes
make sure you surround strings with double-quotes and not single-quotes

1752427
python	perl
it install its own copies of perl python etc. .so that the macports install is standardized and to avoid conflicts apple-supplied versioning of .some programs like perl and python and .some libs often lag far behind the latest versioning of those tools

1752436
stderr	stdout
ipc open2 ipc open3 to start a program while getting its stdout stderr via a file handle

1752440
any	set
i went through the tutorial here and i can get a graphing to show but i don t see any tick marks or labels on my axis set

1752445
increment	average
.so i guess mediocre developers with industry standards average tools and an average level of team co-operation is likely to produce increment of mediocre .software on time and budget

1752458
buffering	streaming
by defining your own buffering you can customize the behavior of the streaming

1752458
buffering	streaming
while the data is being written there is no reason why another thread can not continue to read data from your streaming you may need to some fancy footwork to make sure they are reading writting to different areas of the buffering

1752459
put	get
the idea of a self documenting rest api is that one can be given a single entry-point into a systemd and be able to discover all functionality available through the returned document combined with understanding of standards usage of the rest verbs get put delete

1752460
double-quotes	single-quotes
try replacing your inner double-quotes with single-quotes like .so

1752467
swingworker	executor
using swingworker plus maybe an executor if the updates to the model are frequent and you want some control over the execution of the highlight threads

1752494
click	mouse
another option is run this function if alt+strg+a is pressed during a mouse click on a wpf elements

1752494
contains	any
the only problem with the current implementation if i defined a keyet which does not contains any real key like run if alt is pressed it is also triggers if alt+a is pressed

1752497
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in safari and google-chrome

1752497
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome it does not

1752497
google-chrome	safari
there s a very peculiar issue which i can t believe has gone unnoticed for google-chrome safari .so maybe .something on my end

1752497
google-chrome	safari
which for some bloody reason wouldn t work in google-chrome safari

1752526
attributes	properties
create an aspects on every properties that s already been decorated by an attributes

1752540

you d then have a repository it s the factory-pattern maybe with singleton that maintains a list of icalendereventreader writer implementation for the different formats

1752543
filtering	sorting
datasource also provide a nice way to handle sorting filtering and paginator

1752555
decrement	increment	keydown	keyup
you can increment a counter for each keydown event and decrement it for each keyup event

1752556
sequences	unique
of course if sequences was not unique then the result would be undefined

1752556
sequences	unique
but if sequences is unique as in my case is this guaranteed or is it simply a lucky implementation detail that s subject to change

1752571
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve already migrate applications to webforms but have decided to try asp.net-mvc for this migration for a numbers of reasons including the fact the code in this application is not spaghetti and seems to lend itself to an asp.net-mvc styles layout

1752571
asp.net-mvc	webforms
are the authentication session and general code re-use issues that generally crop up in regular asp to webforms migrations any different .when working with asp.net-mvc

1752580
value	field
i bet it just uses a random value for sequences field

1752594
subtract	formula	unsigned	zero
if you are using unsigned value for the samples then you will need to do more work first you need to convert them to a signed value with a zero centering eg if you have 16-bit unsigned samples subtract 32768 from each then apply the formula then convert them back to the unsigned format

1752603
versioning	upgrade
if the next versioning of either software changes its internals you could get different query results after you upgrade

1752603
aggregate-functions	sum
what about other aggregate-functions like avg or sum

1752604
abstract	super	implements	abstract	implements	super
then implements your two behavior in two different classes which shared whatever they need of an abstract super types

1752620
deprecated	javadoc
note that there is both a deprecated and a deprecated - the capital d versioning is the annotations and the lowercase d is the javadoc versioning

1752622
value	field
i figured the easiest way to do it is to have the database-table for an item have a field called order which gets a value

1752630
.net	wcf
you can use jax-ws service on the java side and then use wcf in .net

1752631
oracle	mysql
oracle can do this but i don t know about mssql and mysql

1752637
xsd	xml
you might try documenting it by creating an xsd schema which would provide a more formal specifications of your xml

1752637
xsd	xml
many tools will generator the xsd for you from sample xml as a starting points

1752640
xsd	xml
an even better way would be to create an xml schema xsd file

1752640
xsd	xml
for a great series of tutorials on xsd checkout w3schools - xml schema tutorial

1752641
xsd	xml
i d write an xml schema xsd file to defined the structure of the xml document

1752641
xsd	xml
the xsd file can be transformed into documentation using xslt stylesheets such as xs3p or-tools such as xml schema documenter

1752643
aggregate	grouping
i don t know of any database which will intuitively solve this sort of problem where you want to get related row value for a grouping based upon the result-of an aggregate for a specific column

1752647
lgpl	gpl
keep in mind that even though a project is gpl that does not mean you can t contact the author s about an lgpl option on the underlying code

1752653
udp	tcp
assuming this is tcp not udp you can think of the socket as a streaming of bytes

1752653
put	get
the sender can put them in in whatever way he wants and you can get them out in whatever way you want

1752654
export	csv

.when you selected one of the layout you have saved vswindowmanager will automatically hide show and rearrange windows .so they are in the exact same layout as before

1752701
nsinteger	int
.so how to convert an nsinteger to int

1752711
nsinteger	int
nsinteger is nothing more than a 32 64bit int

1752715
debugging	exit
dont exit from ie just stop debugging in vs2008

1752722
lookup	any
you can accomplish this with a simple insert statement into the phpbb database however inorder to ensure that all things go smoothly you need to make sure that you also insert any other rows phpbb would otherwise insert for a new thread lookup documentation source code for that

1752722
contains	any
you can hardcode a specific field named that must contains a specific access key .so that any incoming post gets that don t have it will be ignore

1752725
deprecated	javadoc
.so it appears that all you can really do is throw in an deprecated tag that the compiler will printing out or put a custom tag in the javadoc that tells about the hack

1752727
bindingsource	dataview
use a filtering dataview and then set your datagridview s bindingsource to the filtering dataview

1752731
debugging	exit
dont exit from ie just stop debugging in vs2008

1752735
ruby-on-rails	django
that language may be php for you then choose symfony or something or if it s java that maybe spring will do or else ruby-on-rails or django

1752738
emacs	vim
.so i would like to learn how it can be done effectively using may be emacs or vim + other tools

1752738
project-management	project
it will be quite a big project .so i am worried about project-management and debugging issues mostly as well as the productivity factors

1752738
python	c++
i am using snow leopard.i would al.so delve into c++ and python in the future .so may be .something that will be useful for those as well

1752800
any	set
is there any way to intercept properties call in javascript .so i can proactively set a no-value properties as null

1752804
configuration	installation	installation	building
generally an installation of libxml2 include a configuration scripting xml2-config that users of the libs use to find the correct paths to its components and other building info

1752804
macports	fink
if you ve install another versioning of libxml2 make sure your path is set such that its xml2-config will be found first by the imagick configure scripting .so ensuring most likely one of usr local bin opt local bin macports or sw bin fink comes before usr bin on path

1752816
environment	building
i m building a user and contat management and i ve managed to get a working many-to-many relationship between contact and grouping pojo in my environment with either hsql or mysql 5.0.51 but not on a local test server .because of that i ld like t try the double one-to-many as.sociations .so there are few things i would like to ask about that mapping with the introduction of an intermediary model

1752816
hsqldb	mysql
.so this works fine on my machine with hsqldb and my local mysql however it s not the same for the local testing server using the same mysql 5.0..so here are my questions

1752816
associations	model
i m using manning java persistent with hibernate which is a great book from where i started practicing the usage of hibernate.in that book the is a double one-to-many associations let s say in my case between contact and grouping with an intermediary model

1752822
disassembly	native-code
using a piece of native-code to encrypt the data similar to the first option but a native dll is harder to disassembly than a .net-assembly .so it required more skills to find the key

1752854
typemock	mstest
the way i have gotten the tests to run via partcover is to make partcover run the typemock runner which in turn runs mstest

1752854
directory	folder
working directory a folder that already exists

1752864
transient	entity
the actual localizable properties on your entity productname on accessorytype would be transient

1752876
continuous-integration	code-coverage
i ve used trac + bitten for continuous-integration it was fairly complex setup and required substantial amount of time to rtfm set up and then maintain everything but i could get nice visual report with failed tests and error messages and graphing for failed tests pylint problems and code-coverage over time

1752879
postgresql	mysql
i owe you a half option if you re not bound to mysql postgresql could offer a interesting alternative table inherited

1752879
postgresql	mysql
one final words about mysql and postgresql

1752879
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a database that imho in most aspects is today superior to mysql is just not that famo.us

1752879
postgresql	mysql
and no i m not just a postgresql fanboy i m a senior mysql user i started using mysql with a versioning 2.something i introduced it more than 10 years ago in the company i still work for and made it the default database and today i don t allow any new development i can decide to be based on mysql

1752936
callback	methods
the user class is the db model and an authentication class has assorted methodss for connecting to the oauth and the callback route which will have the authentication.save methods being called

1752947
compare-and-swap	atomicity
.so the jvm can create a pool of monitor and each object could just have a pointers field which is filled in .when a thread actually wants to synchronized on the object with a platform-specific atomicity compare-and-swap operation for instances

1752947
constructor	object
i think you can arrange for the constructor of object to do nothing but obviously a lot depends on the implementation

1752951
zend-framework	symfony
loosely coupled i like symfony but i really also like that i can use different components from zend-framework

1752956
object-reference	instances
--- object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1752967
value	field
typically including the field types default-value list value data validation visibility rules and actions which can be triggers etc

1752968
value	field
if previous value was 0 assume that 0 is not a valid index and is the initial value for the hidden syncblk_index field of our object our syncblk creation was not contested

1752995
directory	folder
the safest way if it is an option you are using windows auth is to make it a non-issue by using active-directory rights on the folder .so it doesn t matter if the user attempts to access a directory that is not valid

1753023
dialog	pop-up
for each part i want to add a small button pop-up as dialog which will convert that part to a dialog on-demand and then .when closing the dialog to return back to the form with the new input

1753024
any	set	object-reference	instances
but in any case the server should return a more informative messages than object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1753044
margins	padding
i don t think there s any browser that applies a margins nor a padding and it just wrap around it s contents

1753061
duplicates	contains	order	add
finally a palette can add those semantics for you a palette has a named contains multiple colors but no duplicates and order isn t important

1753071
solaris	linux
no you cannot mix solaris and linux binaries

1753075
ruby	php
i m looking for a libs in php or better yet in ruby to handle an events calendar

another option is to set core.excludesfile to the named of a file contains global patterns

1753094
arrays	loops
.when the object are initializer they are stored in an arrays and then i am attempting with the following code to execute functionality common to all the object in this loops

1753094
arrays	loops
vptr is an arrays of object and the functions in loops are common to all the object

1753113
change-password	login
user must change-password at next login

1753139
font-size	height
the height is a bit trickier as an empty span seems to have a height .so you need to set the font-size to 0

1753149
powerpc	arm
well most riscs are very much alike .so if you know the powerpc well then transitioning to arm mips or sparc will all be a snap

1753177
single-sign-on	cas	single-sign-on	shibboleth	shibboleth	cas
with saml you can communication between the major single-sign-on ss0 technologies like cas openid shibboleth ad ldap.

associations	model
i need to be able to validation on creation of a model sale if it s associations product hasn t reached zero in a product.column called stock_number

1753194
double-quotes	single-quotes
also try single-quotes instead of double-quotes in the javascript

1753195
textbox	button
the verify view is simply a textbox with a button .so the user can enter the verification code manually the user can get to this page from the site and might prefer just to copy-paste the code

1753206
jtextfield	jlabel	jtextfield	jlist	jlabel	jlist
a time-tracking program can start out extremely simple a simple jtextfield a jlist some jlabel and a button or two but you can literally add hundreds of features to familiarize yourself with different parts of the api

1753216
communication	messages
my question is how can i seperate error related messages into a different interface and then make a communication between them

1753223
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i am very new to codeigniter but understand oop and asp.net-mvc as i do a lot of ruby-on-rails development

global-variables	call
if you want to use javascript you could make some global-variables for your javascript to use that get setup before you execute any of your other javascript call

1753236
required	checked
it is fairly typical for a java application to do some self checked at startup and if any of the required dependencies are not present or in the right state the application will not startup

1753271
value	field
you could modify boost-signals detail signal_base_impl connect_slot to clean up any previous iterator value it finds in the signal_data field of an existing connection if you re comfortable making such a change and running a custom building of boost

1753275
nsinteger	int
i m not sure about the circumstances where you need to convert an nsinteger to an int

1753275
32-bit	64bit
used to describe an int independently of whether you are building for a 32-bit or a 64bit systemd

1753275
nsinteger	int
you can use nsinteger any place you use an int without converting it

1753296
spring	guice
how do i mimic the singleton behavior in guice in spring

1753314

managed-code	native-code
none of those options exist in c# because c# generator managed-code and c++ generator native-code machine language code

1753930
managed-code	native-code
managed-code is called verifiable because it has much stricter checked than c++ and enforces type-safety in ways that c++ and native-code cannot

1753930
managed-code	c++-cli
these checked are irrelevant for managed-code written in c++-cli

1753930
managed-code	native-code
much of this is due to the fact that that native-code runs directly on the hardware and managed-code runs inside the .net runtime clr

1753930
managed-code	native-code
dynamicbase - managed-code produces byte called intermediate-language il and is dynamically compiled to native-code jit at runtime .so it has no fixed address spaces to randomize

1753938

sorteddictionary	sortedlist
i m not sure how accurate the msdn documentation is on sortedlist and sorteddictionary

but if the sortedlist uses a binary-search-tree why would it be much slower on additions than sorteddictionary

1754080
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
each test operates on a sortedlist sorteddictionary contains 10 000 int32 key

1754080
sorteddictionary	sorted
as you can see on sorted data the sorted list is faster than the sorteddictionary

1754080

however you would expect the memory usage of a sortedlist to be equals or greater than or at least equals to a sorteddictionary

value	field
you can commit only the field changed by the user if you display a form with 10 items on and they only change 1 you only store that one value back to the database

1754492
value	field
the logic behind this is that if someone changes a different field you don t affect it by overwriting it with what is now the previous value - and if it s the same field that they changed your data is technically newer

.so i want to enable a submit button whenever an option in my selected box #purchase is selecteded .so long as the selectedion is not the default-value

1754689
any	set
.so my recommendation would be to start creating wpf versioning of your existing controls or buy a set from .someone like telerik for any non-domain-specific controls you ve created like toolbar etc and only keep winforms controls for extra-complicated bespoke controls you ve created

.when you are saving large nested sets you should consider the nested-set-model it s a different approach for storing hierarchical-data in a flat table which mysql or any other non-xml database is

1755137
constructor	object
what you achieve is that the object returned from a jquery.fn.init constructor has access to jquery methods

.so you have vector of treefield controls each has .some text value on enter text you walk through all vector and on first equality focus a field

1755148
key-value	key
.when you add a key-value par you just add it as normals to the first dictionary and then retrieve the key set belonging to that value from the second dictionary and add the key

1755171
private-members	private
the use of private properties is with reflection the same as without it but if one considers using reflection to access private-members in a third-party class he should be very sure to know what he does - and he sure knows that this can break operability

1755250
python	tcl
this would involve fork the latest versioning of tk part of the tcl project then replacing the the internal usage of tcl scripting with python scripting

1755250
python	tcl
instead this will be like brain surgery identifying all the linkages between tk and tcl .so that you can either refactor into a simpler interface to python or do a one to one replacement of tcl with python

1755250
python	tcl
this would required learning tcl and python as well as probably writing some tools to help you enumerate the interconnections between tcl and tk

32-bit	64bit
instead in 64bit windows long is 32-bit wide and long longs and pointers are 64bit wide

1757462
synonym	term
i m guessing that it s probably something to do with the way sql-server ranks results which treats stemmed wordss and synonym with equals weight to the original term and takes into account words density for ranking which would be good with long passages of text but doesn t really apply with short phrases like these

1757473

linked-list	hashmap
if two hash value map to the same entry -- a hash-collision -- hashmap building a linked-list

1757554
linked-list	hashmap
in the extreme case if all your key have the same hashcode or if they have different hashcode but they all map to the same slot then your hashmap turns into a linked-list

1757554
hash-collision	key
.when there s a hash-collision it has to compare the incoming key against every key that mapped to that slot

1757554
linked-list	hashmap
but anyway that doesn t affect the whole points that i was trying to make .when you have two key -- yes different key not the same key showing up again -- that map to the same slot in the table hashmap building a linked-list

1757555
reflection	runtime
to use genericss at runtime you need to use reflection - look through all the typess in the assembly for the one you want you can use types.issubclassof get a methodsinfo for the generics methods you want to call on it then substitute in the actual types you want to call it on with methodsinfo.makegenericsmethods and call it using invoke

1757666
put	get
put functions into your selectors object which you can call whenever you need to get the current list of matched dom elements

1757691
scala	java
defining an object in scala is like defining a class in java that has only static-methods

version-control	git
why not simply put ooimpress document under something like subversion or git and use tortoisesvn to let end-users manage the version-control bit

1757742
contains	elements	contains	any
because programming in .net is more about the framework than any specific language or syntax on top the msdn documentation is invaluable for crossing over c# and vb.net barrier because it contains one-to-one samples of using c# and vb.net syntax for .net common elements

am i correct in saying that a major upgrade will replace all files in all components regardless of whether the assembly versioning of the file has changed and that on small updates and minor upgrade it only replace a file if the guid is the same and the assembly versioning of the file has been increment

1757860
sql-server	mysql
c# would access mysql and sql-server basically identically using ado.net or linq - linq-to-sql is tied to sql-server but it doesn t appear to have a long life ahead of it .so that wouldn t be a factors in my mind although ide integration might be

1757869
filtering	grouping
within form and policy pages we offer an exposed filtering of document grouping as dropdown control

1757885
sql-server	mysql
i have used sql-server for many years on c# project large and small but have been using mostly mysql for the last year on various c# but open-source-related and startup-related project which were already using mysql

1757885
sql-server	mysql
for example all join in mysql are nested loops join while sql-server can do hash join or merge join which can sometimes boost query performance 10x+

1757885
sql-server	mysql
i use c# entity-framework and linq with mysql too .so it s not an either-or thing although performance is likely to be better with sql-server in a .net environment because the teams work together to boost performance and make integration work better

1757885
sql-server	mysql
sql-server s sql-language support is richer than mysql s including some very cool features in sql 2008 especially like row_number grouping_sets optimize for computed columns etc

1757885
sql-server	oracle
there s no oracle acquisition cloud hanging over the future of sql-server

you can get similar open-source tools for free pentaho birt etc. but integration tends to be better with sql-server

1757885
innodb	myisam
for very simple readonly or non-transactional workloads a db-based caching access from a web .app where you can get away with using myisam instead of innodb i hear that mysql can be significantly faster

1757885
oracle	mysql
caveat i hear that mysql 6.0 is supposed to address many of the gaps and difference above but i admittednly haven t kept myself up to speed with how the oracle thing etc

1757885
sql-server	mysql
the real win for a c# + .net + visual-studio + sql-server combinations imho is that they have been designed in parallels over the last 10 years to all work well together .so you ll get ease of use and synergy that you may not get using mysql

1757888
triggers	insert
it looks as though something is triggers an abbrev insert that leads to php-template-if-hook

1758116
factory-pattern	factory-method
then use the factory-pattern to generator the right types of object depending on the parameters passed to the static factory-method

1758126
blacklist	whitelist
you could use a blacklist which is not going to catch most things a whitelist which is going to block most non-harmful links or a redirect screens that warns the user don t be an idiot this link might be malicious which doesn t prevent the links but lets you say you warned the user and it s their own fault

1758135
enterprise-architect	visual-paradigm
i personally prefer enterprise-architect or visual-paradigm for uml for my diagram

1758137
backslash	regex
a dot in a regex expression means match any character except a newline unless you added a special flag which will al.so match newline .so to match an actual dot-character we have to escape the dot-operator by prepend a backslash

1758142
copy-constructor	constructor
i assumed that output would be regular constructor for rhs followed by copy-constructor for lhs

1758158
google-chrome	firefox

json	xml
this problem has already been solved in a standard-conforming way see yaml xml and json

1758204
json	xml
if it s such a low-level protocols that yaml xml and json are not available you really should take individual fundamental types apply your hosts s versioning of hton

1758204
32-bit	64bit
i realize that there is a long tradition of reading and writing straight from structures but i ve also spent a long time fixing that code later .when it was move from 32-bit to 64bit environments.

1758212

if you want to implements it the final state machine would be just fine

1758222
void	main
int main void

1758222
haskell	c++	parser-generator	parsec
if you are parsing .some more complicated input and if you do that often you should learn ebnf form and learn .some parser-generator like bi.son c++ parsec or happy haskell and .so on

1758227

silverlight	wpf
i ve been using mostly xbaps for browser deployment while waiting for a silverlight versioning that include wpf s full templating and data binding capabilities

1758300
silverlight	wpf
what does wpf still have to offer over silverlight 4

1758300
silverlight	wpf
why change from wpf to silverlight 4

1758300
silverlight	wpf
we considered using silverlight instead of wpf but decided we want a full blown desktop-application with the whole unique desktop-application feeling and advantages that gives

1758300
silverlight	wpf
however starting today there has been a lot of buzz out there about silverlight 4 being announced at pdc09 and people stating that there aren t many arguments left to choose wpf over silverlight 4

1758300
silverlight	wpf
why can silverlight now be used instead of wpf

1758302
selected	textbox
i am trying to loops through some elementss in a form radio textbox and selected boxes and get the value from each elements

1758305
buffering	streaming
how you decide to empty that buffering depends on if you are process a streaming of data or data packets

1758305
buffering	streaming
if you are process a streaming simply have your background-process remove the bytes from the buffering and process them fifo

1758305
.when	ready
i would implements some types of flow control as well to signals to the pc if something went wrong like a full buffering or if packets-processing time is long to indicate to the pc .when it is ready for the next packets

1758311
set	bag	order	add	getter	setter
yes it s because of inverse true an alternate solution would be to use a set or bag instead of list with order listorder add the listorder column as a properties to the myclass class with an empty setter and a getter that always returns it s index from it s parent s child collections

1758324
hotmail	gmail
this might seem unlikely but say the user signed up for your site 5 years ago with their hotmail account and they have since switched to gmail

1758327
silverlight	wpf
the fuzz is that silverlight 4 will have many of the most commonly used features of wpf that were previously lacking

1758327
silverlight	wpf
the reason silverlight 4 can be used instead of wpf is it now has the ability to run outside a browser and access the local filesytem

1758327
silverlight	wpf
wpf should still be used .when you need features that aren t available in silverlight 4

1758329
directory	folder
if i ve published the website in updatable mode to the precompiledweb folder and release it with the appropriate references in the bin directory why does it look for the class on my machine

1758331
contains	elements
at the top of the page body insert a div elements with the id header contains the inline image mlogo.jpg

1758337
silverlight	wpf
i m working on an application we made wpf instead of silverlight as we wanted a full blown desktop-application with the whole unique feeling and advantages that gives

1758337
silverlight	wpf
why should i consider moving my wpf application to silverlight 4 - given that i still want a desktop-application

1758365
contains	elements
create a copy contains only the elements meeting the criterion

1758367
revision	svn
if you don t pass any versioning numbers to svn-merge and your svn server versioning is 1.5 or newer it will tracking the merges you ve previously done and automatically merge only newer revision

1758388
silverlight	wpf
if your reasoning for wpf is that you want a full blown desktop .app then silverlight is not an option

1758389
silverlight	wpf
i think your understanding of wpf and silverlight is a little lacking

1758389
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a subset of functionality and features that are found in wpf

1758403
contains	elements
however if your second arrays contains elements not found in the first one these will then be in the resulting list intersect works symmetrically

1758409
contains	any
in retrospect we should have prevented any of the join columns in either dataset from contains nulls but we didn t and now we have to live with it

1758412
contains	set
typically used for search results - patient object are large but patient digests contains the basic information to identify the patient in a set of potentially hundreds of britneys and michaels search results last first charts numbers dob

if your environment permits it you can use a sound systemd with different sounds to play .when someone break the building

1758444
autotest	cucumber
this happens for all of my rspec and cucumber tests using autotest and normally running tests individually

1758447
hashtable	sorted	sorted	lookup
you might have some luck using a hashtable or a sorted list with binary-search in the case of int strings and other sorts of ways to reduce the lookup overhead which will at least get you to o n log n

1758487
contains	elements
elements contains the actual id which

1758495
entity-framework	ado.net
a big difference between linq-to-sql and entity-framework is that ef implements the entity datamodel specifications edm and there are other product that are built around the edm like ado.net data service aka astoria

1758521
getter	setter
instead of being lazy-evaluation i create public methods that allow me to communication with them via setter and getter

1758541
pointers	stack
however if you still want to go ahead an do this just use a regular circular-buffer and keep pointers to the head and tail of stack

1758561
value	field
is it possible to simply put my links in the value field or should i building a hidden menu in plain html li ul with tags contains the links somewhere in my page

1758590
logout	login
this example show how to show login logout and toggle visibility .when a user logged in event is raised

1758595
calling-convention	dllimport
looks like the calling-convention is not stdcall which is the default one used by dllimport

1758595
calling-convention	dllimport
.so you have to add this calling-convention to the dllimport call

1758597
pixels	line
i had to add a change to get a two pixels line

1758608
type-conversion	int
both of these seem to rely on implicit type-conversion to int and then back to bool

1758615
arrays	loops
i have a php scripting that has a for-loops which cycles through an arrays with in this is an nested loops which cycle through a sub arrays

1758616
callback	methods
you use a function pointers .when you need to give a callback methods

1758627
traceroute	ping
i think you ll need to ping or traceroute to a machine that will respond on that ports

1758627
telnet	ssh	traceroute	ping
and of course if you can ssh or telnet into your server you can do all this much more easily using the ping and traceroute cmd

1758631
arrays	loops
in that detail view i am trying to populate a table from a plist using a for object in arrays loops

1758631
dictionary	arrays
the plist is an arrays of dictionary

1758631
dictionary	arrays
i am running though the dictionary to find one with a key that is the title of the callout and then get an arrays from inside that dictionary

1758631
dictionary	for-loop
i guess i am just really unsure as to how to deal with the strings and dictionary used in the for-loop

1758645
richfaces	gwt
richfaces and jsf unlike gwt allows for more document-style webpage rather than application-style

1758680
silverlight	wpf
one of the biggest difference between silverlight and wpf is that silverlight is sandboxed .so i still see a place for wpf in desktop applications

1758683
toupper	tolower
an example of such functions are the standard-library toupper and tolower functions in ctype.h - we could use this string_apply function to make a string_toupper function easily

1758684
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
unchecked-exception are further broken into runtimeexception and error

1758687
.when	ready
this usually works for me .when i want to remove flicker especially in ie win since ie has it s own domready android-emulator in jquery s ready event

1758704
compression	streaming
they are a fairly efficient streaming compression algorithms but because of how they function you can t start to decompression at random points in the file you have to start from the start

1758704
zipfile	archive
any product that claims to be able to decompression one file from a zip still has to decompression everything before it in the zipfile inorder to know how to decrypt the given file or even for that matter where the file is in the archive

1758706
ip-address	hostname
you can put code in a php scripting to open a connection to a specific hostname or ip-address and ports

1758720
exponentiation	mod
the way to work out a b mod p without blowing up is to do the mod p ing at every exponentiation - i would guess that the language isn t working this out on its own and therefore must be helped

1758732
any	set
does it work any better if you set the width directly

1758735
arrays	loops
however you could modify this to do value modifications or checked or grep in the other arrayss within the first loops through arrays1 ie if your value in arrays2 and arrays3 are maybe stored as nn-name and nn-address where nn is the id from the first arrays and you need to find the corresponding value and remove the nn- with a s regex

1758743
freebsd	linux
the problem is less common in freebsd as it favour s interactive jobs but linux is where we have most of the problems

1758748
python	java
perhaps checkout the natural language toolkit for starters which is mostly python but also required building some ocaml and java components

1758765
exponentiation	modulo
you re going to walk through the exponentiation yourself taking the modulo at each stage

1758780
factors	primes
to be able to chose a the modulo m must contains a factors of 8 or a square of some primes 3

1758823
instances	private
then have a sub main create a instances of that class and assign to a private module variables

1758825
.when	ready
i m getting ready to built-in a feature that will allow the application to get an updates db .when needed

1758856
configuration	environment
you may need to include separate sections in your configuration files to tailor the settings to each environment

1758871
order	add
.when you tried ignoring the nafxcw libs did you add it back in to try to force a link order as suggested by this kb article

1758873
comma-operator	operands
the comma-operator forces a sequences points .so each one evaluates its left operands discards the result then evaluates its right operands

1758877
hash	md5
i also tried using md5 and still get different hash on command-line with -r and -f

1758889
invoices	product
i ve often seen line_item tables for order or invoices that copy one or more field from other tables inorder to take a snap-shot of a customer s product order .when it was placed

1758893
controllers	routes
you can use a block .when creating your routes and then pass a controllers parameter like .so

1758893
account	in-app
if you use the above snippet you should then create a controllers in-app controllerss account jobs_controllers.rb which is defined like .so

1758893
controllers	routes
you can always use rake routes to checked which routes have been generator and which controllers they ll use

1758894
xsl-fo	xslt
the technology you use for this is xslt xsl-fo

1758895
value	field
in this case to verify the date field value is not null and occurs in the future

1758906
constructor	object
the object has just one methods besides the constructor that send ajax request to the php scripting which returns json

1758918
arrays	loops
it seems like you d want to lazy-evaluation load your xml files - you d need to construct a loops that runs based on an arrays of the items you want to load - here is an example of how you could do that

1758920
contains	elements
the title elements must not contains

1758927
shell	bash
.when you run on your bash shell bash is interpreting as a shell variables which is probably empty unless you have set it

1758932
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
i also bring the keyboard backup in viewdidappear -- not viewwillappear

1758933
webserver	nginx
if you decide to go this route you will either have to add another ip-address to the server and bind apache only to the one ip-address and the other server lighty of nginx to the other because they are webserver the both listen on ports 80

1758937
value	field
has anyone ever had any success using inarray to get indexes of javascript-objects using a field value within that object

1758939
linked-list	dictionary
assuming we need to preserve the insert order of elements in the collections you can represent newlist as a linked-list t while using a dictionary t linked-listnode as a lookup table

1758939
linked-list	dictionary	linked-list	nodes
.when you add an item to the collections you add it to the linked-list then add the newly created nodes to the dictionary

1758939
linked-list	dictionary
the linked-list keeps the insert order and the dictionary allows us to remove m items in o m time

1758947
enumerator	any
c doesn t include any .sort of types reflection .so you ll probably have to create an enumerator of typess or store a string describing the types

1758955
callback	methods
if that s your appdelegate which gets the callback from the thread try adding a new methods besides your callback

1758961
value	field
there are other possibility playing with the macros processor to make it a little bit more pleasent to the eye but the essence is that you have to know in advance the types of the value stored in the union and access the proper field

1758962
google-chrome	safari
i need to use full screens mode in my flash application for some reason .when i go into full screens mode in safari or google-chrome the stage is completely disabled

1758967
primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	icefaces
examples are richfaces also include in seam primefaces and icefaces

1758982
restart	reload
one thing you have to pay attention to .when doing this is that you ll need to restart your daemonized process upon a deploy .so they can reload your updates ruby-on-rails stack

1758996
sinatra	gem
sudo gem install sinatra

1758996
directory	folder
then you need to make a directory for the thing to run and it has to have a public and tmp folder

1759020
required	checked
then you can just register binder for each of the common types - which is al.so ok to do using reflection for example by checked that entity has all field required present - .so it works even if you add new such entities

1759023
javascript	dom
you could work around this using javascript s dom functions taking form2 out of form1 putting it into the body submission it and putting it back into form1

1759029
value	field
for each nodes take the value of field y

1759035
hash	md5
encrypt de cookies data with md5 but i can not validation the hash back

1759035
hash	md5
md5 hash because setcookie does urlencode automaticly and thereby possibly changing the hash

1759040
reflection	runtime
the easiest way to do this kind of runtime evaluation is with reflection

1759056
margins	padding
the width 100 on #top-panel refers to the width of the div s content area excluding borders padding and margins

1759056
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
the page looks ok in internet-explorer since ie incorrectly include padding and border .when calculating the width of the div if the page is rendering in quirks-mode

1759070
object-reference	instances
throw exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object. .

1759072
multibyte	strlen
you are using multibyte strings and strlen is not mb aware use the idioms substring session 0 -32 to get the payload part of the string

1759097
erlang	forth
i m looking for a way to pass events back and forth between clojure and erlang

1759103
arrays	map
if the two byte arrays you mention is your entire key the value are in the range 0-51 unique and the order within the a and b arrays is insignificant my math tells me that there is only just about 26 million possible permutation and that you likely are trying to fill the map with value for all possible key

1759103
hashmap	arrays
in this case both filling and retrieving value from your data store would of course be much faster if you use an arrays instead of a hashmap and index it from 0 to 25989599

1759105
json	xml
i can t say i ve done clojure -- erlang bridges before but talking to erlang in json xml is sufficiently painless

1759111
calloc	malloc
you may want to consider calloc rather than malloc

1759113
python	c++
i m sure there are analogs in python and c++

1759113
python	c++
there are analogous mechanisms in c++ python

1759130
calloc	malloc
you weren t checked the return-value of malloc now calloc but same rules apply

1759130
calloc	malloc
if you don t want to use calloc for this reason here s a versioning that does the same thing with malloc

1759139
markup	xhtml
this is the easiest solution that emits valid xhtml but it takes from the semantic value of the markup

1759144
strict	let
apparently you re not generator page using xmlserializer it wouldn t let you create invalid entities or improperly encode characters therefore i suggest that you use html 4 strict or html5-as- text html instead which are more appropriate for hand-coded markup

1759145
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i would like to find an .app implements in perl python or php that will do the following

1759165
uniform	points
another points to consider is that your histogram will be a flat uniform distribution not a normal-distribution like you show in your question

1759179
jquery	.post
i .post most of my forms asynchronously using jquery s ajax function

1759196
twitter	last.fm
decentralized usernames openid avatars gravatar status updates twitter and currently playing music last.fm have already been done

1759205
templating	mako
my hosting provider however gives me little control of its server i use a lot of custom stuff in my python environment like sqlalchemy and mako templating and the servers python versioning is far too old to be used

1759236
overwrite	preserve
all the databases are on the same server and i don t need to preserve the old data just overwrite it

1759237
debugging	trace
problems are not easy to debugging - only tool is enabling full trace in the java console

1759250
value	field
in mysql s connector-net a tinyint 1 field properly translation back and forth into a .net bool value

1759255
background-image	transparency
she wants her background-image to take up the entire span of the browser windows and then the image that sits on top - she wants to be transparency .so that the background can show through

1759255
background-image	transparency
i ve got the background-image to take up the entire windows but for some reason the transparency gif is not behaving as it usually does

1759292
ubuntu	debian
the debian guide can be quite useful .when it comes to ubuntu

1759305
launchd	daemons
i have a daemons running on dbus that offers service for launchd applications

1759311
macros	let
you can then use some macros s that are defined in wait.h that will let you know what the status of the thread that are finished are

1759327
json	xml
i set one of them up for json and xml on every object kinda convenient .when i want to filtering things out of every alternative formatted response

1759329
credentials	account
now first issue is .when i selected that application-pool with svce to work on virtual directory call it appdir then .when i navigate to appdir i get prompt for credentials but if i use the network service account i do not and verify that i am logged in as me

1759337
double	int
the string 1 for example would be parsable to byte sbyte int uint long ulong float double and decimal

1759387
task-queue	worker
if i understand task-queues properly i d have to create yet another servlet to do the process from the task-queue be the worker

1759391
authentication	login
i would like a user to login to my site and therefore get a cookies and .when the user opens another ie process have that session cookies authentication the user

1759395
panels	grid
add a grid to the pop-up that lays out the lightbox the way you want including panels for the image textblock and button

1759444
triggers	insert
testing with the following code indicates that by the time the servererror triggers is fired ie before returning to the hosts the insert of value 1 and 10 have already been rollback because a re-insert of the 1 doesn t fail on duplicates key or deadlock

1759445
value	field
pull the value from the field whose named is represented in mdl_order.columnnamed

1759452
communication	messages
messages arguments is optional but a good idea to communication why the item is now obsolete and or what to use instead

1759457
required	checked
is there any way to required that a class have a default no parameter constructor aside from using a reflection checked like the following

1759469
controllers	routes
no hiding - it s just the way asp.net-mvc handles url s and maps those routes to controllers actions on your controllers classes

1759469
webforms	asp.net
quite a big step away from the classic asp.net webforms way of doing things

1759470
.net	wcf
wcf is not dot .net

1759481
subclassing	inherited
then you can annotations the base types with that annotations then all subclassing would inherited the annotations as well

1759536
duplicates	contains
the schema in question consists of about 10 tables but a few of the tables will potentially contains hundreds of thousands to 1 million recording that need to be duplicates

1759565
method-signature	signature
yes - it s possible though not with your method-signature and yes with your signature the types must be the same

1759565
contains	any
these are therefore different to and independent of any generics types associated with the class or interface which contains the function

1759572
any	set
i will vote for assembla its big feature set can not be compared with unfuddle beanstalkapp or any other svn only hosting provider

1759583
selected	textbox
selected one menuitem will display textbox and other will show list box

1759594
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think the tool is good but if you are just starting the building of the application i would recommend using asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms

1759663
filtering	sorting
easy to skins and customise with some great features out of the box like filtering sorting and ajax support

1759677
contains	set
stores them in a hashmap where the set contains nextstates for a given 3-state

1759677
contains	set
contains 3 sets -- a set of x-moves o-moves and the board

1759691
stdin	pipe
messages are exchanged between the main process and the data-processing process using the qt mechanisms and the stdin stdout pipe

1759697
rad-controls	telerik
i was mainly using telerik rad-controls for asp.net-ajax in the past

1759711
versioning	upgrade
if you don t configure your upgrade to uninstaller previous versioning of your product then the component will not be removed although its files may be overwrite

1759711
versioning	downgrade
for example a file with a higher versioning will not be downgrade

1759719
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	button	checkbox	button	checkbox	textarea
in advanced data datagrid with columns checkbox textfield textarea button radio-button

1759720
selection	cell
based on the selection in that column i d like to be able to change the corresponding cell in the second column to either a datagridviewcomboboxcell or a datagridviewtextboxcell

1759727
configuration	installation
no installation no configuration xcopy deploy

1759739
hide	show
i know i can find the behavior and call show and hide

1759765
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
you may also consider using google protocol-buffers which are available for ruby and java as well as c++ and python

1759776
textmate	vim	radrails	textmate
unless radrails three is light-years ahead of the latest release though you ll be missing out on a lot of very handy advantages of using a more community-supported solution such as vim or textmate

1759778
selected	checkbox
in the exposed filtering there is a simple checkbox to limit list to selected items if checked the only items presented to the user will be the ones selected here. derrrr

1759788
swfupload	uploadify
i tried uploadify and swfupload and it was quite easy getting them to work

1759821
conditional-operator	operands
in your first example the third operands of the conditional-operator is this

1759822
event-listener	listener
could you also just add an event-listener queue to your blockingqueue then .when something is added to the blockingqueue send an event off to your listener

1759829
silverlight	wpf
however i can see the day .when wpf will be called silverlight or perhaps the other way around

1759840
base-class	inherited
there is a way to do this using reflection as long as your classes follow a consistent class hierarchy in terms of genericss any intermediate classes in the inherited hierarchy between your base-class and your concrete class use the same generics parameters in the same order

1759850
deployment	install
once the user install the program the associations are set but the associated program is the install clickonce application deployment support libs and not the actual program

1759850
windows-xp	windows
tested on 3 different computers ranging from windows-xp vista windows 7

1759880
pointers	stack
i m asking for pointers to a good reference explaining how a typical program might handle a possible wide variety of packets struct types be it a book link or stack overflow answer

1759894
debugging	trace
obvious advantage is side effect of thread-level trace debugging facility with future extension possible

1759898
put	get
edit re your last example if you have only 1 consumer you will never get rid of the object on the queue - unless it s updates in the mean time - in which case you d better be very very careful about thread-safety and probably shouldn t have put the item in the queue anyway

1759945
unsigned	short	digits	short
you could try converting it to an unsigned short and then printing just the last four hex digits

1759973
selected	checkbox
if you want some kind of value send to your php scripting if the checkbox is selected you need to set this value in the widget

1759992
value	field
null field mean no value

1760009
subclassing	base-class
by creating a subclassing you are explicit saying you want all of the base-class s methods and properties accessible

1760020
ruby-on-rails	django
checkout django or ruby-on-rails

1760025
python	java
i m trying to find a way to limit the memory available for the python viewmodel as the option -xmx in the java viewmodel does

1760030
fadeout	fadein
ok after reading a little more about the animate fadein fadeout and fadeto i understood that i don t need to use filtering alpha for ie as jquery already supports it

1760030
fadeout	fadein
knowing that i made a test using fadein and fadeout now online and it works but there is a problem if you hover in and out several time it continue repeat the animation

1760034
attributes	properties
using attributes will hide the properties depending on the implementation of the consumer but in a language level you aren t hiding anything

1760037
required	checked
there are some other types of errors it may not catch - for example if your hosts required ocsp to verify the certificate and your ocsp is down the windows install would fail but your certificate test would pass unless you building an ocsp checked into it...

1760040
getter	setter
first use setter and getter like .so

1760076
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the most recent beta of firebug and have the most recent non-beta versioning of firefox and still no dice

1760093
lookup	any
.so any call to that properties thereafter don t have to perform the lookup

1760097
compatibility	legacy
if internet-explorer 9 were to take a different approach to compatibility it would be relevant and helpful in the maintenance of legacy sites

1760112
javascript	dom
javascript dom framework

1760116
python	c++	python	java
this could be in any programming language however c++ python java or anything non-proprietary language would be ideal

1760130
value	field
this field has value 1 for some contents and 2 for others

1760132
value	field
a problem with that code is that the field a of the object myobj is directly accessible .so it s possible to access it change its value without triggers the listener

1760132
getter	setter
still on luke s tracking i propose now a simple way to add encapsulated field and the respective getter setter to object by the means of a simple function-call

1760150
put	get
the catch is that i get it all as one long string and it s not always immediately obvious where to put the linebreaks

1760158
getchar	fgets	getchar	fgetc
the function getchar or some other like fgetc fgets recieve a enter as a charactor

1760199
google-chrome	firefox
but oddly in firefox google-chrome it isn t quite the same as demonstrated by his example with stateful expression that are used multiple time

1760229
variables	boolean
.when using it assign the string lean subsection2 to the variables pathname and evaluates it as a boolean value which is always true it d have to be false or undefined .so it always takes the positive conditional block

1760276
dialog	pop-up
if you want to avoid the risk of a pop-up blocker consider instead using the iframe within an inline dialog within your application

1760283
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the following snippet has been tested on firefox safari and google-chrome open the console and move between tabs back and forth

1760301
getter	setter
like any good class it has both data and behavior and i don t mean getter and setter

1760303
member-functions	inline
however you can t use static for this purpose since it means .something else on member-functions .so inline is your only choice

1760319
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework team created a sample of how to subclassing controls

1760323
ftp	scp
you can use the ant ftp task or scp task for this

1760332
order	add
if the insert will typically be incremental in other words .when you add a row you will typically add a groupid + personid that are greater than the last row you can create a clustered index on groupid + personid and that will make sql physically store the rows in that order and it makes a lookup on that key very fast

1760348
wordpress	blogs
i currently have a virtual dedicated-server through mediatemple that i use to run several high traffic wordpress blogs

1760394
updating	updates
it has a on duplicates key updates statement because this import needs to be done regularly updating the data in mydb

1760426
icollection	ienumerable
you could accept an ienumerable t parameter and internally checked if it is in fact an icollection t or ilist t and optimize accordingly

1760433
click	mouse
i can t click on it and .when i hover with the mouse the background is not blue like in the other button

1760438
icollection	ienumerable
if you have a look at how linq extension methods are implements using reflector you can see that a few extension methods on ienumerable t such as count attempt to cast the sequences to an icollection t or an ilist t to optimize the operation for example using the icollection t .count properties instead of iterator through an ienumerable t and count the elements

1760438
icollection	ienumerable
.so your best bet is most likely to accept an ienumerable t and then do this kind of optimizations if icollection t or ilist t are available

1760443
value	field
what you end up with is a sequences of rules items comprising a field a value and a comparison equals not equals etc

1760457
show	next
.when i tryed the connection again the next error was show unsuported file-format

1760473
itextsharp	itext
not a lot of documentation for itextsharp .so you have to lookup the java documentation for itext which it s a ports of

1760474
icollection	ienumerable
since ilist t inherited from icollection t and ienumerable t and icollection t inherited from ienumerable t your only concern would be performance in ienumerable t types

1760484
internet-explorer	firefox
i have tried this out on firefox under ubuntu and windows and internet-explorer

1760497
function-call	inline
to ignore inline means to generator an ordinary non-inlined function-call to an inline-functions

1760502
selected	button
.when that button is click i want to remove the current view load a new one open the image picker get the selected picture and display it in the view that i just loaded

1760506
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
safari and ie treat literals as per es4 but firefox and google-chrome appear to treat them as per es3

1760538
javascript	dom
but i ve also seen people formatting their output within javascript using dom functions such as

1760571
loading	gif
for working with various images formats you can use windows imaging component see iwicbitmapdecoder or code from here loading jpeg and gif pictures or 3rd party tools like freeimage or leadtools

1760586
any	set
i can find any options to set the positioning too

1760594
data-members	private
if i m creating an abstract-base-class and the classes derived from it are going to have some of the same data-members is it better practice to make those members private in the abstract-base-class and give protected access to them

1760600
derived-class	base-class
derived-class cannot access base-class private-members

1760603
derived-class	base-class
the base-class could be virtual by the mere fact that only one of its methods must be implements in derived-class

1760603
protected	public
the decision of making these variables and methods of the base-class private protected or even public is a case by case issue

1760603
protected	public
for example the base-class could have a public methods a protected methods and or data and a few private methodss

1760604
derived-class	base-class
by placing that data in the base-class not privately you force every derived-class to have it

1760604
derived-class	base-class
if you find there might be a common themes you can make a derived-class that has those members and implementation which is then intended to be the base-class for those that want to use it

1760604
derived-class	base-class
any variables your base-class uses should be private because derived-classes don t need to know how it works in the same way users of your derived-class don t need to know how the internals of the derived-class work

1760605
contains	elements
i think he wants to hide an elements if the url contains that part

1760608
date-difference	difference
then do a date-difference between these two dates and get numbers of minutes difference

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i make sln files for each sub-module a few vcproj csproj which are related .so that i don t have to open a big large sln file to view the project

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i avoid the problem by just splitting the vcproj csproj into different sln s and use a building-server to building

1760627
postgresql	mysql
i suspect it s because of difference in how postgresql handles grouping by clauses compared to mysql

1760641
constructor	object
you ll still have to work out the lifetime of the process implements refcounts on the managed object with constructor finalizers- .when you hit zero call unregistertypeforcomclients and exit - you can t let main exit until all your object are dead

1760644
stderr	stdout
in case the exception-handling bubbles back all the to the main function and if said exception-handling isn t caught there either a default handler deals with it typically by printing out the exception-handling to stderr stdout and halting

1760644
exception-handling	try-catch
the way this exception-handling could be caught would be with a try-catch construct as in

1760644
function-calls	main
in re-reading the question i noted that the function which is declare with throw abcexception-handling and that is a bit odd because main is the first methods in the chaining of function-calls meaning that there is nothing before main which could catch an exception-handling other than the default exception-handling handler of the java runtime which wouldn t do anything specific for abcexception-handling

1760646
uisearchbar	uitableview
i create a uitableview in the initialisation and want to add it to the sub view .when - void searchbartextdidbeginediting uisearchbar searchbar

1760658
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
it 1 uses mergesort rather than quicksort or heapsort for two reasons

1760720
numeric	zero
read the docs and you ll see it still returns a plain numeric expression which likely still include trailing zero

1760752
order	add
if listofpings is not already properly sorted just add just before the for-loop presumably emitting in sorted order is ok right

1760753
stderr	stdout
alternatively and if you want to only handle stdout stderr which is common run your program through the standards unix tee program or the equivalent on your platform either by doing it yourself .when invoking the program or within the program by fork setting up the streaming as appropriate etc

1760783
children	nodes
only one level deep .so the children are all leaf nodes

in your messages handler callback you don t want probably don t want to continue to manipulate the data as raw binary hex data but instead interpreter the information in a meaningful fashion according to the messages types

1760861
protected	public
personally i like to have public at top protected and then private

1760867
protected	public
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1760869
protected	public
public before protected before private

1760880

the atomicity ie memory manipulated with the interlocked functions doing stuff like lock cmpxchg is only atomicity with respect to itself not other memory

1760925
data-members	private	protected	public
i generally agree with the public protected private order as well as the static data-members data-members-functions order

1760925
getter	setter
though i .sometimes grouping like members getter setter i generally prefer listing members within a grouping alphabetically .so that they can be located more easily

1760954
getter	setter
you don t need to use synthesize keyword in the implementation file if you provide appropriate getter setter

1760954
getter	setter
or you can use either synthesize foo to inform the compiler to generator getter setter for you or dynamic to inform the compiler that these methods will be available at runtime - both in the implementation file

1761003
scriptmanager	ascx
i was creating a custom ascx control and wanted to be able to not worry about whether or not the calling page had the scriptmanager declare

1761010
ellipse	line
the custom inkcanvas in the example draw an ellipse at every collected strokepoint but makes no attempt to draw line between them

1761010
ellipse	line
the custom code could easily be extended to not leave gaps in addition to drawing ellipse at each points it could draw line between each pair of pointss

1761010
ellipse	line
code to draw connecting line might be added before the code to draw the ellipse like this

1761024
pixels	line

1761057
sql-server	mysql
there is an ado.net provider for mysql .so you shouldn t have any more difficulty dealing with a mysql database than ms sql-server

1761057
entity-framework	ado.net
could make things even easier or you could use entity-framework with the mysql ado.net provider

1761058
any	set
any sql database will give you access to a whole set of permissions and role capabilities that may be difficult to enforce using xml

1761067
javascript	dom
i am hoping that there is either a good javascript libs that i have .somehow missed which will make it trivial to do this all in the browser but i think that inconsistencies in the dom prevents one from doing .so in any way which will be re.source-rea.sonable

1761305
contains	elements
there s the recent modern way of adding a .clearfix on the parent elements to clear the contains floats and that would work great

systemd such as php and ruby are designed to be very platform-independent whereas asp.net is deeply integrated into the windows platform

1761421
versioning	upgrade
let s assume that i m doing some sort of nontrivial change to my database which required custom work to upgrade from versioning a to b

1761421
versioning	upgrade
the first logical obstacle would of course be that the deployment utility would not know whether any such logic needs to be updates - i d assume i could provide the logic for this as well checked a versioninging table and if the latest versioning is 5.0 execute this upgrade later adding a new versioning row

1761435
value	field
a constants field is one that is explicit or implicit both final and static and that is initializer with the value of a compile-time constants expression

1761435
value	field
a reference to such a field must be re.solved at compile-time to a copy of the compile-time constants value .so uses of such a field never cause initialization

1761435
execute	declare
the static initializer and class variables initializer are execute in textual order and may not refer to class-variabless declare in the class whose declarations appear textually after the use even though these class-variabless are in scoping

in the example with the checkout page the views would differ from shop to shop but the controllers and the model would remain the same as long as you externalize configuration like payment methods types and .so on

1761722
export	csv
checked this out how to export gridview to words excel pdf and csv document

1761742

the easier route is to run a local mail-server such as postfix exim or qmail and set it up to send mail through a remote-server

1761800
erlang	prolog	erlang	lisp	prolog	lisp
i d suggest lisp for functional-programming for historical reasons or erlang for a more commercial language and prolog for declarative a.k.a logical programming

1761800
functional-programming	imperative-programming	declarative-programming	imperative-programming
there are a lot of programmers that keep getting surprised by the possibilities of functional-programming ability to prove a function right easy parallels integration no side-effects etc as well as the possibilities of declarative-programming for certain task that are just now well suited for imperative-programming patter recognition for example or rules based systemd

1761807

1761996
file-descriptor	stdin
forkpty returns a file-descriptor which is redirected to the programs stdin and stdout

1762009
value	field
i guess you tokenize the grouping field and that makes it possible to search for substring in the field value

1762015
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
i don t understand why firefox gives this warning obviously the file foo.html is under my control since it s stored locally and i have opened it with the file protocols and additionally the windows to be opened doesn t points to any file that could contains any sensitive data as the url parameter in the open methods is set to

1762018

gethashcode	equals
i believe you need to overrides gethashcode and equals in your entities

1762110
solaris	linux
also checked for all exception-handling for example not directly related to release-mode but sometime we just ignore some critical exception-handling like mem access violation in vc++ but the same can be a issue at least in other os like linux solaris

1762120
value	field
i think we d need more detail to be sure but from the messages in the email it looks as if someone is entering a value in your street field that .net is regarding as dangerous

1762175
protected	public
we can redeclare the public and protected methods but not private

1762182
wofstream	wstring
use wstring instead of string wifstream instead of ifstream wofstream wcout etc

1762183

for example if your application runs under iis 6 you could go to the administration console and set a custom account in the application-pool properties

1762186
administration	sysadmin
much less administration individual developers can create new project without the help of a sysadmin

1762201
contains	any
on a windows 7 machine i cannot read any registry value that contains a semicolon

1762205
invoices	product
as an aside if you have an invoicing systemd you really ought to store the price for the product and the tax rates as well as the codes with the invoices the invoices tables should contains all the necessary financial information to reproduce the invoices

1762223
variables	boolean
at present each deriving class uses a boolean variables isinitialized that is set in initializecomponent and every overrides methods call initializecomponent if necessary before doing anything

1762225
arrays	loops
loops through the arrays and use strlen to verify if the current length is longer than the previous

1762260
cpu	irq
.so if your cpu gets interrupted to service hardware irq or if another cpu is reading the same memory it doesn t affect the result and these other operations will observe it as either completed or not started

1762268
facebook	disqus
i also have facebook connect auth enabled for my disqus which placed in page using javascript widget

1762268
facebook	disqus
.when user already logged in using facebook to my site they still have to log to facebook again .when they want to comment using disqus

1762268
facebook	disqus
i assumed i got seamless facebook auth between those two facebookmixin disqus

1762280
configuration	installation
i get the same messages on my eclipse installation too despite other classes display .source with no problems .so i suspect it s not a configuration issue.

1762313
put	get
put the timer out of the updatepanels and get a triggers in the panels - win

1762315
rhino-mocks	moq
you can use a mocking framework like rhino-mocks or moq

1762319
derived-class	base-class
note that you cannot use the methodsinfo object from the base-class to invoke the overrides methods in the derived-class because late-binding cannot resolve overrides

1762325
rhino-mocks	moq	rhino-mocks	typemock	typemock	moq
without using a mocking framework such as moq typemock rhino-mocks that can verify your expectations i would look at parsing the stack-trace

1762326
compact-framework	.net
i m developing a windows-mobile winform .app with c# and .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2

1762360
delegation	dealloc
assign properties types you shouldn t release delegation in dealloc

1762360
delegation	dealloc
your code will work fine if you will use retain properties types or will not release delegation in dealloc

1762366
contains	any
the result-of a left outer-join or simply left join for table a and b always contains all recordinging of the left table a even if the join-condition does not find any matching recording in the right table b

1762384
file-descriptor	pipe
you could use pipe 2 and dup2 2 to connect your standards out to a file-descriptor you can read from

1762384
file-descriptor	pipe
then you can have a separate thread monitor that file-descriptor writing everything it gets to a logfile and the original stdout saved avay to another file-descriptor by dup2 before connecting the pipe

1762393
silverlight	wpf
in wpf there is a scrollviewer.scrollchanged event but in silverlight 3 this is missing

1762399
innodb	myisam
.when i restored the database i found that the table engine has changed to myisam whereas they were set to innodb

1762439
pointers	stack
threads have independent call stack however the memory in other thread stack is still accessible and in theory you could hold a pointers to memory in some other thread s local stack frame though you probably should find a better place to put that memory

1762445
innodb	myisam
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign key

1762445
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently fallback to the myisam engine

1762445
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1762474
display	height
display none elements have a height of 0 iirc but jquery offers a way to not hide but move tab-content out of screens

1762475
facebook	disqus
if i understand disqus correctly then you would need to .post to their service usign the data of the authentication users else if they use the javascript widget they would need to establish a facebook connect session with disqus which might be a confusing experience

1762488
any	set
basically to set any field positioning amoung the manager you shoud

1762498
double	int
then have them see has passing int or double or whatever still allows it to work

1762498
double	int
again experiment with variations - will the templates allow them to pass an int and a double or will it complain

1762498
double	int
from there you can have them pass in arrayss of whatever types int double etc and have it sort the arrays from highest to lowest again encouraging experimentation

1762502
profiling	trace
otherwise you can start a sql profiling trace to capture these events

1762517
.when	ready
the code below show me declaring an anonymous-function to run .when the document is ready which contains another function relating to a plugins which creates a horrizontal accordion

1762554

1762575
margins	padding
margins does not affect the child s positioning in relation to its parent unless the parent has padding in which case most browsers will then add the child s margins to the parent s padding

1762587

asp.net-mvc	webforms
the choice of asp.net-mvc versus webforms have little nothing to do with the ability for the .app to handle load

1762595
web-services	webserver
if you need heavy process do this in web-services that can run on separate machines from the webserver .so that you can scale out buy more servers and put them behind a load balancer if needed

1762606
spaces	output
to remove the spaces you must modify the nodes value before you output it best suited in this case is the normalize-spaces function since urls do not contains spacess generally

1762665
show	next
i imagine the next request is can you show me how to do that

1762704
unique	words
every words in a composition is stored as a unique row in table labels

1762705

the margins of the elements contains within .child are collapsing

1762749
rollback	commit
if during the commit an error occurs and the transactional needs to be rollback this can be addressed like this

1762749
rollback	commit
now if a manual call to fflush or a call to commit goes through successfully there isn t a way to rollback the transactional using nhibernate mechanisms

1762749
rollback	commit
especially .when calling the transaction.commit cmd the adotransaction created by nhibernate is then dispose right after the commit finishes .so you cannot access it inorder to rollback

1762749
rollback	commit
the code sample above allows you to catch errors that happen during commit and then rollback the transactional that has started already

1762758
linux	unix
this is not really a python question but a unix linux compile and link question

1762762
maven-plugin	ant

signals	sigint
a nice side-effect of using a signals in this case sigint is that you also restart the scripting through other means by running

1762839
32-bit	64bit
unlike the earlier debian package repository this should work on both 32-bit and 64bit architectures

1762845
json	xml
your server can create scripting webpage to return data in xml or json format upon request and your windows application will have to make http request to your scripting webserver retrieve and parsing to get the data

virtual-memory	paging
some keyword for search engines are paging swapping virtual-memory

1762947
netmask	packets
if the netmask was correctly set the same as the first example assuming that s the correct setting for your network then the second device would see the first as local on the 10.0 network and wouldn t attempt to forwarding the packets to a router

1762947
configuration	environment
this may not describe your exact situation but i hope that the example demonstrates the important principles that configuration matters you can t have an inaccurately configure environment and expect it to work

1762958
javascript	dom
.some people building dom with buildinger object .so in fact they are writing html with javascript for the dynamic-content

but whenever i replace the jar in the web-inf .lib folder of the .war and restart the server it does not pick up the latest jar

1763104
.war	jar
i have to undeploy restart server several time to make the .war pick up the latest jar

1763105
jquery	.post
and on the client side with jquery s .post methods handling a json reply is really easy too you can specify json as your datatype

1763108

.when you use annonymous authentication there is no impersonation therefore no problem

1763113
highlight	selected
i want to highlight a selected elements with a background-color to indicate it is mandatory

1763134
dsa	rsa
pci-dss required 1024 rsa dsa

1763138
numeric	zero
just write numeric value in a fixed column width with leading zero and strings as normals

1763144
http	ssl
but the invalid certificate messages wonâ t go away since the ssl connection is accomplished before http is taking part since http is http over ssl tsl

1763166
boost	stl
i do not want to use any libs other than stl .so no boost either

1763167
directory	folder
currently the directory size of the repository is clearly much smaller than the source code folder

1763176
postback	ajax
i have a ajax postback on my site and the same value get back via pagemethods

1763241
implements	extends
edit in this example object implements .sortedmap which extendss map are accepted too .so in your case you could create a baseinterface and extends that in the interfaces like acceptedinterface extendss baseinterface you want to be accepted by your .register baseinterface arg methods

1763259
environment	building
this building would use a real external java 5 sdk and thus guarantee that the application libs runs in a java5 environment

1763262
nested	order
they re both inline elements can be syntactically nested in any order

1763284
grouping	sorting
however if you want to have features like sorting grouping drag-drop re-ordering of columns hiding and adding columns at runtime ajax support etc

1763288
contains	any
this means that any program which contains code implements this interface in jdk5 would not have compiled against jdk6

1763292
in-house-distribution	enterprise
you can also use in-house-distribution with the enterprise program see here

1763298
reflection	runtime
if you can t already give the compiler the types of the interfaces you expect it has no way to predict what is going to be passed into your methods .so you will have to use runtime reflection

1763304
3des	aes
older versioning of the specifications mentioned aes and 3des by named but i believe newer versioning just specify strong encryption

1763326
data-annotations	viewmodel
if i read this correctly you are putting the data-annotations on the linq-to-sql class then populating your viewmodel properties with the ones from you linq-to-sql class

1763326
put	get	data-annotations	xval	data-annotations	viewmodel
to get this to work with xval you would need to put the data-annotations on the viewmodel properties

1763351
execution	exit
exception-handling can cause control flow to exit the block before execution the leavecriticalsection call

1763405
attributes	properties
neither control nor listitem expose a cssclass properties however listitem does expose it s attributes properties

parentheses	operators
some might say - well just add parentheses then or don t use it altogether - after all it s a well known fact that ternary operators are evil

1763543
ternary-operator	associativity
but it does depend on the ternary-operator associativity working like in the first case

1763550
assign	add
if what you meant was you wanted to add icontains to something in dictionary then you could simply assign the key in dictionary1 as price__icontains instead of price

1763552
any	set
extremely simple methods to mess with your web application if the application allows users to add pictures to profiling messages board or blog post malicious user can set up image url like account logout or any other valid local url causing actions we don t want

1763573
revision	svn
it looks like there s a perl svn-bisect tool but it s not in the core and svn s slowness in updating between revision will make it a much longer process

1763582
perl	ruby
the caret inside of a character-class is the negation operators common to most regular expression implementation perl .net ruby javascript etc

1763596
zend-amf	amfphp
zend-amf is the spiritual successor to amfphp - basically with a little bit of setup you can create a dev environment where you are able to call php functions right from your as3 code

1763603
firefox	safari
he mentioned that drag-and-drop support is going to be difficult because of the way safari firefox can t remember which one is used to run out-of-browser on the mac

1763622
unique	words
if you mean unique first words of strings words being separated by spaces this would be

1763627
enumerator	any
i don t see why taking out the enumerator explicit offers you any advantage over using a foreach

1763628
lazy-evaluation	maybe
it s clear it lazy-evaluation .so it will be fast except maybe the first case-when you split the string

1763645
selected	button
the user should be able to selected a pdf which already exists from a list and then hit the printing button

1763645
selected	button
.when he hits the button the document should get printed by the webserver to a specific printer which the user also selected prior to hitting the button

1763653
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1763655

1763691
unique	words	sequences	unique
on the other hand to get all unique initial words sequences without considering full strings you could go for

if you need it you could write an interface and extends observablecollection to implements it

1763715
menuitem	button
i ve attached icommand object to the tag properties of button and menuitem object before

1763715
menuitem	button
for even an easier life try subclassing the controls button menuitem

1763730
reflection	runtime
the big aber is that you don t get any hint on which jar-files are used only at runtime by means of discovery and reflection

1763733
silverlight	wpf
i also think even if silverlight 4 makes better use of the gpu it still won t be to the level that wpf utilizes it

1763733
silverlight	wpf
there are al.so a ton of other assemblies in the .net that silverlight doesn t include .so if you need any of those you ll need to go wpf

1763733
silverlight	wpf
just like html5 will reduce the need for a plugins like flash or silverlight in some cases silverlight will reduce the need for wpf but there are still plenty of cases where you ll need it

1763791
bufferedreader	stringbuilder
you can use a bufferedreader to read the streaming into a stringbuilder in a loops and then get the full contents from the stringbuilder

1763794
instances	destroy
for instances lets say that you customobject in constructor creates an instances of some class with new and keep it as pointers to be destroy in the destructor

1763794
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
default copy-constructor will make a shallow-copy .so this will result in two object holding the same pointers

1763899
javascript	dom
how can i use server-side scripting in an external javascript file to grab a reference to a dom elements

1763914
webforms	asp.net
you need to use special techniques inorder to make a asp.net webforms efficient ajax

1763940
textbox	button
i have written a user-controls that contains a textbox and a button

1763940
textbox	button
functionality is such that you input a quoteid into the textbox and click the button then the .app goes and fetches a bunch of information about the specified quote and plops it onto the screens

1763941
spring	guice
if you re using a dependency-injection framework like spring or guice it will be easy to wire those object back together .when your application runs

1763942
installation	environment
they will live in a stateless environment the user-interface maybe somewhat slower than a desktop installation

1763950
arguments	default
this is by the way one of the stronger arguments for favoring abstract-class to interfaces - with an abstract-base-class you can add members with a default implementation without breaking an api

1763959
arrays	loops	arrays	map
i also map the arrays in a loops arrays of comments for display

1763964

i am trying to add a jlayeredpane to a jpanel and then add an image jlabel icons and a button to the jlayeredpane but neither show up

1764141
contains	elements
i ve linked to my answer because it contains a complete example - its probably slightly more complex than you need but still a trivially small numbers of line and combined with the debugger should give you all the elements if you ll excuse the pun you need to solve your problem

1764176
prerequisites	installshield
installshield prerequisites allow you to specify a command-line to be used .when it is run silently

1764176

1764197
json	xml
what is data format xml xml atom-editor json

1764206
32-bit	64bit
specifically sizeof unsigned long will vary between 32-bit on 32-bit platform ilp32 systemd and 64bit on 64bit platform lp64 platform

1764206
32-bit	64bit
is broken -- it will only work correctly on 32-bit platform because c# uint is always 32-bit while the unsigned long will be 64bit on lp64 platform and will fail rather horribly on 64bit platform

1764206
32-bit	64bit
this will cause it to be 32-bit on ilp32 platform and 64bit on lp64 platform -- the desired behavior

1764209
google-chrome	firefox
basically that means that none of javascript based rich text editor would work in a jquery-dialog in firefox and btw google-chrome as well - thats a big bad issue i have tried two .so far and that s how i started looking into this issue

1764239
getter	setter
each member variables has a public getter and a setter function

1764239
getter	setter
functions which are passed an instances of bar will want to access m_foo .so that they can call its getter and setter functions

1764239
getter	setter
do i have any other options though other than replicating every single getter and setter in bar

1764239
data-members	private
but this goes against some other of scott s advice item #22 in this case - declare data-members private

1764259
silverlight	wpf
silverlight has a pretty good subset of wpf display features and even manually construct silverlight content is easier to manage than trying to get .net windows + activex hosting + wpf working

1764270
getter	setter
it already is conceptually public anyway if you give bar getter and setter like you describe

1764270
getter-setter	getter
this applies similarly to any getter-setter pair where the getter returns a reference

1764275
contains	elements
xs is a list contains the remaining elements

1764278
selected	textbox
selected and fill the textbox with the selecteded item .when they hit enter

1764337
printf	scanf
if you want get rid of the warning format not a string literals and no format arguments once and for all you can disable the gcc-warning setting typechecking call to printf scanf gcc_warn_typechecking_call_to_printf no in your target s building settings

1764366
databound	gridview
add a labels to the page call it errorlabels then do something like this in the databound event of the gridview

1764402
value	field
in crystal-reports you can click on the image control and set the value properties of the control to the following replace imagefieldnamed with your field named

1764421
getter	setter
if you now anyway have such large classes with getter and setter i don t think its a problem to return the reference to that object after all there is still a layer in between - you essentially still have control over what is set get in foo

1764423
windows-vista	windows
in windows-vista sp2 and in windows 7 there is a new item in the start menu undock computer

1764426
mongodb	hbase
highly scalability key-value stores like mongodb hbase tokyo tyrant

1764428
getter	setter
each member variables has a public getter and a setter function

1764431
getter	setter
you can create forwarding getter and setter for every single getter or setter in foo

1764431
getter	setter
you can make the foo instances public or you can create a getter and setter for foo

1764431
getter	setter
this leads to variables that are actually private member variables of their classes and eliminates the need for setter and getter

1764459
contains	any
is there any way we can implements a checkbox list that contains images

1764461
textchanged	textbox
i also have a textbox which allows the user to search the datagridview using the textchanged event

if you own the enterprise edition you may create a stand-alone types libs by selected the remote-server files checkbox that you find in the component tab of the project properties dialog box

1764519
midl	idl
otherwise you have to use oleview in the visual-studio 6.0 tool to copy the idl and compile it using the midl compiler into a tlb file

1764535
revision	updates
you can updates your clients repo with the latest revision of that joomla-component

1764537
.net	wcf	contains	set

1764540
firefox	safari
it works in all commonly found browsers ie6+ firefox safari etc..... and it seems the least dirty of all the possible techniques

shell	bash
now bin sh is linked to bin bash .so it s not because of .some kind of weird shell being install as bin sh

1764606
32-bit	64bit
no you can t create an ms-dos program with visual-studio you can only create 32-bit and 64bit windows-applications but i don t think you really want a ms-dos program anyway

1764634
return-value	arguments
if you want to test the attributewithdefault methods you must assert that e.getattribute gets called with the expected arguments and forget about the return-value

subclassing	base-class
pushing all the methods from the subclassing to the base-class seems odd to say the least

1764797
subclassing	inherited
you would probably need to use virtual inherited for your subclassing to have only a single ibase base

1764798
arrays	loops
how can i loops through the .swc and load its assets in an arrays without mentioning their named then obtain and use these namedd for initializer

1764802
contains	set
iterate over the columns in the result set checked for column named contains a spaces

1764808
data-access	nhibernate
you could try a different data-access technology like linq-to-sql or nhibernate though

1764823
hash	md5
the only way that md5 in mysql would return a different hash then the md5 function in php is if the character set in mysql is different

1764830
contains	any
the scriptblock can contains any powershell cmd .so you will be able to start process on the remote machine with this mechanism

1764838
triggers	insert
depending on your target database you may be able to write a triggers for your views that would insert adequate discriminator value

1764846
implements	final	subclassing	inherited
if you don t want the final class sprite to implements all the methods you can implements that methods empty in the subclassing and then use virtual inherited

1764851
constructor	object
creates a temporary object of types cplayer using the above constructor then

1764851
copy-constructor	temporary
the mentioned temporary object gets copy-paste using the copy-constructor to newplayer

1764856
authentication	login
if the site uses cookies based authentication you ll need to .post the login details to the server collect the cookiess then pass them up on the request for the file

1764867
togglebutton	listview
we have a simple animation that runs .when a togglebutton is checked and unchecked expands a listview s height and then collapse a listview s height

1764882
order	join
if however appearance ids are order identically to dates then the query above can be made much more efficient because you won t have to do any join to find the matchid s you re looking for

1764904
unique	words
large words and unique phrases will pop out nicely especially if you create a custom dictionary which i know you said you don t want to do

1764905
progress-bar	progress
you have to specify threadoption.uithread because you are dealing with a progress-bar the handler must be called from the ui-thread to be able to draw the new progress state

1764920
ostream	std
the only thing i can think of is that it s invalid to directly use a newly construct std ostream like that ie without putting it into a variables

1764927
selected	listbox
the selected value is always being posted in the request.form collections .so even if the value in the .net listbox control doesn t change you will still be able to fetch the value that way but the value that are not selected in any of the listbox are not being passed as form-data .so there is actually technically no way for the server to know in which ways you tampered with the listbox before submission it

1764928
postback	ajax
asp.net has great ajax types functionality built-in already no full postback necessary

1764938
firefox	safari
it behaves as it should in firefox but ie and safari start the slider left animation way over in the middle of the page and then shift the menu back where it belongs

1764944
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
.when programming with eclipse or any other application is it possible to map mouse left click to keyboard

1764957
bash	zsh
zsh has some funky filename expansion options compared to bash

1764958
double	int
replace all int double named declarations with variables named numbers

1764958
double	int
replace all int double named declarations in function signature with named numbers

1764958
double	int	boolean	double	boolean	int
replace all int double points boolean named declarations in function signature with named types

1764970
arrays	loops
for instances this loops locates the key index within an arrays

1764976
ostream	std
i suspect that your std .lib implementation implements for as a free function and has thus to fallback to some that s a member of std ostream

1764983
display	height	display	width
to start i would give all img elements a fixed width and height and display them inline and then look further

1765025
value	field
by building and index you can search via a single textbox and find all recording field in your database that have those value

1765038
haskell	scala	haskell	c++
lastly as software implementation will probably be the first to be used there are already implementation in c++ haskell clojure and scala to named a few there actually is a performance problem

1765053
associations	model
because the foreign key is stored in the current model activerecord won t save the change if this associations is created by an after_create callback

1765061
value	field
you may have noticed field value rendering quickly with placeholder spaces for subreport and other resource-intensive object

1765073
arrays	loops
i would personally split the line into an arrays and loops through the arrays examining each line just doing a regex match for the starttime- endtime line then you can use some fairly simple logic to grab order from the previous line and grab the text from line following by searching ahead to find the next starttime- endtime and backtracking two line

1765075
instances	private
amazon virtual private cloud seems like it can do that but the docs always mention connecting to ec2 instances

1765111
put	get
.so put it together and you get

1765119
internationalization	localization
my company uses an internally developed package to support internationalization localization

1765119
internationalization	localization
i ve looked at the wikipedia entry on internationalization and localization which include links to other sites and related topics

1765119
linux	unix
but there s a lot out there and what i d like is a source especially a book which serves as a good introduction to the topic on linux unix in the current software scene

1765120
hide	show
you could either monitor for an ajax event such as ajaxstart or ajaxcomplete and bind an action to that event such as show and hide

1765120
hide	show
the first methods is probably better because you can monitor for global ajax events and hide show the loader image for any ajax event

1765121
account	api
if that is the case i would recommend looking into an existing service that would handle the task of account aggregation and all you would need to do is call into their api to gather the pre-aggregated data

1765130
webforms	asp.net
as far as the asp.net goes the classic use of this technology is to building webforms which were conceived as a web analog of winforms

1765133
ruby-on-rails	django
and if you want to save a bit more time and a whole shed-load of infrastructure and licensing cash you could even take a look at django and or ruby-on-rails

1765137
contains	elements
is there a way to get the deepest elements matching a contains statement

1765142
linux	unix
as i m sure you know linux and unix use 0x0a dos and windows use 0x0d 0x0a and macs use 0x0d

1765149
keyboard	mouse
if this is just for your local mac use you might look at the mac keyboard mouse configuration and see if you can change the mapping there

1765158
hide	show
then use this javascript to show this right before the ajax call fire s then hide it again after it is finished

1765169
webforms	asp.net
2 it is a very significant learning curve to go from asp to asp.net webforms

1765175
malloc	free
you could then change all call to malloc in the java viewmodel to use your own special memory allocation which allocates from that free spaces

1765196
contains	any
if the fruit named contains any one of these characters it d be discarded and we love eating fruit .so much that this should not happen

1765216
contains	elements	contains	any
gets the list of elements contains needle then filtering out those with any children

1765218
.when	ready
we merge into dev .when they are ready

1765218
.when	ready
then we merge to master .when things are ready and we tag all of our release

1765222
logout	login
the basic flow i m looking at is visit site login use site logout .when done or automatically logout .when the browser is closed

1765244
any	set
on any table that you don t want to keep the data of and then either set dummy value for any sensitive user data or delete all user data and just turn a few account into local testing account user testadmin passwd passwd etc

1765252
web-applications	security
take a look at java ee tutorial section for securing web-applications particularly at declarative security section

1765255
any	set
this is a restrictive set of permissions that improves performance and security but it means that apache completely ignore any .htaccess files

1765259
numeric	digits	decimal-point	digits	decimal-point	numeric
a numeric 18 10 defined a decimal with precision maximum total numbers of decimal digits that can be stored both to the left and to the right of the decimal-point 18 and scale maximum numbers of decimal digits that can be stored to the right of the decimal-point 10

1765269
curly-braces	conditional
if the conditional fails it skips to the end curly-braces within the php block

1765277
put	get
however if i put the using statement outside of the local namedspace declaration i get the types or namedspace named logpriority does not exist in the namedspace project.logging .

1765300
logging	trace
logging use trace or informational logging in whatever layer need it only log exception-handling in the top layer

1765359
contains	elements
edit i should note that i m trying to avoid using floats because the rest of the page will contains some floated elements and i ve had issues with nested floats before

1765373
value	field	hide	show
the other onblur functions show hide child field based on the value of the parent

1765375
subclassing	base-class
if you don t mind the base-class referring to the subclassing then double-dispatch

1765395
revision	updates
there s no problem with doing what you suggest in a post-commit-hook but do be aware that it will add a new revision to the repository and that the original committer will need to do an updates before they can see the changes the scripting made

1765402
contains	elements
it s not perfect because if contains classes such as class10 and class20 the elements will be selected but for now it s enough for what i need

1765413
duplicates	elements
this will yield the duplicates elements as a hash with the numbers of occurences for each duplicates item

1765440
ironpython	ironruby
vb.net supports both and i believe ironpython and ironruby do as well in a dynamic way

1765451
value	field
in the sql provided above you can only omit the value for field that are either nullable or have a default-value

1765457
children	nodes
the above function is supposed to take a starting parent id and recursively go through an arrays of children nodess really just an object with a unique id and a parent id .sorting them .so that each nodes comes directly after it s parent see below for sample-data

1765469
groovy	java
groovy offers some really neat language-features for dealing with and implements java interfaces but i seem kind of stuck

1765473
jasper-reports	itext
as of now both itext and jasper-reports are listed as incompatible on the will it play in-app engine page due to the dependence on several classes that are not in the jre class whitelist

1765478
pentaho	birt
i have researched on jasperserver pro birt pentaho

1765490
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox google-chrome opera it wipes out all content of the iframe - if you inspect it s dom with firebug you can see that iframe.body lost it s class some-class as well as all text and it s not in design mode

1765493
textbox	button
what i want is for the user to enter cmd in the first textbox press the button to enter and receive feedback via the second textbox

1765508
implements	super
what we had to to on a project that used nhibernate some years ago was implements our own getunderlyingtypes named stolen from the enum class for our entity layer super types

1765529
selected	button
double-click to selected global find button near the search-box at the top and then you usually have only couple of search results .so you can easily see the function

1765539
entitymanager	entities
i m trying to sort entities via my entitymanager class using std sort and a

1765552
combinations	permutation
i m pretty sure you would stop right after picking 1035 and 1024 and not test for cycles with any value from p5 let alone try all the permutation of the combinations involving these two numbers

1765552
any	set
then for the case of 3 sets we can sometimes see after drawing two numberss that there can t be any numbers in the last set that will give you a cycle no matter how you permutate 1035 from p3 and 3136 from p4 - there can t be a cycle here

1765564
decimal	octal
0 is octal not decimal

1765599
uialertview	uiwindow
edit i haven t yet found a solution to the status bar issue but i ve noticed that a standards uialertview show up in its own uiwindow and .when i investigated that i found the windowlevel properties

1765604
constructor	object
object you cannot add constructor or

1765608
selected	cell
i ve added a selectedcellschanged even handler to the datagrid it should be triggers every time new cell s is selected

1765609
carbon	cocoa
working on an application that contains legacy carbon code mixed with some cocoa

1765649
enumerate	except
you can enumerate through all the threads in your process and call thread.suspend on each one except the active one make the change and then call thread.resume

1765661
reflection	runtime
you can use runtime compiler reflection in ms.net

1765681
value	field
if you can have implements an event handler and the current set of filteringing is something you can programmatically access then in your newrecording event handler you ought to be able to go through each of your current filteringing determine which field the filtering is for and what the value of the filtering is setting the new recording s field to the filtering value

1765708
sql-server	oracle
i have used the solution describe here in oracle and ms sql-server and it is very fast

1765711
dictionary	arrays
i am trying to building an arrays that contains arrayss of dictionary object in xcode

1765711
dictionary	arrays
i can create a working arrays that has one or more dictionary in it and then use the addobject methods to add this arrays as an object in my main arrays

1765711
dictionary	arrays	duplicates	contains
all good .so far except that on inspector my main arrays it contains duplicates of the last dictionary that the working arrays was built with

1765725
contains	elements
i have a elements that contains a table which i want to resize to the maximum viewport height - 70 pixels

1765745
rollback	commit
if you called commit the copy could just be deleted but if you called rollback you could restore all of the properties on the original object from the copy

1765745
any	set
if any properties get set methods triggers changes or events that have effects this could cause real issues elsewhere in your .app

1765759
value	field
this logic will also work for an add form because all the field would be null then get replace with a new value before being sent to the db

1765764
void	main
also there s a subtle difference at least in declarations between main and main void --

1765787
associations	model
i normally model one-to-many with a standards parent-child table setup and i normally model many-to-many with an associations table between the 2 tables

1765802
interpreter	runtime
3 at this points i try to make the classpath exactly the same in eclipse as standalone .so i add my jars to the classpath at runtime just before the python interpreter is called

1765810
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
i will show you a basic example of a textbox button and a listbox

1765815
mp3	wma
we do mp3 wma and some graphic file search

1765859
subtraction	addition
in the applications you mentioned addition and subtraction and other needed math are commonly used standardized operations .so overloading is not required

1765859
subtraction	addition
to provide a trivially absurd example it is perfectly feasible but not at all acceptable to defined addition as subtraction

1765863
standard-library	boost
you might also try beyond the c++ standard-library an introduction to boost

1765869
mousedown	mouseup
however once this panels is created on the windows form i want to handle mouse events such as mousedown and mouseup

1765874
selected	button
mark on of the button as selected show it with the

1765892
subtract	time	subtract	add	any	set
.so any time i need a slider to start at a value other than 0 or return a floating-point numbers i have to set a max value that doesn t describe the true max value of the control and then divide and or add subtract the progress value .when i read it

1765939
processor	cpu
eventually the reading completes and the dma systemd issues an interrupt to the processor more cpu cycles coming up at which points the os sees what data is ready returns to your program and puts your thread on ready queue -- end of the cpu time

1765943
any	set	enumerator	any
set the list of elements in your drop down box to items in an enumerator using the enumerator you can protect your input against any programmatic mishaps code to follow

1765964
compatibility	platform
i know the chances are pretty slim but it might be worth it - in the quest for platform compatibility different libs try to map a specific memory size to a types and one of them might have slipped up

1765983
while-loop	loops
i assume that .when the function acquiredposition returns an empty string you want loops to terminate .so i added the code if not p break after the call to the function if it returns an empty string loops will terminate the file will be closed thanks to the with statement.you should restructure your while-loop like below

1765986
instances	self
from base.payload there is no direct way to get to drvd.payload except by getting the named and using it to do a getattr on self a drvd instances or equivalent

1765989
mta	sta
this points is most important .when dealing with the difference between an mta multithreading apartment and a sta single-threaded apartment model

1765990
subtraction	addition
if you operate with data-structures where it is a common knowledge of what subtraction addition or logical operation should do then use an operators overload

1765991
contains	set
as for the crash on freeandnil it s designed to free a tobject descendant and set the variables contains it to nil

1766014
double	int
int get_values double param int sz

1766023
updating	updates
as they said batch-file updates aren t easily possible .so iterator over each student and updating one at a time is probably the best .solution

1766025
scheme	let
in scheme you usually introduce a variables with let or letrec or lambda and it s pretty explicit what the scoping of the variables is

1766033
type-safety	generics
or you could use a generics object stack but then you d lose type-safety

1766039
textbox	button
in the properties dialog click the create button located to the right of the disabled application named textbox

1766050
key-value	key
say i added a key-value pair to the users_meta table for each user where the key was age and the value was a numbers representing their age

1766066
active-directory	adfs
we are planning to use adfs for these partner organization .so the users will be authentication using active-directory within their network and claims will be sent to the webapp via the authentication token cookies set by the adfs

1766084
click	mouse	document	editing
without ever click in the document works fine the mouseover test show the proper mouse pointers and i get link navigation or editing depending on the design mode if i click a link in the display document

1766089
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure if it s your only problem but dword is 32-bit even on 64bit platform

1766092
32-bit	64bit
pass it as a size_t which will correctly be 4 bytes on 32-bit windows and 8 bytes on 64bit windows

1766093
primitive	int
.so i have created a struct that represents these value internally as a primitive int numbers of months since jan 2000 i think

1766093
subtract	add
it al.so has numerous operators overloads .so that i can add subtract a timespan to a calendar month and get a calendarmonth or subtract two calendarmonth struct to get a timespan.

1766131
instances	private
in response to your comment your question is aimed at why main s eigenclass seems to report hello as a private instances methods

1766135
textchanged	textbox
then instead of using the textbox s textchanged event to fill the dataset use it to change the .rowfilter properties on your dataview

1766136
any	set
note that any fields-for which you set won t be required .when validation or saving the model

1766161
for-loop	arrays
your old arrays items has only size elements .so you need to change the upper limit in your for-loop to size from .when you re copying the old elements to the new arrays

1766162
contains	any
i m looking for a nice and easy preg_replace to eliminate any html tags that contains optional whitespace between them

1766190
scala	java
java language development has move very slowly since the introduction of annotations and generics in java 5 and the majority of interesting java language work has occurred with jvm-languages such as scala

1766190
scala	java
if you need to use the jvm then a more advanced language like scala may fit your needs note that scala will integrated with existing java libs

1766191
theorem	proof
the proof of this theorem isn t straight forwarding .so i don t think the author of the problem expect that you come up with the theorem by yourself

1766203
account	api
if you want to really be able to determine the specific reason that an account is failing authentication there are many more reasons other than wrong passwd expired lockout etc. you can use the windows api logonuser

1766225
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
asp.net-mvc has slight nuances .when viewed from asp.net-asp.net-mvc ruby-on-rails grogr codeigniter etc but it s all essentially built around the same concepts business-logic goes in the model controllers serve to route to appropriate model and views should just display data

1766242
double	int
you could get a histogram of the program counter but it is practically useless unless you are doing something dumb like spending time in a bubble-sort of a big arrays of int or double

1766283
versioning	upgrade
to fix it you have to get a 1.5 versioning of the libs or upgrade your compiler to 1.6 i suggest the later

1766292
proxy-server	squid
but squid is designed to be a proxy-server not a webserver and wil most probably be able to do some url-rewriting as well

1766295
selected	button
after adding this return to the workbook and add a button selected teststring as the macros to run .when click

1766299
hide	show
hey i am trying to create a search field that will filtering or show hide which ever is best the list elements based on what the user typed in and click the search button

1766299
hide	show
everything i tried does not work unfortunately and im unsure of the best approach for this like do i use show and hide or is there something better

1766316
configuration	environment
this same configuration works fine in a test environment the only difference is the sql and iis servers are running win 2003

1766320
triggers	insert
i know mysql has a function current_user but is that going to insert the username at the time the triggers is created or at the time the triggers is called

1766341
any	set
include a hidden-field textbox whatever and set the value of it to any server generator value you want

1766354
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup
for example create a dragbehavior that uses rx to combine the mousedown mousemove mouseup events with a cmd called to handle the new event

1766361
malloc	free
you need to allocate variables sized arrays on the heap using malloc and then free them .when you are done with free

1766376
hide	show
.so i think it s getting confused because onkeydown works initially to hide the hint but if peeps types then backspace everything then start typing again that onkeydown + value will be true and since fieldhint is a toggle it will show the fieldhint again while people are typing and everything is divided by zero - unless peeps then backspace again and start typing again then everything leaves upside down world - unless they backspace again and start typing again then it s all fubar and like opposite day for a few seconds

1766376
hide	show
i understand that i could just use style.display to show or hide the hint but the fade make me look much more like i know what i m doing which is obviously not true

1766384
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
one is for windows-xp and 2009 while the other is for windows-vista and windows-server 2008

1766399
cvs	git
if subversion is not the way to go ie no software available we might consider to switching to something else cvs vss git etc.. that would have a software that supports this function

1766403
grouping	sorting
in some cases where table data was uniquely identifying i used intermediate tables and frequency-distribution sorting to eliminate things like uncommon named eliminated instances where a count with grouping by was less than or equals to 2

exception-handling	try-catch
.when this class is sorted using a custom sorter where the sorter accesses this null properties and throw an exception-handling the exception-handling is considered unhandled even though there is a try-catch block around the sort methods

1766491
meta-inf	jar
try to include it in a jar file in web-inf .lib or place it in the web-inf classes meta-inf mime-types

1766498
xsd	xml
note that dtds are rather out-of-fashion generally replace by xsd specifications which are more flexible and written in xml themselves

1766520
portrait	screens
i m working on embedded device with screens rotated 90 degrees clockwise screens controllers report 800x600 screens while device s screens is 600x800 portrait

1766521
exception-handling	try-catch
there s a try-catch block round the sort methods yes - and that catch block catches the exception-handling

1766549
licensing	gpl
note that the connectors grant exception-handling to the gpl licensing for open source projects.

1766564
.when	ready
if the javascript was loaded first it is possible that code could go looking for elements .when the document was not ready

1766582
vba	vb6
i don t know of a complete ide but mz-tools makes a great ide addin for vba vb6 and it s free

1766591
decimal-point	digits
one digits before the decimal-point is standards .so all following digitss are used

1766605
treeview	listview
i have tree listview not a treeview

1766636
32-bit	64bit

1766649
firefox	safari
compatibility ie6 7 8 firefox and safari

1766657
restart	reload
i load many object into caching but there is a substantial delay reload these every time the .app domain restart

1766664
background-image	transparency
for the opacity issue have you considered embedding button graphics into the background-image and making the button controls themselves transparency changing the background-image every time a button is pushed down or release

1766671
selected	textbox

then you don t need to care if your concrete implementation has a setter or not - your callers will only use the getter

1766861
google-chrome	safari
ideally i d like the solution to work with safari google-chrome other browsers as well

1766864

1767119
callback	methods
.so if the delegation is not a static methods you need to stuff it .somewhere for the lifetime of the unmanaged callback

1767135
contains	elements
after this line id and clazz are always null yet i know for a fact the elements in question contains these attributes

1767145
sftp	scp
using the scp function will be easier than initiating a sftp session too

1767165

1767175
version-control	git
git like some other version-control systemd does not take cognizance of empty folder or of properties of folder

1767186

you could use apc memcached or similar

1767194
jquery	.post
.so i m using jquery to .post .some items and save into the database

1767196
blacklist	whitelist
but i prefer the slightly more robust approach using constants defining a whitelist list of attributes that are allowed to change in a state or a blacklist list of attributes not allowed to change in a state

1767197

1767324
data-structures	tree
for an assignment we were given in data-structures we had to create a test class to determine whether the code we were given correctly traversal the binary tree in our test class

1767330
specifications	w3c
if you want to write a completely conforming even non-validating xml parsing you must read the w3c specifications

1767334
configuration	logging
however this framework is likely to have its own logging configuration - and if it happens to be using the same logging framework as yours then there is a good chance there will be various conflicts between the configuration

1767334
configuration	logging
the reason such failures can happen is because the logging configuration maintains global state accessed via static-methods and variables and various configuration properties can be overrides by different parts of the systemd

1767344
uppercase	toupper
one thing to note you may want to use toupper to convert your string to uppercase .so that you don t have to or it with lowercase guesses might make it a little faster

value	field
maybe just for reference at this stage - or with the functionality that a double click presents a combobox essentially on that field with all the possible value that can be entered

1767462
javascript	dom
it is often more dry to rendering these and return the html to insert-into the dom since the code is already set-up than to have to write javascript to do it again

1767472
portrait	screens
if the screens is a 600x800 portrait oriented device then that s what applications should see from the kernel

1767476
callback	methods
if you use the latest wmq .net classes and the latest ia9h supportpac you get an asynchronous callback methods

1767476
callback	methods
this comes with .net sample code showing how to register and use the callback. it is my understanding that this methods will pass your callback routine a messages .when one is available or else pass an exception-handling to the registered exception-handling listener if the connection is lost or queue is set to get disabled

1767476
versioning	upgrade
if you have an older versioning of .net wmq classes and can t upgrade for some reason you can always keep a separate thread open and periodically poll the queue

1767520

how am i supposed to get a histogram plot starting from this table

1767569
histogram	plot
after that the python code to generator data for a histogram plot is the following this was written precisely in 5 minutes .so it is very crude

1767569
histogram	plot
getting data for histogram plot

1767576
value	field
my stored procedure is returning either 1 or 0 depending on the value of another field however my checkboxfield in the gridview i ve created to display the data returned from the stored proc is crash saying that the value set to the checkboxfield is a string not boolean

1767576
value	field
how can i take the field returned as 1 or 0 and convert it to boolean .so my checkbox can bind to this value for checked unchecked

1767587

would this types of project be best handled using something like xml or json over http

1767627
myfaces	mojarra
there are two widely known implementation mojarra the open sourced sun api and myfaces

1767636
dependency-injection	singleton
no the only thing that is usually static is the reference to the singleton itself and there are other ways to store that reference too such as jndi or dependency-injection containers

1767645
constructor	private
also don t forget make it all static doesn t make it a singleton you would also need to remove every constructor and make the default-constructor private

1767662
value	field
it creates the _delete field for the recording and wires up a remove link that changes the value to 1

1767679
defined	declare
this is probably because i have defined handles to forwarding declare types in several places .so now the handle class is claiming it won t call the destructor on the given object

1767686
any	set
annoyingly at the moment it dynamicly sizes to whatever fills it - i cant think of any situation you d want a listbox to do that but anyway - or i can only statically set its size

1767698
updating	updates
the real question is - does updating c2 mean that sql-server will have to updates ix_test and the actual data row clustered index

1767701
textbox	button
i need updates the text of a textbox .when i do click on a button on a user-controls

1767705
hide	show
the above will hide the navigation bar .when this view controllers is pushed on top of the navigation stack and show the navigation bar .when the view controllers is popped off

1767717
firefox	opera
the only way to find out the location of a non-worker scripting is the non-standard error.filename which is only supported by firefox and opera

1767720
arguments	default
my recommendation to everyone using floats is to not give them a placement arguments at all the default is or use and let latex put things where it likes

1767731
firefox	opera
you can write plugins one for ie one for firefox one for opera

1767746
order	add
i have a set of button that i want to add into an arrays .so that they are order

1767746
order	add
how do i add a button into an arrays and have them order .so that i can use this order later on for different uses

1767768
order	add
if the order that you add those elements is not the one you want it to be you can use the methods sort

1767799
order	add
add a callback for a successful response that places the response data into a shared bucket in any order

1767807
perl	awk
edit i would go perl before that but awk is fun too

1767822
constructor	object
in this case delete downgrates to the c call free that is it just free the object memory itself but any heap data allocated by the object itself internally in constructor will be keeped the same behavior as free p

1767860
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
that would cause unexplainable classnotfoundexception or noclassdeffounderror problems whenever the webapp is deployed on an appserver of a different make versioning

1767871
margins	padding
problem is in most of my pages it ads an extra 20px margins or padding at the very bottom and i can t locate where that comes from

1767883
children	nodes
you are looking at all product elementss that are children of the context nodes the elements that your templates is transforming or that your for-each loops is currently positioning at and then their product children and then any topicfocus children beneath that

1767883
children	nodes
that s either going to find a lot of nodess if the context nodes is the parent of your product elements or none at all if the context nodes is a product elements unless your product elements have product children

1767886
ordinals	digits
each set of two hex digits after a is the ordinals of the character

1767899

the scenario client press the downloading button then the data from the server that has been queried selected and the result is sent to the client over http internet

1767979
boost	stl
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

1768011
export	csv
but is there a way to export my local data to a csv that is ready for the remote upload scripting

1768014
attributes	properties
typically we introduce an object-model whereby an account is little more than a few header properties id named and the various attributes are stored in key-value pairs of a hash dictionary

1768022
any	set	derived-class	base-class
there is no way to set any field of the derived-class until the base-class s constructor is done .so the overrides methods will use the default-value of the step field

1768046
put	get
i m using xval for validation and everything on that end works just can t get it to redisplay the prior page with the information the user put in display in the box

1768057
json	xml
his proposal leans heavily on the use of embedding links within the representations of the exposed resources and makes a lot of sense i can clearly follow the logic and would like to employ such techniques myself in a set of service i am designing however i have an issue which i m not sure how i should resolve namely how should one provide such links if the data representations used are not xml but something like json instead

1768062
carbon	cocoa
me to do this on osx through cocoa rococoa or carbon

1768079
selected	button
as far as append textarea button to selected nodes nikita prokopov s answer will do the trick

1768085
textbox	button
after the button is click you should be able to find the textbox control and read out the posted value

1768086
constructor	object
by defining properties in the prototype properties of a constructor function and creating object with the new keyword the newly created object inherited the prototype of the constructor and thus have access to those methods

1768086
constructor	object
the code below creates a function constructor we first defined a static methods create an object find out the object does not have a getname methods then we defined one in the prototype and find that now the object does have a getname methods

1768086
constructor	object
remember that the newly created object has a constructor properties which points to the constructor which made it and we can access the prototype properties directly

1768086
constructor	object
the john object we created does not directly own the getname methods since the interpreter cannot find it directly on the object it travels upwards to the constructor and finds it in its prototype

1768086
constructor	object
and btw we didn t really have to create a new instances of the john object as pointed in the other answer you can defined properties in the prototype after you create the initial constructor and all object would inherited those prototypal properties even after they ve been created

1768086
constructor	object
but there s absolutely no sense in making getnamed static because as the named implies it must rely on an object instances to determine what the named properties is you should have more generics helpers functions like parsing functions such as date.parse as static-methods and defined instances methods in the prototype as they re more efficient than defining in the constructor

1768188
value	field
by default the formatting string is applied to the field value only .when the databound control that contains the boundfield object is in readonly mode

1768188
value	field
to apply the formatting string to field value while in edit mode set the applyformatineditmode properties to true

1768190
configuration	installation
.so i just want to know that if there is .some problem with my methods of installing or my macports needs .some configuration after installation

1768212
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
php can do this outside a webserver as can perl python java etc. etc

1768215
json	xml
in that case the xyz can be any web-based messages exchange protocols such as xml json etc

1768222
push	pull
i was thinking of either using push or pull

1768222
push	pull
i have found that pull is more scalability than push

1768222
push	pull
but does any body know if the web chat messenger like gtalk yahoo etc use pull or push

1768257
value	field
changes the value of the field y within the rectangle class

1768257
value	field
it doesn t change the value but it also doesn t set the field width within rectangle

1768264
dictionary	arrays
well one way to do it would be to iterate over each row of each dataset and append a given column value to an arrays that s stored in a dictionary where the time index is used for its key-value

1768264
dictionary	arrays
you then iterate over the dictionary and pull the average for each arrays stored there

1768268
kdevelop	anjuta
my school computers have eclipse netbeans anjuta kdevelop and several other obscure ides and they work fine

1768270

1768292
gearman	worker
take a look at gearman it was specifically made for farming out tasks to worker to handle

1768301
icmp	udp
as a bonus for connecting the udp socket you will not have to specify the destination address ports on each send you will be able to discover unavailable destination ports the icmp reply from the target will manifest as error on the next send instead of being dropped and your os will not have to implicit connect and disconnect the udp socket on each send saving some cycles

1768339
constructor	object
this is simply a round-about way of creating an object in the current domain same as if you just called the constructor

1768350
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
i have spent sometime trying to pick one on .net comparisons are for zsh vs bash and fish vs bash

1768350
fish	zsh
but i could not find any comparison for zsh vs fish

1768360
stderr	stdout
the shell .app have both stdout and stderr connect to the same pty .so .when the terminal-emulator reads from the pty for the shell .app output it can no longer tell which was written to stdout and which to stderr

1768364
callback	methods
phpunit s mock classes allow you specify a custom function ie a callback methods - which is practically unlimited in what it can do

1768390
implements	abstract
there must be some methods in the interface i m assuming its the mynewmethods that you re not implements in your abstract blaha class

1768405
fish	zsh
if you can t find any comparison between zsh vs fish then try them out yourself

1768411
hide	show
is there any way to hide remove its entry from window- show view menu

1768425
arrays	loops
if your goal however is to make a single polyline out of all the points you need to create an arrays of many glatlngs and then create one gpolyline after your loops ends

1768443

1768443
instrumentation	debugging
simulator - 3.1.2 | debugging instrumentation fully functional

1768491
any	set
it s even worse the only safe way to use a thread with the freeonterminate properties set is to not access any properties once the constructor has finished because the thread may have destroy itself already or could do-while the properties is accessed

1768492
revision	updates
since you committed all your work in progress you have no reason not to updates your copy with the entire latest revision

1768494
println	output
the println statement output the expected tostring value of parseable each time after the call to parseable.parse data

1768532
display	height
at the points .when i want the height the div is not being rendering display none

1768532
display	height
however i want the height at the time .when display is set to none

1768558
contains	elements	contains	any
basically you only need to defined point.services as a section as it does not need to contains any other sections then defined a collections properties to contains configuration elements

1768558
attributes	properties
pointservice elements are elements and not sections again note that the collections properties attributes defined the item types not the containers types

because .when the click event is fired obj.method will be execute with the this keyword points to the dom elements and it will alert click me because the button contains a value member

1768611
revision	svn
the following cmd will show you information on the latest commit to the svn repository revision contributor date and time and messages

1768621
jquery	dojo
to convert it to a string you can use something as simple as firefox s json object although i highly suggest that you use a more portable libs like dojo or jquery available as a plugins to accomplish this

1768633
click	mouse
how can i add mouse click event to web textbox in c#

1768658
pulseaudio	jack
on gnu linux you have various options like alsa jack pulseaudio and .so on

the println statement output the

1768688
directory	folder
if you have downloading the binary distribution then in the folder where ajaxcontroltoolkit.dll is found release or debugging not sure which you should al.so see a whole bunch of directory named according to culture code such as fr zh-cht ja and .so on each one contains ajaxcontroltoolkit.re.sources.dll

1768688
directory	folder
you need to copy the language folder you want to your website s bin directory .so that the re.sources will be loaded and used by the .net runtime for the matching culture

i was thinking on doing this with an interpreted-language like ruby php perl python or any with the image manipulation capabilities

1768758
bufferedreader	printwriter
i think what you are looking for is a bufferedreader and a printwriter

1768760
javascript	dom
tbh you will have a harder time of just using a javascript engine as you also have to create the environment of a browser scripting engine such as the dom and windows object

1768768
contains	any
thus it has not been doing any management on the pointers it contains though for brevity i have been using new int in the examples

administration	sysadmin
stop the express service start the server in admin mode sqlservr -m -s sqlexpress from command-line connect to the admin instances and add built-in administration back as sysadmin

1768833
administration	sysadmin
since vista win7 win2k8 remove the administration token from your context under normals uac it makes sense to al.so add as sysadmin yourself explicit domain user .so you don t have to use runasadministration to connect

1768835
authentication	login
if you login using sql-server authentication as sa surely you don t get permission-denied

most likely you would have to dig down in the view hierarchy to find the raw uinavigationbar that contains the title and manually set the title on that

1768912
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
this way you could just test to see if the framework has deallocated any of your viewcontroller and then restore the navigationcontroller stack if it did

1768922
display	height
settings can be something as simple as the height of the control or more complicated things like display mode static page dependant grouping dependant etc.

1768935
implements	super
uiviewcontroller and uiview implements it by default .so all you need to do is overrides the encodewithcoder and decodewithcoder methods call super and save the state variables you need

how do i convert nsmutablearray to nsarray in objective-c

1768943
linux	unix
.so i downloading boost 1_41_0 to my linux box and followed the instructions found on the boost site for unix variants

1768954
filtering	sorting
note you have to note since the filtering and sorting would be done on client side it might perform really poorly if you have too much rows

1768956
contains	set
if the object is a pod types or it has no pointers set to heap-allocated object either contains no pointers or contains pointers set to null or to object owned by someone else and therefore not needed to deallocate there s no reason for a leak

1768977
implements	abstract
this code throw an compilation error b does not implements inherited abstract member a.process

1768992
avr-gcc	winavr
the big benefit is the free and very good avr-gcc compiler winavr for windows

1768998
implements	abstract
b inherited it anyway from a and since b itself is abstract you do not explicit need to implements it again

1769086
show	next
next time you bring it back the labels will exist but no image will be show

1769089
linux	unix
the articles deal about memory usage - where the actual data is stored in .rodata or in .data section do the string should be relocated if we re talking about unix linux shared-objects is it possible to change the string or not

1769117
python	c++
if these solutions either don t work or are still not fast enough and if you absolutely want to write the rest of your application in python there is the boost-python c++ libs

1769117
python	c++
the boost-python libs allows full interoperability between python and c++

1769122

1769186
click	mouse
im creating a macros and need to checked some pixels to make sure the mouse click the right spot

1769210
virtual-machine	vmware
one more minor note if you install vmware 6.5 it will re-map f6 to start debugging in a virtual-machine causing an unable to detection the current startup project error dialog to appear

1769239
any	set
as you are storing data to a dictionary-like object you can set pretty much any kind of data you want to it

1769306
gethashcode	equals
value-type are supposed to implements equals and gethashcode correctly

1769351
filtering	sorting
i have no idea how to make the three functionalities paginator sorting and filtering work together...want i want to achieve

1769359
revision	svn
not a direct answer as i m an advocate of svn myself but take a look at wikipedia s entries for list of revision control software and comparison of revision control software

1769361
postgresql	mysql
i ve been migrating some of my mysql queries to postgresql to use heroku

1769374
javascript-events	onchange
i have an asp.net dropdownlistfor control with onclientclick and onchange javascript-events

1769374
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
both work in ie mozilla opera and google-chrome but not in safari

1769383
postgresql	mysql	aggregate-functions	sum
mysql s grouping by can be used without an aggregate-functions which is contrary to the sql standards and returns the first row in the grouping i don t know based on what criterion while postgresql must have an aggregate-functions max sum etc on the column on which the grouping by clause is issued

1769400
checkbox	button
.so i guess i want to defined an implicit styles which applies to the textblock the checkbox and the button

1769414
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1769431
webserver	upload
i have an application which upload file from iphone to webserver

1769433
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and velocity you can look at some commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1769453
put	get
as the others have said - i would definitely not use a long string like an url as the primary clustering key on a sql-server table - but of course you should feel free to put a unique on that column to make sure you don t get any duplicates

1769466
getter	setter
i have tried to mimic getter and setter in javascript as specified in the following link

1769469
mips	x86
it currently works for arm7 nxp lpc2xxx cortex-m3 stm32 and nxp lpc17xx x86 and our in-house mips isa compatible fpga soft-core

1769477
stderr	stdout
a more radical approach is built-in to my experimental shell gush which show stderr from all cmd run in red stdout in black

1769496
set	bag
i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

1769513
.when	ready
prepare the form .when the dom is ready

1769552
json	xml
i d like it to be able to format and pprint xml and json request response bodies

windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
it working fine of windows-xp but on windows-vista and windows 7 its installation is blocked by uac user account control and .when i disable it all things works fine.

1769628
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
if the user is only allowed to selected one item from a list you should use radio button instead of checkbox

1769662
filtering	grouping
the data can be grouping into several category .so that filtering can be made upon it

1769663
delphi	basic
i suspect you need to import the types libs into delphi which would give you the object properties and methods you need to emulate the basic behavior

1769666
pointers	stack
parameter the this-pointers the pointers to the memory-address on stack where we have just written the value 1 and 5.0

1769666
pointers	stack
calling a function means pushing the return address on stack and setting the instruction pointers register eip to the address of the function somefunction

1769666
pointers	stack
inside function somefunction the old stack is saved by storing the old base pointers ebp on stack push ebp and making stack-pointers the new base pointers .mov ebp esp

1769666
pointers	stack
that means stack is discarded which means stack-pointers is set back to the base pointers

1769666
pointers	stack
the base pointers is set back next value on stack and then the instruction pointers is set to the return address again next value on stack

1769672
fclose	fread
s in glib contains a jump-table with pointers to appropriate functions to handle such call as fseek fread and of relevance fclose

1769672
file-descriptor	pipe
of course after this you ll be left with a file-descriptor to a pipe which will contains whatever the child-process managed to write to it before terminating

1769672
file-descriptor	pipe
by not fread ing with the file pointers returned from popen the underlying pipe will not be touch it s safe to use the file-descriptor by fileno and finish up by calling pclose

1769749
exception-handling	try-catch
certainly wrapping the whole thing in a single try-catch is like saying i expect an exception-handling about everything

1769762
safari	opera
opera supports it above 90 adobe was supporting it above 80 but may be supported it better now than last year and safari is supporting it above 40 but not supporting in a comparable manner compared to the prior two mentioned grouping

1769809
any	set
.so you would use __init__ .whenever you wanted to set any attributes - member variables in java - of the object .when it was created

1769809
constructor	object
.so we can see __init__ is passed the arguments we gave to the constructor along with self which is the reference to the object that has been created

1769809
instance-variables	local-variables
finally for instance-variables it solves a syntactic problem with assignment since local-variables in python are by definition

1769812
subclassing	inherited
if you have several tables that all represent buses in different states then you are probably looking for an inherited using table per subclassing strategy

1769836
instances	self

user-interface	look-and-feel
the java look-and-feel design guide offers a detailed reference about the standards in user-interface design with swing and metal look-and-feel

1769862
mkannotationview	mkmapview
note you need to handle the touch-events for the mkannotationview and not mkmapview

1769865
firefox	safari
you can also try running the same code in another browser with a solid javascript debugger like firefox + firebug or safari with the develop tools enabled

1769886
children	nodes
however there are situations where the root nodes is of one types which has children of another types which has children of a third types example documents-- paragraphs-- lines-- words

put it in a loops and do it say 1000 time then divide the result by 1000 what do you get then

1769920
required	checked
how can i checked within this function whether all required field of the structure have been filled before a function-call

1769942
value	field
it is up to you to defined what is a valid or invalid value for a field of the structure

1769948
default	reset
unless you specifically need to know the default properties for your project - i d recommend looking into using a reset scripting

1769956
arrays	loops
performance wise it may make sense to store the value in an arrays as this solution hits the dom quite a lot by having a nested loops

1769973
click	mouse
you can use this properties to allow the user to quickly navigate a simple-form by allowing them to simply press the esc key to close a windows without committing changes instead of manually click the cancel button with their mouse

1769983
constructor	object
create an initializer function that takes all the field as arguments as if it were an object constructor and use it instead of setting the field one by one

1769998
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista is versioning 6.0 and windows 7 is 6.1 which ideally should have been 7

1770040
hide	show
.when the drag stop event is fired you should just be able to unhide them again by calling show instead of hide and replacing .ui-draggable-dragging by another class they have in common

1770075
getter	setter
i provide getter and setter hibernate dependencies on my classpath al.so.but i still do not get the how to validation simple-form there is actually not .so much documentation for spring hibernate combinations

1770078
mp3	wma
we do mp3 wma and some graphic file search

1770126
environment	execution
as to whether there s a performance penalty it depends partially on where your variables is defined and partially on the execution environment

1770169
order	add
take note that this is still not thread safe if atomicity operations are required on the handler s methods then you would need to use higher order locking between treads or add methods on your wrapper class to support thread safe atomicity operations something like begintreadsafeblock folowed by endtreadsafeblock that lock the wrapped handler for writing for a series of operations

1770198
hide	show
i want to hide win_dock .when all the windowss of the application loses focus and show it again if a windows gain focus

1770198
hide	show
.when this counter drops to zero i want to hide win_dock and if this counter is positive again i want to show win_dock

1770214
buildpath	libs
right-click the libs and do buildpath - add to buildpath

1770232
ref	out
note that isbyref is something different that allows you to choose between int and ref int out int

1770235
compact-framework	.net
the problem is that system.media is not available in the .net compact-framework 2.0 to play them

1770241
httpwebrequest	webclient
but .when coding your own webclient httpwebrequest the proxy is not automatically used-- you need to enable use of a proxy yourself either in code or configuration

1770241
httpwebrequest	webclient
note that the same code can be used against webclient as httpwebrequest

1770265
firefox	opera
as this call is within a click handler it even works perfectly with firefox and ie for opera it lets you open the pop-up manually

1770283
uiimage	nsdata
you can get the uiimage content as a jpeg or png wrapped in nsdata

1770287
value	field
you should increase consistency - is the content of the list structure related to the value you want to access with getfield and setfield string field and related to the field parameter you use to create a student

1770287
value	field
if you want to get the field value you just set with the submit methods then you have to get it from the student

1770287
value	field
assuming student has a getter for the field value and in the management class

1770292
parser-generator	antlr
if you have no control then a parser-generator such as antlr may be valuable

1770302
value	field
because you have not set a value to the field attributes

1770302
contains	any	value	field
what you posted although interesting doesn t contains any reference the the field attributes nor show where it is being assign a value

1770302
value	field
but that doesn t set the value to the field attributes

1770302
value	field
to solve your problem search for the field attributes and find out where are you setting a value

1770335
attributes	properties
now what i want to do is access the home id s attributes inside the block defined above .so that i change the properties of the home division whenever .some one hovers on an anchor tag inside the home division

1770343
data-structures	dictionary
i think you are looking at data-structures for time-indexed object and not for a dictionary

1770343
xts	zoo
for the former look at the zoo and xts package which offer much better time-pased subsetting

1770364
shadowbox	lightbox	shadowbox	jquery	lightbox	jquery
i m using a jquery shadowbox libs wich allows you to show html content in a lightbox shadowbox

1770365
virtual-machine	virtualbox
if you are using virtualbox i think that you can do the mounting of the disk image offline virtual-machine not running

1770390
any	set
if i pop mychild off stack i think the navigation controllers will release it and i presume that it would be set to nil and that any messages sent to it would be ignore

1770399
environment	building
we re using this as a building environment as it currently has the numerous libs needed to building painlessly

1770399
directory	folder
what i want to do is use vs2008 on my windows-xp development box and create a new project linked to this .source folder .so that i can explore and edit the .source with the benefits of intellisense then simply putty into the mounted directory and run make

click	mouse
but after any mouse event for instances - left click my application crash with stack overflow

1770426
children	nodes
if it is a inner nodes it stores pointers to four children which can be either leaf or inner nodes

1770426
children	nodes
there is the function split which transforms a leaf into a inner nodes and creates for children leafs with the same color the current cell has at the moment

1770432
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to vs 2008 they changed their stance and include unit-testing in the non team suite level versioning of the ide

1770456
mbunit	nunit
if you can t use nunit and presumably mbunit etc. then you have two options upgrade to vs2005 team systemd or vs2008 professional

1770475
average	max	average	min
another option would be to use jamon a tool that gathers statistics execution-time numbers of hit average execution-time min max etc for any code that comes between start and stop methods

1770497
sortedset	sortedmap
a sortedmap is a mapping from a sortedset of key to value

1770522
.net	wcf
the more .net way would be to use remoting or wcf and named pipe

1770534
json	xml
the response you get back will be in something like xml or maybe json in which case you can use a 3rd party libs

1770538

grouping	sorting
for example even though the datagrid control may not have everything you re looking for consider that it has features such as sorting paging grouping and aggregation already built-in

1770648
javascript	dom
i ve seen .some really good work done with asp.net jquery and ajax stackoverflow uses javascript extensively but you might find that writing an advanced control to work in the dom the same way that a silverlight control works in silverlight .somewhat tedious to write i ll admit that i don t have experience with writing controls in javascript jquery .so i m not the best one to comment

1770699
python	php	python	c++	python	java
i use java python c++ and php

1770700
sql-server	ms-access
also the sql-server the ms-access db and the ssis package do not have to be on the same machine

1770700
sql-server	ms-access
as long as your calling program can see the ssis package and the package can connect to the sql-server and the ms-access db you can transfer data from one place to another

1770706
nsuserdefaults	nsstring	nsarray	nsdate
nsuserdefaults can only store standards data types like nsnumber nsstring nsdate nsarray nsdictionary

1770719
multiplying	subtract
just subtract the two datetime value and multiplying by 24

1770721
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
btw in your original example there is no advantage to using a concurrenthashmap as you are locking each access why not just use a normals hashmap inside your locked section

1770725
python	c++
i made some binding from my c++ .app for python

1770756
children	nodes
in the second case you start at the root nodes read its elements if it is an operators recursively read in the children as appropriate then perform the operators s function on their value

1770891
firefox	safari
i found that this works in ie apple safari and firefox

1770893
order	join
this is like a left join insofar as you still get order with no details but it s a graphing like oo rather than a set like sql

1770895
puts	gets
in any case you may want to additionally log the hashcode of the key used for the gets puts in threads 1 and 2

1770898

in my code i would like to grab some of the field let s say the value of payment_fee

1770909
silverlight	wpf
does anyone have a good example of a wpf or silverlight windows gadget

1770958
for-loop	arrays
you could use an arrays to store the recipients and then use a for-loop

1770965
return-value	arguments
this means that the types of the variables tup the type-parameters of create and the return-value of create are all inferred from the types you pass as arguments to create

1770969
constructor	object
if you call the constructor with no arguments like the new object s passwd member is never set

1770986
py2exe	exe
works ok .when creating exe with py2exe in python2.6 but does not in python2.5

1771008
constructor	object
.when you create a new systemmanagement object with the parameter-less constructor your passwd is null because you assign nothing to it unless you use the setpasswd setter

1771008
constructor	object
.when you create a new systemmanagement object with the constructor that takes a string you ignore the parameter and your passwd is-empty because nextpasswd always returns an empty string

1771092
double	int
imagine for a moment this inherited double extends int extends numbers

1771092
double	int
this is not correct in java but imagine that double is just an int plus a fractions part

1771092
double	int
in this scenario a comparable which works for numbers also works for int and double since both derive from numbers

1771092
double	int
.so would satisfy the super part for t being numbers int or double

1771092
double	int
this means you can pass in numbers for t and the resulting code will also work .when there are int and double instances in the lists

1771092
double	int	extends	super
if you int for t you can still use double but numbers is not possible because it doesn t satisfy t extends comparable anymore the super part would still work though

1771093
silverlight	xbap
i am just curoius to know whether silverlight 4 is going to replace xbap completly

1771093
silverlight	xbap
like full trust xbap can we do everything with current silverlight 4

1771116
contains	elements
response.solutioninfo now contains demlist.size elements

1771126
silverlight	xbap
they ll probably restrict the use of unsafe code and pinvoke in silverlight 4 to a greater degree than in xbap

1771127

this would be pretty trivial stuff for a parsing but different text files have different delimiters .so i d like to let the user specify whether the text is separated by tabs spaces comma pipe unicode snowmen et cetera

1771131
communication	messages
you can consider any option of interprocess communication memory-mapped-files sockets named pipe event windows messages

1771133
python	java
this solution required the python files for selenium-rc and you need to start the java-server java -jar selenium-server.jar

one thing that can help is finding languages with certain synergies i ve found that i can switching relatively easily between python and java .

1771238
python	perl	python	java
yeah i am still more likely to forget semi-colons at the end of my java line if i ve been doing python but the two languages sync well in my brain .so switching isn t as difficult as going from python to perl for example

1771238
perl	php
i ve also found it relatively easy to switching between perl php

sift and surf keypoint - .when attempting to use either of these methods which is based on features i discovered that the object i wanted to detection was too low in re.solution .so there were not enough features to match to make an accurate detectionion

1771394
surf	sift
what would work best is something like template-matching but with scale and rotation invariance which led me to try sift surf but i have no idea how to modify the template-matching function

1771407
contains	set
if the forms where hardcode then we would simply set the db tables up to store the normalize data ourselves however as our users defined the form field contains in the forms we re not sure what is the best way to proceed to implements this functionality

1771518
python	c++
nb i ve not done much in the way of python .so feel free to comment if my python is wrong stupid but the points of this question is more the best way to accomplish this .sort of thing in c++ .so hopefully the python provided is enough to give you an idea of what i want to do

1771559
any	set
basically all this is doing is using jquery to set an event that .when one of the selectedion boxes changes removes the selectedion with the same value from any following selectedion boxes that have a year numbers defined in the named attributes of each selected box that is greater than the year numbers of the selectedion box that was changed

1771559
input-field	selected
since you were talking about combo boxes as well i assume you have a text input-field in addition to the selected boxes but you can use the same principles with those

1771577
appfuse	spring
spring 3 final is soon to be release and appfuse is based on 2.5

1771583

an abstract-class - would work but the base-class has some useful helpers functions that get used by some of the subclassing

1771741
subclassing	base-class
an interface - if applied to just the base-class then the subclassing don t have to implements the function only the base-class does

1771745

xbap delivers the full richeness of wpf and the .net still missing from silverlight even .when elevate privs are enabled

1771849

however imo silverlight 4 would appear to deliver enough to give those who might have considered xbap pause for thought

1771866
arrays	map
have you considered treating the 2-dimensional arrays like it like a karnaugh map

1771893
textbox	button
the user types a words in the textbox click the button and a new textbox is loaded into a panels with the value in the original textbox that the user has entered

1771897
subclassing	base-class
base-class then the subclassing don t

1771897
subclassing	base-class
if the base-class is abstract you can mark methods that belong to the interface as abstract and force the implementation in the subclassing

1771897
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
this provides subclassing with a default implementsation of the interface or part of it and also lets you inherited from something else and still implements the interface or if you want to implements the interface but not inherited the base-class implementsation

1771914
strtol	atoi
for example the boost lexical_cast is an improvement over such functions as atoi and strtol much as the standards c++ string is an improvement over the c way of doing things

1771975
onkeydown	keydown
then added a variables to say people had started typing because there still was an issue with the onkeydown checked because if they were typing and the disable was called on keydown even if typing was true it would still activate cuz it is called to hide the hint on the initial keydown.

1771975
hide	show
anyway .so it checked if it is the initial keydown if it is it hide hint if not doesn t hide it because it s already hidden and to call the hide again would show it thx toggle

html5lib	lxml
however parsing huge files is becoming a performance bottleneck and lxml parsing is about 80 time faster than html5lib i benchmarking it

1772035
contains	any
i was hoping to use jquery to match the string in the input box to any inside one of the list items then hide the other ones maybe by applying a new class dynamically to the ones that contains the matching string and hiding all others that don t contains that class

1772066
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql

webforms	asp.net
having said that i need to points out that division into layer may not help very much with asp.net webforms project

1772086
configuration	environment
for one thing it would allow others to run your tests ver easily just points to the configuration file and less prone to errors environment variables getting contaminated and easier to debugging

1772090
dictionary	map
along the line of what l99057j said if all you re doing is mapping input to constants value this is a place for an appropriate lookup structure such as an arraylist for sequential input or a dictionary map for a sparse-matrix one not a switching statement

1772095
hotmail	gmail
essentially types_key has the named either hotmail or gmail and types has the dictionary that is the value associated with that key

you can also use the isnull transact-sql specific or coalesce sql-92 standards function as in

1772127
javadoc	doxygen
i dislike styles which have enormous vertical whitespace between functions - if they re .so separate that you don t want to see them both on screens at the same time i d say either put them in different files or fill the gap with doxygen javadoc comments

1772131
subclassing	nsobject
in it a normals object subclassing nsobject has this code and only this code

1772133

two generics typess can be subtyping only if the types arguments are identical or with a wildcards .so is not a subtyping of

1772213
subtyping	generics
checked the subtyping section of generics tutorial

1772214
scala	java
that properties is called covariance and in java generics types are not covariant other languages such as scala contains covariant generics types

1772217
plugins	add-on
i imagine there s a way to disable plugins add-on extensions etc

1772220
configuration	environment
one simple step could be moving the environment variables into a separate file and have the original scripting source the new file which effectively becomes your configuration file - minimal changes and no additional parsing required

1772232
stdin	pipe
replace stdin and stdout for child-process with pipe using dup2 function

1772236
codeigniter	symfony
i d say that the single biggest advantage of cake over zend symfony codeigniter etc. is that it is a rapid development framework

1772255
authentication	login
i would think that the solution would be to somehow use the authentication token cookies generator in the asp.net form login and somehow pass that to the silverlight object which then include it in the wcf request

1772274
.net	wcf
all the benefits of general .net don t really apply in the soa-world of wcf i would say you re not passing around class or struct instances - see above

1772277
wamp	php
i figured wamp is a server like iis and somewhere on your drive is php s plugin-folder

1772278
administration	account
checked which user account tfs is using it s likely to be tfsservice or tfsreports and almost certainly won t be your administration login

1772292
repository	entity
and yes i think the repository should be responsible for building an entity with all it s related data

1772311
entity-framework	ado.net
my ultimate goal is to use sql anywhere s ado.net entity-framework connect for a ria service i m writing

1772333
macros	let
i see others have provided examples of points 2 macros as functions let me give an example of creating a new c construct the finite-state-machine

1772372
contains	elements
the xml schema is pretty complex which contains many custom defined simple types and elements with complex types such as

1772386
triggers	insert
tab triggers are also useful .when they match program keyword and lead to actions such as insert snippets that do what you would normally do after entering the keyword

1772389
printf	strlen	printf	atoi	strlen	atoi
no strlen no fgets no atoi no strtoul no fopen no printf with the s conversion specifier .

1772441
haskell	python
some languages like haskell are tailor-made for recursive algorithms while others like python are not

1772452
textbox	button
the button click causes a focus shift from the textbox whixh updates the text value where the menu click will not cause such a focus shift .so the text has not yet been updates in the textbox

1772460

then you d only have to use logical and s and or s to get put stuff into it

1772485
decimal	hex
in hex the value is represented as 0x0800 or 2048 in decimal

1772495

what i need to do at first is to write some .app php python shell or find one to convert over 500 quicktime videos to be able to be read within a flash player

1772550
32-bit	64bit
you could also use int32_t instead of nsinteger if you know the value will never exceed the 32-bit range â this will conserve some spaces in 64bit mode

1772563
printf	strcat
strcat would be faster because printf has to first scan the string looking for format variables

1772598
jquery	.post
why not do a jquery .post to the bit.ly api

1772607

1772639
value	field
i should be more clear in the end i want the value to end up on my page not the field named themselves

1772644
rational-numbers	fixed-point
if you really need the precision and are sticking with rational-numbers i suppose you could go with a fixed-point arithemtic

1772658
contains	elements	contains	set
because attributes named must be unique within an elements and can only contains simple content the dom methods to set and get attributes value are significantly simpler to use than the dom methods for setting and getting value within elementss

1772658
attributes	properties
in wpf you can use attributes in xaml to store the value of object properties that have side-effects .when they reset

1772668
average	max
is there a formula that will tell me the max average # of concurrent users i would expect to have with a population of 1000 users a day using an .app for 10 minutes

1772672

1772680
32-bit	64bit
can the 64bit jdk jre load use 32-bit dll s or do i need to either find the 64bit versioning of the dll or run the 32-bit jdk jre

1772688
silverlight	xbap	out-of-browser	xbap
silverlight 4 s trusted mode is only out-of-browser .so if you want to do anything trusted in browser you still need to use xbap

1772690
event-listener	listener
you might just need to add an event-listener for event.added_to_stage init and execute your setup code within that listener

1772693
value	field
it falls into a field of study called numerical-analysis that deals with these types of problems which goes far beyond just making sure you don t checked for equality between 2 floating-point value

1772696
communication	messages
if you don t want a user to submit a form twice whilst waiting for a scripting to process then you could modify your javascripting function to either disable the submit button onclientclick or add a to your page contains the often used animated circle icons and a loading messages to communication to the user

1772709
32-bit	64bit
64bit dll s required the 64bit jdk and 32-bit dll s required the 32-bit jdk

the following is my current code and i am not clear on how to parsing for the additional comma and numbers

1772730
parsing	comma
i can parsing out the hyphen but not sure how to do it for additional comma or hyphens

1772735
concatenation	comma
you can either implode the arrays as many people above have suggested or assign the actor s named to a variables and concatenation that variables with each iterator and then perform a rtrim operation on the resulting arrays to remove the last comma

1772747
debugging	trace
.when you implements complex algorithm or tracking difficult bug you want to iterate rapidly this sequences modify some code link trace debugging modify some code link etc.

1772753

is there any way to do this besides iterator through the result set

1772767
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested ie firefox and google-chrome over an 8 hour period and there didn t appear to be any negative impact although my boxes are relatively fast

1772793
put	get
i get dynamic-content with ajax and i put it in a div but the problem is that i have diffrent ids for some child divs from the dynamic-content

1772822
put	get
.so i was thinking of having another .sort of tag like this and put it under the authorizeattribute this way if they are not authentication they get caught by that one

uilabel	uiview
i got rid of the uiview completely and ended up putting the uilabel as a subviews of the uiimageview and returned the uiimageview

1772860
selected	checkbox
the best you can do is warn the user ahead of time that only a limited numbers of files will be used then prompt the user afterwards if they selected too many perhaps giving them the opportunity selected which files they want to upload with a checkbox list

1772861
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it works properly

1772861
google-chrome	firefox

what is the exact difference between live and ready

1772865
search-engine	seo
you could use it for seo search-engine optimization in any numbers of web-applications

1772869
query-cache	memcached
memcached would certainly prove helpful here but only in the same way that the query-cache assuming you re using mysql would be helpful

1772872
.when	ready
.ready lets you register a callback that fires .when the dom is ready - this is similar to using window.onload but fires earlier and you can register more than one callback

1772876
filtering	sorting
the table should behave nicely .when sorting and filtering using excel

1772879
bugzilla	trac
.so is your issue tracker jira bugzilla trac etc behind the firewall

1772882
common-table-expression	subquery
.when i do it the old fashioned human way it s fairly straightforward - particularly if the subquery is already alias - it can be pulled into a common-table-expression first

1772887
infinispan	terracotta
on the other side has .net got enterprise open project like terracotta semi commerical infinispan compass

1772887
entity-framework	nhibernate
and entity-framework is a disaster they have to start with nhibernate as the base or get some lessons from them

1772887
ruby	php
many of them are using java and many others are using php ruby facebook yahoo ..

1772887
scala	java
as a language java is far behind c# but scala runs on jvm is as good as c# and it s performance is nearly same as java and also it can use all jdk and other java code as his libs

1772891
temporary	rvalue
you re returning a reference on a temporary object i emphasized the typo computes a pointers interval and the result-of the operation is a temporary rvalue you can t take a reference from it

1772909
silverlight	wpf
is it time to retrain retool the team in wpf silverlight

1772910
postgresql	mysql
after getting burned on the matter of postgresql and java-stored-procedures i won t dare to speculate on whether mysql does java-stored-procedures

1772923
silverlight	wpf
silverlight and wpf both compete with

1772938
contains	set
if i m understanding your question correctly it seems like you have a stackpanel that you want to contains a set of children

1772947
silverlight	wpf
you need to convince them of the arguments for using wpf or silverlight vs

1772968
selected	checkbox
based on certain choices the user selected it dynamically creates a numbers of checkbox input elements

1772975
webforms	asp.net

1772982
dreamweaver	notepad++
i have both dreamweaver and notepad++ handy

1772987
conditional	operators
yes in all sane circumstances the request will complete but under some conditional operators could actually choose to intervene in the transactional manually and maybe cause heuristics damage in doing so.

1772994
exception-handling	try-catch
my test code only throw one exception-handling at the end however. these exception-handling functions were called in my main loops i believe every time this is where i had the try-catch part.

1773004
silverlight	wpf
you will end up doing a mix of both silverlight and wpf it is unlikely that you will end up doing only one and they are sufficiently alike that skills from one can be used in the other

1773038
attributes	properties
i believe ie accesses it as an attributes not a properties

1773040
contains	elements

however i d like to find a way to scripting this change .so that i can automate the installation of a dev environment

1773089
arrays	map
i don t think there s a good jquery way to do this but if you need efficiency map one of the arrayss by a certain key one of the unique object field and then do comparison by looping through the other arrays and comparing against the map or associativity arrays you just built

1773095
32-bit	64bit
you can downloading 32-bit windows binaries of the program and microsoft claims most programs designed for a computer running a 32-bit versioning of windows will work on a computer running 64bit versioninging of windows

1773112
callback	methods
as a rules you should never call a callback methods inside the body of a request reply isoneway false operationcontract methods

1773112
callback	methods
the safest thing would be to not have any request reply methods in your contract what.soever .when doing duplex but you can safely have them just .so long as they don t callback into the callback contract before returning

1773112
callback	methods
it would be ok to call a callback methods after returning for example from another worker thread

1773118
publish-subscribe	message-queue
.so you re basically describing a publish-subscribe mechanism -- a message-queue

1773118
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq probably overkill in your case

1773123
associations	model
rememeber you can always change the model later and then make sure stuff doesn t break by taking the child table rename and associations table tables that replace the current child table table and putting them in a view that is named like the current child table

1773130
display	height	display	width
if you remove the display block you won t be able to set your width height or use text-indent to hide the copy within the a

1773134
contains	set
.so in your ajax jquery whatever code create a string that contains all of the selected html and then get the holder a div or span or whatever and set the innerhtml to the string you ve construct

1773145
.when	ready
.when a thread wait on a synchronized primitive like a critical_section or mutex it is not placed on the ready queue - windows will not even attempt to run the thread and will run other threads if possible

1773145
.when	ready
at some points the thread will be move back to the ready queue for instances .when the thread owning the cs or mutex release it

1773147
json	xml	any	set
i ve setup the service using the wcf 3.5 to accept plain http-post request and it works beautifully as long as the content-types in the request header is not set to text xml or any other xml or json types such as text json or application json

1773151
websphere	ibm
once you get the client install the sample code can be found in c program files ibm websphere mq tools jms samples simple

1773165
callback	methods
if you do need to perform calculations and may need to change output formatting you can use the formatter callback methods as a formatting string

1773178
firefox	opera
this works in ie but i cannot get it to work in opera or firefox

1773183
constructor	private
it has a private constructor .so only the class itself can defined the allowed value

1773183
value	field
and lastly it can be modified to associate more than two field together for example a named description and a numeric value

1773191
reflection	runtime
you can use reflection to get types information about the parameters of a methods but only the declare types - you can t automatically get information about the actual arguments because the reflection metadata gives information about the methods definition not the specific value passed to it at runtime

1773211
multiplication	division
if you have to calculate with your probabilities especially if you do division and multiplication you need to round the results correctly

1773219
any	set
i have set the append parameter to true in both the pdfstamper and pdfsignatureappearance constructor but it does not seem to have any effect

1773219
itextsharp	acrobat
since i can get the desired result using acrobat i am assuming i am just not using itextsharp correctly

1773221
static-typing	let
i used the static-typing of java heavily to let me code faster

1773227
boolean	int
but what happens .when you start to mix strings with dates and int and boolean which all use different rendering

1773234
click	mouse
i was wondering what will be the best way to overrides the treeview s mouse click

1773239
populate	row
the .net result is that .when the data is read back out of the database both staff and managers lists are populate with every row in the table

1773251
toggleclass	addclass	toggleclass	removeclass	removeclass	addclass
for more information see the jquery docs on hasclass addclass removeclass and toggleclass

1773266
linux	bsd
there is still a lot of work to do in porting that especially since the code has lots of dependencies on ptrace and syscall not to mention the different threading model between linux bsd and windows

1773304
hide	show
to hide and show a form use the form.visible properties

1773305
ironpython	ironruby
this talk from pdc09 really piqued my interest the guy demonstrates how you can use ironpython or ironruby to make a c# .app scriptingable in his demo drop a python scripting in a textbox and it works with extends your c# code

1773317
python	perl
some people like python for the same reason others love perl

1773317
python	perl
incidentally i have found that most python lovers loathe perl s flexible and expressive syntax

1773317
python	perl
as a perl lover i don t hate python but consider it to be overly structured and restrictive

1773329
export	report
if you are using a full versioning of cr you can enable the create bookmarks from grouping tree option in the file | export | report export options.

1773330
audio	ogg
the mooncodecs folder within the mono project here has several audio codecs in c# adpcm and ogg vorbis and one video codec dirac but they all seem to implements just the decode portion of their respective formats as do the java implementsation from which they were ported

1773351
value	field
the best solution for this is to redesign and get rid of that field that is storing multiple value and make it a related table instead

1773351
value	field
you should not be storing multiple value in one field and dead slow queries like this are the reason why

1773368
highlight	selected
the one i used in the past was to show all nodess in the path leading to the nodes that satisfies your filtering criterion but highlight filteringing out nodess differently and make them non-actionable can t be selected in user-interface operations can t be performed on them etc...

1773379
authentication	login
but .when not logged in user tries to access resource page that required authentication user must have foorole role we automatically redirect him to login page and after providing correct credentials return back to restrict resources

1773386
any	set
i need to suppress an already set session cookies header but i cannot find any way to do this

1773405
controllers	routes
the default routes in the global-asax are set up to match controllers action id

1773406
contains	set
you are likely in that case if your set contains a list returned by arrays.aslist as pointed out by jeffrey

1773435
ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian or ubuntu you need to install the python-tk package to get tkinter support

1773440
checked-exceptions	runtimeexception
in my opinion catching checked-exceptions and rethrowing them as runtimeexception is abusing the systemd

1773453
stored-procedures	ssis
if i can do the required etl requirements using stored-procedures any advantages of using ssis package instead

1773457
continuous-integration	teamcity
we have been using teamcity for some time for the continuous-integration in the project

1773461
z-index	tooltip
the javascript to display the tip would positioning the tooltip iframe and div at the exact same positioning with the z-index set to a smaller value to ensure it is behind the text div

1773474
stored-procedures	ssis
i have also found that package ssis and dts are more readily recognized as jobs - the stored-procedures that are execute by scheduling jobs are often overlooked by developers because they can t see the scheduling jobs

1773474
stored-procedures	ssis
that said i have seen etl performed by stored-procedures and dts ssis package alike and as long as the stored procedure isn t a large mess of tangled code it seems appropriate

1773481
stored-procedures	ssis
we saw 10 folding improvements in our data-warehouse environment .when we took some of the heavy hitting stored-procedures and put them in ssis package

1773512
any	set
any files specified as static files get upload separately from your code - they re not accessible by your python code .so even with the pythonpath set correctly you won t be able to import them

1773550
json	xml
how would you convert from xml to json and then back to xml

1773568
sftp	scp
libcurl need to be built to use libssh2 for scp and sftp transfer to work

1773571
json	xml
i think this is the best one converting between xml and json

1773580
subclassing	nsobject
py2app which ships with pyobjc can compile loadable bundles can be loaded via nsbundle which seems like the best approach defined an nsobject subclassing in python that implements a protocols obtained via objc.protocolsnamed that you defined in objective-c then compile this python file into a loadable bundle via py2app which uses a standards setup.py

1773582
.net	wcf
also in .net 3.5 i assume there are other ways to do this say with wcf

1773589
javascript	dom
the biggest problem with javascript is that if you manipulate the dom the user might not be aware that anything has happened

1773618
stringtokenizer	bufferedreader
read in every line via bufferedreader and parsing with stringtokenizer

1773642
put	get
the rea.son that there s no .post to a particular member is because that member recording already exists in the database .so the only thing you can do to it is get look at put updates or delete destroy

1773662
macros	basic
access has a built-in macros language called visual basic for applications vba. the ole error might originate from that

1773670
instances	destroy
instances that it contains is destroy

1773673
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1773694
reference-type	generics
we are supporting typesafe covariance and contravariance of generics interfaces and delegation which are construct with reference-type arguments

1773705
ruby	php
i do agree it s a design pattern that makes more sense than most db access patterns found in java and it s one of the strengths of ruby and php

1773716
gdcm	vtk
i am using vtkgdcmimagereader from the gdcm project to read a multiframe dicom image and display it with vtk and pyqt4

1773718
object-reference	instances
then i get an error like object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1773728
directory	folder
this is a quick and dirty trick but you can use turtoisesvn browse the local repository create a remote folder and checked it out into the directory you wan to import

1773755
duplicates	contains
it is probably because of the special handling of merged dictionary which can contains duplicates key

1773763
shell	bash
and how can i prevent the translation in a bash shell

1773769
operators	keyword
.when you access a typesnamed with the operators within a templates you need to use the typesnamed keyword .so the compiler knows it is the named of a types as opposed to the named of .some variables or function within the class

1773774
toolchain	gnu
there are literally hundreds of parts to choose from many vendors all with the same architecture and supporting the same toolchain including gnu gcc

1773794
joomla	drupal
drupal wordpress and joomla

1773795
aggregate-functions	sum
you can just use the sum aggregate-functions

1773803

therefore you can design a hash-function without any collision and use a simple arrays rather than a hashmap to hold your data reducing memory consumption and increasing lookup speed

1773804
htmlspecialchars	echo
this presumes a function h that call echo htmlspecialchars and u that does echo htmlspecialchars urlencode

1773810
expressionengine	wordpress
in expressionengine i would use the url slug but i m not sure how to do this in wordpress

1773815
value	field
is it possible that an exception-handling is being throw before or while the code that populate the field value is being run

1773824
children	tree
this would grab all children from the db and load up the tree in memory

1773827
environment	execution
i would recommend setting your jdk manually in preferences java install jre as well as preferences java install jre execution environment

1773850
ruby	php
typically i like to make those constants in languages like c ruby php etc

1773865
contains	any
is there any option in vim spell checker to ignore words contains underscore.js multiple uppercase letters minus numbers in a plain text file

1773868
if-statement	while-loop
it allows for functions simple fractran and sequences of other functions and a while-loop and if-statement for convenience

1773868
if-statement	loops
plus it goes at least quadratically in the numbers of function-calls - doubling the numbers of function-calls makes it take at least four time as long more if there are while loops or if-statement

1773890
children	nodes
and .when it s a parent nodes they store the address of the children

1773893
nsscrollview	nstextview
how do i centering an nstextview within an nsscrollview like the way preview does

1773901
macros	basic
in common-lisp one can employ macros and compiler macros to produce code similar to c++ templates where basic cases can be customized for specific types yielding different code expansions

1773918
arguments	default
the fact that the original c language was such that by default any variables or arguments was defined as types int is probably another factors

1773936
python	java
well if you re going to tune the java program you might as well tune the python program too

1773936
hashtable	set
as everyone knows if you want a dense set of smallish int in java you don t use a hashtable

1773941
put	get	double	int
otherwise you cannot put a list int and a list double together to get a set numbers which should logically be possible

1773948
value	field
since the run methods would be an instances methods this gets rid of the need for the parm methodss to access the value of the field on the dialog

1773949
shell	bash
please read bash tutorial or this to get familiarize with shell scripting

1773963
webforms	asp.net

1773981
implements	abstract
that s abstract and there are no concrete derived classes in the framework as far as i can see but all you need to implements is getkeyforitem as far as i can see

1773995
arrays	map
use map to create a new arrays from the old one

1773999
contains	set
to use http as merely a transport mechanism the status header is always set to 200 ok the content-types is something generics like application json and the entity body contains something that itself has an object an object types an error-code and whatever else you want

1774016
google-code	bitbucket
for open source project we have used sourceforge but are moving to google-code and mercurial bitbucket

1774018
credentials	security
i don t want to store the data in s3 because as i understand it this would required storing my amazon-web-services credentials on the instances itself or passing them as userdata which is also a security risk

1774025
constructor	private
a parameterless constructor is generally more descriptive than passing null you can make it private if you only use it from within the class

1774033
json	xml
if you don t need for the format to be custom-built then you should look into using an existing format such as json or xml for which there are parsing available

1774034
callback	methods
then the timeout methods in your saga is the callback you were looking for

1774046
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian it is provided by the python-dateutil package

1774047
put	get
for the second arguments you re goign to want to put _server request_uri or whatever variables you can get the request from

1774135
click	mouse
just handle mouse click and use hittest to see if the mouse cursor is on the state image

1774148
value	field
ideally i would just like to augment this code but i would be ok making foo abstract and moving the value field to each of the subclassing with additional annotations

1774155
hide	show
please see slicker show and hide

1774162
python	php
of course this example is in python since i don t know php nearly as well

the only problem is .when the itemscontrol grows too big and hits the right dock it will always force the right dock to go smaller even though the minwidth is set on the grid that is contains within

1774186
python	c++	python	java
we are using gae to hosts our web-services as far as i know gae only support java and python at the moment however most of our engineers here are more comfortable with c++ .so i was wondering if there is a way to integrated g.soap with gae at all

1774213
derived-class	base-class
â first and only for the constructor of the most derived-class as describe below virtual base-classes shall be initializer in the order they appear on a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the directed acyclic graphing of base-classes where â œleft-to-rightâ is the order of appearance of the base-class named in the derived

1774220

regardless of whether i include any brackets or all of them or just the first my capturecollection just contains the original string

1774279
environment	building
par uses various environment variables both during the building process of executable or par archive and the use of them

1774294
python	perl
you should probably use some scripting-language like perl or python

1774307
priority-queue	heap
java s priority-queue can provide the heap implementation

1774312
logout	login
it s a bit tricky because they have to use the settings .app to logout and then login from inside your .application with the test user account

1774320
python	c++
i program in mostly python and c++ and hitting enter send the cursor back to column 1 on a newline rather than keeping you in the block you re working in

1774336
bison	yacc
further reading page 237 it appears that you need more look ahead which is not an option for standards yacc bison

1774363
httpwebrequest	webclient
i ve adapted the code to use httpwebrequest instead of a webclient

1774364
haskell	ocaml
either ocaml or haskell would be a good choice

1774364
haskell	ocaml
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libs for ocaml as well including the peg parser-generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser-generator dypgen

1774364
haskell	ocaml
also checkout this presentation on pcl a monadic parsing combinators libs for ocaml like parsec for haskell there s some good info in there comparing haskell s and ocaml s approach

1774364
haskell	ocaml
some will say that laziness gives haskell the edges in parsing but you can get laziness in ocaml as well

1774371
virtualbox	vmware	virtualization	virtualbox	virtualization	vmware
install the regular debian distribution perhaps inside a virtualization environment like vmware server or virtualbox

1774377
innodb	myisam
myisam insert are going to be faster than innodb .so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

1774378
push	pull
either force the other guy to use git or have the svn repository be the main one and use git-svn to pull push from to it

1774388
version-control	git
git is more flexible and powerful and might be a better option than using both types of version-control systemd in parallels

1774419
droppable	draggable
i see that you have droppable but where are the draggable

1774419
droppable	draggable
droppable accept draggable not just static html because really nothing is being dropped in that case

1774437
sql-server	oracle

animation	rotation
one way to work with this is to use an auxiliary variables for your math animation or whatever and then assign it to the rotation say

1774468
classnotfoundexception	classpath
this just means that the particular class is missing in the runtime classpath while it was available in the compile-time classpath that s the difference with classnotfoundexception

1774469
private-key	rsa
rsa private-keys may be assign a passphrase which - as i understand it - is intended to provide some secondary security in case someone makes off with the private-key file

3des	rsa	3des	des	des	rsa
the passphrase is just a key used to encrypt the file that contains the rsa key using a symmetric cypher usually des or 3des

1774552
private-key	rsa
a good rsa private-key is too long to remember for me anyway but far smaller symmetric key can provide the same level of security

1774566
hide	show
additionally you could hide or show these side notes without changing the layout

1774573
contains	any
during per-processing any reference to this constants value btw by conventions such constantss are named with all_caps_and_underscores is replace by the actual cstring literals contains the email-address

1774689
constructor	object
sure i can factors out that code to a separate methods but i don t like the idea that every time i use that object i need to remember to execute a certain methods which is essential to that object s function that s what the constructor is for

1774695
header-only	boost	header-only	bjam
if you get the boost libs from the official source distribution make sure you building the binaries using bjam a lot of the boost libs are header-only and don t required you to do this

background-color	width	background-color	height
if you mention explicit value for width and height instead of percentage you can see the background-color even if it doesn t have any children

1774833
lexical-scope	let
let has lexical-scope .so its binding are only visible within the let form itself not in functions called from within the let

1774833
macros	let
accessing the value of plain old x will give you whatever is at the top of stack of binding either the most nested let -bound value of x or the function paramater called x or some value x is replace with if you use your own macros or other possibilities. and only uses the current value of the toplevel variables x by default if there is no other binding in-place

1774857
value	field
based on my understanding of how things work this should assign the value of the secure text in user-input to useroutput thereby updating what is display in the nstextfield and then reset the field

1774888
http	ssl
out of curiosity what s wrong with using ssl http and encrypting at the server side

1774899
ftp	ssh
i need to design a set of utility classes that will ease out filesystems access to several types of remote service local ftp webdav svn ssh and i cannot seem to get a perfect design mostly because of a language barrier - i feel that every design path i have chosen was scraper because php did not have support for a specific feature

1774899
abstract-class	subclassing
a file is also based on an abstract-class or interface file and directory which the implementors of a filesystems subclassing may or may not subclassing

in the viewmodel there is a public properties of datatype account and in the ctor of the viewmodel a wcf service methods is called asynchronously and in the callback methods the account properties is set

1774911
abstract	extends
how would you design a api class which can be subclassing in an application without losing the possibility to extends the api with not abstract virtual methods in a new versioning of the dll while staying backward binary compatible

1774916
attributes	properties
for example the intellisense engine in visual-studio uses this attributes to determine whether to show a properties or methods

1774921
flash-builder	air
normally flash-builder only allows you to use the debugger from a flex air application not a library-project

1774921
buildpath	libs

1774993
versioning	upgrade
i do not recommend using the symlink trick advocated by some bloggers for instances here as this can end up contaminating the apple-supplied python and complicating support of multiple python versioning .when you want to upgrade to python 2.6 and or 3.1

1774994
key-value	key
the key issues to solve with the generics schema are join between logical entities and the trouble of pulling together data that belongs to a single entity .when it s split out into key-value pairs in a table

1774997
memcached	apc
also always use an opcode-cache like apc and use it for caching configuration files memcached is also fine

1775036
udp	tcp
a client can send tcp and udp messages using a socket for example

1775039
device-driver	hardware
yours being arm962ej-s but most on-chip peripherals and supports hardware including clocks plls and interrupt controllers are vendor specific you you would have to ports your hardware initialisation and device-driver code and make sure that you choose a device with a comparable peripherals set to the ones your current code uses

inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the use of existing interfaces will also allow more proper integration with other already existing .net technologies such as wpf which bind against the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged interfaces.

1775295
triggers	insert
the first sets the list item numbers from the list table prior to insert whilst the second increment the counter in the list table after it has been successfully insert i heard that modifying other tables before insert had some undesirable consequences with mysql if the transactional failed - as the before triggers would not be undone

1775308
buffering	capture
finally draw your capture back buffering using a spritebatch .when your game is paused in your draw methods

1775310

checkbox	button
it works meaning that if the checkbox is not checked and i try to push the button nothing happens

1775431
callback	methods
then you must need to provide a way to put a pointers to a methods matching this signature into the dll provide a callback methods

1775439
arrays	loops
since the numbers of congruent arrayss is four if you take the naive approach of doing one arrays per thread below not only will you suffer from having poor memory-access but also the h w will need to checked on each iterator which threads in the warp need to execute loops - those that don t will be disabled which can be inefficient especially if one arrays is much longer than the others for example

1775451
ubuntu	linux
i m running jdk 6 from sun on ubuntu linux

getter	setter
setter and getter are just properties that act like functions but there is no way to emulate the syntax correctly

1775754
getter	setter
i had a half-way concept of emulation getter and setter on html elements in ie7 using behavior but even that turned out to be more difficult than i first imagined it would

1775754
getter	setter
even ie8 only supports getter setter on dom object and not jscript object .so i think it s .something the jscript team need to include if they ever do

1775754
getter	setter
if only someone had thought to include setter and getter in the original jscript ecmascript implementation

value	field
in situations where you ve got field of logically smaller sizes short or byte field the clr chooses how to lay out the object in memory such that value which required memory-alignment being on a word-boundary are laid out appropriately but possibly backing other ones - .so 4 byte field could end up taking 4 bytes or they could take 16 if the clr decides to align each of them separately

1776546
revision	svn
alternatively if you use a revision control systemd such as svn you could use a commit hook to kick off a building test cycle .when you commit a file

1776555
carbon	cocoa	click	mouse

jsonp	ajax
i am using the jsonp variant and that piece works - pulling ajax request from a different ip-address or ports is no problem in and of itself

1776819
firefox	opera
this behavior only happens in firefox 3 and opera 9.63

1776820
margins	padding	floating	padding	floating	margins
i ve tried everything i could think of floating both divs changing width and margins padding to account for ie box model but to no avail

1776829
attributes	properties
they depict some properties that the different diagram elements attributes for example are supposed to have .when translation into java code

1776845
h.264	mp4
mp4 h.264

1776845
google-chrome	firefox
numbers 1 gets you firefox 3.5 and google-chrome

1776845
firefox	opera
numbers 3 gets you ie firefox â 3 and opera

1776872
continuum	hudson
there is also project continouslava - notification tool for integration servers continuum and cruisecontrol.net - maybe in future for hudson

1776875
contains	elements	contains	any
in standards compliant browsers however the div doesn t have any height as it only contains floating elements .so it s not a problem that the right content ends up below it

1776881
python	java
as well as the languages you have already mentioned java c# and python are probably the most common in use today

1776917
cursor	row
if you declare the cursor as being dynamic it should see any changes made to a row .when you enter and fetch that row

1776918
copy-constructor	constructor
for iterator the additional constructor will replace default copy-constructor in my case it was equivalent to default copy-constructor

1776919
udp	tcp
on the other hand if you plan to use tcp udp for ipc it will be much easier for you because firefox provides socket service that you can use easily from javascript component

1776923
settings.settings	app-config
this approach allows you to use the ide support for settings.settings file removing the need to generator a custom setting class or messing with app-config

1776923
display	width
due to visual-studio not display user classes in the available data typess for a user setting you need to do a one time workaround that consists of opening the settings.settings file with the xml editor right-click and open width and manually specify the types of the user setting as the full named of mystringdictionary

1776924
expression	evaluation
delayed evaluation of all those expression is probably not helping you

1776946
variables	boolean
boolean variables should be used only for boolean-logic

1776946
variables	boolean
boolean variables are used to store data that can only take on two possible value

1776946
variables	boolean
in these cases using boolean variables leads to confusing code that can often be prevented by using enumerations

1776946
variables	boolean
knowing that the only types of vehicles sold are cars and trucks he correctly identifies that he can use a boolean variables inside a vehicle class to indicate whether the vehicle is a car or a truck

1776946
variables	boolean
istruck is a boolean variables .so it can hold only two states

1776946
variables	boolean
but using boolean variables in the first place made his code less flexible and harder to modify to satisfy unknown future requirements less future-proof

1776946
variables	boolean
using a boolean variables was ultimately a premature-optimization

1776946
enumerator	any
use an enumerator if there are any possible conditional in which more than two states will be required in the future even if a boolean would satisfy existing requirements

1776948
stderr	stdout
i m curious if i can toggle between printing to stdout or stderr based on some value or inline expression without using an if-statement

1776968
authentication	login
in my facebook connect login done view i authentication to facebook with the facebook connect cookies by passing the request variables to request.facebook.check_session

1776976
python	ruby	python	c++
haml is the only language i know of c++ ruby python html etc. that tries to impose such restrictions

1776979
common-lisp	lisp
for a language s awareness of code there s no better i ve seen than lisp and its macros facility -- specifically common-lisp

1776986
configuration	environment
handling multiple environment configuration with .net 2.0

1776986
environment	building
than during the building of your project you copy the right external file according to your environment

1776994
any	set
it also has a methods options which should return a 200 response with the header allow set to the methodss which any subclassing implements.

1777008
display	width
the points is if you want to display the indentation as 4 8 or pi 12 character width just change the settings in your text-editor don t mess with the code

1777010
webserver	upload
you can still have scripting that checked for updates to a particular tag and upload them to the webserver

1777011
functional-programming	imperative
i suggest that many functional-programming languages like lisp have short simple grammars but i am interested in a more popular simple imperative language like c or bash

1777018
curly-braces	parentheses
it only takes into account the parentheses and not the curly-braces but those can be easily added

1777025
buffering	streaming
for small streaming buffering it in-memory as either a or a memorystream

1777045
web-config	app-config
they are mostly meant to read asp.net apps web-config and windows apps app-config and making them work with something else is really pointless

1777050
rollback	commit
you ll get much advice here on different architectures but i can say that the zend-framework and the use of doctrine make this fairy easy since zend provides much of the asp.net-mvc architecture and session management and doctrine provides the basic crud create retrieve updates delete you are looking for - plus all of the other aspects uniqueness commit rollback etc

1777059
configuration	installation
no big setup programs no configuration that one has to take care of no registry that gets polluted programs are simply copy-paste to the application folder or some other place for installation and get deleted for deinstallation

1777059
configuration	installation
the whole time he was able to do his work he didn t have to go through the whole installation and configuration process etc

1777059
unix	bsd
and for us programmers once you figure out that the console is hidden under applications tools you have a command-line-interface to a bsd unix

1777060
gnome	kde
this article reviews various open source utilities available for the gnome and kde desktops

1777070
firefox	safari
here is what it looks like in safari and here is what it looks like in firefox

1777071
data-structures	map
the transitions step would probably be o log |s|+|âˆ | given the performance of most map data-structures

1777071
arrays	map
if symbols are represented as int char s the transitions function could be represented as a map from strings to an arrays of strings giving o log |s| performance

1777098
concurrent-programming	java.util.concurrent
maybe have a look at the examples in the online supplement of concurrent-programming in java design-principles and patterns by doug lea which is the book on threads and concurrent-programming but it doesn t cover the new java.util.concurrent

1777104
uipagecontrol	uiview
basically uipagecontrol has an _indicators arrays that contains uiview for each of the dots

1777132
contains	set
i have a treeview contains a set of treeviewitem - each treeview is pretty simple just some text plus an image - the images are usually folder files icons

1777132
highlight	selected
of course the problem then is that .when draw and then selected by the user the unsightly white pixels of the image background get display instead of being clear and blend with the highlight creating a rather amateur look

1777132
contains	set
it s been a few years since i ve done heavy windows gui programming but i recall in win32 mfc there used to be a single handy value that you could set which contains the color that should not be rendering for an image preventing this problem

1777135
contains	elements	contains	set
yes you can set elements in an arrays to null but code like will fail with a nullpointerexception if the arrays containss nulls .so you just have to be more careful if you know that your arrays may contains nulls

1777144
contains	elements	contains	any
no an arrays elements containss a null is still there it just doesn t contains any useful value

1777154
duplicates	elements
can i set the the duplicates elements to null to remove it

1777158
object-reference	instances
my application is throw an exception-handling on the call to the creation of a new transactionscope with object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1777158
object-reference	instances
about to associate call data with contracts gets written to the log and the next log entry is the object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1777159
keyboard	mouse
if you are really paranoid you could code an on-screen keyboard that input through the mouse for your application very similar to what ing direct has for pin input

1777165
jquery	dojo	dojo	dwr
i haven t tried dwr yet but have used dojo and jquery both and on websphere-commerce

1777165
jquery	dojo	dojo	dwr
since you are already familiar with dwr i would suggest you to go with that instead of using dojo which i feel is cumbersome compared to jquery

1777186
callback	methods
here is an example of registering the callback from an object of types myobjcclass see the -registermatching methods below and then using the context pointers to route the callback back to the object that registered the callback for handling see the handle_devicematchingcallback function s use of the context pointers

1777201
stderr	stdout
as peter hosey points out it s likely that the child process writing to stderr rather than stdout

1777201
stderr	stdout
since stdout and stderr are both inherited by child process if you set the stderr of the task you launchd to a pipe you re aware of its child process should write to that pipe

1777201
stderr	stdout
alternatively you can change the perl scripting to redirect the child process stderr to stdout

1777208
preserve	copying
your problem is analogous to the streaming process program uniq preserve -- by way of copying -- any elements that doesn t match the one before it

1777208
duplicates	sorted
it only removes all duplicates if the sequences is sorted

1777221
httpwebrequest	webclient
i ve previously used a cookiecontainer with httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse sessions but now i want to use it with a webclient

1777234
versioning	upgrade
these formatter are sensitive to versioning changes even in the assembly versioning .so if you deserialize with one versioning of the framework upgrade the framework then it might not deserialize not sure but there are ways around this with the binder properties if this becomes a problem

1777246
httpwebrequest	webclient
before i knew about this option i wrote lots of really painful code at the httpwebrequest layer because webclient almost but not quite did what i needed

1777255
duplicates	elements
to do this add a templates that matches the elements that you want to updates and duplicates it

1777261
updating	updates
i have had a huge amount of success being able to updates server functionality without updating the client

1777263
32-bit	64bit
mongodb is a document-database that has prebuilt binaries for 32-bit and 64bit windows

1777263
put	get
get put .post have worked very well for me

1777272
python	php	declarative	imperative
it s a declarative paradigms rather than an imperative one like in c php or python

1777277
value	field
.when accessing the database through asp.net it will expose the field as a boolean value

1777299
np-complete	sat
for example you can easily write a sat solver in prolog and that problem is np-complete

1777350
json	xml
personally i believe that using application xml and application json are one of the worst choices you can make if you hoping to support rest clients

1777352
value	field
you could remove the uses field and make the id columns nullable and let a null value mean that it doesn t use the feature

1777354
xsl-fo	xslt
use an xslt stylesheet to convert the xml or xhtml into xsl-fo

1777355
value	field
why not get rid of the two use field and simply let a null value in the _id field indicate that the recording does not use that application bug-tracking or database

1777383
profiling	debugging
my dev env is setup xcode has just two profiling iphone device 3.1.2 base sdk and iphone simulator 3.1.2 either one with release and debugging

1777408
nlb	iis
basically we have two servers on our nlb 10.0.51.51 and 10.0.51.52 and two ips assign to our nlb 10.0.51.2 and 10.0.51.4 and we have iis listening on both of these ips with a different wildcard certificates to avoid giving out public ip s let s say a 443 routes to 10.0.51.2 443 and b 443 routes to 10.0.51.4 443

1777440
contentcontrol	textblock
i know that wpf contentcontrol does this accepts both strings and other elements and i know that it has something to do with typeconverter attributes partially explained here but i tried to look at contentcontrol labels textblock and other controls in reflector and didn t find any typeconverter attributess there and googling didn t help

1777448
postgresql	mysql
mysql s totally non standards compliant grouping by can be emulated by postgresql distinct on

1777448
postgresql	mysql
ruby-on-rails is married to mysql .so i m not surprised that it generator sql that doesn t work in postgresql

1777457
httpmodule	isapi
this means that if you want it for everything you have to add an isapi filtering to bind all files to be handled by .net which comes with overheads and can cause some unexpected behavior if you have any global handler or httpmodule defined

1777458
defined	declare
in short you have to defined declare print_foo before invoking or your compiler will flag an error

1777478
execution	jobs
having a single instances execution jobs is not a problem but i still need all of the webserver to be able to scheduling jobs

1777481
.when	ready
with git you have the possibility of cloning the repo off the the key and just pushing to the key .when you re ready to move your data to the office

1777486
callback	methods
i can declare a c++ methods as a function pointers but this is a callback methods .so that c++ methods would need to be part of the class .so that it can access the instances field

1777492
logout	login
my co worker also developed an application with user login logout and he did the same thing

1777496
canvas	scale
the problem comes for the containers types you have used and the complexity of the xaml it has produced the canvas is absolute positioning and shouldn t be used for scale really

1777498
getter	setter
you can add special properties in your viewmodel that will set value of your mutable properties in its setter and return needed value using all three your properties in its getter

1777520
arrays	loops
vectorisation in matlab often means allocation a lot more memory making a much larger arrays to avoid loops eg by tony s trick

1777526
unsigned	short
data types unsigned short int

1777532
contains	set
for instances i am looking for a database contains tv related information with a set of channels with their logos and perhaps the show that are being aired on these channels

1777543
fseek	lseek
if the program checked the return-value of fseek or lseek as it should the program will likely return an error

1777563
firefox	safari
i ve got an elements an image defined as instrumentation in css and for the life of me i cannot get it to properly display a png with transparency in ie7 or ie8 -- works fine in safari and firefox

1777571
duplicates	contains
on the other hand if you re talking about a real arrays and you want to filtering duplicates out of this without help of the great collections framework then you d need to create another arrays and add items one by one to it while you checked if the arrays doesn t already contains the to-be-added item

1777577
constructor	object
just remember that each time you refresh you will be firing the constructor of each object stored in the session variables

1777627
sql-server	oracle
i added the coalesce to handle .when an article has no comments - it s safe in both oracle and sql-server though you didn t mention which you are using

1777627
sql-server	oracle
to my knowledge it could only be sql-server oracle or db2 because of the with clause

1777644
selection	cell
based on the selection in the combo box i then overwrite the cell in the 2nd column with a new cell of that types

1777650
.net	wcf
windows communication foundation wcf is the recommended way for two .net process to communication with each other

1777659
display	height
height will not work on any block which has display inline

1777689
innodb	myisam
i carried out a test insert 1300 recording but showed the same result with innodb for transactional and myisam

1777703
arrays	loops
this worked fine and i thought of using arrays .so that i can form a loops use this scripting to checked multiple-processes

1777717
pointers	stack
i would expect it to first allocate the std auto_ptr on stack something that i guess couldn t ever throw an exception-handling and let it acquire ownership over the pointers

1777724
click	mouse
however as the elements is rotated there is less surface area for the mouse to click on

1777734
instances	destroy
in the case things go wrong all boost shared_ptr instances would be destroy and you would still end up with no leak

1777735
linked-list	arrays
from the above it doesn t mention what kind of backing data structure is used for the list -- for all we know it may be an arrays or a linked-list

1777741
arrays	loops
we use a table of nibbles here to reduce the numbers of time loops is run -- if you re doing a boatload of these computations it might be more efficient to building a much bigger arrays say at the byte level cutting loops runs in half

1777752
python	c++
after one of my last questions about python c++ integration i was told to use dlls at windows

1777770
pointers	stack
in c++ a types class or struct lives on stack by default and only lives on the heap if you declare it as a pointers and new it up

1777773
htmlcollection	nodelist
the ecmascript third edition standards goes out of its way to say this is ok to do for the arguments array-like but not that you may also do it on other array-likes that may be hosts object such as nodelist or htmlcollection

1777779
removeclass	addclass
take a look at the jq .lib uncompressed copy the code for addclass removeclass and attr

1777794
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i have an .app that uses the sphinx search-engine and the thinking-sphinx gem

1777796
oracle	mysql
i don t know if this will help for mysql but for large-scale oracle systemd i was involved with in a previous job the insert updates were done in batch-file of 100 s or 1000 s to maximize throughput

1777804
value	field
you might also try mysql_fetch_array or mysql_fetch_row but i find associativity arrays quite nice as they allow you to access their value by the field named as in mike s example

1777813
cross-join	inner-join
given that an inner-join is just a cross-join with a filtering conditional do you guys think that this is an inconsistency in oracle s sql implementation

1777813
cross-join	inner-join
having the cross-join keyword in addition to allowing inner-join without a join conditional would be fine

1777813
cross-join	inner-join
a cross-join is in fact an inner-join without a join conditional why not express it as an inner-join without the join conditional

1777817
g++	gcc
compile your object with g++ compiler instead it will link to standards c++ libs gcc does not

1777831
scheme	let
if you assume that î is bound to lambda and let cc is defined as they are in plt scheme

1777857
contains	elements
1 we readily have an arrays contains say n elements

1777868
webrequest	webclient
edit you may also want to use the webclient or webrequest classes to downloading the webpage

1777872
gentoo	linux
the server is running gentoo linux with apache and i have full root access

1777896
environment	building
selected the building tab in it.this will the building and environment related properties of your project

1777910
versioning	upgrade
after i upgrade from drivers versioning 192 to 195 beta the problem went away

1777935
keyboard	mouse	display	outline
for anchor links i want to removes the dotted focus outline for mouse events but want to display them .when for keyboard tabbed navigation

1777935
keyboard	mouse	display	outline
but remember i want to remove dotted focus outline only for mouse events but want to display them .when user use keyboard tabbed navigation

1777940
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
but in touchesmoved can i get all the coordinates of the touch from touchesbegan to touchesended

1777961
click	mouse
will must likely to apply .when it s a mouse click

1777984
order	add
here s a solution using variables - just add your order by clause and you should be set

1777986
keyboard	mouse
you can find used mac mini s for cheap and use an existing monitor and usb keyboard mouse

1777989
youtube	flickr
this is the technique sites like flickr and youtube use to do media transcoding asynchronously

1777989
scala	java
you can use a java ee server or a jms technology like apache s activemq and then layer your scala lift code on top of it

1777989
daemons	systemd
.so we queue those tasks into a messaging systemd and have back-end daemons handle them

1778000
malloc	free
since the error occurs .when draining the pool i might be suspicious that you ve already deallocated the object by that points and the object is over-released although generally you ll get a malloc double free error for this or perhaps the memory has already been overwrite by something else

1778039
controllers	routes
since the controllers is no longer in the url of your route aka you don t have controllers in the route url but it s a default-value you need to make sure to specify the controllers .when generator routes

1778088
push	pull
specifically the new master branch points to skeleton master branch and i can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup

1778092
perl-module	lwp
.when using the perl-module lwp simple is there a simple way to determine the speed and amount downloading by a single getstore invocation

1778097
directory	folder
one way to get around your problem is to add your local folder the unzipped versioning in the current directory to the beginning of pythonpath .so that python will find it first

1778132
getter	setter
use getter and setter and make the properties private

1778136
arrays	loops
loops through the caching arrays 10 time and printing

1778140
contains	any
first of all in that example data you listed it appears that there aren t any line which contains clown and 112

1778202
exception-handling	try-catch
you need a try-catch throwable o ... â in your main routine .so any unexpected exception-handling can be caught logged and the user told

1778214
stderr	stdout
you have to use a normals compiler and redirect the stdout and stderr to your website

1778218
32-bit	64bit
i m looking for a c++ libs that can parsing 32-bit and 64bit mach-o binary format

1778236
itemtemplate	gridview
imagine for example a gridview with a itemtemplate and edititemtemplate

1778243
json	xml
partials html formatted as json xml or straight up html

1778244
nsmutablestring	nsscanner	nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsscanner	nsstring
besides this you might want to look at the documentation of nsstring nsmutablestring and nsscanner

1778258
python	java
it looks like you might be more familiar with a language such as java or python that doesn t have an explicit pointers syntax

1778259
windows-xp	windows-nt	windows-vista	windows-nt	windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
found solution after a lot of googling on microsoft.com on windows-server 2000 windows-xp 32-bit windows-server 2003 and windows-vista 32-bit run regedt32 which is located in the system32 subfolder of the windows-nt root folder

1778278
python	c++
one language i would like to see would borrow as much from the syntax of python as possible but compile to machine-code that runs as fast as c or c++

1778286
32-bit	64bit
one reason that this might happen is that you ve compiled a 32-bit dll and you re trying to run it on a 64bit os

1778289
jasper-reports	itext
take a look at jasper-reports it uses itext to export files i think and its ide is simple and can be used by non-programmers

1778294
communication	messages
i have an internal communication systemd that send them an email .when they get a private messages

internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i would doubt firefox internet-explorer safari opera or any other browser is going to allow you to do this

1778313
denied	temp
also the temp path is normally denied access from the web

1778313
wamp	php
it sort of sounds like you are trying to use wamp and php as a local file utility of some sort

1778330
google-chrome	firefox
and it seems to function differently on google-chrome and firefox

1778343
nsmutablestring	nsscanner
in xcode press cmd-shift-d and search for nsstring.h nsmutablestring and or nsscanner

1778345
selected	button
if you set the uisegmentedcontrol to be momentary you can selected a button more than once

1778345
subclassing	inherited
otherwise you should probably subclassing the uisegmentedcontrol which inherited from the uiresponder and handle the extra touches yourself don t forget to call super in any touch methods you overrides

1778374
any	set
it seems like another weight object was created without any attributes but the id set

1778377
textbox	button
i then import the html files i did and started to replace input with asp textbox s and the button into an asp button really simple basic stuff but soon i click view in browser i got my code all scrambled

1778377
put	get
to try to get what s wrong i put the aspx file aside and open only the html page

1778377
cassini	iis
all 3 files above are the same page being run through 2 different servers cassini iis and the normals html rendering from firefox

1778381
repr	eval
note float repr 0.47000000000000003 or eval repr 0.47000000000000003 will give you the expected result but you should use decimal if you need precision

1778390
required	checked
i am working on a web .app that required me to checked if the users email are valid and exists

1778393
text-editor	editor
as you know most of rich text-editor use iframe to create wysiwyg editor

1778427
administration	account
it sounds like the authentication problems you re having are related to google-.apps if you have an .app engine .app that allows any google-account to authentication and you have a google-.apps account as administration you won t be able to authentication against your .app as an administration with it even if you have created a google-account for that email-address

having come across a numbers of idiosyncracies .when using mysql for olap are there reasons in favour of using postgresql instead assuming that i want to go the open source route

1778684
contains	set
it s also a character set specifications which contains rarely-used kanji- characters

1778685
tokenize	parsing
as far as potential problems one that comes to mind is that since you re tricking phpdocumentor into parsing the docblock and the javascript code you re implicit count on the php tokenize which is how phpdocumentor parsing php code internally to successfully read your javascript code and treat it as php code

1778706
value	field
but still all the controls are in edit mode only actaully once we give click then updates then i should again gone to readonly mode means all the value should again be showing in labels field

1778802

i would recommend using iterm - it has .so many advantages over terminal eg mouse support 256 colors sensible copy and paste auto-copy words url selection with double click middle click paste .

1778834
matplotlib	networkx
i recommend networkx www.networkx.lanl.gov to building your graphing structure and which you can then use to call the relevant matplotlib methods to plot

1778834
matplotlib	networkx
networkx and matplotlib work very well together

1778839

the singularity os include a bartok compiler that the os uses inorder to translation a managed program to a native one x86 32-bit

1778880
panels	grid	any	set
canvas is designed for manually controlling size and positioning on grid you can set the margins - but there is no way to control the positioning on stackpanels wrappanels or dockpanels or the radial panels you can find in almost any wpf sample collections

1778881
highlight	selected
.when i selected a row in the tableview it selecteded correctly blue highlight show 100 correctly

1778881
highlight	selected
the problem i m having is that the animation is really flickery and the row that was selected doesn t even get highlight before the animation starts

1778881
highlight	cell
i ve done this before but never with custom cell and i know that the procedure should be as follows row highlight detail view animates in edit details detail view animates out row gets deselected

1778900
pascal	delphi
it s not really a comparison for cpp and delphi pascal but you ll find a lot of information

1778908
hash	md5
md5 isn t an encryption methods it s a one way hash

1778909
hash	md5
md5 is an hash which makes it allmost inpossible to get the original value back

1778910
hash	md5
if you intend to decrypt them later md5 won t be an option since it only hash strings you lose the original data

1778913
hash	md5	salt	md5
however you should always encrypt hash passwd with at least md5 and a salt as pointed out in ivan s reply

1778916
hash	md5
just be aware that basic md5 hashing is no longer a secure hash

1778916
hash	md5
i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hash all over these days .so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing

1778916
salt	md5
there may be special hoops that you can jump through like both using a salt and performing nested md5 hashings to make it more secure though i m no cryptographer

1778923
object-reference	instances
if i using the following code i will get the same err object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1778946
versioning	upgrade
i ended up using a more complex way to do upgrade by reading the raw xml from the user settings file then run a series of upgrade routines that refactor the data to the way it s supposed to be in the new next versioning

1778954
contains	elements
this worked well for tags that contains inner text or child elements but it didn t work well for tags that stood alone the br tag

1778956
implements	final
this allows the base-class to implements types-safe code that needs to know the final closed generics types

1778962
display	height
you re going to have alter the height of the tableview cell depending on how many line of data you want to display in each row

1778962
font-size	height
calculating the row height will prove tricky if the numbers of line of text changes each time or if the font-size changes

1778964
tree	trie	prefix-tree	trie
a trie is an uncompressed prefix-tree a tree in which the paths from root to leaf nodes correspond to all the prefixes of a given string

1779034
any	set
does anyone have any set of known best practices for dealing with error domains and codes

1779036
pygtk	pyqt
as i found pygtk have better documentation then pyqt

1779036
pygtk	pyqt
it will take the same time to write a program on pyqt and pygtk

1779044
comma	words
i am not sure how you are separating your input text into separate words .so you might need to change the delimiter from a comma or do a little more code to building the comma delimited string but once built the join and where-clause above should do the trick.

1779076
python	c++
i m not sure if swig can pull this off since it required a bidirectional understanding of inherited - python class uses c++ class as base and c++ code recognizes the inherited relationship

1779095
value	field
i have a mysql field text which contains the value of a textarea

1779128
implements	abstract
you need to remove abstract and implements the equals methods as well

1779136
ruby-on-rails	grails
the case that you re describing would appear to be in the sweet spot of grails or ruby-on-rails or something analogous from microsoft

1779145
put	get
i want to get all value in one of the columns of a datagrid and put them in an arrays to use it as a dataprovider of a combobox is this possible

1779147

if a variadic-functions incorrectly interpreter the arguments passed to it the c standards specifies that the behavior is undefined that is anything can happen c89 standards para 4.8.1.2

1779151
json	xml
on the server before you return your data as xml json whatever try setting dbnull value equals to a blank string

1779165
value	field
it will allow you to easily add more recording field later on and you can put arbitrarily complex code in the getter that return the value

1779188
unmanaged	c++-cli
compile the unmanaged code using c++-cli as managed assembly and reference it directly

1779190
templating	jinja2
djangos templating language doesn t give you a lot in the way of logic in the templates i ve heard positive things about jinja2 if you want to change that

1779221
nested-loops	arrays
.so if you iterate over the matrix in the usual way nested-loops over i and j then you can keep tracking of the diagonal in an arrays that is addressed in the above mentioned way

1779234
spring	jsf
spring has a lot of extra goodies like spring-test aop asp.net-mvc jsf integration etc

1779257
key-value	key
it might be easiest just to write one for each file and for each properties in that file put the properties key-value pair into a map but only after ensuring that the key is not already in the map

1779268
any	set
that said the main reason that you are likely to required synchronized over volatile is the requiredment for using atomicity compare and set operations it will not be any performance consideration

1779268
value	field
well if you have multiple threads modifying a field dependent on that field s value compare-and set then synchronized is the only safe solution

1779276
getter	setter
kdsrathore you can use some explicit locks or make some dummy object object new object on which you synchronized in setter getter of that double

1779280
contains	set
.when run from the desktop it contains the value gnome but .when run via dpkg from the command-line it isn t set .so .something like this might work

1779290
duplicates	contains
as it is franz solution will not work it returns triples of prople which speak the same language but these triples may contains duplicates

1779290
duplicates	contains
if the definition of the speak 2 predicates contains duplicates data then you should use setof 3 instead

1779292
base	zero
let us assume the matrix is n n stored in a vector row first zero base loops are exclusive to last elements

1779295
exception-handling	error-handling
of course the error-handling exception-handling is move to the end the catch block or is considered the responsability of the calling level

1779301
youtube	flickr
i m just thinking about how to create a generics file storing systemd like google-docs flickr youtube dropbox etc. something that you could reuse in different environment such as storing pubmed journal articles or cramster homework assignments and tests or just images like on flickr

1779306
spring	guice
spring encourages good oo design practices interfaces layer separation-of-concerns that benefit any problem they touch even if you decide to switching to guice or another di framework

1779307
bison	yacc
given that all cases are as simple as that it is possible defining your language either as internal dsl using a higher level programming language ruby or scala or as external dsl using code generator xtext mps or yacc and bison

1779317
postgresql	mysql
i have a lapp linux apache postgresqlql and php environment but the question is pretty the same both on postgresql or mysql

1779317
document	editing
people foo and bar are editing the document 0001 using a form with every document details

1779317
document	editing
people foo bar john mary paoul are editing the document 0001 using a form with every document details

1779317
updating	updates
i thought to use files creating for example an empty txt file for each document and everytime the document is updates i touch the file updating the last modified time as well.

1779317
document	editing
but i guess that this would be slower than db and give problems .when i have much users editing the same document

1779317
lighttpd	apache
long-polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css javascript etc.. and just for this types of long-polling

1779317
lighttpd	apache
apache will proxy-up all those request to lighttpd

1779340
double	int
my goal was to test the possibility of writing my versioning of int double string and other standards types

1779341
hash	md5
basically you first compute a sha-1 or md5 digest hash value from the contents of the file

1779350
python	java
hsqldb does this but unfortunately it s java rather than python

1779355
selected	listbox
but if on postback user selected an item in listbox ods2.select still doesnâ t return any results but if we replace ods2.select

1779355
selected	listbox
assuming user selected an item in a listbox -- it seems that .when we call ods2.selected ods2 for some reason can t bind to listbox1.selectededvalue and extraction a value from this properties

1779356
pointers	stack
by coincidence more or less pointers to float has the same size as float 32-bit on your platform .so stack is balanced after removing this arguments from it

1779363
void	main
incidentally main should be int not void and usually it returns the value zero unless there is an error

1779367
pecl	pear
this is slightly off topic but you can use the pear package or pecl package i forget which xdiff to send back good user guidance .when you do get a collision

1779368
elisp	lisp
one of the well-known tags in the templates is lisp - it purports to run arbitrary elisp code to generator content to insert-into the new buffering

1779369
abstract	extends
abstract or base classes are there to provide a base types which you can extends through inherited

1779370
selected	listbox
ods2 has a selected parameter which in your sample page load is bound to a listbox control that hasn t been databound

1779379
arguments	default
as to why it works at all because of the default arguments promotion of variables argumentss you ll actually pass a double with your first call

1779379
32-bit	64bit
as pointers on your systemd seem to be 32-bit the second call only overwrite the lower half of the 64bit floating-point value

1779387
implements	abstract
an abstract methods is one which a class doesn t implements making it an abstract-class

1779387
implements	abstract
.so formally you need to subclassing this and implements those two methods marked as abstract

1779391
void	main
it s int main not void main

1779407
any	set
i m looking for a web application either an existing website or a site which i can generator and set it up for myself or a greasemonkey scripting which lets me browse or any earlier versioning i specify in a more convenient way where i can search for a classname

1779407
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox install the .user.js file then visit but it s very hard to use in google-chrome because it doesn t work in the main frame only the all-classes subframe

1779411
crossover	mutation
once you have them you need to decide on a crossover and mutation strategy

1779427
rar	zip
i don t know if this is an option but gds can index index files within zip jar rar compressed archive using a third party plugins

paintcomponent	draw
it send its graphics object to lc which use it to draw shapes but whenever it draw something the paintcomponent event of statechartpanel happens again and it causes my application to hang

1779462
http-get	put	required	checked
.so servlet a can perform an http-get on a particular path to checked a status either sending back an object or checkeded an http response code - this latter methods seems a misuse of status codes however and put .post an object if required

1779476
arguments	default
the compiler just called every function with the types of the actual argumentss which received a set of default arguments promotions to simplify things

1779479
text-align	width
then i m creating a canvas to surround another component that goes inside this component and setting that canvas width to 100 and then setting text-align centering but no dice

1779500
formatting	printing
i never did find way to do much conditional formatting with the reportviewer control without it being dog slow .so i deligated it to use for printing the list only

1779500
formatting	printing
the default printing view had no conditional formatting and a full view printing will be rarely done and only by myself .so i can wait a minute or two

1779511
player	movie
.when i launchd the movie player the player comes up but just goes away after about 20 seconds

selected	button
you know those color-picker button with a little rectangle in it display the currently selected color

1779519
background-color	transparency
edit the icons using graphics software to have a solid background-color instead of transparency and resize it to be exactly as large as the button contains it

1779521
json	xml
is using json or xml a better option than an arrays for the dialog scripting

1779523
highlight	selected
but .when bring my mouse over it it doesn t give any colour highlight which means it is not selected

1779537
attributes	properties
the only way i can control the string-length in my database tables is by adding the subsonicstringlength or subsoniclongstring attributes to the properties of the object that need to be persistent

1779539
transformation	normals
after applying those transformation how can i calculate the normals untransformed rectangular bounding-box of this in screens coordinates

1779551
duplicates	elements
for example in the code below i tried to find if there is ant duplicates elements in each row of the two dimension list it works and every thing is content in same function but i am not satisfied with how code looks and i find it more imperative styles of approaching to the problem .so i am looking for any suggestion or thought on this from the experienced people out there

1779564
base-class	inherited
make the elements you want to put into the list all inherited from a common base-class

1779580
short	zero
this only works if the first operands is larger than zero but at least it s short and confusing

1779580
expression	evaluation
however i m not sure that the evaluation order is defined .so you might have to move the decrement outside the expression

1779582
copy-constructor	constructor
this is because you defined neighbor constructor manually and this disables compiler generator copy-constructor

1779591
search-engine	web-crawler
you ll also probably want a whitelist of search-engine web-crawler ip addreses which you allow into your search-engine-crawlable pages you can work with google bing yahoo etc

1779593
toggle	slider
for example here s a plugins that i use often - a very simple slider and fade toggle effect

1779603
activerecord	datamapper
activerecord datamapper

1779608
double	int
.so do you suggest that it is better to re-define add as add int double double

1779608
assign	add
is there any other way of passing making add 1 30 30 work other than casting 30 with float or assign like float x 30

1779615
duplicates	contains
though there are exception-handling in general you may want to defined positive functions in this case defined a function which returns true if the arguments does contains some duplicates data

1779618
double	int
the upsizing of int to float to double works but the problem is that you aren t passing variables to add .so inside add it can t change them

1779626
double	int
you can implicit cast an int to a float or double but you cannot implicit cast an to a

1779629
.when	ready
.when scala swarm becomes production ready you ll be ready for that too

1779637
development-environment	platform
it contains a very nice interactive development-environment and supports a variety of platform including the iphone

1779653
calayer	uiview
for your uiview s calayer the transform properties is a catransform3d struct

1779669
show	next
since oses often place stack well away from other structure .when ulimit is reached it is just possible that the os might be able to expand stack if .when the overflow occurs nothing else has show up next to stack

1779669
pointers	stack
in theory an application exhausting its stack might be able to start a new thread with a larger stack copy the existing stack and continue but as practical matter i doubt this can be done if for no other reason than pointers to local-variables stack will need adjusting and c++ compilers don t make it possible to find such pointers and adjust them

1779700
value	field
however now .when i go to my create page and choose a date and click save i get the error the value 22 11 2009 is not valid for the date field

arrays	map
inside generator remove the first digits from suffix map it to an arrays of corresponding letters and recursively call generator for each letter from the arrays append it to the prefix

1779890
methodology	paradigms
now as far as i know that s a paradigms and not a methodology

1779890
methodology	waterfall
if it is a methodology can someone please explain how it differs from agile or waterfall

1779897
multiplication	addition
you can get a somewhat unique one by converting the hex versioning to several int worth of data then combining them addition or multiplication

1779908
hash	md5
if you want to interpreter the md5 hash as a plain string you can try the fnv algorithm

1779923
bison	yacc
liby is part of yacc and some versioning of bison but is rarely actually needed it just defined default implementation of yyerror and a couple other things

1779941

1779946
plpython	plpgsql
what i know - people usually use a combinations of pl languages - sql plpgsql plperl or sql plpgsql plpython

1779949
append	input
you could use a flex eof rules to append a newline to the input

1779951
triggers	insert
you can accomplish this using a triggers a stored procedure that is run whenever a row in the applicationresources table is insert updates or deleted

1779970

python	ruby	getter	setter
but .when your language lets you switching from public variabless to properties and vice-versa without any incompatible change in the api such as c# ruby python ... it s silly to carry around total boilerplate .when the public accessor getter and setter do nothing except copying to and from a private variables -- even if you re certain your compiler can optimize them away such boilerplate accessor just bloat the source uselessly and waste an important design feature that s part of what makes such languages nice ones

1780562
key-value	key
the key would if this were a flat table view but this is an outline view and two dictionariesâ one a descendant sibling or cousin of the otherâ can have the same key. instead you should make a model object for each key-value pair

1782049
callback	methods
i have a scenario where upon receiving a cmd on one of the callback methods in client the client needs to call another service

1782049
callback	methods
in onnewcommand callback methods client receives a messages x

1782243
itextsharp	itext
maybe this helps it is about itext not itextsharp anyway

1782247
triggers	insert
in mysql you should be able to set a triggers on the insert operation on the login table that can do the second insert for you

asp.net-webpages	asp.net
rick strahl has a nice article on hosting asp.net-webpages within a winform .app using the asp.net runtime

1782333
value	field
on the plus side however the value are constants .so i only want to call the code that determines the actual value the first time that properties is accessed and then store the value in a class field and the next time that properties is accessed return the caching value directly

1782341
defined	declare
as s.c.madsen and int3 already posted you can declare static const in class scoping for any types as long as it is properly defined in the cpp file and initializer but it can t be a compile-time-constant

1782368
beautifulsoup	lxml
i suspect that it is choking on poorly formed html and i d like to try pre-parsing it with a parsing better designed to handle bad html say lxml or beautifulsoup and then feeding the prettified cleaned-up output to the form parsing

1782380
business-logic-layer	data-layer
your data-layer should probably be more than a set of semantic queries and you should encapsulate it in an api otherwise your business-logic-layer will have to know too much about the implementation of your data-layer

1782381
graphael	raphael
raphael which looks very interesting and also has a smaller brother graphael especially for graphing charts

1782385
contains	any
however since dtos are simply messages they don t contains any behavior

1782401

because all of the machines are in your domain you can put together a vbscript that will get the mac-address es from the local machine and store it as an attributes of the computer object in active-directory

1782412
pointers	stack
the arrays b is allocated with malloc the address for the storage is on the heap whereas the address for the pointers b is on stack

1782412
printf	scanf
that s why the first scanf and printf works but not the second

1782422
pointers	stack
in c arrayss are pointers to a memory block of the allocated types in your case and an expression like gets translation into which btw gives rise to the funny variant which will actually compile. this arrays is allocated on stack

1782422
pointers	stack
the second arrays is allocated on the heap and stack contains the pointers variables to that arrays

1782540
spring	grails
.so my .solution was to just include the libs s spring configuration with the grails context by adding an import to the grails-app conf spring re.sources.xml file

1782540
spring	grails
unfortunately the datasource defined in the libs s spring configuration is overloading the datasource defined in my grails datasource.groovy file

1782540
spring	grails
is there any way i can tell grails to load the libs s spring configurationuration first .so that it then gets overrides by the rest of grails configuration and thus using grails data.source

1782540
spring	grails
as a tenporary measure i ve removed the datasource entry in the dependancy s spring configuration file and its beans have been inject the datasource created by the grails configuration - this isn t ideal though as i ve had to make a special building of the dependancy jar

i m migrating from sql-server to firebird

1783297
emacs	vim
because someone already mentioned emacs of course there s vim with r plugins don t know how many of those there are but i found at least one with a quick google

1783297
emacs	vim
vim might have an even steeper learning curve than emacs though

1783297
emacs	vim
i think emacs and vim will both handle pretty much any language out there .so let the flame .war begin

1783303

administration	credentials
to mitigate this you have to use session_regenerate_id .when your users credentials changelog in and out goes in administration section etc.

1783394

instead of a login page for each language consider using localization - you can set up your sever controls labels etc. to show text in any language depending on the browser s cultureinfo i think it s cultureinfo meaning one page can display any language you care to set up

1783396
declarative-programming	logic-programming
functional-programming is a subset of declarative-programming which include logic-programming languages like prolog

1783396
functional-programming	imperative

if i m understanding your question right you re saying you re redirecting the standards output but you have to keep reading from that streaming to stop the process from blocking .when the buffering gets full

1783496
radio-button	textbox
well you can implements an onclientclick function with your radio-button like this or you can have a function to iterate through all the radio-buttons on your form and whichever is checked will fill the textbox with your value

1783690
filtering	grouping
its difficult to tell without looking at an execution plan but i think that whats happening is that sql-server is not clever enough to realise that the where-clause specified is filtering out the groupinging and does not have any effect on the recording include for each grouping

1783693
ruby-on-rails	django
if you are experienced with java and concerned about deploying django and ruby-on-rails apps i d recommend you give jruby a try

1783715
web-services	security	http	ssl
you can secure basic http web-services with ssl for security

1783752
lighttpd	apache
if you want to off load the polling request to a second server lighttpd in your case then it would be better to setup lightttpd in front of apache on a second physical machine and use a shared caching server memcaching .so that the lighttpd server can read the caching timestamps and apache can updates the caching timestamps

1783752
lighttpd	apache
the rationale for putting lighttpd in front of apache is if most request are polling request to avoid the heavier-weight apache process usage

1783768
web-services	soap-client	web-services	api
for php to consume .net web-services quickly you ll need to use php5 native soap-client api enabling caching to store wsdl locally

python	java
for instances twitter is a rails-based website and its service are consumed by multitude of various desktop and web-applications written in .net java python etc through its restful web-api

1783800
groovy	java
this is normals as both java and groovy both play on the jvm .so it is perfectly normals to call classes and methods from one another

1783802
instrumentation	profiling
the only good way to tell if there is any discernible difference in performance is to use profiling tools like instrumentation for measuring things like display frame-rate for the two techniques or shark to determine hotspots in your code

1783812
32-bit	64bit
the _w64 annotations is a note to the miscrosoft compiler that .when compiling for a 64bit target the variables should be 64bit wide instead of the usual 32 since on 64bit platform pointers are 64bit but unsigned int s are usually still 32-bit

1783818
value	field
then in the new subreport create a new field called _this exactly this means the bean in the collections passed is the same as the value i want

1783821
coalesce	isnull
both coalesce and isnull answers give in other answers are equally valid too for this particular case and simpler frankly

1783833
ubuntu	linux

1783839
checkbox	button
and sometimes after click on some button and checkbox in the grid more empty rows are added

1783854
revision	svn
but in svn the versioning is about the whole repository any modification to files are by means of atom-editor operation to the whole repository .so if the repository versioning is 342912 and a new file is created then that file has a start revision numbers of 342912 not 1 which is more intuitive

1783865
button	popup
the problem is then .when i click the button the browser brings up a popup asking for my username and passwd to the freshbooks service

1783869
if-statement	loops
if-statement for loops while loops and functions contains code .so don t need a trailing

1783887
dictionary	arrays
i have an arrays of dictionary items with 2 value

1783887
dictionary	arrays
i m not even sure if this is possible but can i pass this arrays into a function and return an object index based on a dictionary value

1783894
python	ruby
also consider checked out python and ruby as alternatives for web development

1783895
post-increment	pre-increment
also pre-increment can be faster than post-increment as there is no need for a copy of the variables for comparison - however optimisers can deal with this

1783901
contains	any
iow changing a properties value on one of the views is immediately reflected on any other view that also contains this properties

1783905
binary-compatibility	shared-libraries
prevents binary-compatibility of shared-libraries dlls

1783909
ruby-on-rails	django	web.py	django
as i said in my comments they re nowhere near as clean as proper web-frameworks django ruby-on-rails even web.py etc but they do work a lot better than just hacking away on your own

1783910
arrays	loops
of course it s possible just loops through the arrays until you find the thing you re looking for

1783921
coalesce	isnull
or in this situation you can use coalesce or isnull

1783925
ruby-on-rails	django
symfony is somewhat similar to ruby-on-rails django if that s what you re used to

1783939
revision	updates
the database can be brought up to the current revision level by running the updates database cmd

1783948
nsinteger	int
note the slight difference in the signature return-type nsinteger vs int

1783952
duplicates	elements
you could replace the elements with a duplicates that has no events and set your own on the new elements

1783959
constructor	object
call would return you a new user object without any issues since your constructor is-empty

1783969
localization	translation
we ve recently finished internationalizing a website and are ready to begin the im sure arduous task of localization translation

1783973
temporary	copy	git-filter-branch	git-repo
for a one-off solution i d take that annoying subfolder branch in my local git-repo s working copy branch off a temporary working branch tmp-subdir for safety and then use git-filter-branch on that working branch to move all its files into the proper place

1783978
database-performance	rdbms
it can be overwhelming to analyze database-performance with grid control and i would suggest starting with the simplier awr report - you can find the scripting to generator them in oracle_home rdbms admin on the db hosts

1783993
required	checked
if your application required a stable-sort your checked will have to be more careful

1783993
order	add
you might add a unique tag to each item being sorted just for testing purposes which the sort s comparison function doesn t test .when sorting but which can be used to ensure that two otherwise-equal value end up in the same relative order in the final output

1784009
parsing	comma
thus by changing the value of ifs you can for example parsing csv files by setting this to a comma

1784023
contains	elements
the arrays could contains anything between 1 elements day day day day day night night and over 20 000 elementss

1784033
constructor	object
setting them in the constructor of the object might make sense or using a wrapper repository object that could set them prior to passing along to the simplerepository could also work

1784044
weblogic	oc4j
weblogic websphere and oc4j consider

1784047
backslash	regex
provided that your blocks are not nested this regex would find a backslash after start-of-string or with no in between

1784054
for-loop	loops
if your for-loop is performance-critical and not doing heavy computation such that the index arithmetic actually matters you should almost certainly be restructuring your code to do more work in each pass of loops

1784061
python	ruby
i m not sure how other python or ruby apps stand up on this front

1784064
border-layout	gridbaglayout	springlayout	flowlayout
the flowlayout gridbaglayout and springlayout managers use the component s preferred size the latter two depending on the constraints you set but border-layout and gridlayout usually don t.if you specify new size hints for a component that s already visible you need to invoke the revalidate methods on it to make sure that its containment hierarchy is laid out again

1784070
any	set
by using the net.rim.device.api.ui.component.basiceditfield or subclassing or any widget that allows you to set a net.rim.device.api.ui.text.textfilter you can specify complex input semantics that will interpreter the key presses in context of the types of input you desire int numeric uppercase email url etc

1784102
custom-server-controls	user-controls
user-controls aren t meant to be reused across sites use custom-server-controls instead

1784102
custom-server-controls	ascx
if that doesn t work the link that he provided tells you to copy the ascx files anyway .so that wouldn t be what you were looking for try the above if not stick to custom-server-controls

1784133
scala	java
i have a scala representation of some xml a scala.xml.elem and i d like to use it with some of the standards java xml apis specifically schemafactory

1784135

the -e will put the project in myproject src but link it to myproject .lib pythonx.x site-packages .so any changes you make will get picked up immediately in modules that import it from your local site-packages

1784147
virtual-functions	base-class
to find out whether deriveda interact should do something with it s parameter you can implements another virtual-functions in your base-class

1784149

1784162
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting a fresh install of drupal 6.14 on a ubuntu 9.10 machine using xampp for linux

1784163
order	join
the join and where-clause will explode the tables try it with selected and skipping the grouping order clauses grouping by will flatten them to one row each and the sum s will do the relevant math

1784196
text-align	width
but that would mean wrapping everything in a containers elements and setting the width of that elements along with the text-align properties

1784203
for-loop	arrays
then just do a for-loop on that arrays

1784273
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception

object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1784297
environment	building
plugins can now be scoping using either the environment or predefined building scoping

1784303
constructor	object
my thought process if the properties are required to actually construct the object they should go in the constructor

1784303
constructor	object
system.missingmethodexception - no parameterless constructor defined for this object

1784311
any	set
if thats the problem then set the .when no data variables to printing all sections except detail and put your messages in any other band

1784321
look-and-feel	nimbus
while not the greatest solution for java the nimbus look-and-feel is a good alternative.

1784328
display	width
add an empty div to the page with padding 0 and display inline inline needed .so the width collapse

1784337
constructor	private
provide a parameterless constructor for the designer and make it private - if you really must do it this way.

1784337
constructor	private
the designer need to execute the code in initializecomponent and it s can t work if the constructor is private

1784346
punctuation	words
all in all since l is identically equivalent to list g it s hard to get very excited about the ability to express it via punctuation square brackets instead of round parentheses instead of a single short pronounceable and obvious words like list

1784369
contains	any
however i m concerned that this won t find all controls in the tree - any contentcontrol could also contains of a control of types as could headeredcontentcontrol or any other similar control with one or more child content attributes

1784369
contains	any
is there any means of execution a search against the actual layout tree .so that any instances of a specific types of control contains without a specific parent can be found

1784376
export	csv
and export them to a csv file which is all userport needs

1784389
arrays	map
.so you can use an arrays as a key-value map but it s really not the correct structure for that

1784392
any	set
12 00 50 234 the web service was actually able to open the wait handle call set on it without any exception-handling throw etc

1784395
simulator	platform
simulator building are compiled for the intel platform since your computer is on the x86 or x86_64 architecture

1784401
callback	methods
if possible defined your callback methods to be â œonewayâ and or make a none blocking call to them â œbegin_m1 ... â

1784414
value	field
my solution which feels completely insane is to add an is_published field to the model that required upload and .when you get to the create page to instantly create it with all blank value except and then i have an id i can pass to the uploader

1784415
fadeout	fadein
this starts the fadein before the fadeout is done

1784425
value	field
to get around this you must use the bes management console to change the value of the maximum numbers of kilobytes per connection field to a higher value up to 1024k

1784425
configuration	installation
edit the mds configuration rimpublic.properties file in your jde installation directory and change the value of the ippp.connection.maxnumberofkbytestosend properties to match the bes setting and then restart the simulator

1784427
multiplying	addition
if you know beforehand that you will have overflow then you can scale their amplitudes prior to addition - simply multiplying by a floating-point value between 0 and 1 again keeping in mind the issue of precision perhaps converting to a larger data types first

1784457
perl	php
i ve the task to convert a crypt function someone made in perl into php code

1784457
perl	php
but .when i have something like 2010-01-01t00 00 00.000 the perl versioning works without any error and the php versioning printing php warning pack types h illegal hex digits

1784478
contains	elements
each tuples contains 4 elements

1784489
32-bit	x86
if you re building with the platform set to x86 your 32-bit dll should work fine

1784489
deployment	install
if you embed a manifest in the dll it should be able to properly resolve the correct c runtime and load it provided the correct runtime is install on the deployment machine.

1784502
triggers	insert
by using a before insert triggers you could get something similar to what you get by using an autoinc in sql-server

1784508
jquery-dialog	jquery
is there a way to load jquery wysiwyg plugins inside a jquery-dialog box

1784519
controllers	routes
ruby-on-rails routes are used to route some urls to one controllers and one action

1784533
gzip	zip
it is a command-line tool to scheduling in schedulingd-tasks in windows and backs up to gzip zip specifically zip64 due to the 4gb limitation with regular zip files or bzip2 files

1784539
datagrid	textbox
i m looking to create a free-type textbox which onkeyout filtering a datagrid below

1784543
stdin	pipe
pandoc can read from stdin write to stdout or pipe right into a file

1784549
contains	elements
if every tuples contains 4 elements then frankly i think you d be better off assign them to individual variables manipulating those and then building your tuples

1784568
defined	declare
inorder for you to use a variables defined in your implementation you don t have to declare it a properties and synthesize it

1784570
udp	tcp
i used to have the same exact application but instead of udp it was tcp based

1784571
handler	service
i get following exception-handling in my result completed event handler the event is raised from within the web service wrapper class

1784572
push	pull
they re having you pull commit over http and push them via ssh

1784574
python	perl
first if you are going to ignore the fact that the input is xml then there is no need for perl or python or gawk or any other language

1784581
publishing	enterprise
i am using sharepoint 2007 enterprise + publishing portal templates + windows-server 2008

1784581
authentication	login
.when an anonymous access a page which needs authentication by the default behavior the login page will be redirected

1784595
macros	vba
i would create a vba macros that loops through each row and output the data to another page

1784603
messagebox	alert
.when i click the button of alert messagebox showing hello postback occurs

1784608
children	nodes
you can also use to great effect to set up a default rules like copy everything or process children but do not generator output and then add ruless for specific nodess you need to process in a special way - thus you do not need to write explicit loops comprehensions for each nodes level in the document as you often do in l2x

1784625
filtering	grouping
if you combine a filtering and a grouping however sql-server can no longer use this trick and is forced to evaluate the value of count or max based on the filteringing result set leading to expensive lookup

1784632
synchronous	.when
ideally the first scraper would be synchronous and everything else async to maximize parallels parsing and adding to the db but i m stuck on how to figure out .when the crawling is finished

1784650
png	gif
just to add i do not want the php scripting to be evoked .when request are made for css javascript png gif jpg and other media etc

1784652
getter	setter
setter and getter functions or to access members directly via

1784664
imperative-programming	declarative
i have been searching the web looking for a definition for declarative and imperative-programming that would shed some lighting for me

1784671
getter	setter
with c you would typically not defined setter and getter for each struct member

1784671
getter	setter
the advantages of setter and getter is present in c++ because you can do data hiding via private and protected

1784680
any	set
i want to set myvariable to the reference that is returned but i can t find in any of the documentation how to actually do that

1784690
json	xml
soap xml are the default but there is no reason why you can t do yml xml serialization object or my current favorite json which makes calling into it from a browser really easy

1784692
linux	unix
you ll never be stuck .when you are faced with a customer unix linux mac systemd that you don t have install capabilities for

1784710
if-statement	loops
in a nutshell the declarative language is simpler because it lacks the complexity of control flow loops if-statement etc

1784710
declarative	imperative
you have declarative .aspx files and then the imperative aspx.cs code files

1784716
imperative-programming	declarative
c# is a much more imperative-programming language but certain c# features are more declarative like linq

1784732
udp	tcp
looking further i see that the difference is that the tcp versioning of your code receives data via the inputstream that s provided by socket whereas the udp versioning of your code receives data directly from the datagramsocket s own receive methods

1784740
keydown	keyup
you have to let the keyup inorder to fire a new keydown event

1784743
httpd.conf	.htaccess
.so basically in httpd.conf i m adding an include to conf extra httpd-zf.conf which contains the same thing that was in my .htaccess and working perfectly

1784754
value	field
it looks like you forgot to assign a value to buabfile.file static field

1784756
xsd	xml
that s the part where xml schema is not helping you much - you cannot express requirements like this in xsd

1784773
height	frame
i don t really want to hardcode the frame value in case the screen-resolution changes or i use the view in a different context with a different height for example

1784774
any	set
since computer memory is always finite the set of representible value of any types is by definition also always finite too and therefore in computer science there is no such thing as continuous typess which i think was what you were really asking about not continuous attributes

1784787
udp	tcp
you shouldn t have trouble deciding whether to use tcp or udp you should rely on the actual dhcp specifications to determine what protocols is used

1784800
decrement	increment
stl iterator support only increment and decrement next an previous operations where motion through a 2d set required four such primitive left right up down etc...

1784812
getter	setter
in c if you are creating a new struct it already has setter getter built-in

1784812
getter	setter
no need to create separate setter getter interfaces and functions in c

1784834
http-unit	selenium
can you separate components of an icefaces application .so they can be tested in i.solation instead of using .something like selenium or http-unit on the assembled application

1784842
derived-class	base-class
that is a limitation of hiding the methods in the base-class but the only way you can return a more specific object in a derived-class using the same methods named

1784843
python	php
you asked whether html is allowed within python which indicates that you still think too much in php terms about it

1784843
python	php
contrary to php python was not designed to create dynamic webpage

1784843
turbogears	django	web-frameworks	turbogears
with things like django or turbogears or all the other web-frameworks you essentially set up a small stand-alone webserver which comes bundled with the framework .so you don t have to do anything tell the server which function should handle what url and then write those functions

1784847
decrement	increment
assuming you mean a vector of vectors and you have std vector in mind there s no built-in way to do it as iterator only support increment and decrement operations to move forwarding and backwards

1784847
2d-vector	matrix
a 2d-vector is a matrix and .so you d need two iterator types a row iterator and a column iterator

1784872
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
all the registers in cpu of x86 are 32-bit where as for 64bit its 64bit

1784873
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
for example on windows you have things like filesystems redirection and registry redirection wow64 .when running 32-bit apps on a 64bit windows os

1784885
combinations	permutation
almost all the permutation and combinations

1784899
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
in x86 there are 8 32-bit registers in x64 the registers are 64bit each and there are 8 more of them

1784899
32-bit	64bit
in x64 mode you can still use the registers as 32-bit by using their 32-bit named starting with an e instead of their 64bit named starting with an r and the assembly would be mostly the same

1784915
windows-xp	windows
i m confused further but have found an answer sort of - i m using windows 7 and have tried it on a windows-xp computer and the code compiles fine and reads in the file other errors you lot have noted are to be changed anyway through development - this was just one stick in the way...

1784926
hide	show
on the other hand you may want to hide the struct entirely and only show its declaration to the clients as a kind of an opaque handle

1784936
nested	order
you could instead do a per types order by either a series of nested switching if-statement of by constructing a dictionary or similar structure to get them

1784948
value	field
you either stop outputting the field that are different or choose to aggregate them and specify which of the multiple value you want min max etc for .when there are duplicates

1784970
any	set	contains	any	contains	set	subset	unique
i have set s of unique maps java hashmap currently and wish to remove from it any maps that are completely contains by some other map in the set remove m from s if m.entryset is a subset of n.entryset for some other n in s.

1784977
selected	cell	selected	textbox
.when i move that code into a user-controls i can no longer selected the textbox .when editing the cell

1784977
datagrid	textbox
the problem is .when i edit the cell in the datagrid i get the user-controls showing up but i can t click in the textbox searchtextbox

1784997
user-input	output
.so initially all user-input would be int and your output would be int

1785002
attributes	properties
the xmldoc s labels attributes should change only .when the doclabels s text properties changes

1785018
attributes	properties
you do your query using your object relations and all the sql join are inferred by the attributes on your object properties set-up in the code-generation step

1785047
multiplication	division
and indeed as noted by mark scalar division and multiplication is also possible

1785059
selected	button
if you re setting the selected state on the button touch down event rather than touch up inside your button will actually be in a highlighted+selected state .so you ll want to set that too

1785059
highlight	selected
according to your code-snippets this control state would be disabled + selected + highlight for the duration of the network operation

1785061
worksheet	excel
i m doing a excel 2007 vsto templates where i load a worksheet with between 10.000 to 15.000 rows of data and was count on using the built-in excel cell autocomplete to speed future data entry

1785062
common-lisp	lisp
i ll points out here that lisp describe a family of languages of which common-lisp is only one dialect

1785062
declarative	imperative
i think it doesn t matter which of the terms declarative imperative functional or procedural is a subset of which

1785063
revision	svn
no this undermines the idea of svn repository-level revision

1785073
increment	average
the new getct function should call the previous getct function to see how many items prior to this one are greater than the average and then increment that total if this item was also greater

1785076
perl	php
it seems that the perl implementation of pack is tolerant of invalid hex digits in the input string and the php versioning is decidedly not

1785076
perl	php
this printing 3 in perl for some reason but results in the error you mentioned in php

1785076
perl	php
i m not sure exactly what perl is doing with these digits but it s definitely not the same as php

1785082
background-image	width	background-image	height	display	height	display	width
after reading a few post i established that the issue was indeed that there was no content in the div except for a table i was trying to make the background-image adjust to the size of the broswer without collapsing or expanding and therefore used a much larger image in the background of the div inorder to form a cropping of sorts. the solution for me it seems was to simply cheat by placing an img tag that display a blank .png file that i then re-adjusted to the the correct height of the image with width set to 100

1785088
lookup	any
why this works well on limited hardware is that these calculations can be done using bitwise-operators and simple lookup tables without the need for any floating-point calculations

1785109
imperative-programming	declarative
i ll add another example that rarely popup in declarative imperative-programming discussion the user-interface

1785109
checkbox	button
on the imperative end you could use directx or opengl to very imperatively draw your button checkbox etc.

1785109
declarative	imperative
just because one language is declarative or imperative does not mean that it doesn t have certain features of the other

1785117
any	set
set sortexpression on the column to any valid column named

1785125
return-value	arguments
basically arguments is pushed to stack right-to-left and then the return-value is put in eax and the caller is responsible for cleanup

1785133
pointers	stack
stack is represented by a pointers to the last elements that was pushed onto it

1785133
pointers	stack
inorder to change stack by pushing an elements onto it this-pointers must be updates .so we pass a pointers to it to the push function

1785143
textbox	button	selected	button	selected	textbox
i have the following set up a ddl ddlprod radbuyer and autocomplete textbox txtprodac radprod that .when populate and their respective radio button are selected a gridview of the data is produced...lovely stuff

1785143
radio-button	button
i stuck in the else section .so that should a user hit the search button without a radio-button being checked a labels would appear and saying please check...etc

1785167
hide	show
in the user-controls you add a textbox and a combobox and add a methods properties to show one and hide another

1785196
attributes	properties
if i recall you retrieve that through the document properties on the web browser and find the link using the dom tools then grabbing the href attributes

1785197
pointers	stack
in a stack you always want to maintain a pointers to the top and the push function makes it easier to maintain this-pointers

1785199
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
i was building an active-directory single sign-on authentication systemd for java web-applications using spnego kerberos and everything works fine with either firefox or reportedly safari but internet-explorer causes an exception-handling

1785212
multiplying	division
you might also want to create a simple hash-function for hashmap entry object to return smaller numbers to increase multiplying division performance

1785218
xsd	xml
.when doing xmldocument.validate is there a way i can tell it to ignore properties that are not present in the xsd and instead just ensure that the properties required by xsd are present in the xml document

1785222
pointers	stack
a stack is basically a linked-list of pointers

1785244
getter	setter
how can you get intellij to generator getter setter on one line like this

1785265
stdin	pipe
as a i m new to the whole piping thing and python i had recently encountered a problem trying to pipe cygwin s stdin stdout into a python program usin python subprocess moudle

1785274
contains	set
just to make sure i wasn t going crazy and contains is not in fact a methods of the jquery wrapped set

1785292

i m interested in what other people are doing in these scenarios to lean on their continuous-integration and treat it more for integration than a continuous build-server

1785470
sinatra	gem
once passenger and rack are install gem install rack gem install passenger you just need to edit the apache vhost to points at the config.ru file for your sinatra .app and create the required directory as per the passenger docs and you ll be good to go

the only way to do this is to use row_number and row_number+1 on a selected order by date for an sql that supports row numbers or to create a temporary table with an auto increment key which you populate in date order

1785660
right-join	having
you are having a right-join .so if you have more than 1 recording for device serial-number in table gpsreport it will get all those recording and joint then to the unique list received from selected distinct device_serial from gpsreport

setting the userinteractionenabled properties of uilabel to yes fixed the highlight issue but it also disables the uipickerview from autoscroll to selected the row that has been touch

1785817
default	reset
1 if we first set dropdownlist.selectedindex to some value and then rebind control to datasource itâ s selectedindex properties will be reset to default

1785879
alter-column	alter-table
alter-table physician alter-column reflastname nvarchar 500

1785893
callback	methods
on this scenario the callback methods is invoked once

1785915
double	int
thus since two int s are divided by each other they will evaluate to an int solution in this case rounding towards zero before being implicit converted to a double

1785915
double	int
as other have noted you ll need to cast the int variables as double s .so the .solution comes out as a double and not as an int

1785929
value	field
value in header field

1785945
constructor	private
in c++ this can be obtained by declaring the constructor destructor as private

1785949

1 - in this video by tim heuer it turns out my vs2010 w silverlight 4 toolkit installation didn t match the final building .so i m missing the option that show up in the out-of-browser settings dialog that provides the checkbox for required elevated trust .when running outside the browser

1785951
attributes	properties
you might have an properties call attributes that is a dictionary which you then could call

1785951
void	main
i have never used it inside of a static void main

1786117
fpdf	fpdi
would fpdf and fpdi work

1786118
classname	inherited
edit because __class__ will always be the classname of the class in which the function was defined to support inherited you must redefine the getinstance methods in every child class

1786127
put	get
just put the full url into your browser windows which will let your browser get it then copy-paste and save locally

1786156
object-reference	instances
but wlw display an error - object-reference not set to an instances of an object. again the actual response data doesn t include the periods - that s just how network monitor represents carriage returns

have you tried just creating a second scripting elements contains the code you want to run and adding that after the you ve added the one that needs downloading

1786257
macros	basic
however handling platform specifics through really very basic macross seems gross too as the function gets chopped up into small pieces which may not compile properly read answer to c #define macros for debugging printing for a similar problem

1786257
python	perl
coming from a mostly scripted background of perl python shell .

1786285
instances	self	subclassing	nsobject
self in this case in your instances of webappdelegate which is probably a subclassing of nsobject not uiviewcontroller

1786399
explode	implode
i updates them using explode implode and setcookie methods in a custom function set_cookie and it works great

1786428
hash	md5
if you are not concerned with security someone deliberately trying to break your hashing then simply using the md5 hash will give you an excellent hash with minimal effort

1786428
hash	md5
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786436
where-clause	sql
i ve tried the following as well sql where-clause prep- execute line are all that change

1786438
qthread	qobject
i modified my main class to subclassing qthread instead of qobject and in the run create a qeventloop connect all signals slots and execute the thread

1786450
contains	any
with this methods you will get false positives if you have submitted or cherry-pick-synced any changelist since the last time you updates the sync points caching but it s better to list an extra changelist for review than to miss one especially one contains all new code

1786481
decrement	increment
i could have a counter that is increment every time a thread enters the object and decrement every time a thread leaves

1786483

boolean	int
does anyone know of any libs for objective-c cocoa-touch that provide data entry field-for all different types of input date field boolean numbers int etc

1786509
value	field
i went into phpmyadmin and changed the value for an int 15 field to a 10-digit numbers .so everything should work fine

1786517
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
as for a text-editor i personally like scite but any text-editor that will do syntax-highlighting will do code-folding helps as well

1786540
value	field
the value you were trying to set is too large for a signed int field

1786540
display	width
the display width 15 does not affect the range of value that can be stored only how the value is display

1786556
protected	public
in the common oo languages each class has a public and a protected contract

1786575
value	field
i guess i cant enter a value above 2147483647 for an int .so i assume everyone who uses a field to enter a 10-digit phone-number uses a bigint

push	pull
similarly you could just push the changed rows to this small table - and have your cache-maintenance program pull from this table

1786648
deployment	install	ruby-on-rails-plugins	gem	jruby	mri
on the other hand ruby-on-rails apps deployment is easier both ruby mri or jruby but the application s size is naturally larger given you have to install other gem and ruby-on-rails-plugins

1786652
updating	updates
if you re not updating direct properties of employee there s no updates to execute for its table and thus preupdates listener is never called

python	ruby	python	java
there are some really good html parsing for ruby and python but a quick google show there to be a numbers of parsing for java as well

1786745
python	ruby
personally i would at least for the beginning start in ruby or python as the libs are known and there is a lot of info about using them for this purpose

1786745
python	ruby
also i find it easier to quickly prototype these types of things in ruby or python than in the jvm

1786783
cakephp	symfony
if you want to building your own in an existing php framework checkout cakephp or symfony

1786791

1786810
joomla	drupal
still as those two are not as popular as drupal or joomla or whatever other well-known cms you can think about i would probably not use them for any real site -- at least not before studying them for a while

1786830
authentication	login
if you have access to both the joomla codebase and the external portal it may be easier to create an authentication plugins that checked against the portal instead of using joomla login

1786882
arrays	loops
if each device has some kind of standards methods for retrieving the attributes of interest you can write code that would accept an arrays of whatever and add that to the data structure using a for or foreach loops

1786887
emacs	vim
we had some lighting conversation for ten minutes and then one of the guys said ok now for the truly important question - vim or emacs

1786887
emacs	vim
i m guessing i won t be able to unravel the full potential of both these editor before i start .so inorder to pick the one which is likely to work best for me the question goes - which of vim and emacs will make me most comfortable and efficient working with c++ if i m all about visual-studio at the moment

1786900
contains	any
after either of those is satisfied the string can contains any numbers zero or more characters that are not or

boolean	int
i ve been using int32 string and boolean instead of int string bool in c# for a while now but i don t know why

1786942
recording	playing
then playing back the song involves process all of the structure recording that you recorded

1786951
boolean	int
if i wanted to make damn sure that the int i was using was 32-bit i would use int32 but i don t see a reason for using the more verbose boolean instead of the standards alias bool

1786952
32-bit	64bit
since it is machine agnostic information data types width should also be defined in some place or predefined by the specifications i.e 32-bit or 64bit floats

1786953
switching	screens
there s quite a lot of navigation between screens .so what i d like to do is have a viewswitchinger methods in mainviewcontroller that the child view controllers can call to ask for the view to switching away to another child view

1786964
setinterval	settimeout
by the way there is setinterval to calling a function repeatedly at a set interval rathering than recursively calling a function with settimeout

1786974
getter	setter
what i was thinking though could i building these into the getter and setter methods for my date properties on the linq-to-sql created object-model or should i just go round the .app everywhere re assign how the value is saved adding an extra line to the controllers like

1786991
put	get
and use that to get the last id insert and put that in your new recording

1786996
emacs	vim
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1787012
freebsd	ubuntu	freebsd	debian	ubuntu	debian
even better use virtualbox boot up into a full blown linux-distro debian slackware freebsd ubuntu fedora you named it and use both editor to get a feel of it and you will know which you get comfortable with and stick to it

1787013
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php
that is usually done using a session-based login-system of some sort based on one of the scripting languages like php ruby asp or perl

lemmatization	stemming
lemmatization and stemming are special cases of normalize

1787136
getter	setter
previously in cf8 .when i would cfdump an object i could view all of my setter and getter that existed in the object

1787136
getter	setter
the new cf9 documentation states that there is a metainfo tag that .when set as true should dump inherited object like my setter and getter for my database columns but in this instances it does not work

1787143
defined	declare
first one strange thing i found was that if i change the forward-declaration of .so that it doesn t match for example everything still compiles and works correctly to be clear i don t need to defined such a function only declare it

1787143
private-members	instances
note that while a friend declaration also works this actually gives each instances of the operators friend access to any instances of test while what i want is that the private-members of should only be accessible from

1787150
put	get
i put a new link button with id as companies and wrote this code but i still get the old error

1787306
emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	vim
i m wondering if anyone has come across such plugins or-tools in the past - i m aware that there are snippet scripting in vim textmate emacs and other powerful editor just curious of what else is out there in the wild

1787309
tuples	any
but stop and consider it looks like it s possible to not match any dog and cat elements which would leave you returning null for one or both of the tuples components

1787309
expression	evaluation
once you have an expression in hand you can initializer a constants with the result-of its evaluation

1787319
javascript	dom
this solution seems to load the image into the dom twice...once .when the javascript loads it and then again .when the div layer that loads it becomes visible.

1787331
datagrid	textbox
.so essentially i discovered that the issue that was occurring was that vb.net was calling page_load before the event itself was being called and in the page_load methods i was calling the methods that filled the datagrid which cleared the textbox in the footer before the value in them were being read

1787345
sql-server	mysql
i need to export database from sql-server 2005 to sql-scripts like we can easily do in mysql

1787349
aggregate	grouping
you probably already know this but you can aggregate sum count etc over the detail in a report in the report page grouping header footer and give totals that way

1787349
shipping	tax
then you could do sum over the detail field to generator your subtotal then add tax shipping etc

1787366
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have read that certain security features that are baked in to asp.net webforms that you will have to add yourself by hand .when doing asp.net-mvc apps

1787378
versioning	upgrade
hacking plugins means you have to hack again if you want to upgrade with a new versioning .when available unless of course the new versioning resolve the conflict problem

1787389
dictionary	arrays
note it is a dictionary inside a dictionary not an arrays inside a dictionary or a dictionary inside an arrays

1787397
flac	mp3
edit maybe i should add that each of my threads is using subprocess.popen to run a separate command-line decode flac pipe to stdout which is fed into a command-line encoder lame mp3

1787405
put	get
i need to put .some data into a combo box and requery .so i can get the information display

1787417
sql-server	oracle
sql-server parallels to oracle dbms_metadata.get_ddl

1787422
sequences	unique
worse the c libs doesn t offer unique handles to sinks .so a sequences of hotplug events could change the hardware a given sink instances actually controls without the code noticing

1787429
getter	setter
getmetadata would give you back your getter and setter

1787437
triggers	insert	populate	row	value	field
the have an insert updates triggers .so that whenever a row is added to or changed in the table you populate the .sort field with the correct value e 1 c 2 t 3 anything else 0

1787451
javascript	dom
into the dom twice...once .when the javascript

1787473
put	get
note that if you choose this then to modify a foo s bars you d get the foo modify the bars in the foo representation and then put the foo

1787490
one-to-many	entity
i believe you can remove the link entity and set up a one-to-many or many-to-many associations between product and recipes

1787501
any	set
.when i create a branch off a revision of trunk my resulting branch doesn t have any mergeinfo set .so as far as i can tell it s impossible to figure out what revision the branch came from later

1787501
required	checked
but it s slow and required checked out the source and committing the change back

1787548
decrement	increment
note this is assuming a muti core systemd for now lets ignore hyperthreading and lets ignore any of the typical problems associated with mutithreading assume that all threads have private write location and can only read from public ones locking and unlocking only happens .when increment or decrement the counter for numbers of active threads

1787554
memset	memcmp
use memset to zero a string arrays memcpy to set the string and memcmp to compare the entire arrays against another similar arrays

1787554
arrays	loops
this can use 64bit loads never has to checked for the zero terminator and can be optimized to not loops or branch at all if using a small arrays size of 64 or 128

1787567
put	get
in my server code my content is normally put to the queue as bytes and .so appears as a bytesmessages but just in case i get a messages that was manually put on the queue i catch the classcastexception and test to see if it is in fact a textmessages

1787585
xquery	xslt
it explains xml schema which defined exactly what the incoming xml must look like xpath how you navigate nodes to arrive at the data you want xquery xslt namespaces etc

1787585
versioning	upgrade
that s especially important .when dealing with program storage because you can then make your programs understand previous versioning of saved files and use or upgrade them automatically

1787608
google-apps	gmail
if me i will register my custom domain to google-apps and will open an gmail account with own domain

1787617
webforms	asp.net
since it is more bare-metal than asp.net webforms you do have more opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot if you are not careful

1787630
dictionary	arrays
python doesn t exactly work the same way but python dictionary are similar to javascript associativity arrays

1787660
formatting	printing
it s meant to be used as a format thus the f with formatting sequences to printing the remaining arguments

1787665
selected	checkbox	highlight	selected
if you have a smoother interface in mind you can extends that idea by hiding the checkbox with css then using javascript to make the checkbox selected .when the corresponding paragraph is click and highlight the paragraph by applying a css class to show it as selected

1787667
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
search in o log n sorteddictionary sortedlist

1787681
profiling	trace
.net profiling uses the profiling api to trace the graphing of object

1787681
callback	methods
you might be particularly interested in callback methods objectreferences and rootreferences and maybe also objectallocated

1787687
any	set
i have memcached set up on my server but there doesn t seem to be any useful documentation that i can find on how to efficiently transfer large amounts of data

1787687
value	field
lets say that i have a table with two field key and value

1787699
environment	building
i m currently in the process of building our asp.net c# 3.5 website and i have been looking at azure as our possible hosting environment and i had a couple of questions that i couldn t really find answers for on their website

1787723
converter	export
most of the graphics can be defined in xaml which means you can export them from programs like illustrator or anything that generator the standards svg vector-graphics via an svg-xaml converter

1787735
concat	where
as guffa has concluded use the one that best represents your intention with the code. of course for simple usage where performance isn t too much of a concern use + or concat

1787740
.net	wcf
i am developing wcf service with basichttpbinding these service should be accessible using .net 1.1 .net 2.0 for this purpose i am using basichttpbinding

1787749
progress-bar	progress
in my audio-streaming application i like to show the progress of downloading and playing .when i tried it with mpmovieplayercontroller it show both progress in the same progress-bar is there any way to implements or use the applies default progress-bar in our application

1787751
constructor	object
alternatively you can make travel object immutable and use a constructor factory-method or mutable builder object to create instances

1787752
pure-virtual	base-class
basically in a pure-virtual base-class the __declspec novtable arguments can be used to suppress the creation of a vtable for the base-class as well as vtable initialization deinitialization code in the constructor destructor respectively

1787767
put	get
sometimes i get the feeling that some code have put the most common pattern first to save the most common case from having to test patterns that it will not likely match

1787788
http	ssl
run a command-line binding of the ssl ports netsh http add sslcert ipports

1787843
conditional	operators
this could still potentially cause problems if someone used the identical comparison operators on the return-value but you typically only see this .when a methods might return both false and 0 under different conditional

1787848
ghostscript	pdftk
as an alternative for pdftk you can use ghostscript

1787859
stateless	stateful
how do i convert mdb stateless beans to stateful beans

1787900
ubuntu	linux
i am using aptana 2.0.2 with pdt plugins on ubuntu linux platform

1787902
continuous-integration	teamcity
as mentioned in the question continuous-integration with teamcity and clearcase we a colleague and i did manage to make teamcity interact efficiently with clearcase but

1787913
any	set
another points is that you can always set the working directory with the setwd path to dir cmd inside any r session on any platform

1787922
arguments	default
the default arguments value for the new elements is the default-contructed one which in your case is myclass

1787923
jquery-plugins	jquery
does anyone maintain a list of jquery-plugins that support the jquery user-interface css framework

1787936
assign	add
i want to assign an icons to display next to my .app s uninstaller in the windows add remove programs

1787947
subclipse	aptana
after a little bit of digging around aptana seems to be based on eclipse and you re probably using subversive or subclipse for the svn perspective

1787951
return-value	arguments
but in actuality what you have specified is that the result-of proc car items is a procedure to be applied to the arguments which is the return-value of for-each proc cdr items

1787952
binary-tree	linked-list
what you are looking for is a linked-list that is indexed with a binary-tree

1787952
binary-tree	linked-list
this would provide you o log n insert deletion and search using the binary-tree with o m traversal using the linked-list

1787956
primitive	boolean
specifically .when you cast a value-type a primitive such as int32 boolean etc. to an object the runtime has to wrap the value-type instances in a reference-type box it and place it on the managed heap

1787958
fseek	ftell
with the fgets sscanf methods it s a lot easier to guarantee that you re on a line boundary without having to use ftell and fseek to move around the file

1787985
any	set
to allow the properties to be set in any order but retain an established validation api used automatically by some apis including datagridview and asp.net-mvc-validation one option is idataerrorinfo

1787988
scalatest	junit
there are examples using junit scalatest and and specifications

1787997
profiling	debugging
as for tools to help you debugging this try using a memory profiling tool such as compuware devpartner memory analyzer

1788014
stderr	stdout
if the process limit as show by the ulimit cmd is 1024 and you have not closed stdin stdout and stderr and 100 file descriptors are used by items such as database connections and other file handles than you will have 921 open connections available for simultaneous process

1788016
listbox	textbox
i would like to display a bunch of settings in a windows and offer different ways for the user to set them textbox listbox etc

1788020
sql-server	mysql
but it s very slow .so it s better to use full-text indexing in mysql in sql-server

1788039
credentials	security
you d configure wshttpbinding with username passwd client credentials over message-based security like this

1788043
32-bit	64bit
it makes total sense to me that on a 32-bit systemd i would expect 4-byte pointers and on a 64bit systemd i would expect 8-byte pointers

1788057
32-bit	64bit
you re running a 32-bit kernel but you re compiling the code into a 64bit executable

1788060
abstract-class	pure-virtual	abstract-class	base-class	pure-virtual	base-class
i believe by virtual base-class you mean a base-class having a pure-virtual function an abstract-class and not deriving virtually from a base-class

1788066
base-class	inherited
say a is the base-class and b and c are classes that inherited from the base-class

1788066
instances	private
create a class somemethodsimpl that just provides the implementation you want and then the implementation of b somemethods and c somemethods will just delegation the methods call to a private instances of somemethodsimpl somemethods

1788069
base-class	inherited	pure-virtual	base-class
if you want to keep your base-class as pure-virtual create another class that inheriteded from this one and implements that one function and then have your two other classes inherited from this one

1788089
highlight	selected
plus i need to highlight selected row with some different color

1788098
hide	show
on the other hand allowing the user to hide show columns would also be good

1788104
python	ruby
i don t know which language do you use but there are the good tutorials for ruby and python

1788113
macros	let
the above would let you adjust only the value of the built_with_foo building setting to choose whether to use the preprocessor macros and other linker-flags variants whose named end with a trailing _ or the ones whose named end with a trailing _foo

1788164
contains	elements
how about have the image tag contains all the attributess needed for the large image and use javascript to get access to those attributess and use an onclientclick and reference the click elements to get the attributes value

1788174
callback	methods
a delegation methods implements the callback mechanism which usually takes the sender as one of the parameter to be called

1788199
.when	ready
now threadb needs to know that .when we say ready we really mean ready

1788210
textbox	button
how to disable all the controls button anchor textbox ... in the page using jquery

1788219
gridview	listview
if you want multiple-columns in a listview use a gridview see here

1788224
for-loop	arrays
i know i have value in the arrays because .when i display in for-loop

1788227
nsinteger	int
i say should because .when i compare the value to an int or an nsinteger or nsnumber it never evaluates correctly

1788250
contains	set
i have a large-data set in which each entry contains two items a key and a size

1788250
data-structures	tree
i hate using two separate data-structures but there doesn t seem to be a way to resort a tree based on a different key

1788258
textbox	button
i have an arraylist that is populate using a textbox button for input of numbers

1788259
arrays	map
in my sdl program i am using a map construct to simulate an infinite arrays of object within a certain class

1788261
digits	zero
it is stored as a six digits octal numbers with leading zero followed by a null and then a spaces

1788266
dev-null	stdin
you can try and run ssh without a terminal - the manpage suggests it might be necessary to redirect stdin to dev-null for ssh to think it has no terminal

1788271
arrays	map
it will do a better job of simulating an infinite arrays than a map because a map isn t an arrays

1788313
click	mouse
you may also want to handle mouse click on the slider differently because i think normally click right or left of the thumb causes the slider to jump by a certain interval instead of jumping right to the click location

1788313
click	mouse
i m guessing here but jlist fires two selection events for each click one on pressing the mouse button another one upon release

1788325
pointers	stack
the upshot is that only the one you declare gets created on stack - the other two are created on the heap .so by using this versioning you re actually incurring twice the overhead you would if you used a pointers and assumed responsibility for deleting all your instances at the end

1788334
put	get
.when i put breakpoints it goes to the function tscreen correctly....but i can get output.

1788335
constructor	object
a constructor is some methods automatically called .when you initializer a new instances of an object

1788335
constructor	object
actually you can imagine the constructor always return the instances of the object created that would be a good image

1788343
python	perl
ps there are some perl python scripting to import source tree into svn client side scripting

1788344
constructor	object
what actually happens with the constructor is that the runtime uses types data generator by the compiler to determine how much spaces is needed to store an object instances in memory be it on stack or on the heap

1788344
constructor	object
.so the rea.son the constructor doesn t return a value is because it s not called directly by your code it s called by the memory allocation and object initialization code in the runtime

1788358
constructor	object
somewhat longer answer in c++ constructor are called for dynamically as well as for globally and automatically allocated object

1788364
constructor	object
.when you call a constructor the return-value is the new object

1788364
constructor	object
but within the constructor itself you re not actually creating and returning the object

1788376
children	tree
for each child object the same list of children as line 2 printing their tree by starting at line 2 with the child object s children

1788403
project-management	project
finally good project-management is what makes a great project

1788415
stdin	pipe
perhaps the easiest way is to make the mathematica program its own self-contained scripting and just call it as a systemd call or pipe stuff to from it via stdin stdout

1788415
stderr	stdout
call a mathematica program from the command-line with command-line arguments stdin stdout and stderr

1788421
python	java
i m trying to encrypt a string from java to python using the libs bouncycastle j2me on the client side and python m2crypto on the other

1788453
constructor	object
look at a constructor in a broader sense it is a function which construct a new object

1788455
accumulate	grouping
the bean-counter reality of it is that the easy wins of the rapid grouping accumulate hidden costs of poor quality

1788458
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
on the error console it says unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element radio

1788463
databound	gridview
inorder for a gridview row to be in edit mode the grid must be databound

1788475
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior occurs in ie6 i havent checked ie7 and ie8 it does not occur in firefox and google-chrome

1788501
configuration	logging
there is a sample log4j configuration for logging into both console and file show in the above link

1788513
contains	elements
input elementss are usually contains inside a form elements is that your case

1788518
ip-address	proxy
i tried methods to retrieve the ip-address at the server side but these methods don t give the ip-address of the client .when there are proxy servers or nat in between

1788549
constructor	object
these object are not referenced from elsewhere but their constructor are still supposed to run

1788555
web-hosting	hosting
actually i had to contact the web-hosting service provider support for this because the rules implements by openid libs were interfering with the mod-rewrite rules of hosting provider

1788559
value	field
leave from the field and change value of another textinput this is just a textinput this is a form there are some more form elements then come back to value exceeded textfield by shift+tabs and remove the additional entered numbers .when you come to green soon your value is accepted

1788559
value	field
now again enter more value and now you are in the warn zone then leave from the field and do the few changes in other form elements

1788559
click	mouse	value	field
then come back to the value exceeded text field by mouse click and start delete from del even though you removed additional value still field show that you are in warn zone

1788587
ip-address	hostname
if you re still in testing you can add a hostname entry for that ip-address on your local machine s see then you can essentially use a dummy hostname for testing until you get into production

1788599
duplicates	contains
the list templ may currently contains duplicates

1788615
hide	show
i want to stripes all tags remove the show hide stuffs from wikipedia or is there some website that makes pages in more readable format

1788639
firefox	safari
.when i run it the code wont work on ie8 but okay in firefox safari and others

1788644
value	field
value loginid field is required

1788646
simulink	matlab
we re using matlab simulink for model development and real-time workshop autocoding within a team of several developers

1788646
version-control	git
we d like to migrate our programme to a different version-control systemd svn hg or git but we re concerned about performing merges and diff on simulink .mdl files

1788649
localization	translation
if there is no translation on your language but i think there is one simple help ooo community with one more localization

1788665
object-reference	instances
that error object-reference is not set to an instances of an object will only be throw .when an attempt is made to reference that object

1788690
nsmutablearray	nsarray
how can i checked if a variables is an nsarray or an nsmutablearray

1788712
updatepanel	datalist
i have used jquery for rounded corners div and i have a updatepanel which contains a datalist which contains som images and a delete link

1788737
expression	evaluation
i don t know for sure but i m guessing it s because java evaluates the postdecrement on the last x-- before evaluation the - operators whereas c++ evaluates the - first and the postdecrement after the entire rest of the expression is done

1788749
malloc	strdup
normally you use strdup to copy a string which handles the malloc in the background

1788755
font-size	height
this is strange because the p contains only text and its line height is 24px .so its height should be 24px multiplied by the numbers of line of text inside it regardless of the font-size of anything inside it

1788765
expression	evaluation
modiï ed at most once by the evaluation of an expression

1788776
put	get
alternatively it may use the http methods get put etc

1788777
google-chrome	safari
but in safari 4 google-chrome fx3.5 and all the modern browsers the xmlhttprequest is built-in - it knows that it s still waiting for the server to still streaming its content exactly as it would with and

1788820
hide	show
show hide stuffs from wikipedia or

1788838
callback	methods
logically i cannot see match difference between marking the callback methods as â œonewayâ or calling them with being_methodname ..

1788846
logout	login
login logout and permission-check functionality is not a problem different sessions is the problem

1788854
oracle	mysql
i am a mysql fan however i want to know in which situations choosing oracle over mysql seems like the way to go

1788857
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is based on ubuntu which uses the freedesktop.org standards for it s menus

1788863
arrays	loops
to put back the in database your would have to somehow store it as an arrays and then loops thought that arrays and do subsequent insert queries

1788868
innodb	myisam
i have to choose between enforcing contraints and transactional vs fulltext index innodb vs myisam

1788879
typedef	struct
users sbarbier dev xcode infographie tp9-raytracing raytracing-directions.h 22 0 users sbarbier dev xcode infographie tp9-raytracing raytracing-directions.h 22 error changes meaning of directions from typedef struct directions directions

1788881
firefox	safari	put	get
i have a small portion of code which works well on firefox but i can t seem to get it to work on safari unless i put an alert instruction anywhere inside of the whiles

1788892
show	next
now i want to do paging in the gridview but .when the next page is click it show the following error

1788892
contains	any
the ilistsource does not contains any data sources

1788892
show	next
and the next page in the grid show empty

1788898
build-server	msbuild
i have an msbuild scripting which performs a lot of tasks as it is run on our build-server

1788901
selected	checkbox
you could try editing the distribution list on the exchange advanced tab selected the hide grouping from exchange address lists checkbox

1788902
overwrite	import
but .when the incremental .profile import runs it overwrite these with the old value from active-directory

1788909
protected	public
the methods contenttransferencodingtostring is protected not public and can thus only be called from a class that inherited mailmessage

1788913
exception-handling	try-catch
you d need to wrap some of this in try-catch blocks as at least new url throw an exception-handling upon malformed uri

1788918
contains	elements	key-value	key
i tried using a hashtable but .when i go hashtable.add key-value where key is my dummy1 and value is one of the arrays elementss it will throw an error stating that an elements already contains that key

1788931
operator-precedence	ternary-operator
also note that + has precedence over the ternary-operator javascript operator-precedence

1788955
selected	cell
the datavaluesprovider will load after a input on a specific cell of the selected row

1788989
average	median
if you feel the need to reuse the code for calculating stuff i would create a toolkit class similar to the math class in java that can calculate average median sums or whatever you need

1788991
player	movie
in your case please note that .as files are not executable they will be compiled into a .swf flash movie which will be run by the flash player inside the client s browser

1789008
value	field
if you want that the user gets a text entry field to edit the value then you may want to read up on editor

1789015
oracle	mysql
but then if you just need a little database for a website stick with mysql otherwise if you need complicated report and performance is an issue then i believe oracle is the way to go

1789026
arguments	default
in general python support for defining functions taking default arguments variables numbers of arguments and keyword arguments is more flexible than any other scripting-language i ve ever seen

1789027
multiplication	division
.when dealing with more than a single radicand the numbers are no longer closed under multiplication and division .so you will need to store them as variables length rational coefficient arrays

1789037
boolean	int	row	col
to make your cell user-editable your tablemodel must implements a public boolean iscelleditable int row int col methods that returns true for those cell that you want to be editable

1789037
row	col
the jtable will automatically updates the tablemodel trough the public void setvalueat object value int row int col methods

1789043
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
why this does not work in ie google-chrome but works in firefox opera

1789064
shell	bash
it does indeed launchd the bash shell and flying around the file directory is okay with cd ls cp rm etc.

1789071
callback	methods	decrement	increment
i would suggest the same adamantium but also introduce a counter that is increment with each methods invocation and decrement by the callback

row	col
extends tablemodel class generally you extends abstracttablemodel and make sure that iscelleditable int row int col returns true for the cell that you want to edit

1789117
row	col
inorder to fire events you can use the firetablecellupdated int row int col or several other firexxx methods whose implementation is already present in abstracttablemodel

1789121
shell	bash
are you using the default cygwin bash shell

1789123
emacs	vim
i use vim myself but i m quite certain that both vim and emacs would be a bad choice for a student course

1789127
file-descriptor	pipe
i ve played with different sleep value and in the past i ve written a versioning before the subprocess module was added to python which used the signals module sigchld and sigalrm and the os.fork and os.execve functions --- which my on pipe and file-descriptor plumbing etc

1789163
software-quality	code-coverage
one suggestion can be to include code-coverage into your assessment of software-quality

1789167
rollback	commit
yes you need to send your mail within a transactional context and wait for completion then just rollback transactional on any exception-handling or commit it if there is no any

1789186
row	col
you have to specify in your table that a given cell will be editable or not you could do that either in jtable.iscelleditable row col or directly in the tablemodel.iscelleditable row col methods

1789195
exception-handling	try-catch
the code that is throw the exception-handling is inside try-catch block then why should this happen

1789204
environment	execution
this is not working - may because the environment that is set in the first process is not used while execution the second process

1789252
user-input	output
the main problem is that you can t access persistent-storage user-input or audio output from a gpu

1789278
getter	setter
it is possible if you wrap your variables in getter and setter and fire the event .when the setter is called

1789280
any	set
it depends on the character set unicode or ansi wchar_t or char .so if your are using ansi simply tchar will be char without any casting but for unicode you have to convert from wchar_t to-char you can use widechartomultibyte

1789285
versioning	upgrade
i have a server on which i have two sites built with django and python one site is major site is building with an older versioning of django the other with the newer release i have upgrade to the new release and major aspects of my other site have broken is it possible to tell the site to use a different versioning in say the python path

1789289
any	set
the solution is to use set any instead of a set words

1789289
any	set
set words value any pad

1789289
any	set
set any error try disarm error

1789290
oracle	mysql

1789290
oracle	mysql
even if i can use oracle forms to connect to mysql i would like to know any other third party tool which can do the job easily quickly

1789293
primitive	int	extends	final
.so the functionality can be achieved by wrapping the primitive-types in .some kind of wrapper object - but of course they re not 100 interchangeable for instances java s primitive wrapper types int etc. are marked final .so it s not possible to extends them with event-firing versioning to take advantage of auto un boxing

1789307
bioconductor	bioperl
also an r bioconductor solution or a bioperl module would do but i didn t manage to find anything

1789309
keyboard	mouse
.so if your avr is emulation a usb keyboard or mouse it should be possible to wake the computer by sending the proper data

from memory a double can represent a 53-bit signed int exactly

1789508
contains	any
doccontent is never referenced in main nor is any other variables that might contains the original text fs br bit or mr

1789524
32-bit	64bit
i recommend you provide universal 32-bit and 64bit binary

1789532
response	timeout
however the client wait forever until the server send its response and eventually timeout

1789546
hide	show
it simplifies the form layout and allows you to show and hide whole tabs depending on choices made in other tabs

1789562
order	add
there is the store management interface where people add product category checkout order and .so on

1789566

i am pretty sure there is no other way to change the compiler used by visual-studio because there is no trace of csc.exe in any solution configuration csproj file or whatsoever nor in the visual-studio 9.0 folder subfolders within the program files dir

1789575
if-statement	loops
your if-statement are not correctly resetting your loops iterator

1789576

1789578
attributes	properties
left join is generator if isforeignkey is set to false in the associations attributes for the entityref-typed properties

1789616
environment	building
as a best practice use instead of calling make directly as it ll take care to call the right make instances if you for example use a special make versioning for your building environment as well as provide slightly different behavior .when running using certain switches such as -t

1789644
uisearchbar	uitableview
the problem starts because i m adding the uisearchbar to the first section of the uitableview because if i understand correctly i must do this .so i can jump to the search bar by touching the search icons in the section index directly

1789647
httpwebrequest	webclient
you need to use httpwebrequest rather than webclient as you can t set the timeout on webclient without extends it even though it uses the httpwebrequest

1789658
constructor	private
however it doesn t work as the classes generally have a private constructor to prevent unauthorized initializer i m mean that way .so i get the types typesname must be a non-abstract types with a public parameterless constructor error

1789664
directory-structure	filesystems
i am trying to create a web-deployment-project for a web appplication that required a directory-structure to be created somewhere in the filesystems user choice

1789666
constructor	object
however if you ll always need the list object initializer it s a little simpler to just create it within the object constructor and use the automatic properties instead

1789667
variables	boolean
to avoid using break or return one inevitably ends up with a while-loop with a regular stop conditional and some boolean variables to indicate that the lookup has succeeded

1789671
exception-handling	try-catch
i know that many exception-handling might have happened during running the service it is really doing many things but all those exception-handling are handled in try-catch blocks .so why is my always looping thread stops

1789679
put	get
i m expecting to see a string such as abc or def as that is what i put in there initially but if i do a system.out.println i get something like java.lang.string#f0454

1789696
put	get
i m expecting to see a string such as abc or def as that is what i put in there initially but if i do a system.out.println i get something like java.lang.string#f0454

1789713
data-structures	map
i m trying to prepare for a few interviews and i was just curious to see if how java implements its data-structures arraylist map etc is public

1789745
contains	elements
.so i would say both section and article elementss can contains the other elements if appropriate

1789771
jndi	jdbc
per java ee specifications ejbs are strictly prohibited from accessing any external resources by any means other than through a resource manager jdbc jndi jca etc and this include especially access to the local filesystems through classes of the java-io package

1789777
jax-rs	cxf
i have a glassfish .app server hosting my web service jax-rs with cxf

1789807
defined	declare
if .so how would i declare and defined a function which takes a function pointers as an arguments

1789845
buffering	streaming	lan	wan
however if youâ re doing lots of copying in various environment network streaming both lan and wan copying files on the local disk you might be better off .when you have the option to selected the size of the buffering used for copying

1789845
constructor	object
implements it with object methodss and a constructor that takes a buffering size used for your varying needs and maybe add a static methods to get a pseudo-singleton instances that uses some default buffering size which is used for the casual copying every now and then

1789860
vb.net	vb6
you could write a com-visible c# or vb.net component and call it from vb6

1789863
firefox	opera
the issue is only .when using firefox or opera

1789867
subclassing	nsobject
i presume your card class is a subclassing of nsobject in which case you should implements designated-initializer init which call and does generics setup

1789879
sigaction	signals
use sigaction to catch the signals and store the old handler

1789883
click	mouse
the mouse cursor reappears on screens but no other application is receiving any mouse click any more

1789887
revision	svn
and running git-svn git-rebase correctly fetches new revision but then tries to apply what looks like all 8000+ commit from the svn trunk

1789902
simplemodal	jquery
am i able to embed a flash player in an eric martin jquery simplemodal

1789908
python	java
even though you tagged the question java here s an example of a searchparser in python

1789940
json	xml
i don t agree that it is not possible to distinguish between uri of restful web service and other web resources - if we follow the link we get certain types of content application xml and application json would be pretty strong indicators wouldn t they

1789956
textbox	button
in the case of a button the value is typeof button and for a textbox it is typeof textbox

1789958
nsmutablearray	nsarray
in short you can t tell the difference between an nsarray and an nsmutablearray

1789958
required	checked
the reality though is that design-patterns that required checked for mutability are confusing to use and incur significant overhead

1789958
nsmutablearray	nsarray
for example if test-for-mutability were a common pattern than all of the methods in cocoa that return nsarray instances would have to actually return nsarray instances and never return a reference to the internal nsmutablearray that might be being used

1789962
directory	folder
that directory is initializer with whatever it needs and then you store a small file in the project directory that tells you what folder the user chose

1789970
dataadapter	datarow
if you re saving your data with a dataadapter then after the save your datarow and any other rows with a datarelation points to that id will be updates

1789989
constructor	object	exception-handling	try-catch
i have to initializer file object inside the constructor and for handling the exception-handling is it efficient using throw or should i go for try-catch

1789997
google-chrome	firefox
this is true for all browsers i have tested ie8 firefox google-chrome

1790008
put	get
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790011
textbox	button
all i want to do is to bind textbox1.text to itestclass.testproperty .so that .when i click the button i can see its value change in the textbox

1790019
constructor	object
you are supposed to take the object to a safe state in the constructor but let s imagine you want to open a file for reading that doesn t exists throw the exception-handling is the only way

1790020
web-applications	client-server
i ve been researching on building web-applications in a true client-server fashion

1790021
constructor	object
if you can react on the exceptional state and still create a valid or at least useable object then handle it within the constructor

1790029
any	set
is there any way to set these white strps to transparency

1790032
constructor	private	value	field
in general it is a good idea to have only simple logic in your constructor for example setting private field with arguments value

1790034
callback	methods
phil takes advantage of the existing api to create a new html-helper methods to provide a callback that can rendering the non-cached code

1790034
callback	methods
his supplies an anonymous methods to the helpers to specify the callback

1790037
cursor	row
now i m having a hover function which would show a cursor .when i move the cursor over a row

1790037
tablerow	layout
the problem on hover-out i want the tablerow getting back its odd class again inorder to keep the 2-colored layout

1790041
self-organizing-maps	som
after some research i ve decided that the best way is to use the self-organizing-maps som approach

1790046
macros	basic
clarification i am trying to do this without coding whole visual basic macross if at all possible i want to be able to do it using the macros builder thingumy

1790047
children	nodes	children	tree
what about creating a conditional tree where conditional object may be simple conditionalal or compound conditionalal joining 2 simple conditionalal with a boolean ie andconditional parent nodes with children rangeconditional and equalsconditional

1790053
keyboard	mouse
all you should need is a main methods and methodss to implements the keyboard and or mouse routines

1790061
keyboard	mouse
an application that acquires the mouse or keyboard device in exclusive mode should always unacquire the devices .when it receives wm_entersizemove and wm_entermenuloop messages

1790085
getter	setter
this include getter and setter in properties

1790085
getter	setter	design-time	designer
it s a great feature but what resharper doesn t know is that .when you re designing a view which will be display in the designer form user ctrl that the properties getter and setter are called at design-time and don t show up in compilation

1790085
getter	setter
.so resharper will suggest that those properties s getter or setter can be made private or just removed

1790092
sortedlist	hashtable
just use sortedlist or replace hashtable with sortedlist

1790096
versioning	upgrade
some people are not in control of their browser versioning and cannot upgrade it

1790105
dictionary	arrays
and then whenever you want to find the index of a dictionary in an arrays

1790108
put	get
to get rid of it just put

1790113
textbox	button
given a form frmlogin with 2 textbox txtusername and txtpassword and a cmd button you can try the following

1790122
python	java
the java webdriver binding offer a wait class for just this purpose though there isn t yet an analogue for this in the python binding

1790123
sortedlist	hashtable
if you want the items in the order you re adding them you don t want a hashtable or a sortedlist

1790124
calling-convention	function-pointers
the function-pointers might just .so happen to work because the calling-convention doesn t depend on cv-qualification that is a is returned the same way a is and const this is passed the same way non-const this is

1790127
alignment	layout
though since ie8 came out i already don t do any pixel-precise layout fixed alignment for ie6 anymore

1790149
any	set
to find out how many other sets are not disjoint with a b consider all the possibilities in general all the sets with two elements that are not disjoint with a b are of the form a x or b x for any x in the original set

1790149
contains	elements
but those only contains one elements each a a a and b b b .so we shouldn t count them

1790150
perl	php
alternatively you could query the information_schema.columns table to locate all of the varchar columns and use that to building queries in another language like php or perl

1790159

1790180
gzip	zip
pack200 and gzip produces much smaller files than jars effectively zip files

1790187
arrays	loops
initializing a numpy arrays is relatively expensive and with this conventional python pattern you incur that cost more or less at each loops iterator each append to a numpy arrays is roughly like initializing a new arrays with a different size

1790195
toggleclass	addclass	toggleclass	removeclass	removeclass	addclass
you should use toggleclass instead of addclass + removeclass

1790206
click	mouse
the user click the mouse on your player s play button

1790212
updating	updates
not that she shouldnt updates i just know that if any updating were to happen it would either have to be insanely simple or i would have to do it for her

1790216
publishing	release
part of our release is to publishing these dll s

1790235
python	java
how do i add version-control to a python project in the same way maven does it for java

1790255
google-chrome	firefox
the styles attributes isn t a string .so that types of selector won t work in fact the con.sole in google-chrome and firefox both say indexof is not a function .when trying this one

1790256
revision	updates
more clearly i don t want the latest revision numbers since that can be my own commit but the revision numbers of the latest updates i made in my local repo

1790275
generic-list	enumerator
this explains how enumerator works for generic-list

1790277
mouseleave	mouseenter
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790286
revision	updates
would mean that 1234 is the highest revision your working copy was updates to

1790290
sql-server	mysql
i would like to support at least two kinds of databases - one will be microsoft sql-server 2005 2008 and the other most probably mysql

1790291
binaries	install
we especially recommend using an install if you use microsoft visual-studio because the install can downloading and install precompile libs binaries saving you the trouble of building them yourself

1790316
contains	any
currently i m working on a methods that pull the matching entry and eagerly loads all game plays and associated prizes but it seems wasteful to load all game plays just to find the latest one and any that contains a prize

1790353
versioning	upgrade
.so if your team upgrade boost to a new versioning you could simply change the include-path in the .sln or .vsprops files to make the compiler search for the new versioning -- if a coworker hasn t install the right versioning he just won t be able to building which might be preferable to silently buildinging with an old versioning

1790359
any	set	aggregate	grouping
in short what you want is groupinging like in both the answer and then within the grouping you either use aggregate to merge row by row or multiple any on the results of the groupingby depending on which is clearer in your context or more efficient if you have a large set of data within each grouping

1790365
derived-class	inherited
i have a question there why does derived-class inherited from parentclass

1790375
output	mode
suddenly the console is showing no output while i run my programs on the simulator even .when on debugging mode

1790380
decimal	hex
edit this is the actual output from the scripting string is the hex string value is the decimal conversion of that string and checksum is the resulting output

1790387
order	add
b use an order by clause .when you retrieve the tuples .so that they are in the order in which you will add them to the tree

1790410
revision	svn
that will assure that the versioning or revision strings are forced into your source by svn

1790411
decimal-point	digits
you need to defined the float with more precision float 10 5 would mean a float that can have 10 digits total with up to five after the decimal-point

1790425
python	php
i m working on a project in php 5.3.1 where i need to send a json string to a webservice in python but the result i get from json_encode does not pass as a valid json i m using jslint to checked validity

1790427
digits	zero
but looking at the example i think the decimal datatype might come in handy if the numbers of digits required after zero is small around 2-4 and the numbers of digits before decimal is also small around 10-12

1790428
selectedindex	selecteditem
it seems that the listbox is populate after the initialization and the selectedindex will become 0 after all.same story for setting the selecteditem to null

1790428
selected	listbox
it is rather unlikely that you want to make use of master-detail binding and then have no currently selected item in your listbox all the time

1790429
any	set
if the query don t result any row you can set the header for 404 - not found and redirect to a 404 page

1790439
exception-handling	error-handling
it s probably throw cross-thread exception-handling and because you do not have error-handling it s crash at the return points of the new splashform

1790439
output	mode
.when you run the application in debugging mode checked your output windows to see if any exception-handling messages show up

1790445
webserver	upload
its running fine.but .when i made .some changes in the class added few proprties methods and upload to the webserver in production its not getting affected in the live site.but this works pretty good .when runs in local .so there is no code error .is this because the dlls are dynamically generator in the live server and not getting updates

1790450
callback	methods
the formatter appears to work for most cases until i try to use it to call a remote methods to which i pass a callback to a cao

1790454
variables	boolean	boolean	int	contains	any
for sure object key cannot contains spaces or any non-unicode characters unquoted variables can be only boolean int float object and arrays value strings should always be quoted

1790464
selected	listbox
you need to set the index to -1 this tells the listbox not to selected anything

1790465
json	xml
both cxf and jaxb are xml oriented more than json oriented

1790470
jdom	xom	dom4j	xom	dom4j	jdom
there are at least 3 different ways to implements the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libs like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1790470
jdom	xom	dom4j	xom	dom4j	jdom
using xom or jdom or dom4j to wrap the xml is also possible and the learning curve is a lot lower than for sax or xslt

1790473
seam	jsf
how is that possible with jsf seam

1790475
calloc	malloc
variables stored on the heap are the variables which you initiated using explicit memory allocation routines such as malloc calloc new etc

1790485
constructor	object
the contract for a constructor is very simple - you give me zero one or more parameters and i ll give you back a construct object

if the thread always terminate the main thread after 60 seconds perhaps you d be better using thread.join in your main thread with a timeout

1791838
printf	strlen
on the other hand since strlen str determines string-length by count the numbers of characters before a null is encountered it doesn t offer you any benefit over just using printf without a field width specified

1791838
printf	strlen
the upshot the only case where specifying a field width for a string is helpful is .when the string isn t guaranteed to be null-terminated or the classic case of using printf to write to a buffering that may not be big enough to hold the contents of str but in that case you d have to determine string-length using something other than strlen

do note that rollback cannot recover if you had multiple separate transactional such as multiple push or commit cmd in the rsync windows or run destructive operations that tamper with history such as git-rebase hg stripes and some mq cmd

c++	lua
i would like to be able to initializer these object in lua yet pass them around in c++ using pointers to that interface which they resemble

1792678
c++	lua
as such i can imagine creating a c++ implementation of the interface which would act as a handler for said lua object yet i don t know how to do this

1792678
c++	lua
the class would act as the lua object representative or proxy in the c++ world
