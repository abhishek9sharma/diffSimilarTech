gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
the intellisense only gives me equals gethashcode gettype and tostring as options

1100012
contains	set
the advantage of this approach is that the assembly contains the forms can swapped out for a different assembly with a different set of forms

1100018
instances	private
if you want to be sure that only b operates on a make the instances of a private and expose a protected interface from b to its descendants

1100030
contains	lookup
then you can perform a hash lookup for each words in the text block and find out if the words list contains the words

1100082

japplet	jwindow
for convenience jframe dialog jwindow japplet and jinternalframe by default forwarding by default all call to the add remove and setlayout methods to the contentpane

1100138
contains	lookup
if the common pattern is lookup - find-it - overwrite-it then you could replace the value-type to a list that contains the value-type

1100210
repository	entity
in addition to the common methods a repository will have entity specific methods such as getcustomerswithpastdueaccounts

1100210
dependency-injection	inject
then you could use dependency-injection to inject customerrepository at runtime

1100211
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiview
uinavigationcontroller from a uiview that is a subviews of the uiviewcontroller mentioned

export	report
i am using report service 2005 and am export the report into excel

1100236
export	report
but .when i export the report to excel the value where textbox should be is the reference to the location of textbox1 and textbox2 in the excel sheet instead of the value

platform	anycpu
platform anycpu c windows microsoft.net framework v3.5 microsoft.common.targets 539 9 data-conversion

1100240
keyboard	mouse
depending on your mouse software you should be able to map those keyboard shortcuts to your mouse s back forwarding button

1100285
keydown	keyup
is it absolutely necessary to tracking down every keyboard notification keydown and keyup events

1100315
onkeydown	onkeyup

python	ruby
that jives really well with the ruby way of looking at the world but doesn t really follow the python way

1100345
configuration	logging
via configuration it is also possible to place interceptor before and after the web-services call if you want to do logging etc

1100356
postgresql	mysql
i m starting a new opensource project for real estate and wanted to focus on using mysql but would also like to ensure it works in postgresql

1100384
triggers	insert
it looks to me like you ve got some kind of triggers on the destination table that s firing trg_mytable is a giveaway it s probably doing something like insert a timestamped recording into an audit table somewhere and is getting confused

1100396
32-bit	64bit
as mentioned in this question comments there are certain disadvantages .when moving from 32-bit .net to 64bit .net

1100402
ruby	php
if your using .net java you could use an orm object relational mapper like hibernate nhibernate for .net and that will take care of you db interoperability for php or ruby i would look for something equivalent

1100409
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2 and firefox 3.5 do and i assume other browsers as well

1100409
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3.5 opera 9.6 opera 10 google-chrome 2 safari 4

1100423
put	get
it works for put as well as .post and get

1100424
smarty	twig
there are other templates engines such as smarty twig etc. that make the syntax even more concise

1100449
python	ruby
.so just checked very quickly ruby 1.9.1-p129 appears to use 1.5x .when append to an arrays and python 2.6.2 uses 1.125x plus a constants in object listobject.c

1100455
selected	button
the image in the selected button below continue to appear in designer but with issues

1100457
click	mouse

textbox	button
create a form with 2 textbox and a button

1100458
textbox	button
create a form with 2 textbox and a button

1100461
filtering	grouping
in the case where it is not filtering the elements are grouping by the value of that conditional - the conditional is calculated once

1100478
configuration	environment
however i put together a short example that could be used as an integration-testing to run on different systemd configuration environment

1100479
buffering	streaming
if your bytes originate from a streaming the nio bufferinging can use direct mode which creates a buffering backed by native resources

1100501
order	add
actually now that i look at this you may want to add time and .sort by time and date .so that way two post in the same day are show in the correct order

1100514
authentication	logout
the idea is that even though the browser s still sending authentication data we re just ignoring it because the user chose to logout

1100514
authentication	login
whenever a new login request is sent to the browser all the authentication data is erased .so the user is able to log back in any time

1100541
value	field
assuming you re only dealing with those four field city zip state country there are finite value for all field except for city and even that i guess if you have a big city list is also finite

1100546
protected	public
i know in c# what restrictions access-modifiers like private public protected etc

1100551
development-environment	virtualbox
an alternate route would be to use something like virtualbox and just install your development-environment database whatever on there

1100552
filtering	grouping
another solution i realized would work is to revers the order of my query and perform the grouping before i perform the filtering

1100563
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my xcode sdk to versioning 3.1.3 and my iphone os to 3.0

1100569

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i can t help with the mysql part but i do something very similar with both sql-server and oracle

1100692
32-bit	64bit
migrating 32-bit managed-code to 64bit

1100692
32-bit	64bit
unless your application uses data that doesn t fit into 32-bit memory or makes heavy use of 64bit operations you may not see much if any improvement

1100692
managed-code	native-code
from native-code to managed-code or

1100717
webforms	asp.net
as long as they know how asp.net webforms work things should be fine

1100718
vbscript	basic
basic doubt...if qtp generator vbscript code as we recording actions can t we directly write vbscript code and get rid of qtp which does the same thing too

1100726
any	set	arguments	default
if the criterion are set then i write the sql for the recordsource on-the-fly if they aren t set i just use the default recordsource and any filtering passed in the openreport arguments

1100733
linux	unix
what is the corresponding concept in linux unix

1100739
selected	checkbox
selected the grant or deny checkbox as appropriate

1100747
copy-paste	undo-redo
the problem we are seeing is that the standards actions like undo-redo cut copy-paste and .so on all display the default icons for the corresponding actions

1100748
visualvm	hprof
to analyse a hprof memory-dump you can use quite a numbers of tools such as eclipse-memory-analyzer include with eclipse 3.5 galileo visualvm or netbeans

1100753
ebnf	bnf
scala s parsing is a backtracking parsing .so it can deal with pretty much any bnf or ebnf

1100788
radio-button	selected
selected the radio-button under the remove column for every previous versioning item

1100797
innodb	myisam
depending on your database storage engine innodb myisam etc you may be able to lock the table while a person is modifing it

1100798
javascript	dom
if you need to generator the css during dynamic page creation you can easily inject it into the dom at the bottom of the head using javascript

1100800
tcp-ip	udp
i work on a product that supports both udp ip and tcp-ip communication between client and server

1100800
udp	tcp
wild guess coming up the udp to tcp code ratio is probably about 80 20

1100800
tcp-ip	udp
we have extra overhead with the udp communication because we have some of the same stuff that you get for free with tcp-ip checksums sequences numbers etc.

1100800
udp	tcp
for example wireshark showed that a request for the next set of recording was 80 bytes with udp and 84 bytes with tcp

1100803
contains	set
sendmessage last param should be a pointers to-char contains text you want to set

1100803
selected	cell
how to get selected cell from tdbgrid in delphi 5

1100852
any	set
if results are found in these tables it should add them to any results it found for the other words and return a set where the recording is in both these sets

1100859
runas	cmd
try creating a batch-file with the runas cmd in it

1100864
click	mouse
.so if a link has been visited you click the link and have been taken to the target page the link is no longer a link you can t click it no mouse change etc

1100866
versioning	upgrade
functionality that should be in a nice libs where it can be easily upgrade with each new versioning of the framework is instead spewed out in generator model and controllers code where it ll end up intermixed with your code

1100868
udp	tcp
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1100869
deprecated	javadoc
according to the javadoc httpservletresponse.setstatus int status string messages is deprecated due to ambiguous meaning of the messages parameter.

1100878
navigation	styling
css should really be handling this because it is a navigation styling issue

1100906
ruby-on-rails	django
use a asp.net-mvc framework - asp.net-asp.net-mvc ruby-on-rails django etc since this allows for far more separation of presentation and logic

1100910
metaphone	soundex
you should also investigate metaphone or soundex but to support that you will need to pre-index your data in a separate table or pre-calc the methaphone or soundex codes for each words in a separate field and index that as well

1100916
json	xml	any	set	contains	any	contains	set
have you looked at creating a set of error response meaning specific xml or json content or whatever you are using as a transfer language that contains the error messages or code and any other useful information

1100924
decrement	increment
another way of doing this would be to put hooks directly in my code that creates and destrys comment object to synchronous call some methods on blogentry to increment decrement the comment count

1100976
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if the model already implements inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged what s wrong with the view binding directly against the model

1100986
value	field
i think the answer is not directly - looking at the amd systemd programming specifications the asid field in the viewmodel control block is simply a up to 32-bit id which the hypervisor sets to a unique value for each instances of a viewmodel and is used as an additional tag in the tlb lookup

1100992
c++	lua
i read through the section in modern c++ design and i think i ve got a good enough understand on using loki for this with the exception-handling of not using the smallobject - lua just wants raw memory .so i took a first stab at using the smallobjallocator directly

1100998
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged are not the only aspects to be considered.

1101018
constructor	object
doesn t object initialization outside of a constructor break encapsulation

1101018
constructor	private
shouldn t the _astring member be private and initializer via a call to the constructor constructor omitted here

1101020
getter	setter
it turns out that i had some properties tagged as data-members that had getter but no setter

1101020
data-members	instances
i had to search for all instances of data-members and looked at them one by one to find the properties that were missing a setter

1101023
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 3.5 failed on me a long time ago while tomcat would propagate the messages just fine

1101037
any	set
if you want the class user to be able to set read the variables at any time then make it public

1101039
linux	unix
since the application runs in a linux environment i figured i d try using unix cmd like mount and tar

1101050
getter	setter
if you consider properties as getter and setter i don t believe it will break encapsulation

1101055
constructor	object
doesn t object initialization outside of a constructor break encapsulation

1101081
exception-handling	try-catch
one idea i have is to wrap the body of every javascript function in a try-catch block and upon catching an exception-handling log the named of the function and then throw the error to the global handler

1101082
value	field
one suggestion would be to add a hidden-field along with each fake datasource field value

1101105
administration	account
generally this problem is solved by installing a windows service which runs as systemd or an administration account

1101119
javascript	dom
you want the dom and the dom features with javascript i assume

1101129
protected	public
is it possible to restrict an attributes usage to just protected and public variables

1101158
javascript	dom
dom scripting was an interesting book taught me a lot about javascript

1101190
arrays	loops
loops through the arrays of wordss with foreach and checked if the current words exists in the ua string using strpos

1101193
mouseclick-event	mousedown
dynamically adding containerss like picturebox and caption for each image handling the mousedown or mouseclick-event for the containers and perhaps drawing a red square around it to show that it is selected

1101199
error-code	hresult
.so far my digging indicates that the error-code is really the hresult value

1101219
selected	textbox
lets say i have five textbox and a dropdown box in my flex application how can i make the progress-bar fill up .when there is text in each box and the dropdown selected

1101220
implements	abstract
the writedescriptionto is abstract to force constraints to implements it

1101251
python	ruby
personally i find ruby to be superior to python in many ways that comprise what i d call consistent expressiveness

1101259
ienumerator	ienumerable
fundamentally all an ienumerable promise is that it can return an ienumerator which itself provides a simple contract that happens to have a fancy language construct to make it easy to use foreach

1101265
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
as a quick answer i would say change memberexception to an unchecked-exception extends runtimeexception and see if you get the same results

1101272
dwarf	elf
any recommendations for a good cross-platform libs for reading elf file debugging information in dwarf format

1101298
ubuntu	debian
specifically ubuntu debian

1101305
launchd	daemons
i have a pair of launchd daemonss one of which is a true daemons runs as root and one of which is a gui agent that runs as a per gui session basis session types aqua

1101313
keyword	lexical
the lexical analyser must determine the keyword being seen foreach not for and .so on.

1101314
attributes	properties
the documentation says that the properties attributes mpmediaplaylistpropertiesplaylistattributess will return the attributess associated with a playlist in the form of an nsnumber contains an nsinteger object

1101339
thickbox	jquery
i had a similar problem - thickbox works fine on data that loads in page - but .when you return dynamic-content using jquery ajax cmd after the page has loaded - links contains in that new data would not open thickbox.

1101339
thickbox	jquery
as an example - this is a code-snippets of how i got thickbox working on content i dynamically generator using the jquery ajax cmd which i think is similar to jquery s load methods that you use

1101357
sql-server	oracle
a sql-server database corresponds more to an oracle user schema

1101360
stderr	stdout
do i have to do this and bind the stdout stderr somehow to a newly created console page or is there another way

1101362
response	timeout
set your caching timeout in the server response .so that ie doesnt caching

1101376
windows-server	windows-vista
if you use windows-vista 7 or windows-server 2003 or newer you could use shadow-copy

1101380
hide	show
rather than having this feature fail .when it is used and then show an appropriate error messages to the user i d prefer an ability to silently checked if root is available first and if not hide the respective options in the first place

1101386
numeric	zero
an other thing that has bitten me more than once is trying to use excel to process some chars or varchars that are numeric except they have leading zero such as 007

1101397
aquamacs	emacs
as a long-time emacs user i would recommand against exotic versioning of emacs aquamacs falls in this catagory but this starter kit thing as well and let me try to explain why just for the sake of finger-training and brain-training also

1101397
configuration	environment
almost every flavour of unix comes with a preinstalled emacs .so the hope is that you ll never have to re.sort to vi even in the most hostile environment for instances editing a etc configuration file on a remote hp-ux server via ssh

1101406
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	hsqldb	hsqldb	mysql
let me see if i understand your points but starting your hsqldb you can consider as a normals database like mysql postgresql

1101414
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
where applicable you should throw exception-handling of the correct types eg argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception in .net

1101424
aquamacs	emacs
for the subset of emacs that i use there s very little difference between using aquamacs and gnu emacs on a linux box

1101430
digits	base
.so i have a set of base digits like bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz34679

1101453
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
all my code is stored on a remote-server in .sourcesafe .so i don t need to really accommodate for that but i ll regularly jump into perl python php for separate side tasks

1101460
constructor	private
this opens up a lot of other options such as making the action properties private settable perhaps providing a constructor to set it etc

1101462
extends	super
in one of my project my pom extends that super pom and i would like to add an additional resource

1101462
extends	super
is there a way to extends the super pom s resources

1101463
32-bit	64bit
if i am not mistaken the double in 32-bit environment will take up 16 digits after 0 whereas the double in 64bit will take up 32-bit am i right

1101467
32-bit	16-bit
for instances int was 16-bit wide in 16-bit dos and 32-bit wide in win32

1101487
common-lisp	lisp	output	mode	expression	evaluation
it would really make this experience much more enjoyable if i could find a decent intro to setting up an emacs environment for common-lisp that allows me to edit in lisp mode in one window-functions and variables autocomplete would be really nice here see the results of evaluation single expression both output and return-value in another as well as be able to tell the whole buffering to be evaluated and run while i see the results somewhere

1101502
cakephp	joomla
several open source project are using it like joomla in the other hand cakephp take the code model to make it own acl systemd

1101515
directory	folder
the last time i had that kind of problem i made an include directory out of my public_http root folder and added its path to the include_path ini configuration

1101517
lookup	any
is there any reference implementation of a scsf cab where a lookup pop-up windows is created from the shell and data is send over between the main shell and the pop-up windows

1101521
lisp	tcl
this usage model works for shell tcl lisp anything with an interpreter.

1101532
contains	any
if the result doesn t contains any escaped characters it works well but if not i get a unrecognized escape sequences exception-handling

1101557
selected	button
click the pencil button at the fbml box selected move to wall tab and then done

1101571
double-quotes	single-quotes
in my experience sooner or later you are going to want to put single-quotes double-quotes and or entire xml document into a member and if it s an attributes you re going to be cursing at the person who used attributess instead of elements

1101580
firefox	safari
firefox safari will work just fine but ie will fail to set a cookies if it comes from a domain with an underscore.js

1101583
base-class	inherited
for troubleshooting does this error occur if you were to extends the base-class product instead of the inherited class

1101599
double	int
conversion to and from int float double

1101607
updating	updates
updates - i m updating instead of commenting because there are no response yet

1101610
instances	private
note that the string-based dictionary caching i use in the .post is terribly inefficient - you ll want to caching the delegation to a private instances like in your example

1101612
internet-explorer	safari
tosource does not work in internet-explorer or safari

1101617
debugging	trace
i took a trace with debugging diag and the report points to one of the threads that is taking up 11.358 cpu time vs 0.687 for the closest runner up

1101625
required	checked
for uppercase letters it is easy to checked using character.isuppercase c but for all the symbols such as and various punctuation are not considered uppercase although they do required shift to be pressed inorder to generator thier keystroke

1101642
protected	public
the getre.sourcefilename methods is protected .so we will have to wrap it in a public methods to expose it to the outside world

1101660
selected	button
1. upon initialization if i selected multiplayer the button are still disabled

1101663
shark	gprof
the general consensus over the past few years seems to be that apple would rather you use shark instead and they ve been very lax about fixing bugs and such with gprof

1101682
selected	button
you probably want to disable the button the ai selected as well

1101719
click	mouse
the main rea.son is that you can set the mouse cur.sor to become a small hand .when you hover over the button .so it gives back information to the user that this can be click

1101741
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate works very well with oracle in my experiences as does llblgenpro not free but has a reasonably priced per-developer license for the entity mapping designer

1101805
contains	elements
the simpler and cleaner solution is for the class to contains an elements which is of types base-class which has the possible states as child lasses

1101860
contains	set
the outer-join is intended to address the cases where you wish to selected a set of recording from a primary table which may or may not have related recording contains in a secondary table

1101918
linked-list	queue
are you talking about the stl containers classes where you can have a queue bitset vector linked-list etc

1101920
implements	extends
in the jsp world the extends functionality is not part of vanilla jsp and is implements using third-party libs sitemesh or tile

1101923
vb.net	vb6
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time .so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1101953
any	set
to get the most bang for your buck in terms of memory you could use any int types and set manipulate individual bits via bit-masks etc

1101953
16-bit	8bit
the string example above would work ok however again its not significantly different than the shorts here you are now just representing either 0 or 1 with an 8bit value as opposed to 16-bit value

1101969
shell	bash
2 misuse of shell built-in according to bash documentation

1102004
entity-relationship	diagram
an excellent technique you can use is called entity-relationship diagram

1102004
entity-relationship	er-diagram	entity-relationship	diagram	er-diagram	diagram
a very useful rule-of-thumb to remember .when using entity-relationship diagram is that most of the time almost always a box in the er-diagram is a table in the database

1102046
joomla	drupal
i d have a look at drupal as psu_kardi suggests or joomla

1102066
dynamic-programming	branch-and-bound	linear-programming	branch-and-bound
operational research linear-programming optimization start with simplex with matrix notation i personally call this complex then try a branch-and-bound and adventure yourselfinto dynamic-programming

1102080
value	field
comp field in cobol are supposed to hold the binary value

1102082
arrays	loops
if arrays is lower on stack than i this code will loops infinite because it mistakenly accesses and zero arrays 10 which is i

1102089
default-value	arguments
you could alternatively use functools.partial self.dostuff item with an import functools at the top of course which is another fine solution but i think i d go for the simplest and most common fake default-value for arguments idiom

1102092
instances	private
i don t think you can access the instances variables structure in this case from outside because it is private

1102098
treeview	listview
while what she does is more geared to treeview which don t have any virtualization because they grouping by default the lessons learned could definitely be applied to a custom listview that has virtualizing groupinging

1102098
treeview	listview
obviously display the items like in a treeview has some diffrences such as selection of the grouping nodes from a listview with groupinging but that could be fixed by catching the selectionchanged

1102104
attributes	properties
just for your future info to set the autosize properties to false in the properties windows you need to set an attributes -

1102117
shutdown	exit
java offers no guarantees about what happens on an exit apart from attempting to run shutdown hooks if the exit is a clean one

1102125
order	add
interestingly if you add an extra int ret2 in function1 then on my systemd the order is correct whereas its out of order for just 3 local-variables

1102137
value	field
for example to store an numeric field of value 987 we would required 3 +1 divided by 2 2 hence an comp-3 field of length 2 bytes can store a value of +999 to -999 as the limit

1102137
numeric	digits
.so an 7 digits numeric numbers would required 7 +1 8 2 4 byte in size

1102137
numeric	digits
.so the comp-3 field of size 4 bytes can store an numeric digits of +999 9999 to -999 9999 digits

1102137
value	field
in case of the above question to move the decimal portion of the numbers need to defined an variables which can store only the decimal portion and move the value to that field which would hold just the decimal portion

1102137

binary	hex
any such apis which do exist will almost certainly be doing the encode to a byte arrays perform appropriate binary operation decode opaque binary-data to hex base64

1102306

i ve put together a small function that yield results in both firefox 2+ and safari 3+ but apparently doesn t even register in ie 7

1104264
firefox	safari
again this works in firefox and safari but has no effect on the same divs in ie

1104265
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome all methods work properly

1104266
reflection	runtime
you can t demand that t is an interface .so you d have to use reflection at runtime to assert this

1104268
simulated-annealing	np-complete
i am using simulated-annealing to solve an np-complete resource scheduling problem

1104274
scala	java
scala sits on top of the jvm seamlessly integrated with existing java code and has many features that java doesn t

1104277
constructor	object
assuming the code-snippets you posted is the exact code that s causing problems the only place this could occur is if one of location#getz ... location#hashcode or location#equals object mutates the state of location or the location constructor or one of these methods starts a thread that randomly changes the state of the location instances but i think we can rules that out

1104278
keyboard	mouse
i want to trap windows mouse and keyboard input with the help of event given by windows for detection systemd idle or not in c++

1104278
keyboard	mouse
anyone can tell me if windows event to trap the mouse and keyboard input is available or not.

1104279
value	field
normally i d just have the action in my form go to where the 3rd party s form points and then have all the same id named value for my own field but there are several problems with this

1104283
value	field
a field for consumption value at ports or sailing

1104283
value	field
the second way i was thinking of storing these value was to just have a field for each and zero out the other one based on the fuel types the user chooses

1104317
contains	any
i have also tried to put the cmd resources on a stackpanel contains this stackpanel without any change

1104322
postgresql	mysql
i was having similar problems with mysql and postgresql but no problems with sqlite

1104322
postgresql	mysql
this is how i solved the problem with postgresql didnt test this trick with mysql but id asume it would solve it as well

1104344
mouseenter	mouseover
i have always used the mouseover event but while reading the jquery documentation i found mouseenter

1104344
mouseleave	mouseout
also applies for mouseout vs mouseleave

1104350
mysqlimport	mysqladmin
pl mysql_safe mysqladmin mysqlshow mysql_tzinfo_to_sql mysqltest mysqlbackup mysql_multi mysql mysqlumpslow mysqlcheck mysql_upgrade mysqlimport comp_err mysql myisamchk innochecksum

1104365
selection	cell
i now want to building a very similar view with a list of the same kinds of items and some additional controls and different behavior on cell selection

1104381
mouseover	mouseout	event-bubbling	mouseout	event-bubbling	mouseover	event-bubbling	mouseleave	event-bubbling	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
mouseenter and mouseleave do not react to event-bubbling while mouseover and mouseout do

1104391
python	php
i ll paraphrase the answer to how do i include a php scripting in python

1104392
jquery	dojo
i used prototype mootools dojo and lately jquery and i am very satisfied with the help they provide

1104401
put	get
i want to get the text of every row and put that text into an arrays

1104405
debugging	trace	logging	trace
configuring format of output and logging levels trace debugging error etc

1104417
buffering	streaming
you can create a discarding streaming buffering and associate it with your streaming

1104418
subclassing	superclass
you do it all the time the outlet for the view in uiviewcontroller is defined in a superclass you subclassing for each of your view controllers

1104441
filtering	sorting
apple suggests subclassing nsarraycontroller inorder to change sorting filtering behavior

1104448
value	field
if you are required to sum up value across recording then your second methods might be preferable as it would be more difficult to accidentally sum ifo180 and ifo360 value as they would be in different field

1104455
value	field
i d have a separate table or storage area somewhere that stored the max min and sum value associated with each field in your original query and updates those value every time i updatess and added a table recording

1104455
populate	row
after the original query to populate these value is complete which is the almost the same as the query you posted you re essentially reducing your final query to getting one row from a data table rather than computing everything all at once

1104476
json	xml
output escaping isn t just to guard against malicious or accidentally borked input it ensures that the output is thoroughly sanitised and treated as having no special meaning in the surrounding output format whether that s html xml json or whatever

1104479
scala	java
i ll tell you my little per.sonal experience and how i found that it wasn t .so easy to integrated scala with existing java libs

1104479
scala	java
i wanted to get started with something easy and as i thought that scala was very well suited for scientific computation i wanted to do a little wrapper around jama java matrix libs .

1104479
scala	java
my initial approach was to extends the matrix types with a scala class and then overload the arithmetic operators and call the java native methods but

1104479
scala	java	subclassing	superclass
as far as i know by reading the manual the parameters of the primary constructor are al.so implicit field of the class .so i would end with one arrays arrays double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant

1104529
baud-rate	parity
there are four parameters that govern if both sides can understand each other baud-rate bits-per-byte usually 8 parity bits even parity odd parity none or always 1 or 0 and stop bits

1104533
configuration	installation
i need to describe installation operations and configuration

1104534
any	set
basing a new site in a directory outside of the default xampp http root basically any path that will be accessible via http must have explicit permissions set

1104534
hide	show
it include a menu option to hide show hidden-files among many other useful features

1104547
boolean	int
.when i defined columns in mysql i generally use int varchar 255 text and the occasional enum for boolean

1104579
csv	zip
if anything will do you could simply zip the csv file

1104581
jquery	.post
if you want to create a way to directly pass php cmd and directions via ajax the only way i could see it is by using a php eval on code that is sent to it via .post or get in jquery

1104593
perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl
to consume an xml service use java javascript ruby perl python whatever

1104601
defined	declare
to defined local inputbindings i just declare the input in window.inputbindings or usercontrol.inputbindings

1104609
textbox	button
in the create view there are a few textbox that correspond to my table columns and a single submit button that creates my new database row somehow

1104655
sql-server	oracle
i m developing an asp.net application with database factory-pattern which allows the application to support both sql-server and oracle

1104655
sql-server	oracle
i ve created an abstract-class that has the methods common to sql-server and oracle like the createconnection and createcommand methods

1104655
sql-server	oracle
this class is implements by sql-server and oracle classes

1104655
sql-server	oracle
now is there an easy way to write inline sql queries with parameters common to both sql-server and oracle

1104655
sql-server	oracle
i mean i understand that we use symbols in sql-server and in oracle for parameters

1104661
solaris	linux
my module is multiplatform and runs on windows solaris and linux and similarly the peer machine can be running on any os

1104695
subclassing	superclass
is it because the jvm knows that dosomething has a call to super.dosomething or because calling a subclassing methods will always acquire a lock on the superclass as well

1104742
csv	xml
excel can open files in the format of csv and xml - it can also generator the schema file

1104767
push	pull
the serialization class can either have methods on it that are used to push pull the real object in and out of serialization or you could use a separate data mapping class this might be better if you have serious versioning concerns

1104767
getter	setter
that way your main application object s are persistent ignorant and you don t have to make compromises - like public getter and setter and attributes - just to support serialization

1104769
object-reference	instances
it gives me the ubiquitous object-reference not set to an instances of an object exception-handling

1104773
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m currently porting an asp.net webforms application to asp.net-mvc

1104786
packets	subnet	mac-address	subnet	mac-address	packets	traffic	packets	traffic	subnet
if your peer machines are on a different subnet and therefore traffic between you and the peer is passing through a router then there s no way to do what you want -- the mac-address of the packets you receive will be the mac-address of the router which forwarded them to you as that s the link-layer device you re communication with

1104786
packets	subnet	mac-address	ethernet	mac-address	subnet	mac-address	packets	ethernet	packets
if the peer machines are on the same subnet then the incoming packets will contains the mac-address of the peer in the ethernet header.

1104786
network-interface	packets
your options are pretty much limited to either packets-capturing on the network-interface you re listening on to get the entire packets or using whatever tools your systemd provides to checked the local arp table

1104786
winpcap	libpcap
if after all that you re still determined look into libpcap winpcap for packets capturing which is the most portable option which comes to mind

1104786
solaris	linux
to checked the local arp tables linux os x solaris and windows all provide an arp command-line utility but the syntax is likely to vary

1104802
httphandler	pagemethods
a simple way to do this would be as you said simply make an ajax call to a pagemethods asp.net-mvc action httphandler or web service that returns the required value from the session

1104804
directory	folder
in this application i have created a folder in the application directory

1104815
primitive	int
should i not be using a primitive int types to store the numbers

1104830
sql-server	oracle
the only way to write one query that will work for both oracle and sql-server is to use only the syntax that is common to both platform

1104830
sql-server	oracle	database-agnostic	oracle	database-agnostic	sql-server
i ve done a lot of this types of programming database-agnostic software and with .net a relatively pain-free way of doing this is to write your main application to work entirely with ado.net datatables dataset with a wrapper class that handles generator the datatables from either oracle or sql-server tables under-the-hood and also handles persistent changes made to the datatables back into oracle or sql-server

1104857
configuration	logging
it uses common.logging which can then be mapped to log4net or to any other custom logging framework via the configuration file

1104865
debugging	trace	logging	trace
as for debugging logging then i simply use trace call and sysinternals debuggingview or text files to log the output of trace call

1104890
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript are two such languages

1104892
push	pull
gethash pull out the whole object .so you can just modify it in-place rather than telling push how to look it up again

1104893
arguments	default
arguments vararguments varkw default inspect.getargumentspec object

1104924
subclassing	superclass
if i think that subclassing should have a protected way to take effect on the state defined in the superclass i make a protected setter .

1104928
associations	model
i m trying to remove the associations and leave the user entity with a scalar properties companyid but still have the company entity in the model mainly to increase performance i don t need to full entity attached to it

1104928
associations	model
after i regenerate the model following additional changes in the schema etc. i m getting the company associations once again on the user object along with the companyid properties which of course causes errors of mapping since i m having 2 mapping to the same companyid field in the database

1104953
arguments	undefined
the order of arguments evaluation is undefined in c except for || comma and ternary operators .so value for second occurrence of n could vary

1104953
decrement	increment
the rules of thumb never use variables you are increment decrement twice in one expression

1104964
webforms	asp.net
lets say i have a asp.net webforms website and i have a paged gridview

1104964
attributes	properties
inorder to implements his suggestion i created a control adaptor for link button which will allow it to rendering the href attributes if you give it one and put the postback javascript in the onclientclick but it makes it .so you can t use the onclientclick properties at the same time as the href

1104965
environment	restart
if you edited the correct php-ini and it does not reflect your change you might want to restart your web service as many environment will only load the php-ini .when the server starts

1105010
pointers	stack
since .net value-type managed-c++ struct are stored on stack why is it or alternatively is it actually necessary to pin_ptr them inorder to pass a pointers to an unmanaged function

1105010
pointers	stack
is it not therefore fundamentally unsafe to pass any pointers to any value-type on stack to any unmanaged functions without first pinning them

1105030
selected	checkbox
is it possible to include a servicedependency based on whether a checkbox was selected in a wix application

1105031
32-bit	64bit
i have a 32-bit com component that is used mostly by asp we also have the 64bit versioning

1105031
32-bit	64bit
can i install regsvr the 64bit versioning on the same machine as the 32-bit versioning obviously in a different folder and have my existing 32-bit applications continue to use the 32-bit component whilst my 64bit applications consume the 64bit versioning

1105058
derived-class	base-class
in other words given a base-class shape and a derived-class rectangle

1105069
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit windows the registry and filesystems is redirected for 32-bit applications

1105069
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
registration for the 32-bit com dll s will be under a separate location in the registry hklm software wow6432node classes and your com components should live in separate folder 64bit under program files and 32-bit under program files x86

1105069
32-bit	64bit
it is possible that the component itself could prevent this - for instances if it creates global resources that would wind up conflicting between the 32-bit and 64bit versioning

1105069
32-bit	64bit
32-bit and 64bit versioning of webbrowser-control on the same systemd

1105071
pointers	stack
is it not therefore fundamentally unsafe to pass any pointers to any value-type on stack to any unmanaged functions without first pinning them

1105077
constructor	object
calling a constructor will always give you an object of the types of the constructor

1105094
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear also supports reading from writing to xls and xlsx as well as clipboard support cut copy-paste which can handle excel content on the windows clipboard

1105097
jsonp	ajax
you ll have to use jsonp to do cross-domain as far as i know - it s a security exception-handling in ajax

1105126
hide	show
i m using javascript to show hide the menus and a ul for each menu inside the same div as the origin link

1105132
selected	checkbox
for the checkbox that are selected i change it s named before submission

1105133
hide	show
jquery s hide and show don t work and neither do these methods

1105134
ruby	php
looking for mac or windows desktop tools or some sort of server-side scripting php ruby or coldfusion preferred

1105158
put	get
edit as craig stuntz pointed out you can get the route value in a view via viewcontext without having to put them into viewdata first

1105168
value	field
you can defined a class which contains two field your string value plus a timestamp and annotations that class with embeddable

1105168
value	field
you could do it in java with the default initializer value of the field being new date or whatever

1105173
sqldatasource	databound
here s a similar question how to add item to sqldatasource databound list

1105206
hide	show
for example this code hide all elements of the pie class whereas i only want to effect the elements that are currently show and not act on the ones that are currently hidden

1105211
groovy	java	python	java
i know that is better to use python to call pthreads and win api but i would like to know if there is a not .so painful way to call c apis from groovy or at least with java

1105236
required	checked
it would still required reading every line at the outset but it might be faster than doing a checked on each one as you do .so

1105269
groovy	java
is there a java or even groovy libs for this

1105284
versioning	upgrade
if .so it might be an upgrade from an older versioning of sql-server

1105297
nsscanner	nsstring	decimal	hex
this goes in a category of nsstring uses nsscanner for the implementation and handles both hex and decimal numeric character entities as well as the usual symbolic ones

1105312
authentication	login
the problem is that from the admin login page after it properly authentication and creates the new user in the database or updates their info from the ldap server but then returns me to the admin login page indicating that i failed to enter a valid username and passwd

1105333
operators	keyword
if that happened then i d have the problem that .some boolean operators have keyword while others don t .so if alternate keyword were used you might see expression like

1105341
click	mouse
but i still manage to lose the focus by mouse click

1105348
32-bit	64bit
you can effectively get a 64bit int from 2 32-bit int or a 128bit int from 4 32-bit int or indeed any size you required from enough int

1105348
32-bit	64bit
to demonstrate consider the simplest case of representing a 64bit int with 2 32-bit int

1105359
glut	sdl
you could look at glut c qt c++ sdl c

1105360
constructor	object
there s an example on page 557 of advanced php programming of how to declare a constructor which creates an arrays properties but the example code doesn t compile the second object seems to be redundant

1105380
instances	private
it looks like tcpendpoint has a private instances variables called delegation and since it s private this subclassing can t access it

1105431
value	field
set the connection-string to the value in your web-config file and the itemstyle-width for each of your field depending on the types of data and how much spaces you have

1105431
value	field
for the last cell set the td colspan value to the numbers of field in your gridview

1105431
value	field
set up a datasource which gets the each possible value of that field within your table

1105446
attributes	properties
declare an jstl tag with an attributes variables which will have an exception-handling object if there any error occured between the body of tags at the end of tag which have stack-trace and messages properties

1105466
contains	elements
it also contains familiar elements such as

1105476
contains	elements
i have a layout store that contains all of the common visual elements for the other controllers

1105494
functional-programming	imperative-programming
functional-programming is harder to get your head around than imperative-programming

1105494
functional-programming	imperative
most developers don t understand functional-programming concepts and can t even write very good imperative code in c#

1105504
compact-framework	.net
i m working on a .net 3.5 smart-device project and i could really use the combobox dropdown event but the .net compact-framework versioning doesn t have it

1105509
attributes	properties
also inspect the properties and methods of the xmlreader base-class to determine how to get at elements attributes and other xml-entities

1105514
google-chrome	firefox
combining them works great in google-chrome and firefox

1105516
malloc	free
i had just completed the section of the course on malloc and free to the general satisfaction of most of the punters .when the one cobol guy on the course came over and asked

1105516
put	get
this is actually not too far from oo and i think the basic idea you need to get across is that there will be subtly different types of recording with different things you need to do to them and the best way of dealing with this is to put the recording and the things that need done together to create object

1105528
processor	cpu
writing a caching line that is shared between processor forces it to become invalid in the other cpu s keeping the caching in sync

1105534
webserver	nginx
also a good frontend webserver like nginx is way faster than any webapp layer you d have to write to read the blob from the db

1105541
ftp	scp
tar + ftp scp

1105564
.war	jar
maven treats a project as something that creates a single artifact - aka jar file .war file ear file etc

1105566
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
doesn t look right in google-chrome safari firefox either .so this really isn t an ie8 problem

1105566
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in the future design your site to look good in ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

1105569
stderr	stdout
i admit that i don t know much about multithreading but i think what i need is a mechanism to promptly pause inputstream threads one each for stdout stderr .when an user-input is needed and resume once the input is provided to prevent a block

1105569
stderr	stdout
1 is there any way to control the process of taking in inputstream stdout stderr without using read

1105583
attributes	properties
.so what i would suggest is you create .some kind of column attributes to attach to the properties of you entity

1105583
attributes	properties
and then look through those properties attributes and try to lookup the data from those attributes in the sqldatareader

1105601
32-bit	64bit
you can t normally use 64bit int on a 32-bit machine without any outside module

1105605
if-statement	for-loop
your code can at runtime take the function foo and perhaps add another if-statement perhaps change the conditional in the for-loop perhaps replace the call to baz with another function-call

1105610
any	bag
is there any elegant way to checked for this or am i going to have to implements my own paging and add a look ahead until the next bag logic

1105630
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python ruby perl can do this in a few line by using simple regular expression and a directory listing

1105636
scheme	lisp
i would highly recommend structure and interpretation of computer programs which actually uses scheme but that is a dialect of lisp

1105642
udp	tcp
it s a voip application that uses a combinations of udp and tcp to initially set up the connection and do ports tunnel stuff and then uses udp for the streaming data

1105655
markup	xhtml
the html5 validation will not be able to checked the conformance of the facebook markup but it should still be able to checked the conformance of the xhtml

1105659
key-value	key
i have two variables key and value and i want to add them as a key-value pair to a list

1105662
any	set
you may be running on a 64bit os and have your .net .app set to any cpu

1105679
directory	folder
delete the file after you have what you need from it presumably after moving it out of the temp directory using move_uploaded_file to the folder from which you will read it then remove it using unlink

1105682
specifications	w3c
seems like it defers to w3c dom specifications in many aspecificationsts i am not very familiar with that specifications

1105695
web-services	api
spring-ws provides a very nice client api which is currently my tool of choice for talking to remote web-services

1105697
selected	cell
now .when you selected a date on the control it will show the value in the cell you linked it to

1105700
mocking	tdd
i m looking for resources that provide an actual lesson plan or path to encourage and reinforce programming practices such as tdd and mocking

1105726
selected	textbox
funny enough .when i selected an item the correct displaymember is show in the textbox

1105730
javascript	dom
you can add an iframe to the dom via javascript with src set to the url you want to downloading

1105731
sql-server	mysql
if this is a single-user systemd you may want to consider simplexml or if a relational-database is required database engines such as mysql or sql-server would definitely be a better bet

1105733
scala	java
after all scala has about 5 years of age and java was very different 5 years into its own lifespan

1105733
scala	java
native libs scala uses java or .net libs as base for their own

1105733
scala	java
another important difference is due to how sun saw java and epfl sees scala

1105739
webforms	asp.net
a few asp.net webforms

1105739
put	get
i put in a hyperlink to the asp.net-mvc page from one of the standards .html pages and i get a 404 response telling me the requested page does not exist

1105750
row	col
public object getvalueat int row int col

1105752
entity	poco
now i m trying to turn this poco domain model into a set of entity classes using linq mapping

1105753
revision	svn
ordinarily i understand i could use svn keyword and add the revision - but as i understand it svn keyword apply on a per-file basis

1105758
value	field
if you wanted to still display the value using a disabled field you could do that too and rely on the hidden-field for the actual value

1105762
json	xml
make whatever you have the time to do and your server is able to do binary json xml .

1105762
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	safari	opera
the specifications say it does not work for netscape mozilla safari opera and internet-explorer for the macintosh. .

1105765
contains	elements
i don t really understand that or how it produces an infinite list instead of one contains 3 elements

1105769
build-system	cmake
my current build-system is cmake - but at the moment its only capable of building the linux versioning

1105783
hide	show
basically having some trouble with using hover to hide or show an item

1105783
hide	show
problem is if the mouse hovers over the div and leaves too quickly the show hide div will stay visible

1105790
python	php
if python is on a different physical machine than the php scripting i d make sure the php scripting is web-accessible and use urllib2 to call to that url

1105792
udp	tcp
both use openssl under-the-hood and provide similar abstractions for tcp udp and ssl

1105792
udp	tcp
one thing you may need to keep in mind is that ssl is record-oriented instead of the stream-oriented both tcp and udp

1105793
command-prompt	cmd
this is from both cmd and the visual-studio command-prompt

1105799
put	get
if you are willing to put up with a small performance hit on insert these entities you can create a solution to get n of them very quickly

1105808
malloc	free
i suspect an issue is because loki uses malloc free for each chunks as well as .when the size is getmaxobjectsize .

1105812
filesystems	fat
for this strategy what you would need is code for your bootloader to mount the nand flash as a drive and have a fat drivers .so that it can traversal that filesystems and find the image

1105821
revision	updates
edit for the php case it is not possible to have the revision written automatically into a file on checkout or updates

1105831
gnome	xfce
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

are there any field that need to be set explicit in the caml and using the addfieldasxml methods directly to make this code work with custom list templates types

1106974
exception-handling	try-catch
i was thinking that i could try using convert.changetype but this has the problem that if it doesn t convert it will throw an exception-handling and i will be running the dosomework methods often enough to not have to rely on a try-catch to determine whether the convert is valid

1106974
double	int
.so this got me thinking i know that i will be working with numeric types hence t will be any of the following int uint short ushort long ulong byte sbyte decimal float double

derived-class	base-class
i understand overrides a methods function redefines its implementation in the derived-class from its implementation in the base-class

1107101
implements	abstract
myabstractclass1 can implicit implements a methods of myinterface as an abstract methods but can t explicit implements a methods of myinterface as an abstract methods

1107101
implements	abstract
the explicit implementation is private to the class you are implements it on .so it is not accessible to derived classes and thus cannot be abstract

1107101
implements	abstract
you al.so cannot force classes which derive from myabstractclass1 to explicit implements myinterface .so there is no way to ensure the abstract member will ever be implementss

1107105

and why on earth would a testng class extends the junit base-class testcase

1107152
testng	junit
did you have junit tests running successfully that you re not trying to convert to testng or visa versa

as for your question i normalsly just use a class encapsulating connection and cursor but it looks like you may prefer to use an execution context object whose __enter__ methods gives you a cursor while __leave__ commit or rollback depending on whether the termination was normals or by exception-handling

1107314
rollback	commit
but i think this makes commit rollback among other issues a bit murkier

1107319
double-quotes	spaces
and you should add double-quotes around variables .so your scripting will work with file named that have spaces

1107337
getter	setter
.when you defined your bindable sources through the use of getter and setter the binding don t seem to work

1107337
getter	setter
the solution is to declare a bindable event for your getter and dispatcher the event in your setter

typically you would follow the pattern of having a constructor that takes in a resource controllers named and then assign it a list of routes it was responsible for and then mapping it in your global-asax

1107718
processor	cpu
in a multitasking or multithreading processor environment the usual case for a long time now where there are other operations possible while the desired event has not arrived burning cpu and resource access paths leads to an awful waste of process power and time

1107743
derived-class	base-class
a derived-class concrete_with_knobs is 400k larger than its base-class concrete

1107750
jeditable	jquery
you may want to checkout the jquery plugins jeditable the successor to editable

1107752
keyboard	mouse
in systemd preferences keyboard mouse and keyboard shortcuts there s a full keyboard access setting that allows users to configure whether they want tab to enable changing keyboard focus to textbox and lists only or to all controls

1107753
sourcegear-vault	cvs
i m familiar with subversion tfs sourcegear-vault cvs and vss in a windows environment

1107766
value	field
if i change the field value through the browser for example new value and repeat the above step again i get some interesting value

1107773
malloc	free
c++ compilers simply make the default operators new and-operators delete wrap malloc and free or other memory allocation primitive that normally don t know anything about object and types and allocate release raw chunks of memory and thus have to store the size within to know how much to release

1107774
webforms	asp.net
as with asp.net webforms this form is more like an mvp pattern

1107780
malloc	free
i can t imagine an implementation where it wouldn t since the memory allocation functions underlying new and delete will just be like malloc and free type-independent functions that operate on pointers

1107783
python	java
the python versioning of .app engine does support async request .so if porting to python is just unthinkable you may wait in the rea.sonable hope that such functionality will eventually be in the java side too

1107787
contains	set
i set it up for each site .so that etc hosts contains

1107800
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
you can pull specific elements from csv xml or json -- retrieved from urls local files or database

1107823
while-loop	arrays
for high-performance iterator over javascript arrays use either a for or while-loop

1107824
firebird	oracle	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	oracle
if i need to create a generics database handling class for existing rdbmss like sql-server oracle firebird et. which .net abstract-class interface should i use dbconnection dbcommand dbparameter ... or idbconnection idbcommand idbparameter ...

1107829
textbox	button
typical top of the masterpage textbox and button deal

1107838
progress-bar	progress
deciding whether to use a progress-bar or a progress monitor

1107841
value	field
another approach is to order by whether the date field has a value

1107855
attributes	properties
in my opinion this should be the key while the value is a custom object which will have additional properties to hold your other necessary attributes

1107861
vbscript	perl
or even perl java etc as for using batch-file powershell vbscript the one minor thing to take note is that scripting written in them are not portable to nix

1107872
sql-server	oracle
i d leave the actual creation to a factory class and your code should not care if it is talking to a sql-server or db2 or oracle or whatever

1107874
firefox	safari
one other thing is that gwt is adding this same support to normals browsers firefox ie safari .so you can debugging from within them the same way

1107890
keyboard	mouse
last but not least if you do have the headcount budget to hire one more engineer please do but make sure he or she is a software engineer in testing not a warm body banging at the keyboard or mouse for manual-testing -- somebody who s rarin to write and integrated all sorts of automated testing approaches as opposed to spending their days endlessly repeat if they re lucky the same manual-testing sequences

1107914
aggregate	grouping
to use multiple aggregate in linq-to-sql on a table without groupinging the only way i ve found to avoid doing multiple queries is to make a fake grouping

1107918
inkscape	batik
it doesn t work in inkscape - but it does work with the batik toolkit

1107932
hide	show
use the onclientclick events to call the needed hide or show div

1107941
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering

1107942
aggregate	grouping
why would doing a grouping by on a selected which aggregate two inner selecteded cause the query to run .so slow

1107966
hide	show
to hide and show your div using jquery you could do something like

1107988
value	field
this is working fine but on page postback hidden field lose their value

1107990
pointers	stack
but once i m outside the scoping the local stack is gone the arrays is invalid and i ve just got a useless pointers right

1108031
keydown	keyup
edit i only added the keydown and keyup events just to prove that the key presses were getting through

1108046
listbox	textbox
i ve solved my problem by completely ignoring the combobox and creating my own user-controls that has a textbox and a pop-up with a listbox

1108052
hide	show
edit#2 moving all tags down at the tail of the fixed well hide this error and the page show normally

1108057
licensing	platform
i ve used both extensively and these days i d struggle to recommend one over the other assuming of course that considerations such as platform licensing costs and existing team skills are not taken into account

1108058
malloc	free
in pure c you only really have one solution allocation on the heap with malloc and making sure to free afterwards

1108058
fclose	fopen
example the file handle and fopen fclose in addition to allocation stuff there are some things related to the os to handle the file

1108060
standard-library	boost
you don t have to remember about delete ing blahptr -- .when all copies of it go out of scoping boost will delete your std vector object automatically and c++ standard-library will delete the underlying arrays

1108063
linux	unix
you should notice that cscope targets only the unix linux oss

1108065
sql-server	ms-access
my environment ms-access 2007 + odbc sql-server 2005

1108066
exception-handling	try-catch
i tried the same with old way try-catch block but still i am not able to catch that exception-handling in test and test keeps throw errors in runafter methods of junit

1108073
http-get	put
you can call rest service from delphi using http-get put .post delete

1108082
installation	building
i am creating the application ear file using the building file that is include in the seam installation examples

1108104
assign	add
why don t you add a wildcard to the value you re assign to the parameter

1108107
configuration	installation
installation and configuration is a breeze compared to some other open-source bug trackers

1108113
jax-ws	cxf
for me the best documented of the lot is cxf which will generator jax-ws-compliant code that you can then use with any jax-ws libs in your application such as cxf itself or sun s jax-ws-ri and .so on

1108116
quirks-mode	firefox
if firefox 3.5 is occasionally choosing to parsing your page not in its normals quirks-mode but in a variant that respects xml structure that could be your problem

1108118
expression	evaluation
millions lines-of-code work because this is how c and c++ do short-curcuit logical expression evaluation

1108118
expression	evaluation
if the first expression evaluates to false the second will not even start evaluation

1108123
32-bit	64bit
compiled for 64bit as opposed to 32-bit executable

1108127
ubuntu	debian
it s the default versioning of java that comes with many open-source linuxes such as debian ubuntu and fedora

1108167
any	set
in the building settings for you project set the platform target to x86 instead of any cpu

1108167
32-bit	64bit
this will solve problems where your project has hidden dependendencies on 32-bit subsystems that are not available in 64bit

1108167
32-bit	64bit
your application will then run in the 32-bit susbsystem on 64bit windows

1108168
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
you could compile it for x86 instead of any cpu that way it will run against 32-bit libs on a 64bit windows

1108168
32-bit	64bit
or swap 32-bit libs for 64bit .when installning on 64bit windows

1108170
cursor	row
on debugging i can see cursor c contains two columns and one row but .when it comes to line

1108191
implements	abstract
now you can defined an abstract archive class that all archive classes can implements

1108213
internationalization	translation
it handles very difficult internationalization and translation transformation issues which makes it slow

1108218
32-bit	64bit
our application then works fine on 32-bit and 64bit systemd

1108220
testng	junit
looking at the maven-surefire-plugin info i can t see any way to selected a test for testng process only if it also extends a junit 3 class

1108253
python	java
as i want to use this to get comfortable with non-microsoft technologies i don t care which language i use be it java or python plus having no idea about any of them i hope this is a good form of taking my first step in

1108267
assign	add
however i ve temporary add the application user and iis user to administration role and assign fulltrust security policy to my web application using caspol

1108269
put	get
if that is the case the php scripting may be trying to send it internally in which case it ll just disappear while the other target email will get put on to the internet and routed properly

1108273
command-prompt	command-line
the other option is to just open up a command-prompt in the directory where the executable is placed and to run it from the command-line there but then if i want to use the debugger i have to attach it and that s a pain too

1108318
python	java
it has plenty of support for java python and gae as well as many other sundry things

1108323
python	java
eclipse is the best ide to use for both python and java

1108323
python	java
there is the the eclipse-plugin at for java and there is pydev for python at

1108334
selected	checkbox
instead make a completely new form based on the field you need and with checkbox that user will de- selected to disable searching a particular field

1108390
ready	live
also i wouldn t personally trust a machine matching two images to sign off systemd as ready to go live

1108401
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i think you can do that if you use the sharpdevelop ide which is free and really similar to visual-studio

1108422
ref	out
the pl sql block to read out the ref cursor looks a bit strange to me

1108450
jquery	dojo
jquery mootools dojo yui prototype and more are all cross-browser compatible

1108461
jquery	dojo	mootools	extjs
take your pic yui dojo extjs jslib jquery mootools prototype

1108470

1108477
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
you can set the qgraphicsscene s area that will be display by the qgraphicsview with the methods qgraphicsview setscenerect

1108490
dependency-injection	abstract-factory
the code is closed in that it doesn t have to be modified if you add a new factory because you re using dependency-injection and it s open in that you can extends the functionality by writing a new abstract-factory

1108504
groovy	scala
recently one of the creators of the groovy language said in a blog .post he would never have bothered designing groovy if scala had been around at the time

1108504
scala	java
if i look at the capabilities of scala compared to early java its miles ahead

1108504
.when	ready
.when i move from c++ to java the jvm was not ready yet regarding scalability

1108550
carbon	cocoa
cocoa used to work on cs3 with the trick of putting a cocoa bundle inside the main carbon plugins bundle loading it from carbon and issuing a nsapplicationload

1108557
windows-embedded	windows-ce
windows-embedded ce windows-ce 2.0 and later

1108568
python	java
the urlfetch service operates at a higher level of abstraction than individual connections and the native python and java libs that use it are modified to use this service

1108591
cursor	row
you need to move the cursor to the first row with c.movetonext before reading the value

1108597
global-assembly-cache	gac
deploy to the global-assembly-cache gac

1108616
firefox	safari
this will only work in firefox and safari though

1108637
streamreader	streamwriter
this is probably a bad idea - i would create one streamreader and one streamwriter both wrapping netstrm and then you don t need to deal with the binary-data at all

1108641
required	checked
and once the checked is already there it might as well use it skip the call to operators delete too - after all it s required to be a no-op anyway and it will spare an extra meaningless checked for null inside operators delete itself in case the pointers actually is null

1108669
jface	swt
in the end though the ve is not powerful enough that you never have to tweak the code by hand and you ll probably have to learn swt jface by hand anyway

1108678
filtering	sorting
to make life easier it employs a searchlist another prototype i wrote which allows you to do incremental search filtering and live sorting on the listed items

1108687
contains	elements
cannot add a simplecontent column to a table contains elements columns or nested relations

1108692
compatibility	platform
gij hasn t passed the sun compatibility test and should be considered a separate platform for building testing etc

she shouldn t have access to the students table because she could lookup or modify information for any student in the whole university

1108712
getter	setter
- client side add to business object s getter setter rights checker allowing write display data for particular user

1108714
getter	setter
use attr_accessor to add attributes and you will get getter and setter automatically

1108726
cross-join	inner-join
in mysql this implied join is a cross-join which in mysql is equivalent to an inner-join however be aware that a cross-join is not equivalent to an inner-join in standards sql .so whilst your second query may well work if construct correctly with the correct where filtering it s ambiguous

1108726
cross-join	inner-join
however the precedence of the comma-operator is less than of inner-join cross-join left join and .so on

1108726
cross-join	inner-join
this change also applies to statements that mix the comma-operator with inner-join cross-join left join and right-join all of which now have higher precedence than the comma-operator

1108734
contains	set
if you look at the output from set it contains among other things the following

1108743
order	join
the first one allows the order to be null because it s a left join

1108749
postgresql	oracle
my database background is with oracle .so i was surprised to discover that postgresql include schema changes in transactional - if you begin one create a table and then rollback the table goes away

1108757
order	join
in the first instances you may get less recording because only one customer will pass-through to the where conditional if his order are filtering out by the cash conditional in join

1108764
negative-number	decimal-point
.when length is a negative-number numeric_expression is rounded on the left side of the decimal-point as specified by length

1108787
value	field

1108789
division	modulo
using the modulo gives the remainder of the division rand 100

1108799
keyboard	mouse
if you could mention the playoff between controls that would also be appreciated if touch screens a keypad control is provided but if also supporting keyboard mouse input how do you manage the keypad user-interface spaces effectively

1108816
ruby	php
they have a php to ruby reference which could be quite helpful

1108816
ruby	php
the book is full of examples that show the php way and how it compares to the ruby ruby-on-rails way

1108825
value	field
in sharepoint can i use calculated value on a date field to set the format of a date

1108833
python	c++
i am an experienced c++ programmer with average python skills

1108833
executable	jar
is it a jar is it an executable

project-management	project
as for planning a small project you can do a lot of project-management in a spreadsheet before it gets unwieldy

1108847
constructor	object
i tend to include the desired functional object in the constructor .so that things work out of the box .so to speak

1108869
scala	java

scala	java
if something is possible with java then it is possible with scala

1108869
scala	java
scala can call java classes

1108880
python	c++
since scala is fp at least you mentioned it and c++ python is oop it s a good language for you i d say

1108892
environment	building
i m hard-put to envision how a postconstruct could apply to a stateless environment since i always use that function to finish building a bean s state

1108903
perl	c++
while this approach could be developed in c++ it would likely be easier to use a tool such as perl to implements it

1108918
python	perl
we ll be using perl and python scripting to access the database to further normalize the data into several other tables for top talkers interesting traffic etc

1108926
ubuntu	linux
i am working on ubuntu 8.10 linux os

1108941

1108947
macros	vba
i am not very experienced in writing vba macros for excel and i hope i never have to be .so if anyone have a few pointers i d be most grateful

1108959
configuration	environment
annotations also get compiled in some way i guess and it should be quicker than parsing the xml but on the other hand if i want to change my configuration i have to recompile it instead of just changing the xml file which might become even more handy for production environment on customer side

1108965
distance	altitude
edit sql-server 2008 geographic extensions also neglect altitude information .when calculating distance

1108970
keyboard	mouse
our user-interface supported a normals keyboard mouse combo too the touchable button were just standards button controls sized appropriately

1109010
show	next
now the debugger application will start next to the android-emulator and your messages will be show with green text

1109023
any	set
as for keyboard events a qwidget doesn t get any keyboard events unless it has set itself a focuspolicy

1109039
callback	methods
as this methods required a call to a google server you must also pass a callback methods to handle the response

1109055
bazaar	git
is there a place where you guys upload your personal project and also svn i think is the most popular but with git bazaar i dont know if it just a hype or distribute versioning controlling is really the way to go

1109063
configuration	logging
even better modify the configuration run and debugging to load a different logging configuration file

1109069
git-repo	repo
in my git-repo which is tracking a svn repo i have made a numbers of edits to a single file

1109076
selection	cell
do note that selection could be more than one cell .so your checked for a marked cell needs to checked the whole range in .some way

1109090
initializer	getter
in the menus properties getter for my concrete viewmodel implementation i am writing proxy code to reach back into the initializer controllers and request the menu data

1109146
svnadmin	dump
you should be able to do this with svnadmin dump and svndumpfilter

1109153
svnadmin	dump
you need svnadmin dump your repository run it through svndumpfilter to keep the folder you want and then svnadmin load it into the new repository

1109155

object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1109158
filehandle	eof
.when you run on an opened filehandle perl automagically runs through the file line by line until it hits eof

1109161
configparser	pickle
this could load up data from a specific file which could be text json configparser pickle or any suitable format

1109170
value	field
and fetch the value of the field auto_increment

1109177
version-control	git
they offer all kinds of version-control and project-management tools svn git trac etc

1109225
directory	folder
updates since you want to do plugin-style dlls you can keep the dlls in a separate directory and copy them into the exe folder on application startup

1109240
keyboard	mouse
we use two distinct user-interface s one for touch-screen with large bold button and one for mouse keyboard entry

1109240
click	mouse
to help prevent this we disable the enter key-press on button .so only a mouse finger press will fire the click event

1109246
export	csv
this little piece of code export sashelp.class to a sas catalog entry of entry types csv

1109251
reflection	runtime
here is an example on how to use reflection to dynamically call a methods from a dll loaded at runtime

this allows other folder than the default to be checked for required libs

1109255
put	get
if you put everything into one c source module you get -

1109277
hash	md5
oscommerce stores the passwd using md5 but also adds a random 2 digits numbers provided in plaintext to the hash

hash	md5
hash md5 twocharactersplainpassword

1109277
hash	md5
hash md5 74pass acaa6e689ae0008285320e6617ca8e95 74

1109277
oscommerce	cart
is there any possible way of import customer passwd from my oscommerce cart to my new cart

1109292
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way function

1109303
export	report
also the report should be able to export in the excel and pdf format and even it should be printable

1109329
hash	md5
do not save plain md5 hash in your database

1109329
hash	md5
plain md5 hash can be reverse engineered quickly and easily using rainbow tables

1109329
hash	md5	salt	md5
anyways i want to reiterate that plain md5 hash are easy to crack for most passwd since people like short and easy to remember passwd. use a salt and or a more complex algorithm

1109340
export	report
you can export to excel from the report viewer

1109405
required	checked
it would be challenging for an orm to implements unique checked because it would required a selected and lock before every insert or updates

1109410
selected	checkbox
the way we are using them is to wrap it around a gridview .so that only the header-row is display which contains a checkbox for selected all while collapse

1109410
display	height
about 95 of the time this will work perfectly fine however once in a while the cpe loads with the right height set but display none as styles instead of display block

1109473
mathml	xhtml
internet-explorer doesn t support xhtml except marketing xhtml or mathml without a plugins

1109474
specifications	srs
for instances you do not have a software requirements specifications srs in agile

1109491
arrays	map
imho you should not use anonymous functions anyway only if it is for prototyping or as parameters for arrays methods as foreach map filtering and the like .

1109498
display	outline
i want to rendering this text in one colour with an outline .so that i don t have to worry about what .sort of background the the text is being display over

1109522
for-loop	arrays
i fill refresh them with data from an arrays with a for-loop

1109536
distance	polygons
the requirement is that the new inflated polygons s edges points are all at the same constants distance from the old original polygons s on the example picture they are not since then it would have to use arcs for inflated vertices but let s forget about that for now

1109547
data-manipulation	extraction
i think the dsl most of us use most often is sql a little language for data-manipulation and extraction

1109557
linux	unix
these are standards on linux are generally available on unix and can be run on windows under cygwin although you may be able to find windows-native apps that can do it as well

1109557
daemons	systemd
this can be a daemons .app or windows systemd process or it can be a unix-style superserver that s configure to load and run the actual file-copy .app .when someone contact the listening ports

1109571
python	java
it is automatically wrapped to python c# java using swig

1109584
selected	checkbox
at least with the latest jquery i had to remove the to get this to function with two different checkbox arrayss otherwise all checked items were selected for each arrays

1109587
distance	polygons
the resulting polygons lies at the required distance from the old polygons far enough from the vertices

1109587
distance	polygons
near a vertex the set of points at distance d from the old polygons is as you say not a polygons .so the requirement as stated cannot be fulfilled

1109594
powerpc	arm
windows does not run on arm or powerpc chip for example because it is somewhat dependant on the underlying instruction set

1109602
put	get
i can use set_icon const void size_t function to put binary-data but then how do i get it on the other side

1109604
youtube	vimeo
posting a video on tumblr.com allows you to just paste the url of the video on youtube vimeo whatever and tumblr automatically does the embedding for you

1109606

1109620
executable	jar
the jar executable provided by jdk works the same way tar works on linux

1109651
zipfile	archive
you could use any zipfile viewer to extraction the contents - many will write the contents of a file in an archive to stdout .so that it can be pipe into another cmd remember jar files are just a specific usage of zipfiles

1109713
c-strings	c++
c++ strings represent the length explicit .so they can contains binary-data including the 0-character that terminate c-strings

1109725
processor	cpu
binary code expected to run on any processor either needs to avoid extensions or to detection the cpu types before using them

1109725
64bit	x86
intel s itanium 64bit architecture was completely different from amd s x86-64 architecture .so for a while their 64bit offerings were non-compatible and itanium was nothing like x86 whereas x86-64 extended the instruction set by adding 64bit instructions

1109731
zipfile	archive
my question is similar to this one write a passwd protected zipfile in java but what i need is to create passwd protected zipfile using mechanism simpler than aes beause not every archive manager can unpack aes-protected zipfiles for example winrar is not able to do that

value	field
since there are numerous field but only certain field value are different then i am thinking to set the default-value to all the field .so that users just need to alter those value .when needed

1109732
value	field
in my approach i will hook a javascript function on load of the form-data entry screens and use xmlhttp approach ajax approach to hook to the custom web service to pull retrieve the default value of each field

1109736
selected	button	show	next
if you now selected the button or whatever cmdnewowner is on the form the object inspector should show nothing next to that event

1109737
jax-ws	cxf
such as spring-ws cxf or jax-ws ri

1109738
credentials	security
you could store the user s nt login credentials in your custom security object and then just impseronate the user via code .when appropriate

1109739
revision	updates	revision	svn
if there are conflicted files svn tosses out your changes and uses the revision you ve most recently updates to

1109753
order	add
you then put the common properties id value description order into the interface and you ll be able to create a new t set the properties and add it to the list

1109756
httphandler	httpmodule
you ll want to use an httphandler or httpmodule to do this

1109758
export	csv
it gives you all the same functionality as crystal-reports and will let you do your export into whatever format you like pdf csv txt xls etc. right out of the box

1109758
export	csv	export	report
you may run into some problems .when trying to export to xls csv .when you are using embedded tables in your report but microsoft is supposedly fixing this in the next release

1109767
32-bit	64bit
what you are seeing .when echo -ing the numbers is something intended for human reading and thus the value will be rounded to what floats can provide in accuracy about 6 decimal places for 32-bit and 17 for 64bit fp value

1109777
attributes	properties
make everything internal in the dll and then in the properties assemblyinfo set the internalsvisibleto attributes to only points to the strong named of your application

1109778
unordered	iterator
hash are unordered .so there is no such thing as the last element. the functions for iterator over a hash key value and each have an order but it s not anything that you should rely on

1109785
value	field
grouping by all the field that you want to be returned as unique value

1109785
value	field
use min max avg or any other function to give you one result for field that could return multiple value

1109798
callback	methods
if you want a class or instances methods that triggers a change in or gets a value from the current scoping ruby uses a types of callback called a block

1109822
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
but it only works in firefox google-chrome safari and any browser supporting css3

1109824
directory	folder
svnadmin can write to the root to create new project and to the project folder to create the trunk branches tags directory

1109882
constructor	object
this is why system.exception-handling has a constructor overload that creates an exception-handling object from serialization data

1109901
duplicates	elements
had mapped it as a collections of elements but it was somewhat wrongly adding the user_id to the types id column which causes duplicates error sometimes

1109905
value	field
this way you avoid the messiness of setting getting value in javascript and tying which field to set retrieve directly to your onloads as well as avoiding the possibility of query-string that s too long

1109905
any	set
the service could easily be sufficiently generalized .so that all you d have to do is add your button to any entity and it would work assuming you d set up your service to handle that particular entity

1109951
double	int
for int it can construct them by peasant arithmetic double or double and add 1 for each bit for bits it just provides the appropriate encrypted bit

1109951
boolean	int
we can mix and match boolean and int value in our designs obtaining an if then else that required evaluation both branches simd styles by evaluation cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond .so you can get away with using the built-in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuit more shallow

1109951
value	field
we should be able to map an arbitrary nc1-like circuit over each input to extraction a field multiplying some value and generally map it into a form that you can reduce cheaply

1109951
binary-tree	tree
in a balanced binary-tree or other balanced arrangement to minimize tree height apply your reduction operation to the output from your circuit and any encrypted map metainfo

1109953
defined	declare
i have a filesystemxmlapplicationcontext and i would like the beans defined in the xml to take as a constructor arguments a bean which is not declare in spring

1109955
windows-server	windows
install the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

1109970
callback	methods
in the main body of the program register is called .so that the plugins can register its callback methods with the base-class and then later dispatchtasktoplugins is called to get the plugins running

1109977
value	field
where in this case _list is an arraycollection object whose filtering function depends on the showall field to choose value

1109989
punctuation	words
one thing i can think of is that it will count punctuation marks as words if they are surrounded by spaces

1109989
punctuation	words
you may want to reduce the set of words characters to alphanumeric characters only and count punctuation marks as words separators - unless it is a or a - in the middle of a words depending on what you defined as a words are it s and quick-witted single wordss

1109990
perl	ruby	hash	tie
i know there s plenty of .solutions like that for perl with tie hash .so there s probably .some gem like that for ruby

1109995
getter	setter
this is a rather old topic are setter and getter good or evil

1109995
getter	setter
inline the getter and setter

1109995
getter	setter
to which extent do the getter setter impact performance function-call stack frame compared to a direct field access

1109997
sql-server	oracle
i had similar requirements to support both sql-server and oracle and summarized my two years of experience with such problems in these articles

1110000
selected	listbox	listitem	selected	listitem	listbox
i am using jquery to append or remove a listitem rendering as option from the listbox rendering as selected multiple multiple

1110002
scala	java
if you haven t any experience with that you can just read the java resources as anything in them will be applicable with scala with no changes aside scala syntax

1110002
scala	java
some interesting sign of scala tooling for these environment is the fact that the eclipse-plugins in development uses aop to merge more seamlessly with the whole ide that the netbeans plugins is being completely rewritten in scala and that there s a scala power pack on idea that supports among other things translating java code into scala code

1110002
maven	sbt
sbt uses the same project layout as maven as well as maven ivy repositories but project configuration are done in scala code instead of xml -- with support for maven ivy configuration-files as well

1110002
scala	java
as a purely oo language scala already introduces some nice features comparable to some stuff that s present in c++ but not java though they work in different fashion

1110002
executable	jar
is it a jar is it an executable

1110002
scala	java
you can deploy jars wars or any other of java targets because the scala compiler generator class files

1110002
scala	java	.war	jar
in fact you use java s jar to generator a scala s jar file from the class files and the maven targets for lift support building .war files

1110002
environment	execution
however even with the use of a compilation daemons to speed up execution startup time are slow enough that effective use of scala in a heavy scripting environment needs something like nailgun

1110008
getter	setter
in c++ the compiler inline the getter and setter

1110009
any	set
if the set is small enough you won t see any performance issues

1110010
contains	set
.so if rules only contains 3 rules with their id s set then this query will only return those 3 rules for each agency regardless of whether there is data for those rules its data will be null

1110011
getter	setter
in c++ .when a compiler s optimizations are enabled then getter and setter may be inline be implements using the same machine instructions as there would be for direct access to the underlying member data

1110015
listitem	listbox
that is .when you save the new value to the database add the new listitem to your listbox control too

1110015
selected	listbox
asp.net could conceivably have added a third rules if the posted value for the selected list is not already in the listbox add that value to the listbox. but since it is a security risk to allow arbitrary value to be posted to a page at least .when you have established a set of expected value as with a listbox microsoft decided against it

1110020
arrays	loops
you could use a for each loops to construct a temp arrays of the same size then cast each individual elements to double and but it in the arrays

1110027
youtube	vimeo
i am trying to code a firefox extension that can get the video youtube vimeo properties path etc. .when a user right-clicks on it on a webpage

1110032
contains	elements
you ll need to turn your hash into an arrays contains the elements you are interested in first of course

1110057
value	field
setting the email field as private getter-setter will not solve my issue since i don t want to store the value at all on the entity and fetch the field from the database - as i said this application needs to be as performant as possible

1110080
python	php
i m trying to do exactly the same thing as in my previous python question but in php

1110080
python	php
please note that php scripting is al.so a webpage at the same time .so maybe we can use it like in previous question where answer to my question was snippet that made python just open url instead of running subprocess.

1110089
getter	setter
often i encounter classes that are used as data containers which have both getter and setter for each member

1110089
getter	setter
most compilers can optimize trivial getter setter but as soon as you declare them virtual in c++ you pay an extra lookup - often worth the effort

1110101
function-call	inline
if the definition of the function is not visible to users of the class which will include foo.h but won t see foo.cpp then the compiler may not be able to inline the function-call

1110108
arrays	loops
in general if you don t want to just any ruby magic like .join you can just loops over the arrays hash by index and only add the comma if it is not the last elements

1110113
freebsd	bsd
edit here s wat.c a bsd-specific extension tested on my mac only -- sorry but i have no other bsd flavor at hand right know to work around this apparent freebsd ports problem

1110113
installation	building
to building install this extension pythonetup.py install if you have permission to write in your python installation or pythonetup.py building_ext -i to write wat.so in the very directory in which you put the sources and then manually move it wherever you prefer to have it but first try it out with python -c import wat

1110115
xsd	xml
is there a way to query this schema .so that i can get the xsd text and then use it within a .net application to validation other xml

1110126
callback	methods
nonblocking the callback methods getdata_complete will be called on the ui-thread once the background-thread is complete

1110132
silverlight	wpf
if you are doing wpf or silverlight visifire is an option

1110150
nsstring	nsdata
therefore the nsstring initializer grabs even the bytes after the end of the received nsdata until it reaches some zero byte previously stored in memory

1110158
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
ditto for webkit google-chrome safari and opera

1110189

1110286
updatepanel	gridview
this gridview has sorting and paging enabled and is also surrounded by an updatepanel

1110317
json	xml
you could look at sending back json or xml for example using json_encode

1110319
versioning	upgrade
with wpf i ve had rendering issues related to my video driverss and the fix was to upgrade the video drivers to a newer versioning

1110321
textbox	button
you will need some mechanism to create a relation between the button and the textbox obviously

1110321
textbox	button
one approach would be to have dictionary in the page storing button textbox relations

1110321
textbox	button
.when you create the button and textbox controls you insert them in the dictionary

1110321
textbox	button
...and then you can lookup the textbox in the button s click event

1110324
getter	setter
if you want to use trivial getter setter for some reason such as only having a getter and making the variables readonly from outside the class make them final

1110326
getter	setter
however providing a getter and setter for each data-members of a class is not a good practice

1110327
perforce	git
branches are cheap in all of the systemd mentioned .so far svn tfs perforce git

1110327
any	set
the option of merging any component s between any set of branches remains open to you

1110339
order	add
if i have a table with the primary key on a bigint identity-column can i trust that queries will always return the data sorted by the key or do i explicit need to add the order by

1110348

scripted building and install environment

1110357
any	set
you also need to set the id on txtcomment and recreate any dynamically created controls at postback

1110363
perl	c++
its result is basically the equivalent to argc and argv in c but i d need something on top of that just like boost program_options in c++ or getoptions long in perl

1110370
null-pointer	lvalue
if you dereference a null-pointer you don t have an object or function that this lvalue identifies

1110370
null-pointer	lvalue
it says that if it was given an lvalue that resulted from dereference a null-pointer the result is throw a bad_typeid exception-handling

1110373
order	add
however any time where you need a guarantee that rows will be order a certain way you should add order by

1110375
boolean	int
i have an arraylist that gets different types of value in it 1st value- string 2nd value- datetime 3rd value-- boolean and 4th value is int how do i find thier types and assign those value accordingly any help is appreciated

1110407
radio-button	selected
i was wondering if anyone can .post an example of how to get a selected radio-button option from an asp.net radio-button list control via jquery-on the loading of a page

1110425
while-loop	for-loop
you will often see this pattern using a for-loop rather than a while-loop

1110429
radio	click
assign the same named is definitely valid behavior -- it s how radio button know which grouping they re a part of .so that others in the same grouping turn off .when you click one while other groupinging on the same page are unaffected

1110465
.when	ready
it tells me it s ready to convert .when i hit finish i get the nice little dialog windows

1110478
selection	cell
maybe try handling the selectionchange event of the worksheet object in question and in the event handler write out the value of the selection to the destination cell

1110478
selection	cell
just remember that the selection can be more than one cell .so you ll need to allow for that in your code

1110498
edmx	dbml
the second tool i know of are the huagati dbml edmx tools which allow updates of dbml linq-to-sql and edmx entity-framework-mapping files and more like naming-conventions etc.

1110502
realloc	free
if you want to use realloc i do not see another solution as you initial arrays was free by realloc

1110502
calloc	free
you can calloc your reduced arrays copy the nodes then free the old arrays

1110514
.net	wcf
you can hosts it in any .net environment and there is specific support for hostsing wcf service in iis as well

1110526
classname	inherited
.so in your example change the classname to messagealert from usercontrols_messagealert al.so change this in the inherited in the aspx

1110530

3 choose the right construct operators or function to test conditional

1110544
logfile	tail
watch newline being append to the logfile using a utility like tail -f

1110553
protected	public
since private methods must be used by the code which is visible in some form public package protected private methods can be considered to be covered under the tests for the more-visible methods

1110553
show	next
.when working with existing code you should be able to show that all the known scenarios are covered .so that .when the next change request or bug fix comes along you will be free to dig into whatever module you see fit without the nagging worry what if i break .something which leads to spending more time testing even small fixed then it took to actually change the code

1110555
contains	any
right-click outside of any test methods to run or debugging the entire test class contains in the current file

1110572
finite-state-machine	automata

1110625
callback	methods
i need to find a way to detection if a request is a callback .when the application_beginrequest methods is called

1110633
authentication	login
if you have public pages the login page and private pages member pages and once you authentication your users you want them to browse only the private part of your website you should checked early in the process step authorizerequest would be a good phase if the request comming in is for a public or for the login page which you also consider public and redirect to your private page from there like...having a home page for the member area of the site and always redirecting to it once you get an authentication and properly authentication request to some public url of your site

1110636
contains	set
then for the 1st groupbox mainpanel i set the tabindex for each of it s controls and groupbox that are contains within

if something break in your new versioning and you have to rollback call to the old stored proc will still work without error and just populate the custom field with your default value

1110702
selected	cell
selected the cell you want to replace and copy them

1110702
selected	cell
since this doesn t change non-formula cell you could selected the entire sheet and copy- paste special to remove all formula

export	csv
i export it fine but .when i go to import it into a mysql-python via phpmyadmin i get a invalid field count in csv input on line 1.

1110782
attributes	properties
if visual-studio still named the setter properties incorrectly you can use one of the soap attributes to rename it

1110788
export	csv
there should be an ms-dos format of csv in your export drop down

1110801
getter	setter
getter and setter are one of those things that are sometimes useful but you get these doctrinaire people who somehow leap from has proven useful in some cases to must be used all the time and if you don t use it you are a heretic who should be killed

1110801
getter	setter
if you have side-effects to a get or set by all means use a getter or setter

1110801
getter	setter
but if not writing getter and setter just clutter up the code

1110801
getter	setter
but declaring a member field private and then creating public getter and setter for does nothing to solve the problem

1110804
stderr	stdout
looking at the documentation it does say there is a stdin stdout and stderr file descriptors that i can directly manipulate but there is a big fat warning that says don t do this

1110811
duplicates	elements
removes duplicates elements from self

1110820
value	field
come up with some kind of csv encoder decode for the field and value and populate a collections on every page

1110826
stderr	stdout
in this case will stdout and stderr used as parameters in tidy have their value changed to new stringbuffer buffer.substring i

1110829
required	checked
in .some cases we mix types-inference and typeschecking for instances in haskell a lot of modern extensions can t be inferred but can be checked .so they required types annotations for advanced features like polymorphism recursion

1110830
constructor	object
the constructor class_initialize will first retrieve the session cookies session-timeout session-timeout and database connection-string sessiondsn from the application object and create an instances of the class mysession to hold the session data

1110848
stderr	stdout
you misstate what is going on here -- the object references are pass-by-value a copy of the reference is made .so stdout and stderr do not get modified .when you call tidy

1110852
response	timeout
you ll also want to consider how to handle the no response or timeout conditional

1110858
stderr	stdout
no stdout and stderr will not be changed and yes parameters are pass-by-value

1110862
keyboard	mouse
wrist-rests for keyboard and mouse

1110893
contains	sorted	contains	elements
or use one arrays containss object or struct that contains both the data and the key. then your get methods is simply searching a sorted list for the first elements greater than

1110900
children	nodes
for each nodes i m on i want to get a list of the immediate children

1110901
ref	out
combine this with ref and out to avoid excessive copying of these large value-type

1110901
required	checked
for example while the clr and jvm can avoid arrays bounds checkeded in some situations in a lot of cases they can t and every arrays access required a checked whether or not the index is still within bounds of the arrays

1110926
silverlight	wpf
as mgroves mentioned silverlight is one alternative to a desktop-based wpf .app

1110926

i have a gridview inside an updatepanel

1110940
silverlight	wpf
it is the pros and cons of wpf .app wpf browser .app and silverlight

1110945
contains	elements
a table-cell can legitimately contains block-level elements .so it s not inherently a faux-pas

1110975
getter	setter
just to be extra clear java 1.6 introduces getter setter like file.canexecute and file.setexecutable boolean for file-permissions

1110982

you re unlikely to be reading this anymore but you re missing the following in your app-config or for you web-config

1113189
web-applications	enterprise
java is huge among enterprise web-applications and for a beginner the amount of different frameworks shortcuts and technologies seems to be bone crushing and some indeed tend to overspecify and therefore oftentimes overcomplicate things

1113191
textbox	onblur
there are many reported problems with the onblur event firing the code to clear the textbox looks fine

1113199
selected	textbox
inside the tables there are form elements mainly textbox and selected

1113199

i have a bit of jquery that makes the heading highlight if there are non-blank form elements in the contains table

1113226
functional-programming	imperative
having been an imperative developer for some years now i had never had the urge to learn functional-programming

1113226
.when	ready
note .when i say real .app i m not talking of a real world production ready .app

1113227
virtual-machine	vmware
why not install a linux virtual-machine on your laptop in vmware or similar

1113235
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in firefox but in google-chrome it does not work

1113238
google-chrome	safari
will only be recognized by webkit browsers google-chrome safari -moz- .

1113241
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit for rendering same as safari

1113245
g++	gcc
if you have visual-studio which i feel is an excellent ide you can try to set it up to use gcc g++

1113262
highlight	cell
if you want the highlight to remain as the new view is being pushed and auto-dehighlighted on pop default behavior for tableview cell s make sure you also have the background transparency for self.selected

1113268
python	java	python	c++	python	ruby
there will be time .when i need the big guns of c++ but for many things i ve been having a good time with c# java and ruby or python if i can get away with it

1113270
contains	set
the problem is that the height variables gets set just fine whereas the width variables contains nan â 2147483648

1113309
iequalitycomparer	icomparer	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
the project is called essence and it uses the system.linq.expression libs to generator based on attributes standards representations of equals gethashcode comparator tostring as well as being able to create iequalitycomparer and icomparer classes based on an arguments list

1113312
contains	any
see the sample below this does not contains any anonymous delegation or lambda for older versioning of .net fw

1113319
administration	account
it only worked as the local administration account

1113321
hide	show
initializer all components and building an entire tree controlling it with show hide disable enable operations on user events

1113332
.when	ready
a lot of time i m not saying that this is the case in your question but it is a recurring pattern .when someone says but can haskell be used in the real world what they are really saying is i know how to do this in c and in haskell i cannot do it in exactly the same way therefore it must be impossible in haskell therefore haskell is not ready for the real world

1113333
python	c++
i m familiar with python and c++

1113339
google-docs	spreadsheet
if you just need a form and storage then the absolute simplest solution no coding required would be a google-docs spreadsheet form

1113356
iequalitycomparer	icomparer	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
anyway the project is called essence and it uses the system.linq.expression libs to generator based on attributes standards representations of equals gethashcode comparator tostring as well as being able to create iequalitycomparer and icomparer classes based on an arguments list

1113361
data-access	ado.net
i am using multiple layer project where the datamodel hosts the ado.net entity-model and data-access layer does the validation

1113369

i use and recommend netbeans for c++ development together with cygwin to develop pthreads applications on windows that will run on linux solaris later on

1113435
perforce	cvs
there are many different source control providers including tfs subversion svn perforce cvs and visual source safe to named but a few

1113438
callback	methods
.when your application call beginwrite the systemd uses a separate thread to execute the specified callback methods and blocks on endwrite until the networkstream send the numbers of bytes requested or throw an exception-handling

1113438
callback	methods
as far as my understanding goes whether or not the callback methods is called immediately after calling beginsend depends upon the underlying implementation and platform

1113438
callback	methods
this will cause one of the threads in the thread pool to block until the wsasend methods signals that it has completed after which the callback methods is called

1113438
callback	methods
the reason it has to do this is because if io-completion-ports are not available then the callback methods will be called straight away

1113494
textbox	button
solution set multiline false and set a button on your form to use the acceptbutton properties or capture the return enter key in the keypress event of the textbox

1113507
selected	checkbox
what you need to do is have a map properties that will hold the selected items and you use that with the checkbox and the value that the checkbox relates to

1113511
.net	wcf
the servicehost whether initializer by yourself directly or whether you delegation that job to iis was is the runtime environment for your wcf class - which is just a simple .net class after all which needs to run somewhere

1113513
.when	ready
no seriously .when you have to do something inside ready

1113524
put	get
obviously you may want to put it in a function or class .so you can get at it from anywhere without having to duplicates the code all over the place

1113529
selected	checkbox
i need to show a treeview with checkbox to selected in asp.net-mvc with c#

1113533
.when	ready
if you defined a function and pass it to the ready function the ready function decides .when to execute it

1113537
32-bit	64bit
allocate 3gb of ram to your viewmodel for 32-bit or more for a 64bit guest os

1113540
callback	methods	.when	ready
.when you use methods like ready and click you don t want the code to run .when you set up the event but .when the event happens .so you need a callback

1113548
selected	listbox
now i want the top-level listbox s items to not have a blue background then they are selected see pic

1113548
background-color	transparency
i tried to use the xaml below with a styles to change the background-color to transparency as describe in this blog .post

1113548
selected	listbox
this works but it also changes the selected background-color of the items in the nested listbox

1113558
32-bit	64bit
advantage of boost-serialization this approach works .when transferring object between 32-bit and 64bit systemd as well

1113578
flac	mp3
is encoding a wav file into a flac ogg vorbis or mp3 file something that would work well as a tbb task

1113580
default	reset
i agree with matt looks like you can just stick an itemscontrol inside a scrollviewer for the main list but you can also reset the colors back to their default inside the scoping for the child listbox es

1113581
midp	cldc
is there any way of creating transparency mutable images in java-me cldc 1.1 midp 2.0

1113592
order	join
merge join is the best possible as it exploits the order resulting in a single pass down the tables to do the join

1113592
order	join
if you have two tables or covering indexes that have their order the same such as a primary key and an index of a table on that key then a merge join would result if you performed that action

1113592
nested	order	order	join
worst case is nested loops which is order n m which means there is no order or size to exploit and the join is simply for each row in table x search table y for join to do

1113605
hide	show
create all of the components for the current screens and show hide disable enable them

1113610
updates	mage
you can try creating a custom versioning of app-code core mage sales model order.php under the app-code local folder it goes here .so magento updates don t overwrite it

1113611
python	ruby
there is a lot of discussions of python vs ruby and i all find them completely unhelpful because they all turn around why feature x sucks in language y or that claim language y doesn t have x although in fact it does

1113611
python	ruby
instead explain what ruby s lambda can do that python can t

1113611
python	ruby
we know python does with indentation what ruby does with brackets and ends and that is called self in python

1113611
perl	awk	perl	ruby
ruby has first class regexps -variables the awk perl line by line input loops and other features that make it more suited to writing small shell scripting that munge text files or act as glue code for other programs

1113611
python	ruby
python ruby blocks correspond to different construct in python

1113611
python	ruby
interestingly the convenience statement in ruby for calling a block is called yield which in python will create a generator

1113611
python	ruby
python has built-in generator which are used like ruby blocks as noted above

1113611
python	ruby
things similar to decorator can also be created in ruby and it can also be argued that they aren t as necessary as in python

1113611
python	ruby
ruby required end or to close all of its scoping while python uses white-space only

1113613
python	ruby
you can have code in the class definition in both ruby and python

1113618
postgresql	mysql
is postgresql support in ruby-on-rails less superior than say mysql

1113627
keyboard	mouse
move the mouse from keyboard use the mouse right-click the desired project choose menu add- new folder types folder named etc

1113635
lookup	any
lookup by named won t work either because .when implements interface methods explicit it can have any named yes not in c#

1113639
silverlight	wpf
there you will find different visual-studio-templates shell and module templates for wpf and silverlight

1113644
hide	show
that function show or hide div your dropdown

1113650
postgresql	mysql
after having used sqlite mysql and postgresql with ruby-on-rails i prefer using postrgresql

1113650
ubuntu	osx
installation for osx ubuntu and windows went well as opposed to buggy install for other dbs

1113668
difference	factors
.so this is responsible for a factors of 5 and everything else i did is responsible for another factors of 5 i think the difference between user and real time in the above is mostly accounted for by the fact my virus scanner is running which it wasn t earlier

1113688
communication	messages
i wrote a simple application that communication with the modem and reads text messages it receives

1113691
installation	upgrade
also i changed the permissions to 0777 for all files and folder of my wordpress installation that allowed me to install and delete plugins without ftp but .when i pushed to automatic upgrade to wordpress 2.8.1 it still asked me for my ftp account

1113691
shared-hosting	mediatemple
updates i managed to run id and id www-data on the mediatemple shared-hosting

1113703

groovy	scala
develop team towards dynamic-languages groovy scala ...

1113710
assign	add
add an assign shortcut

1113712
spring.net	ninject
now you can use an inversion-of-control containers like castle unity ninject or spring.net to configure your development-environment versus release environment

1113713
python	ruby
python has docstrings and ruby doesn t.

1113718
any	set
i want to know if i do not explicit set any maintenance jobs are there any default maintenance jobs sql-server will perform like backup

1113741
python	ruby
what ruby has over python are its scripting-language capabilities

1113741
python	ruby
what python has over ruby to me is the vast numbers of binding for other libs

1113741
python	ruby
while much used binding to databases are of good quality i found niche libs to be better supported in python even if for the same libs there is also a ruby binding

1113741
python	ruby
ruby for scripting and python for stand-alone apps

1113744
interop	tlbimp
you can use tlbimp to create an interop assembly for excel 9.0 as explained in the article achieving backward compatibility with .net interop excel as case study

1113744
interop	tlbimp
for some more details have a read of using tlbimp to create strong named interop assemblies

1113745
postgresql	mysql
for example i often test using sqlite and use mysql or postgresql in production with no changes in code

1113747
environment	building
it is particularly useful if you need to building across many environment

1113747
opensolaris	freebsd
virtualbox is getting better and i now have an opensolaris environment and a freebsd one as well

1113759
reliability	scalability
technologies supporting cloud computing reliability security and scalability

1113766
32-bit	x86
a c# application that call the advantage.data.provider.dll and therefore ace32.dll must be targeted for x86 32-bit

1113770
python	perl
i know there are implementation of python and of perl for .net

1113791
parentheses	operators	any	set
the same was you would do it in any c++ objective-c compiler and most algol derived languages and extra set of parentheses inorder to turn to seperate boolean statements and an operators into a single compound statement

1113803
put	get
i won t touch on specifics of graphic design that seems outside the scoping of .so but a good place to start is to get a graphics designer to put together .some conceptual screens and then as a developer your job will be to building controls to match that

1113804
arrays	loops
as you can see i have different arrays for each section and different for loops for each section

1113804
arrays	loops
if i go with approach i have .so far then i will end up with 50 for loops and 50 arrays

1113804
arrays	loops
in the end i do want to end up with 50 arrays but do not want to write 50 for loops

1113825
local-variables	class-variables
is implicit you only need to actually use it .when disambiguating between class-variables and local-variables of the same named

1113829
32-bit	64bit
on other systemd the int types cannot be used to represent pointerss because an int is 32-bit and a pointers is 64bit

1113832
hashmap	arrays
you should instead use a hashmap to arrays

1113838
subtract	add
an int literally stores a numbers which you can add subtract etc

1113849
for-loop	arrays
one way to verify this would be to set up a for-loop that wrote to every elements in the arrays and then checked the memory usage of the application

1113855
put	get
is it not better if i put all the return codes in an enum as i clearly do not worry about the value it get only the named while checked the return types

1113859
margins	padding
try increasing the width of the external div decreasing its padding decreasing the width or margins or padding of the internal boxes

1113863
ndepend	fxcop
code-analysis fxcop stylecop ndepend ... and modifying existing assemblies ilmerge mono linker ...

1113867
updating	updates
i want to allow my users to updates the options collections for a decision in a separate view from updating other decision properties

1113871
enumerator	any
the types of the enumerator is some types that can store the value of any enumerator a and b in this case

1113875
python	ruby
i don t think ruby has x and python doesn t while python has y and ruby doesn t is the most useful way to look at it

1113875
python	ruby
to use an example you brought up both do theoretically have lambda but python programmers tend to avoid them and construct made using them do not look anywhere near as readable or idiomatic as in ruby

1113875
python	ruby
.so in python a good programmer will want to take a different route to .solving the problem than he would in ruby just because it actually is the better way to do it

1113876
value	field
since embarcadero s nntp server stopped responding since yesterday i figured i could ask here i work with a non-db-aware grid and i need to loops through a dataset to extraction the numbers of columns their named the numbers of rows and the value of each field in each row

1113876
value	field
i know to read the value for all the field in each row but i don t know how to extraction column-related information

1113880
python	ruby
thus you ll find that ruby has things like constants while python doesn t although ruby s constants only raise a warning

1113884
margins	padding
you sure there isn t any padding or margins on the image or the text

1113898
python	ruby
ruby has sigils and twigils python doesn t

1113898
python	c++
python has a jit compiler psyco a sightly low-level language for writing faster code pyrex and the ability to add inline c++ code weave

1113907
margins	padding
.when you say width 30 or width 70 it implies the width of the content inside the div excluding the padding border and margins of the div

1113920
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
tested in opera 10b firefox 3.5 internet-explorer 8

1113928
arrays	loops
if you want more information about field the tfield object asqlite3query1.field has a default properties and a count properties .so you can use it like an arrays and an enumerator both of which can be used to loops over each tfield object and retrieve its metadata

1113930
windows-server	windows
set up a windows media service on windows-server 2008 windows media service startup

1113945
projectile	collision
specifically sections on newtons laws of motion collision projectile motion and gravity

1113952
cosine	sine
you re using sine and cosine to convert from in 2d again polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates

1113957
any	set
updates what i really want is a way for the windows object to change without having to change or set any additional properties on the windows

1113969
postgresql	mysql
i use mysql not postgresql but i assume postgresql has support for sub-queries

1113974
32-bit	16-bit
the long versioning work with 32-bit int and the short versioning with 16-bit int

1114002
arguments	default
by default _tmain takes unicode strings as arguments but cout is expecting ansi strings

1114003
defined	declare
the variables s is only defined inside the click handler for x because it is declare within the function

1114020
visualvm	yourkit
i used to really like yourkit but visualvm does .so much now

1114024
constructor	object
can javascript classes object have constructor

1114025
getter	setter
as soon as i write the member variables i like to go to source - generator getter and setter

1114025
getter	setter
does the generator getter setter come under code assist

1114032
sql-server	mysql
i m not exactly sure how to get around it in mysql but in sql-server it would be something like

1114041
32-bit	16-bit
for instances some platform have a 16-bit int size but use 32-bit pointers

1114041
32-bit	64bit	unsigned-integer	int
in your example i would probably use a typedef for a 32-bit or 64bit unsigned-integer rather than using int or unsigned int or size_t

1114045
lgpl	gpl
i read somewhere that gpl or lgpl enforces that software that uses gpl software must also be release open-source

1114058
executable	jar
if you are not against wrapping the jar in an executable launch4j will wrap the jar in a executable as well

1114067
any	set
you can create a set of test scripting to feed into a telnet netcat and they ll be much easier to maintain than any binary-protocol test scripting

1114073
lgpl	gpl
you can compile a c program you write with gcc hence using lgpl licenced runtime routine libs from gcc and still release you software without the restrictions of the gpl

1114076
lgpl	gpl
first you and your lawyer must read the gpl and lgpl licenses

1114076
lgpl	gpl
as far as i understand you can think of using gpl lgpl libs in this way

1114076
lgpl	gpl
if you link dynamically or statically with a gpl or lgpl libs you have created a derivative work

1114076
lgpl	gpl
the gpl lgpl licenses mean free as in free speech not free beer

1114076
lgpl	gpl
you can create a derivative work and sell it for large amounts of money but you must comply with the gpl lgpl

1114080
any	set
if you set a variables in the topmost frame it does seem to be there in the ipython session but this doesn t work for any frame further down

1114092
selected	listbox
i added an icollectionview to manage the selected item on the listbox

1114092
selected	button
it also allows me to have two button that allow me to selected the previous and next items in the list

1114092
selected	listbox
it all works great however .when the selected item is below the display area of the listbox the listbox s scrollbar doesn t move accordingly

1114092
selected	listbox
how can i synchronized the scrollbar display area of the listbox with the selected item

1114096
webserver	security
it didn t appear to be a wcf issue but a security configuration problem on the webserver that wasn t allowing dns permission as required by wcf

1114121
instances	private
as you can see you can simulate private both static and instances members using closures

1114144
any	set
the triangles are defined to move along that set path at constants velocity and they do not interact with the world in any way

1114152
value	field
for reference-type field this storage holds just a reference to the value which would itself be allocated on the heap later

1114152
value	field
for value-type field this storage holds the actual value

1114152
value	field
the field i in each case takes 4 bytes to store its value the field s takes 4 bytes to store its reference and the field l takes 8 bytes to store its value

1114154
order	join
i would expect to retrieve all the cola s in table and all the first row in the set of cola results for my left join based on my order

1114166
updating	updates	required	checked
the timestamp is a key drivers of this client-side persistent since updating a recording required checked the retrieval timestamp against the current timestamp to see if another user has updates it since it was originally retrieved

1114183
application-pool	was	directory	folder
i m moving my blog which was in a physical folder blog on my iis 6 webserver to a virtual directory called the same named blog running blogengine.net the virtual directory is running in the same application-pool as the parent website

1114184
textbox	button
to make it simples i have 1 button and 1 textbox

1114184
textbox	button
i want to button to be disabled .when the textbox s text has no character

1114203
put	get
it show how i split sequences put them in listbox that helps easily get the item count

1114211
initializer	getter
because if you did not initializer it it will be null and the getter for istextvalid will throw an exception-handling and wpf will fail to retrieve the value

1114219
checkbox	button
in visual-c++ 2008 express edition .when adding forms all of the default handler for button checkbox etc go into formname.h by default

1114219
design-view	designer
.so .when i do this most of my handler code now goes in the header then i switching back to the design-view to see the form designer

1114219
design-view	designer
once i have any reasonable size interface going back to design-view from the code view of the header formname.h takes on the order of 1-3 minutes for what i assume to be the form designer to re-parse the header file to roundtrip any changes i may have made in the actual code

1114223
environment	building
that testing pre-prod environment should definitely be using release building .so that you can see the true perfomance and compilation issues before going to production

1114223
configuration	environment	environment	building
in there is a link to scott hanselman s more generics article on building configuration and different environment

1114238
any	set
pear is probably a good idea for the delivery methods however you can just place it in the standards path usr shared php or any other place that is set as the include-path in your php settings file

1114255
python	java	python	c++
according to steve yegge google is using c++ java python and javascript

1114259
profiling	debugging
profiling on the debugging building is usually pretty pointless especially in c++ because debugging heap have a lot of extra checked that totally changes the performance .profile of a typical application

1114261
codeigniter	kohana
i just spent some time going over the logic for the codeigniter and kohana session libs and i came up with the following on how each starts and ends sessions for the page

1114262
updatepanel	datalist
i use updatepanel with datalist elements inside

1114296
setinterval	settimeout
take a look at the settimeout and setinterval javascript functions

1114297
google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera	opera	gecko
over time gecko konqueror opera safari and google-chrome each decide to similarly spoofing the user-agent of some previous browser inorder to manipulate browser-sniffing webpage into correctly understanding their browser s features

1114297
google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	safari
plenty of other nonsense also results like modern google-chrome s user-agent simultaneously claiming to be mozilla google-chrome safari and like gecko

1114299
google-chrome	firefox
this seems okay in google-chrome and firefox admittedly it s a little flakey sometimes it doesn t work maybe if the image is in the caching

1114310
data-structures	tree	pointers	stack
i have worked with pointers arrays std vectors std strings classes and several data-structures including stack and binary tree

1114321
processor	cpu
.when a processor interrupt occurs due to an external device the cpu will save the current program counter and usually the flags register on stack and jump to the handling subroutine

1114321
local-variables	function-call
at a higher level whatever language is used to implements a thread will often use stack for its own purposes to store functional call parameters local-variables and function-call return value speaking in broad strokes here -- consult your languages low-level documentation for specific detail

1114323
priority-queue	heap
in contrast to an ordinary priority-queue an interval heap offers both minimum

1114337
httpd.conf	.htaccess
i had tried placing the block of rewrite directives in three places in the part of the httpd.conf file at the top of my httpd.conf file and in the variables www html .htaccess

1114338
cgpoint	cgrect
this will return a cgrect which in itself is comprised of a cgpoint called origin and a cgsize called size

1114338
cgpoint	cgrect
however most co-ordinates rely on cgrect cgpoint and cgsize in some way or another

1114340
checkbox	listbox
i have two checkbox and one listbox

1114357
any	set
i am looking for the best or any way to set the album art of mp3s using php

hashtable won t give you any form of relational data but are very efficient at lookup

1114821
stdin	pipe
the command-line is backwards as pointed out by another answer. if the application reads from stdin .when started without a command-line then this sort of shell pipe arrangement will work

1114842

1114911
any	set
but any structure which indexes items by two different criterion is therefore going to have some kind of extra overhead per item compared with a set

1114911
duplicates	elements
if you want to efficiently maintain order and exclude duplicates while adding elements then i would recommend using the set or unordered-set i defined above based on positioning and also a which will maintain the order

1114935
put	get
so...on one hand there is the option of staying organized the way i ve been doing for years and allowing intellisense to be the way that a new user of an assembly quickly gets up to speed with its functionality and just lump it for the includes... the other way is to put everything in one namespace...and write good docuementation on how to get started with the assembly.

1114939
order	add
order does matter there and the first route you add is the first route for a url to be tested with

1114965

the problem is that .when i m using it from lua if i don t keep a lua reference to every single object i add to the c++ rendering manager it starts to garbage collect the pointers and of course cause things to crash

1114995
activerecord	datamapper
incidentally this is one area that datamapper kicks activerecord s butt soundly

1115002

1115086
spaces	output
unlike competing processor of the era - like the zilog z80 - the intel 8086 had only one address spaces which had to accommodate not only electronics memory but all input output communication with such minor peripherals as keyboard serial ports printer ports and video display

1115086
spaces	output
for comparison the zilog z80 had a separate input output address spaces with dedicated assembly opcodes for access

1115086
spaces	output	electronics	led
the need to allow spaces for an ever growing range of peripheral expansions led to the original decision to segment the address spaces into electronics memory from 0-640k and other stuff input output roms video memory etc from 640k to 1mb

1115104
joomla	drupal
i m not too familiar with content-management-systems and don t know if i need a full fledged content-management-system joomla drupal or i should just create something

1115111

what happens if you run a 32-bit executable on 64bit windows

1115111
32-bit	64bit
64bit linux gives 32-bit programs access to 0-4gb

1115115
any	set
.so any os needs .some amount of the address spaces set aside

1115119
binary	hex

i wish there existed color scheme quick setups like both emacs and vim have had for decades

1115166
arrays	loops
use loops to create an arrays

1115167
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to dig deeper you could checkout a framework like codeigniter or cakephp

1115171
subclassing	superclass
sadly you need what i consider a hack making a one-to-one reference from subclassing to superclass restaurant to place

1115206
jinternalframe	jlayeredpane	implements	extends
you could implements your main game display and control panels as the background of a jdesktoppane which extends jlayeredpane and could make the popup jinternalframe

1115210
python	java	python	php	python	c++
the initial goal was to provide eclipseâ s java functionality in vim but support for various other languages c++ php python css html xml etc. have been added and several more are planned

1115212
nsfilemanager	nsfilehandle
i know there is nsfilehandle and nsfilemanager which is what i plan on using to take care of reading and writing to the file but i m not sure where the my document section of the ipod touch is if you know what i m saying

1115219
subclassing	superclass
remember that although wildcardbuddies is a reference to a pair of employee subtyping the object it points to is quite specifically a pair of managers and conversion from a superclass employee to a subclassing manager is not allowed

1115225
firefox	safari
my only leads are from safari unmatched embed tag firefox browser pretends charts never loads even though it has ie non-specific prototypejs error

1115233
toolchain	qmake
qmake in the qt toolchain generator xcode project

1115269
operators	keyword
or is the keyword this only a declaration operators for a public member and not a reference to the outer object

1115290
constructor	object
.when you copy the a object into b s prototype you call a s constructor

1115308
google-chrome	firefox
add shortcuts here to notepad dreamweaver and why not google-chrome and or firefox

1115323
case-statement	declare
you can t declare a variables at the beginning of a case-statement

1115323
case-statement	declare
it doesn t have to do with variables being declare in the middle of a block â even adopting a standards that allows that won t make gcc accept a declaration at the beginning of a case-statement

1115332
.when	ready
as it give the cpu to the other process in the ready queue .when the blocking-call in the blocked state

1115364
authentication	impersonation
claims based authentication makes life easier if you want to flow identity through multiple systemd such as a middle tier and onto a compatible back end without having to mess with impersonation and delegation.it s also partially for federation - allowing other people s systemd to perform the authentication and for you to then authentication access to your application based on the identity information sent by those systemd

1115377
arguments	default
in computer programming a default arguments is an arguments to a function that a programmer is not required to specify

gitorious	repo
.so a little background i have dropbear and git install on a palm pre and am trying to commit changes to a repo on gitorious

1115424
sql-server-express	sql-server
the sql-server migration assistant 2008 for access v4.0 can be used to migrate the access database tables to sql-server-express

1115424
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you are doing something similar i strongly recommend that you use sql-server or sql-server-express as your backend database

1115442
restart	exit
i have used the following code i am able to change the backcolor but .when i exit the application and restart it i am not able to get the color that user has set

1115442

in the color dialog box i am selected a color and pressing ok button the color is al.so changed but .when i restart the application i dont get the colour which i set using the color dialog.i want to retain this setting .so that the user can get the desired color without resetting it each time the application is execute

1115443
pascal	delphi
as we know delphi also provides memory-management a bit like c - using ampersands and pascal functions but what would be the most effective logging

1115444
positioning	slider
i can make it look right using absolute positioning but .when the windows size is too small the content slider off the page without a horizontal scrollbar

1115444
positioning	slider
i only know how to do this using absolutely positioning divs but content in absolute divs will slider off the page .when the windows is too small

1115449
ubuntu	linux
i am writing the program for linux i m using ubuntu 9.04 and using gcc

1115451
python	java
basically what i have is an object that has been initializer in java and i want to initializer another java object in the python scripting and have the pre-instatiated java object added to the object i have initializer in the jython interpreter

1115451
python	java
i am pretty sure this is because the setb methods is attempting to call a methods on a python object not on the actual java object

1115451
python	java
basically i expect the call to setb on the instances of a i have just created in the jython scripting to be a java object not a python object

1115451
python	java
sorry if this is obvious i ve read the tutorials as well as the jython sections of java in a nutshell and core python programming but the examples are really really simple they have no examples of how to do this two-way binding

1115462
updating	updates
the main drawback of this methods is that if you need to updates any of the book data you will be potentially updating many entities - and as they live in a separate table to the book itself it won t be able to be completed in a single transactional batch-file and i d imagine you d use the user identity as the partition key in the mapping table anyway which already precludes a single batch-file updates in that table

1115462
put	get
if it becomes too expensive to updates the data in the mapping table at the same time as the primary table you could put a messages on a queue and get a worker role to perform the updatess for you asynchronously

1115467
version-control	git
3 i m using git for version-control and i push my updates to the server itself

1115468
value	field
in the class reflecting the encode data structure you simply mark some field as a bound numeric value and that s mostly it

1115470
selected	cell
i cannot selected a row or a cell anymore

1115476
firefox	opera
your only real loss then would be having an improper font-weight for older non-ie browsers like firefox 3.0 and lower and opera 9.2x and lower

1115487
getter	setter
use a different serialization such as datacontractserialization which also supports private getter setter or field but doesn t support full xml control - for example see here

1115497
getter	setter
in this example boo will have id properties with public setter and getter

1115499
administration	account
at least at where i used to work regular user will not be a local computer administration .so each installation will required local administration account

1115510
constructor	object
that variables inside the constructor function is immediately discarded after the function has returned the new object

1115510
nested	assign
by declaring that function as a member of the prototype object or by assign it to an already created object you lose the nested scoping hence no closure and no access to the so-called private member

1115514
linqdatasource	gridview
i have gridview in my page and i set it s datasource to linqdatasource also i set allowpaging true allowsorting true

1115514

here is my question how can i implements paging in gridview of course for relational tables using linqdatasource linqdatasource with enabled delete or updates

1115528
lgpl	gpl
gsl is very good libs that gives tools far behind distributions but it is covered by gpl not lgpl meaning that if you want to develop non-gpl applications and distribute them you can t

1115539
positioning	sidebar
i m not sure why because i m a little rusty with my css but now that both are relative positioning if you have no negative margins on the sidebar content the top of it will be aligned to the bottom of the image

1115576
python	ruby
you will find these functions in early lisp all the way up to ruby and python

1115582
click	mouse
and the thing with getting mouse outs .when click is a definite indicator to me you must be having a bug somewhere .

1115585
.net	wcf
i m currently working on a solution which needs to use both silverlight 3.0 and standards .net applications as clients to a web service implements with wcf

1115585
duplex	was
my initial workaround was to split off the duplex from the simplex pieces of the service at which points everything worked just fine -- but at the cost of duplicates object model on the clients which was not ideal

1115594
shared-libraries	ldd
if .so then you could run ldd on it to see which shared-libraries are required

1115626
value	field
field are just added work for no business value

1115647
boost	stl	using-declaration	typename
as long as my ide doesn t support view short typename i m leaning towards using-declaration for commonly known symbols the stl boost ...

1115666
compatibility	platform
it s a large document and i will be working daily on both platform .so compatibility is essential if it s two different pieces of .software

1115672
silverlight	wpf
blend makes it easier to develop applications for both wpf and silverlight

1115673
default-value	default	default-value	dbnull
that said your best bet would be to checked for dbnull or null in the above case and use return whatever default decimal instead though null and dbnull both have a significant semantic difference from just a default-value

1115681
auctex	latex
for previewing i am using emacs with its preview latex feature in the auctex package

1115728
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter stringbuilder you are implicit using .net s utf-16 string

1115738
attributes	properties
the visible properties affects rendering of the entire elements and is unrelated to the css visibility attributes

1115738
attributes	properties
you can do this by either removing the error class from the elements via the cssclass properties or by setting a styles visibility visible attributes manually via the attributess properties since the styles attributes overrides a css class

1115741
emacs	vim
i don t know much about emacs .so you may regard the following as off-topic but i work with both eclipse and vim

1115742
attributes	properties
the styles properties controls the styles attributes of the elements

1115758
textchanged	textbox
in a .aspx webpage by setting a textbox s text properties by code in runtime will textchanged event handler of that textbox be fired

1115761
webforms	asp.net
there might be something present in the page markup which states or hints at the underlying technology presence of view state blobs for example denotes asp.net webforms

1115762
ref	out
in c# .when sending a parameter to a methods .when should we use ref and .when out and .when without any of them

1115771
ref	out
in general you should avoid using ref and out if possible

1115771
ref	out
the difference between ref and out is that .when using out the compiler enforces the rules that you need to assign something to the out paramter before returning

1115771
ref	out
if you need to call methodss that was declare with the ref or out modifierss on their parameters you should use the same modifiers before your parameter .when calling the methods

1115771
ref	out
even without ref or out

1115784
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop has a very intriguing visual-studio look a like developed in c# and offering it s source for both review and modification

1115792
default-value	default
i want to set a default-value to make the parameter optional but i also want to later detection in my code if the value was changed from its default without hard to debugging side affects

1115799
contains	elements
it might be an utf-8 file which contains elements declaring it as latin-1

1115812
ref	out
ref and out are used .when you want something back from the methods in that parameter

1115812
ref	out
.so the difference is out can be used with an uninitializer object ref must be passed an initializer object

1115824
utility	gnu
microsoft nmake was mentioned before but i will suggest using gnu make utility that used for managing building

1115824
environment	building
it is compiler independent old meaning proven and very flexible tools that will allow you to create very robust building environment

1115840
emacs	vim
emacs and vim are generally smaller faster and optimized for text editing and navigation

1115860
cryptography	security
anyway checkout this article security pitfalls in cryptography

1115862
google-chrome	safari
this code gets the desired functionality to work like charm but only on google-chrome and safari

1115880
aes	rsa
modern symmetric aes and asymmetric rsa cryptosystems are very secure read practically impossible to break in themselves but the way you use the cryptosystem and user behavior changes everything

1115889
implements	extends
also a class can implements many interfaces but can only extends one abstract-class

1115898
ref	out
but in most programs where you are using class es as the default you can normally just pass the reference by value no ref out

1115898
ref	out
this could use a tuples instead but it is such a common pattern that it is reasonably understood even by people who struggle with too much ref out

1115900
updating	updates
the constructor grabs the entire table one row per setting and copies these into a dictionary and it has methods to access such as bizconfig.get key and updates this dictionary also updating the table at the same time

click	mouse
but stuck with the events my idea was on mouse over i should triggers the click event but the event is fired only once while i want it to be fired repeatedly as long as the mouse stays on the button

1115910
hash	md5
just ask for the named and calculate a hash such as sha1 or md5 for that named maybe lowercase and stripes whitespace first prefixed with some secret text that is hardcode in your program

1115913
callback	methods
instead of using events to communication the completion of foo to foohandler since foo is internal anyway you could add a callback parameter to the constructor or load methods of foo which foo can call .when it is done loading

1115916
authentication	login
.net application being tested uses authentication mode forms .so whenever an instances of watin.core.ie is created the login page appears

1115916
authentication	login
can successfully fill in the login form and authentication but wondering how to handle this for multiple tests

1115921
mouseover	mouseout
start and loops the animation on mouseover stop pause the animation on mouseout

1115922
mouseover	mouseout
in the mouseover event or the first methods of the hover event you start a timed function that causes the scroll and in the mouseout event or the second methods of the hover event you stop the timed function

1115956
versioning	staging
if the problem is with the index as the staging area for commit .git index you can simply remove the index make a backup copy if you want and then restore index to versioning in the last commit

1115956
linux	osx
on osx linux

1115969
fogbugz	mantis	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla	fogbugz	bug-tracking	bugzilla	bug-tracking	fogbugz	bug-tracking	mantis

1115989
rollback	commit
speaking of which you have no commit rollback logic

1115998
required	checked
a better alternative would be to use an alarm and a service to checked your current location against your set of 20 to 80 location as required

1116078
any	set
to make the debugger catch all exception-handling before any stack unwinding takes place set a breakpoints on __raise_exception see section breakpointss

1116116
spritebatch	xna
i will also points out that i am using xna to develop this game but i have almost no grasp of all the classes available yet pretty much only using the game component with some classes that are related to it such as gametime spritebatch graphicdevicemanager but not much more

1116121
selected	button	highlight	selected
they won t display the delete button upon swipe and don t even highlight .when selected

1116135

i highly recommend memberwing they have a free versioning that is quite enabled and the upgrade is only us 100

1116137
.when	ready
.when you think you are ready you can start to replace parts of the engine you are using to better suit your needs

1116140
rendering	redraw
for example if you draw the quad while the graphicsdevice has another vertex declaration on it or if the previous thing rendering set some exotic rendering state or if you redraw the quad within the drawing code of something else

1116195
.net	wcf
mono doesn t support all the .net apis though - notably wpf and possibly wcf too i can t remember - but it does provide good support for much else of the framework

1116214
xsd	xml
you cannot block the insert of the unless you write a xml editor yourself which would understand and interpreter the xsd schema on-the-fly

1116231
value	field
the problem i have is that whenever i try to get the value of the field i get either true or false

1116253
keydown	keyup
you shouldn t use the keypress event but the keyup or keydown event because the keypress event is intended for real printable characters

1116254
asp.net-mvc	webforms
either completely to asp.net-mvc and stop using dotnetnuke or to a better webforms implementation meaning separate logic from display and take into account the page lifecycle issues

1116254
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
there s a third option - combining asp.net-mvc and asp.net webforms but you should look at it carefully taking into account all the variables in your platform

1116259
callgrind	valgrind
you may be able to use valgrind callgrind with the flag to achieve this

1116264
traversal	parent
what about traversal upwards the parent of the control until you find a control of the certain types or with a specific member variables called helptexts

1116265
32-bit	64bit
i ask because i noticed that many 64bit executable link against what appear to be 32-bit dlls

1116265
32-bit	64bit
for example my 64bit mfc .app links against user32.dll urlmon.dll wininet.dll - all of which are 32-bit dlls that reside in windows system32

1116265
32-bit	64bit	compatibility	legacy
.so is this .some ms specific wizardry that applies to these dlls or is there backward compatibility as it were for 64bit executable that need to use legacy 32-bit dlls

1116276
32-bit	64bit
you cannot link 64bit executable to 32-bit dlls or vice versa

1116281
callback	methods	put	get
simply put the constructor call configuration value and the call to the start methods in the callback that handles the results you get from the ajax request

1116285
.net	wcf
you can then use .net ria service or even simply wcf to communication with authentication service

1116331
mkmapview	mapkit
the error is not throw .when i import mapkit mapkit.h or .when i declare a variables as mkmapview mapview

1116377
32-bit	64bit
it seems like in the 64bit jvm threads don t get preempted or something because in the 32-bit jvm this loops would get preempted and then the other thread would finish and set the variables to true but not in the 64bit jvm

1116388
delphi	c++
it doesn t need c++ runtime because its compiled with the libs and it works in delphi on vista but not c#

1116395
value	field
its value field contains the recording s id and its option field contains recording s text

1116395
display	width
.when i cut down the width it also cuts down the text display

1116414
contains	elements
however this partials view contains the inner working for a dialog wrapped in a form elements along with the rest of the partials view content

1116419
javascript	dom
for example i m writing a javascript libs that tries to unobtrusively and gracefully enhance some object you give me your li elements or even something unrelated to the dom

1116419
hashtable	set
ideally i could make my own hashtable or set either way implements as a dictionary to keep tracking

1116438
binary-tree	tree
your need to building a multi-branched tree types structure not simple binary-tree

1116527
pagespeed	yslow
use yslow or pagespeed to identify bottlenecks

1116567
optional-arguments	arguments
the usual workaround is to take advantage of duck-typing and checked arguments for types and providing optional-arguments the ability to pass in named arguments makes this fairly easy to handle

1116572
double	int
maybe your calculator methods can be applied to two different set of parameters say on an int and on a double

1116573
any	set
does any one know how to set the startup project in expression-blend 2

i have a problem with an iframe which move the parent framelayout around .when click on an anchor or the javascript link which has an anchor not sure

1116607
constructor	object
my problem is simple i m trying to configure sm via code registry to use a particular constructor .when creating an instances of a repository object

1116610
any	set
you should assume that any function can set errno not just those in the standard-library

1116612
click	mouse
you still can have version-control systemd with this approach and rollback any templates which was modified by mistake by 2 mouse click on a website

1116622
configuration	installation
i haven t poked at the innards of our hudson installation too much but it there is a button under source code management that says add more locations... if that isn t the default out-of-the-box configuration let me know and i will dig deeper

1116622
required	checked
most of our hudson building required at least dozen different svn repo to be checked out and hudson monitor them all automatically

1116646
any	set
the value of errno is zero at program startup but is never set to zero by any libs

1116649
any	set
adam as neil said any function can be compiled against errno.h and set errno

1116651
png	gif
one cool feature is the ability to send an arrays of bytes to a server side scripting which allows you to save jpg gif and png onto a server directly from flash

1116670
contains	any
does any craft enthusiasts know where i could get a xml or libs that would contains all of the floss numbers and their colors

1116674
.when	ready
ready event fires .when dom is available.

1116676
put	get
by the way you could use joptionpane to put up a little gui to get user-input .

1116695
entity-framework	nhibernate	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	nhibernate
with .net which data-access methods is better to use linq-to-sql entity-framework or nhibernate

1116697
value	field
2 my validation is only receiving a single value the value of the field i attach it to not the value of the multiple field it is supposed to validation

1116697
value	field
the setup i m currently using below actually execute fine but newplace validation receives _post city_fk as field instead of the desired grouping of posted value

1116711
silverlight	wpf
i need to have a custom user-interface elements that can be changed such as the colour and text used in the application but as a resource - in wpf i can use a dynamicresource to assign brushes strings etc however i need to implements this in silverlight 3 - how can i do this as a staticresource will not do and as another question i have a resource which is made of other user-interface-elementss like rectangles

1116713
slidedown	slideup
jrails redefines slideup and slidedown for some reason

1116744
pointers	stack
alternatively you can make a stack of pointerss to nodes or whatever is like a pointers in c#

1116763
temporary	copy
and it will move construct the temporary into ab or do return-value-optimization to omit doing a move or copy altogether

1116763
temporary	rvalue
note that move in this case is not optional because ab is neither a local automatic nor a temporary rvalue

1116764
configuration	installation
a second thing wrong with it is that under a default installation on vista it won t work anyway by default vista doesn t give the user write access to anything under the program files directory .so saving changes to the application configuration file will throw an exception-handling

1116766
contains	elements
the correct hash is stored in the session and the hash form elements has a zend_session_namespace instances which contains the namespace for the hash

1116766
contains	elements
to unit test the elements you would replace the zend_session_namespace instances in the elements with setsession with one you create yourself which contains the correct hash the hash is stored in key hash

1116776
carbon	cocoa
if you re a cocoa programmer don t be freaked out by the fact that this is carbon

1116806
double	int
there s an overload for interlocked.exchange specifically for float and others for double int long intptr and object

1116806
reference-type	generics
there isn t one for uint .so the compiler reckons the closest match is the generics - but in that case t has to be a reference-type

1116817
gtk	x11
on linux under x11 and using gtk you have something called main loops

1116824
32-bit	64bit
call me old-fashioned but i ll still be using c++ to make both 32-bit and 64bit applications just as i have been for years

1116825
json	xml
i m manipulating few data with php i have the choice between json and xml

1116825
json	xml
also i wonder if there s good classes that can make parsing xml or json easier

1116831
put	get
now my problem is that if i put the code for read-function before the code for action-function i get an error in read-function saying that it doesn t know what action-function is because the code for it is further down and if i do the opposite well i get a similar error obviously saying that read-function cannot be resolved etc

1116831
put	get
if i put the code for these two functions in the reverse order i will get an error saying

1116838
any	set
a timer can be set up with any object as its target

1116841
json	xml
json has the added advantage of being less bloated than xml and can easily be translation to javascript .when on the client

1116843
post-increment	pre-increment
in the general case the post-increment will result in a copy where a pre-increment will not

1116844
json	xml
there are a numbers of perhaps one-sided json vs xml articles at the bottom of the json.org page

1116860
hash	md5
i m currently using md5 hash but i would like to find something that will create a shorter hash that uses just a-z a-z 0-9

1116861
json	xml
one thing to consider is that at least on downloading the difference in size between xml and json xml being bigger is not really interesting because you will using gzip compression over http

1116861
json	xml
i m pretty sure that it s xml and not json but you can checked me on that

1116871
domdocument	domxpath
one possibility domdocument and domxpath

1116873
backtracking	n-queens
for example i would like to show how a backtracking for the n-queens problem works

1116877
domdocument	domxpath
if youâ ve not just a fracture like the one mentioned use a real parsing like domdocument that you can walk through with domxpath

1116883
hash	md5
you can decrease the numbers of characters from the md5 hash by encoding them as alphanumerics

1116884
dictionary	arrays
json views your data as structures known from programming languages maps dictionary called object in json arrays and literals

1116884
json	xml
xml is much more complex than json though

1116884
json	xml
it s easy and fun to write your own json parsing but writing xml parsing is huge undertaking surely not for somebody who is new to xml

1116884
attributes	properties
if you want to use more advanced properties from xml-entities automatic inclusion of other document schema implicit attributes value etc. or mix content and markup xml will work better for you

1116894
click	mouse
using my good ol mouse to points and click away

1116899
joomla	drupal
today i would use one of the many good frameworks for this purpose joomla drupal etc instead of coding it myself

1116921
python	php
one versioning uses snoopy.class in php and the other uses urllib and urllib2 in python

1116921
python	java	python	php
looking into how to do this with java i get the feeling it will not be the same walk-in-the-park as it was with php and python

1116921
python	php
.so php and python versioning were a breeze

1116934
python	java	python	php
i would argue that is as simple in java as it is in php or python your examples

1116937
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
another option is to use progressive-enhancement with fonts-face with your chosen fonts which is supported by firefox 3.5 opera 10 and i think safari

1116938
contains	any
however if the text contains any ansi colour escape sequences which are never display and only serve to colour the text .when display it fmt considers these as normals characters and calculates the wrong line lengths

1116953
unique	words
simple example extraction the unique list of words of 8 letters or more from the document

1116953
contains	set
comparison could then be two document are similar if one s set contains more than 75 of the others

1116958
communication	messages
i do this in a separate thread using messages queue to communication between the threads

1116966
groovy	java	python	java
personally i prefer jython because it s based on python in fact it is python but a little bit outdated but i must admit that groovy is more tightly coupled with the jre it s more syntactically similar to java and thus might be a better option

1116975
entity-framework	ado.net
thereâ s â classicâ ado.net linq2sql ado.net entity-framework ado.net data service ado.net dynamic data

1116978
json	xml
the main reason for this is not parsing for there are very good libs for xml and json that do this for you see other post but the understandability

1116978
json	xml
json works with a lot of different parentheses .when looking at your xml data you will probably see any errors faster

1116984
python	java
if you re prepare to relax your non-binary requirement pylucene is a wrapper that embed java lucene into python

1117007
jdbctemplate	jdbc
in your jdbc daos make use of spring s jdbcdaosupport and or jdbctemplate support classes

1117074
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am writing an .app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117079
order	add
the search will go through the entire html page and add an object into an arrays every time it comes across .first_class and then it will go through the document again looking for .second_class resulting in the final arrays contains all of the searched items in the incorrect order in the arrays i.e all of the .first_class object followed by all the .second_class object

1117079
order	add
is there a way i can get this to search the document in one go and add an object into the arrays each time it comes across one of the specified classes giving me an arrays of items that is in the order they are come across in on the page i am scraping

1117081
scripting	shebang
if it is a single scripting to be run on a box that already has python install you just need to put a shebang into the first line of the file and that s it

1117083
duplicates	contains
how do i make sure that .when i merge a few temp indexes that might or might not contains duplicates document i end up with one copy in the main index

1117090
sequences	unique
in that case you just want to pre generator a sequences of cryptographically secure random numberss and then assign each url to be encode a unique numbers from the sequences

1117116
data-access	ado.net
ado.net is the original data-access technology from .net 1.0

1117116
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework is more flexible

1117121
pointers	stack
a second possibility is that you have a list of pointers references and the items are being deallocated before after being put on stack

1117125
data-access	ado.net
i think what you are looking for is here from year 2007 that even though is 2 years old is about xml ado.net data linq sql-server visual-studio orcas entity framework...they address the question does microsoft have a data-access strategy

1117130
sql-server	mysql
and btw i tested this with mysql because i don t have a sql-server at hand right now

1117143
factorization	primes
that way you can get phi k quickly wihout expensive primes factorization and still iterate through all k between 1 and n not inorder but i think you don t care about order

1117163
subtraction	addition
you ll find other such methods for right addition right subtraction etc

1117165
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	oracle
use an rdbms with decent cursor such as oracle or postgresql

1117171
user-interface	drawing
if it is spending most of its time drawing the user-interface then assuming your view isn t doing data-access you should probably look elsewhere first.

1117174
python	c++
you won t get conversion operators like in c++ because python does not have this kind of strong static types systemd

1117176
linux	unix
it s a .lib for unix linux

1117183
debian	linux
if you want something more fancy on linux you can try the classic ncurses or if you just want a dialog box you could try the libs that the debian install utilities use but i forget its named

1117206
value	field
a lot of work is actually needed to be able to natively read write these value you d need to unpack binary field contains specificationsially encode value according to the jeita specifications

1117208
any	set
in a mysql table the id column is set to auto_increment and the next auto_increment is set to 128 in phpmyadmin but any new rows added have 127 as the value in the id row

1117234
pointers	stack
i d go up the call stack and hunt for null pointers could be a member of the the object you re pushing on to the fron of the list or that object itself

1117241
webserver	nginx
if you want to run it on mac os x you can simply setup your webserver i recommend nginx with phusion s passenger and your database server to start on boot that way whenever your computer has to restart it will have your site running

1117265
export	report
anyhow you still have to convert them back to absolutely positive value .when export to account report

1117266
export	csv
alternatively you could just use the export functions of quickbooks to periodically export the inventory as csv

1117273
hide	show
how to show and hide div every 1min in jquery

1117289
hide	show
to flip show hide you can do something like this

a loops that call selected to determine which sockets clients are ready and then reads and or writes to those sockets doing whatever process is necessary .when no socket is ready

1117349
stderr	stdout
on the other hand forms application don t have the stdin stdout and stderr connect and while they can behave as cmd-line tools and process cmd arguments they have problems .when embedded in scripting because the standards input output is not hooked up

1117368
kerberos	ssl
you can take out the authentication streaming part ssl or kerberos ntlm if you really don t need it and then it becomes

1117423
smalltalk	lisp
this practice goes back to the earliest dynamic-languages like smalltalk and lisp

1117424
boost	stl
is there a data structure readily available in stl or boost that accepts two arguments and maps it to a certain value

1117426
exception-handling	error-handling
part of the reason is that exception-handling is always more costly and complex than more conventional error-handling

1117426
nsexception	nserror
aside from obejctive-c conventions and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117431
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
if you compile normally the clr will run your .app as 64bit on x64 windows and 32-bit on x86 windows

1117457
hash	md5
i have a database application that generator a md5 hash and compares the hash value to a value in our db sql 2k

1117457
hash	md5
i realize this may not be the best methods to hash but utimately any changes to the md5 code would force us to change some 300 value in our db table and would cost us a lot of time

1117467
quantifiers	pcre
i am reading the pcre .doc and it refers to possessive quantifiers but does not explicit or specifically defined them

1117489
defined	declare
uri and michael are right -- i ll just add that if what s bugging you is having to touch two files to declare and defined the destructor it s perfectly all right to defined a minimal one inline in the header

1117499
enumerator	any
if we assume that in both cases you re using the extension methods provided by the enumerator static-class then you ll be hard pressed to measure any difference between the two

1117502
tokenize	parsing
if you have a couple developers willing to write their own parsing tokenize and query optimizers then there are no limits to lucene

1117512
contains	set
eclipse can contains a lot of different feature set via plugins

1117517
value	field
and probably you will need to change your stored value and start using a blob field or converting to base64 and using a textfield

1117524
configuration	environment
seems like a good candidate for inclusion in environment.rb or if this hack is only necessary in particular environment then in their individual configuration files

1117531
exception-handling	try-catch
another option that can help is to wrap only the offending code with a try-catch putting the exception-handling handler as close to the exception-handling as possible

1117550
vb.net	vb6
same goes for vb.net by the way - spaces inside square brackets used to work in vb6 but they don t in vb.net

1117564
value	field
.when you have a model field with a choices option you tend to have some magic value associated with human-readable named

1117564
value	field
is there in django a convenient way to set these field by the human-readable named instead of the value

1117574
python	java
you would probably have a hard time writing efficient code that would run on appengine python or java and also run on asp.net

1117576
derived-class	base-class
you can freely cast from a derived-class to a base-class but you cannot blindly cast from a base-class to a derived-class unless the object really is an instances of the derived-class

1117598
python	java
the native interfaces are c and java haven t tried the latter actually but the python interface is also pretty good actually better now that it s not in python standard-library any more as it can better keep pace with upstream development

1117602
any	set
the reason for this is that the form is the super form-for a set of sub forms and i want the super form to be invalid .when any of its subforms are invalid

1117611
dynamic-linking	static-linking
this is called static-linking .o vs dynamic-linking .so

1117614
postback	ajax
inorder to updates a database you have to make a round trip to the server either through ajax or through a postback

updatepanel	formview
once you get it working normally try putting the formview into an updatepanel and see if the bind still works

1117619
hide	show
you just need to connect to the change on the selected checked the val and hide show the div

1117623
tree	trie
in that case r b tree or trie s might be the best way

1117627
getter	setter
private is really .so that you are not using variables globally .so you make use of getter and setter in classes which helps loosen coupling

1117640
firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
writing your own code is definitely an option but layout engines ie webkit in uiwebview safari or gecko in firefox is a complicated task

1117654
constructor	object
to answer the general question of casting a to if you wanted to do it safely without just applying the object to the some constructor there is a simple function that i would use

just click the new query button and selected the crosstab query wizard

1117676
pyflakes	pylint
there are some tools like pylint or pyflakes which may catch some of those

1117679
execution	exit
the methods you are execution is a background-thread as you mentioned .when the gui exit after you close the form all the main foreground thread are died hence your application dies with it

1117688
multiplication	division
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117688
multiplication	division
i would also be careful about always using multiplication of the reciprocal instead of division to gain cpu performance they may not give exactly the same results

1117693
derived-class	base-class
otherwise the problem i m attempting to learn my way through is one of setting base-class member types based on arguments passed to a derived-class constructor using templates

1117693
derived-class	base-class
if there were a way to set the base-class member types t foo-t simply by passing arguments to the derived-class constructor i would prefer that

1117696
subtract	add
think about it in terms of elementary operations that hardware can more easily implements -- add subtract shift compare

1117696
multiplication	division
as you see even at this small size numbers of bits in the numberss and with libs optimized by exactly the same speed-obsessed people multiplication by the reciprocal can save 1 3 of the time that division takes

1117702
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1117718
linux	unix
while i talk of linux and tools here you really do not need a unix environment

1117724
attributes	properties	hide	show
one thing you can do is make the height fixed and use overflow css properties set to hide to hide the text and use the title attributes to show the whole text in a tooltip

1117728
pointers	stack
for example any pointers value or stack offset whether used directly or used internally by the language runtime etc. will likely not be valid the next time your program runs because the heap will have been used to allocate slightly different series of memory blocks

1117736
pyflakes	pylint
pydev is pretty well integrated with pylint see here -- and pylint is a much more powerful checker than pyflakes beyond the minor issue of misspelled variables it will catch styles violations etc etc -- it s highly customizable for whatever your specific purposes are

1117741
bug-tracking	trac
trac as a bug-tracking and requirement management tool -- it nicely integrated with subversion has very useful plugins including blog and discussion plugins

1117743
selected	textbox
in a textbox i am entering or selected the path and filenamed from local machine or remote machine once i selected the filenamed then i want to checked if the entered file named is has any invalid charcaters

1117743
selected	textbox
i cannot give like textbox â œselecteded pathâ because i can selected a file from local machine or remote machine but the file named is same

1117783
hide	show
and .some stuff i d like to hide and show in correspondence to click on those triggers like .so

1117788
oracle	mysql
postgis is gpl but as it turns out geodjango has support for mysql and oracle

1117797
callback	methods
now to receive the result you need to implements one callback methods

1117815
contains	any
continue this process any time a cube contains more than 1 un-equal coordinates

1117836
redmine	trac
with regards to annotations you might be able to get away with using one of the code review plugins for either trac or redmine

1117842
windows-vista	windows-xp
i am especially interested in how to write portable code which works on both windows-vista and windows-xp i think windows-xp does not have function like run as administration

1117845
contains	set
there might be some issues that you would want to iron out such as handling cases where your dosomething methods also contains a try-catch-finally set that clears the debugging context

1117847
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
i am trying to do a painting program with qt 4.5 .so i am using the qgraphicsview for the canvas and qgraphicsscene to store the items draw

1117847
qgraphicsview	qpainter
for some reasons i just couldn t get a qpainter context in my own derived qgraphicsview

1117847
qgraphicsview	qwidget
seeing that qgraphicsview is derived from qabstractscrollarea then qframe then qwidget i would expecting that the code would work

1117847
qgraphicsview	qpainter
1 why is that i can t use paintevent in a qgraphicsview to get a active qpainter

1117857
selected	textbox
how can i display a selected calendar value in a textbox

1117889
design-time	designer
if you want to provide special design-time functionality then you will also need to provide some additional designer related attributes and probably your own class derived from controldesigner

1117903
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework is an evolution of ado.net and the first concrete implementation of the edm providing a higher level of abstraction .when developing against a relational-database

1117903
entity-framework	ado.net
to begin evolving the ado.net platform the entity-framework is built on top of the existing ado.net 2.0 provider model with existing providers being updates slightly to support the new entity-framework and ado.net 3.5 functionality

1117906
shell	bash	jface	swt
i m running bash shell in os x and would like to try some swt jface tutorials

1117906
jface	swt
now i would like to compile and run a swt and or jface application from command-line without running eclipse

1117906
jface	swt
could someone guide me with the step needed to compile and run a simple swt jface application

1117907
instances	destroy
i tried creating a new instances of the form but then i would have to create the new instances and destroy the original one which seems like a big waste and inefficient

1117978
protected	public
private is imo always best at first and then make public protected as the need arises

1117978
any	set
was there any other functionality that your subclassing had to provide or could you have just created a new instances set the path and be done with it

1118001
raw-sockets	packets
this example from the documentation show how to use raw-sockets to sniff packets and it looks similar enough

1118006
arguments	default
is there a way to eliminate the need to redeclare the default for all of the subclassing constructor arguments as in dog.__init__

1118006
arguments	default
should i even be including this many arguments with default anyway

1118011
python	php
or any other language framework with full control like php codeigniter or python django

1118050
multiplication	division
any well written program will do the multiplication and division necessary to scale the fonts properly and in the newest versioning of windows the os will lie about the resolution and scale the fontss automatically

1118050
windows-vista	windows
edit beginning with windows-vista windows will not report your actual configure dpi unless you write a dpi-aware program

1118086
contains	any
however .when an exception-handling is raised the runtime starts walking up stack from the site at which it is raised checked tables of metadata to see whether the site in question is contains within any of the critical try blocks

1118088
cryptographic-hash-function	hash
you can of course but in that case the sha digest of the whole file will not be the sha you include because it is a cryptographic-hash-function .so changing a single bit in the file changes the whole hash

1118090
revision	svn	output	cat
i would normally suggest using svn diff or svn cat but there is as far as i know no way to get the revision numbers inline with the code output

1118137
command-prompt	cmd
further informations about command-prompt options can be get by cmd

1118147
interpreter	runtime
it is theoretically possible but there will be a lot of runtime support baggage involved and even a full javascript compiler or interpreter to support eval

1118150
conditional	parentheses
my conditional is that i want mimimum 7 numbers in the given string ignoring separators x parentheses

1118155
linux	osx
getting a linker-error on osx no errors on linux or fbsd for the same code

1118163

1118175
contains	any
creates a character-class matching any one of the contains characters

1118177
java-3d	jogl
it doesn t use java-3d afaik either self-made 3d or opengl using jogl iirc

1118182
protected	public
the field were made private yes you can use private protected with recording and added readonly properties to the public section

1118185
contains	any
if you re asking this for the purpose of creating a standalone executable from javascripting code i m sure there must be wrapper which essentially would create an executable contains your scripting and an embedded-javascripting viewmodel sadly i don t know any offhand

1118198
contains	set
inorder to set a div contains a transparency text image as the highest z-index in my document i picked the numbers 10 000 and it solved my problem

1118199
value	field
how do i evaluate splistitem field value using vs debugger

1118199
value	field
best i get is only a list of field named but not value

1118212
textchanged	textbox
if its a textbox you are using you want to use the textchanged event

1118218
revision	svn
svn blame â show author and revision information inline for the specified files or urls

1118227
callback	methods
all the other variables present are defined in the class that contains the initialization code and the callback methods

1118228
turbogears	django
am sure you would have read from plenty of comparison between turbogears and django on web

1118247
file-manager	upload
hey checkout the upload progress dialog at s3fm a free online amazon-s3 file-manager

1118248
photoshop	layer
think of the grid as a visual constraints layer then the design can be mapped between a photoshop comp and specific html css implementation

1118261
getter	setter
the first seems to conform more strictly to the pojo conventions but the second types is what intellij generator if i ask it to make a class getter setter and hey intellij has never let me down yet

1118268
datagrid	textbox	object-reference	instances
i have a textbox inside my datagrid whose id need to be passed to javascript.the id of my datagrid is datagrid1 and that of textbox is txtitem.all these are inside a contentplaceholder.now i have passed the id of textbox as ct100_contentplaceholder1_datagrid1_txtitem.it show an error in my javascript as object-reference not set to an instances of an object .how can i pass the id of this textbox which is inside a datagrid to javascript

1118299
python	c++
there are binding for it in a lot of programming languages including c++ and python

1118314
any	set
i use pydev with eclipse really good set breakpoints step into code view value on any object and variables try it

1118334
value	field
you could try having a properties on your class that was the byte arrays of your value field

1118356
powerpc	arm
if it is ok it is only ok for x86 and x86_64 processor and most likely not for powerpc and maybe arm since there are no memory barrier instructions

1118376
any	set
for example a program like the gimp the gimp program will be the root nodes of the set of modules but for gentoo almost any program with a gui is a root nodes while the libs etc are dependencies of them

1118386
json	xml
i have been working on twitter api and found it easy to get json xml feed from an url like

1118386
json	xml
similarly i wanted to know if there is a way to get osm json xml data from an url and use that and use it on an osm map..

1118401
emacs	vim
vim and emacs do just fine as well

1118440
value	field
i m using nhibernate there it is very easy to have a subclassing for each specific types and map them to the same table each using a specific field for its specific value

1118444
derived-class	base-class
if you need a named from a base-class .when templates are involved you have to either fully qualify them or make them implicit dependent in your derived-class

1118479
web-services	api
the web-services api will not be published

1118479
web-services	api
the data of the web-services is not secret and private i just want to prevent abuse as there are also api to write some data to the server such as usage log

1118480
value	field
set a customer field to a new value

1118480
contains	set
what happens now is that the savecustomer methods retrieves the current object from the database which does not contains the value set in code but does contains the value set by the stored procedure

1118480
contains	set
set the other one to null since the actual object does not contains the changed made by the stored procedure

1118494
qgraphicsview	qpainter
i guess the moral of this is that there is no qpainter context within a qgraphicsview and you are better off ignoring its paintevent

1118506
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason new data never loads in ie 7 but loads fine in firefox and google-chrome

1118534
worksheet	excel
i want to get the background-color of a cell of an excel worksheet

1118582
extends	sealed
i recently removed a lot of interfaces and sealed a lot of classes as i don t want the user extends the api only in some places

1118586
callback	methods
if the timing requirement is low just start a thread that run an infinite-loop that sleeps and call your callback methods .when it wakes up

1118589
oracle	mysql
i noticed mysql offers simple solutions for this but i did not find anything useful for oracle

1118595
show	next
a printf in the next line show buf to be 300 characters in length but int len gives only 89

1118601
debian	linux
on both my cygwin and my linux box debian i m experiencing same issue

1118611
firefox	safari
i ve tested the following in firefox and safari and it works although it s perhaps not the nicest solution

1118611
margins	padding
if you leave off the padding and margins from the body you ll get scrolling

1118617
sql-server	ms-access
i would like to copy publishing for ms-access users some tables from sql-server 2k to an ms-accessdatabase

1118633
glib	gtk
it is used by the c++ gtk glib wrapper gtkmm

1118642
digits	zero
printf 0x 04x produce a string using the format 0x 04x which corresponds to a literals 0x followed by a four digits or more hex numbers padded with zero

1118658
sql-server	ms-access
it s been a long-long time since i touch ms-access but from distant mostly suppressed memory i recall there was a way to create linked external tables to any odbc supplier including sql-server

1118669
value	field
how then does one distinguish between field and local value value local to the constructor methods

1118669
value	field
however the g value is used only for calculation of the x and y field and has no meaning beyond the constructor scoping

1118670
turbogears	django
in my experience it is simply less hassle to use django compared with turbogears

1118677
uilabel	uiview
set clipstobounds to true on the uiview that your uilabel is sitting in

1118700
object-reference	instances
the problem is i get a object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error .when i try creating the database

1118709
python	perl
perl and python accordingly says to the

1118709
contains	any
your regexp matches any string that contains both numbers and letters but not only one of them

1118710
revision	svn
background for the question is i think there are many settings that i wand to put into svn to archive and shared in the project but putting the .metedata branch into revision control seems to be the wrong way to do this

1118714
moss	wss
i am afraid that it is not possible out of the box in sharepoint wss moss

1118724
checkbox	button
for many controls such as a button or a checkbox setting will suffice to prevent any integration between the user and the control

1118735
worksheet	excel
i have a c# simple application that have to write some value in a excel ranges of a specific worksheet

1118742
put	get
put all the functions you want to selected from into a dll then use dlsym or getprocaddress on windows or whatever other api your systemd offers to get the function pointers by named and call using that

1118761
relational-database	schema
i have a basic understanding of google s data store .so please assume i will choose a column based database for my stand-alone django application rather than a relational-database .so that the schema could remain mostly the same and will not be a major factors

1118768
glib	gtk
you can find libs that do the work for you like gtk glib

1118792
constructor	object
however if you want to give different object different behavior model you could always pass in a delegation to the constructor

1118795
selected	listbox
i have a listbox to show the search results and i want to be able to selected more than one recording in the results set and open a new form with the limitation of the selecteded recording only

1118820
any	set
if you have a methods declare as my sample above this does not set up any requirements on how you call it

1118826
debugging	exit
not just this having multiple exit points in a program will make debugging harder

1118837
arrays	loops
all you have to do is loops through each line in the file adding it to an arrays using split on the comma

1118839
communication	messages
also look for anything that can open another invisible windows it s common to use windows messages to an invisible windows as an interprocess communication mechanism again look for 3rd party code that might be doing that

1118887
design-time	designer
you would have to create a designer .so the controls can be seen at design-time

1118895
expression-blend	silverlight
on microsoft showcase there are a lot of great video tutorial about silverlight and expression-blend

1118898
margins	padding
i have checked every thing from padding to margins because i know those are usually the problem between browsers

1118898
margins	padding
i as mentioned in the comment below i modified the code a bit as emily suggested i got rid of the margins and even went further removed all margins and padding between items fixed imgs to view the difference between items alternatingly having bgcolor changed

1118899
duplicates	elements
unfortunately if there are duplicates key in the list-attribute you need to do a merge rather than a save on the elements and this is not yet supported for entitymode.dom4j

1118899
duplicates	elements
once i d updates the mapping files to handle the child elements and rename the relevant methods in the domain object it persistent the related data as long as there are no duplicates in the hobbies natch

1118909
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1118917
web-services	api
we re in the process of creating a new api for our product which will be exposed via web-services

1118935
.net	wcf
i have a .net wcf web service working great .when called from another .net .app

1118936
persistent	transient
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instances persistent

1118938
constructor	object
the constructor invocation pattern if a function is invoked with the new prefix then a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function s prototype member and this will be bound to that new object

1118941
contains	elements
events from contains elements triggers the async postback by default .so it s unnecessary

1118994
arrays	loops
and i want to extraction an arrays of cats ids in 1 line not a function nor a loops

1119041
value	field
i assume that there some field value or value that you can change to make b into a c

1119058
oracle	mysql
i know you can do this using limit mysql rownum oracle or similar but that s not standards sql

1119062
append	input
now i have a requirement to also create a one additional file during the xslt process where i will need to append information regarding each input file process to a common javascript file

1119062
append	input
my question is is it possible to append to a file during the process of multiple input files

1119076
ruby	php
if this is for your own personal website i would suggest moving to a cheaper hosting lighter technology like ruby or php

1119078
groovy	java
you could have a look at how groovy does it using using their scriptom module which is based on the jacob libs java com bridge

1119083
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
as for now it s supported by sql-server oracle and since jul 01 2009 by postgresql 8.4

1119104
version-control	git
you could use a distribute version-control systemd such as mercurial or git

1119109
tinymce	yui
in that case its recommended to use javascript wysiwyg editor like textile markdown tinymce or yui

1119112
shell	bash
edit this seem not to work .so my advice is to trash away the crappy dos command-line and use cygwin with bash as a shell

1119124
persistent	transient
since the id types is assign nhibernate has no idea how to tell if the object is transient or persistent

1119125
constructor	private
if you don t want such parameters to become field and don t want to expose the actual field in a constructor the usual solution is to make the primary constructor private with the actual field and use either an alternate constructor or an object-companion s apply as the effective primary constructor

1119134
malloc	free
i want to know how malloc and free work

1119137
pointers	stack
in unmanaged c++ we can declare a stack buffering and then pass a pointers to it to an api function

1119148
contains	elements
i think styling via column related elements is restrict because although and represent columns of cell it does not actually contains them they re actually containss by the s

1119148
contains	elements
with this comes issues of precedence and specificity and cascading since cascading can only be done between contains containers elements - .when conflicting styles rules from the and which would be the same level in a multiple-inheritance hierarchy occur - which should the cell actually use

1119162
malloc	free
one implementation of malloc free does the following

1119163
malloc	free
this has nothing specifically to do with malloc and free

1119163
malloc	free
this would be true even if you never used malloc and free and allocated the char arrays on stack or statically

1119175
malloc	free
.when you free memory malloc takes that memory block off the chain.

1119190
malloc	free
malloc and free are implementation dependent

1119190
malloc	free
.when you malloc a block is pulled from the free list

1119197
malloc	free
how malloc and free works depends on the runtime libs used

1119212
haskell	lisp	haskell	prolog	prolog	lisp
most courses will touch upon html css ecmascript but what about prolog haskell or lisp

1119215
delphi	basic
i have such a basic problem in delphi i can t solve it

1119225
malloc	free
as far as malloc free implementation goes - entire books are devoted to the topic

1119310
updating	updates
longer explanation i need to updates some data in an xml column and i m using a search replace types hack by casting the xml value to a varchar doing the replace and updating the xml column with this cast

1119312
export	csv
i have an export running on that table to a csv file overnight to give the user a backup of their data

1119315
selected	button
now this macros .when the button is pressed it insert a picture and the size of this picture is selected based on the button size

1119319
malloc	free
there s a sample implementation of malloc and free in the book kernighan-and-ritchie the c programming language

1119322
dialog	pop-up
returning the messages as a string will pop-up a confirmation dialog contains your messages

1119323
any	set
you can add an onchange event on the textarea or any other field that set a variables in javascript

1119325
click	mouse
it will then triggers the rightclickcommand defined in its current datacontext the viewmodel for the windows whenever the rightmouse is click within the windows and not capture by any other control in the logical tree - the event bubbles up from the control directly under the mouse

1119334
malloc	free
the more interesting part is how free works and in this directions malloc too can be understood better

1119334
malloc	free
in many malloc free implementation free does normally not return the memory to the operating systemd or at least only in rare cases

1119334
malloc	free
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standards malloc free is not efficient

1119334
malloc	free
but since malloc and free must be .so universal the standards behavior is always the fallback .when alternatives are not usable

1119334
malloc	free
you know your next free or malloc will crash but you don t know why

1119342
python	ruby
oh yeah and in your spare time after your job or between sessions working on your first product that s .when you start monkeying around with ruby or python or cocoa or whatever else floats your boat

1119346
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
if that isn t possible you can write the bytes you read from the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream which will grow as required

1119347
webrequest	webclient
i have also tried using the webclient class but i suspect it uses a webrequest internally

1119371
malloc	free
malloc and free don t work the same way on every o s

1119387
constructor	object
it s a little ugly having to use eval but afaik there isn t a javascript function constructor that can take a string of code and turn it into an object nicely

1119391
32-bit	x86
in fact more modern x86 cpus support pae which enables addressing more than 4gb or gib even in 32-bit mode

1119399
strncmp	memset	strncmp	strcat	memset	memcmp	memset	strcat	memcmp	strcat	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memmove	memmove	memcpy
in it is used as the types of the parameter num in the functions memchr memcmp memcpy memmove memset strcat strncmp strncpy and strxfrm which in all cases it is used to specify the maximum numbers of bytes or characters the function has to affect

1119422
superclass	inherited
the tag inherited all of the tag attributes of its superclass and adds the following tag attributes

1119427
local-variables	eval
i just remember that in ecma 262 is only one way to add dynamically local-variables to scoping using with statement and eval of course here are solution

1119443
configuration	environment
below is a program c that is execute in msvc++ 6.0 environment on a pc with configuration cpu intel 1.8ghz ram 512mb

1119454
arrays	loops
in the second loops you skip around in memory and run through the arrays traversal the elements in the following order

1119473
iprincipal	iidentity
i have my own iprincipal iidentity and membership-provider

1119473
webforms	asp.net
this behavior is tightly coupled to various features of asp.net webforms my main concern being the sitemap authentication because i d like to use it if i can

1119478
show	next
.when the contextmenustrip is show the items treat the ampersands as escape sequences and underline the next character

1119482
haskell	lisp	smalltalk	lisp
i have read numerous time that learning a language such as haskell lisp or smalltalk will somehow make you a better programmer while you program in other languages

1119496
pass-by-value	return-value
a change to the struct in methods b wonâ t show in methods a unless it is returned again costing time as it is pass-by-value and methods a reads the return-value

1119505
any	set
do we make the transitions to thinking in sql just by practise or is there any magic to learning the set based query language

1119513
value	field
i d say figure out what the value stored in the float field actually is or at least determine what is being returned

1119522
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
it has concepts that aren t supported by the languages i use c# c++ python perl and i wanted to know what i was missing and also if it would be worth looking into libs that purport to add these features

1119531
abstract-class	subclassing
.so one possible .solution would be to have a java class that subclassing the image abstract-class but stores the data in a compressed form

1119540
any	set
if you don t get on any project that required you to use result set skills i personally wouldn t worry about it

1119553
arrays	loops
if you already have the textbox in an arrays loops through the arrays and look for duplicates value

1119557
ocaml	lisp	ocaml	sml	scheme	lisp	scheme	sml	scheme	ocaml	lisp	sml
the list then include lisp scheme dylan ocaml and sml

1119557
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
some languages having first-class-functions include python ruby smalltalk and i think perl

1119562
union-all	union
if the european union were called european union-all we would see 27 spelling for the words euro on a euro banknote instead of 2

1119565
32-bit	64bit
however we are moving to 64bit addressing while the uint will most likely stay at 32-bit it s size is not guaranteed in the c++ standards

1119572
export	report
.when you export this report into excel you will have each value 10|20 and the sum of the two - without the reference to the cell they occupy

1119580
contains	any
typically i have a solution contains a numbers of project without any unit tests in that main solution - this is the solution that gets built-in release-mode for a true building

1119580
contains	any
for a specific project i have a separate solution which contains the project i want to unit test and any dependent ones and a myprojectname.unittests project which house all the unit tests for that project

1119605
textbox	button
but i of course want to bind the text properties to my viewmodel .so i can send the value the bound textbox .when the button is click not working with code-behind i want to do this

1119615
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using an ado.net entity-framework objectcontext to access my data store

1119623
hash	md5
what you can do is get a secret-key that only you know include that in an md5 hash signature typically you can structure signature as a s tring of your parameters a nd value and the secret append at the end then take the md5 hash of that...do this both in your client and service side and match the signature string only if the signature match do you get granted access...since t he secret is only present i n the signature it w ill be hard to reverse engineer and crack

1119640
constructor	private
i d use a private constructor and list each of the field in the class like this

1119658
value	field
.when you create your custom validation or form if you specify a second optional parameter context null then zend will auto-populate this with the entire arrays of posted data which you can use to incorporate other field value into your validation

1119675
callable-statement	jdbc
if you re using the jdbc callable-statement then you re safe

1119677
any	set
how can i set things up in this project to make sure this .jar file is updates any time one of the .java files in the project has been re-compiled

1119679
configuration	installation
okay this is the usual issue with the new installation of the sharepoint by default the internet-explorer of windows 2003 runs in the very restrictive mode ie enhanced security configuration enabled which al.so include the javascript .so that the event not getting fired.to .solve this add the site as trusted site in the ie and set the security level to low

1119689
duplicates	elements
in this example it display the ids of the two elements with duplicates value

1119690
png	gif
if you don t know the image types like you want to handle gif and png as well or if you think the extension may occur multiple time in the filename image.jpg.jpg then you will want a templates to help you

1119696
python	java
i m trying out jepp java embedded python - has anyone used that before

1119699
combinations	permutation
note that i am looking for combinations not permutation and that we need a solution for varying k hard-coding the loops is a no-no

1119707
updatepanel	gridview
i have a master details setup with a gridview and detailview both in updatepanel

1119707
updating	updates
this works fine .when updating but .when a new item is selected in the gridview the updates text disappears

1119713
distance	polygons
i would start by bounding all the polygons by a bounding circle and then finding an upper bound of the minimal distance

1119713
distance	polygons
then i would simply checked the edges of all blue polygonss whose lower-bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1119713
distance	polygons
for every blue polygons where distance red s centering current blue s centering - current blue s radius upper bound of min distance

1119713
distance	polygons
if the blue polygonss are relatively small compared to the distance between them and the red polygons then this approach should work nicely but if they are very close you won t save anything many of them will be close enough

1119714
python	java
if you can get your python code to work in jython then you should be able to use that to call it from java

1119722
digits	base
how would you convert an int to base 62 like hexadecimal but with these digits 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

1119739
value	field
we are trying to store datetime value in an oracle date field

1119752
python	java
it has both python and java support

1119760
attributes	properties
an example is given below for tagging three properties with an attributes using reflection but it could be easily modified to add attributess to a types or to all properties etc

1119788
ready	live	.when	ready
however it s probably better practice to setup a local environment using something like xampp to edit your website on a development machine and then upload it to your live server .when it s ready

1119791
libpng	zlib
but you can consider looking at the ones used by fairly portable libs like libpng zlib etc

1119795
show	next
if i navigate from one recording to the next then the textfield updates their text to show the new data

1119820
random-seed	generator
and in the implementation file i defined the float as a random numbers and i used srandom as a random-seed generator

1119839
data-members	instances
data-members on php classes can t have runtime-calculated value such as new object instances

1119845
.when	ready
.when the user is ready to checkout just pull the item details from your session and building an order

1119861
default	reset
then press the button to reset to default p 1

1119868
authentication	logout	authentication	login	logout	login
i have a website where the login info is optional saved in a cookies remember-me checkbox at login and .when the user logs out the value of the authentication cookies won t change to expire the cookies allowing logout

1119884
python	java
now depending on your setup either java or python part would be a server accepting connection from other language

1119884
python	java
another option is to write a c wrapper around that pieces of python functionality that you need to expose to java and use it via jvm native plugins

1119884
python	c++
create c++ code that will receive your call and internally call python interpreter with right params

1119884
python	java
convert response you get from python and send it via swig back to your java code

1119890
push	pull
it can be used to push put a view into a region or pull let modules declare which region they populate

1119891
triggers	insert
i am wondering because if it doesn t change that often and this is a frequently execute query it may be better design to have an after insert triggers calculate the value and store it in the table as a separate column

1119897
sql-server	oracle
how do i do query several databases different ones oracle sql-server etc. in jruby on ruby-on-rails with jdbc and put them all in one page

1119907
callback	methods
it should run the callback methods immediately in another thread

1119922
attributes	properties
in the designer create various columns and set the datapropertiesnamed to the attributes properties named s from the class that was used to generator the xml

1119929
entity-framework	nhibernate
perhaps you want something a level up such as nhibernate subsonic entity-framework etc

1119934
arguments	default
because i left the first arguments empty of the invokemember call it would use the attributes to determine what the default member is of your class in your case it is main

1119942
arguments	default
the defaultmemberattributes attributes defined the default member to be called on a .when invokemember is called with an empty string as the first arguments

1119950
codeigniter	kohana
makes me think that you might be using codeigniter or kohana

1119955
http	ssl
if you want security transmit your data over http http with ssl

1119956
contains	elements
i have a elements contains an image

1119956
contains	elements	hide	show
i want to hover the contains the image and then show or hide the elements

1119977
crypt	hash
you should hash your passwd and store the hash passwd in the database see crypt

1119980
constructor	object
better type-safety gets throw in free. also if you d like the dictionary to own the object and free them .when you re done change it to a tobjectdictionary and .when you call the constructor pass doownsvalues to the appropriate parameter

1119981
mapping	unique
is there a way to specify in a hibernate mapping file the constraint named from foreign key unique etc that will be created rather than the not user-friendly generator ones

1119995
textbox	button
it s certainly simpler .so if you just need a simple textbox here and button there you ll be able to create .something quicker in winforms for sure

1119997
hide	show
i m using a list to building a simple nav menu that show .when you hover and hide .when you leave it

1120001
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i have a solution with asp.net-mvc web application wcf web service and silverlight

1120009
distance	polygons
pick any blue polygons and find the distance from the red one

1120009
distance	polygons
if the minimum distance between the bounding areas is greater than the already found distance you can ignore this polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
find the minimum distance centroid distance between the red polygons and all the blue polygonss

1120009
distance	polygons
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the .sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found .so far

1120009
distance	polygons
for the actual minimum distance calculation you could use yang et al s a new fast algorithm for computing the distance between two disjoint convex polygons based on voronoi diagram which is o log n + log m

1120013
click	mouse
you can add a custom mouselistener and handle mouse click drag and mouse release and then resize the panels programmaticaly

1120039
attributes	properties
as long as you make your class comvisible in properties of visual-studio 2005 or 2008 or set the comvisible attributes to true in the assembly file you should be able to see your class in vb6

1120059
selected	button
on a click of a button a unordered list gets append with an with details from the selected item in the dropdownlistfor

1120080
linux	unix
these are widely considered to be classics and standards references for unix linux et al

1120081
mouseover	mouseout
what i recommend you do is to use a javascript-framework such as jquery which has cross-browser handling of mouseover and mouseout

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
even better it has mouseenter and mouseleave which are special events that are sure to only triggers once per mouse entering leaving of an elements even if it has child elementss

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
see demo of mouseenter mouseleave events in jquery

1120091
revision	svn
you might try doing an svn up and getting the last revision and use that rev plus one

1120103
value	field
the first c_data is a default no-args constructor which initializer the structure s field to default value value - 0.0 labels - 0 id - 0 and the second c_data is a constructor which sets the value field of the instances to the passed-in parameter val and the other field to their default value

1120109
export	csv
i m trying to export a postgresql table with headings to a csv file via command-line however i get it to export-to-csv file but without headings

1120110
atomicity	deadlock
the only atomicity thing is the cas operation in hardware you completely avoid the possibility of deadlock and usually there is some performance gain too

1120116
value	field
assuming your syntax is correct you most likely have a field that required a value but you ve omitted from your target field list

1120136
32-bit	64bit
as raymond chen points out in windows a 32-bit application can allocate more than 4gb of memory and you don t need 64bit windows to do it

1120137
environment	building
you can also try to building a test environment like your customer have - limit or increase numbers of cpus memory etc

1120140
parsing	comma
at this points it can really just be a comma-delimited parsing ie don t worry about escaping newline and comma

1120147
blackberry-simulator	blackberry
to start with inorder to see html rendering email on a blackberry-simulator no matter the model the simulator must run off of a bes connection corporate blackberry server as the include ess the software pop smtp proxy .app that allows you to test blackberry email service locally does not support html email

1120153
msbuild	nant
cruisecontrol.net recommends that you use nunit through your builder nant msbuild

1120157
hash	md5
then .when the client connect have the client generator another random string append that to the end of the shared string then calculate the md5 hash

1120166
contains	any
a folder may not have any content and a normals file cannot contains other files

1120168
postgresql	mysql
many databases at least mysql and postgresql maybe all has a database called information_schema or something similar

1120169
oracle	mysql
if no what db oracle mysql microsoft other

1120173
highlight	cell
.when highlight the cell it goes blue and the accessory item turns white

1120173
highlight	cell
.when i go back to the tableview the uitableviewcellaccessorydisclosureindicator is gone and tapping holding down the finger on the same cell will not highlight it again

1120173
highlight	cell
i have noticed that apple s own example code the cell is highlight .when the new view is pushed and going back to the tableview the cell remains highlight until the tableview is pushed all the way back into place

1120186
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
as far as the spinning part goes you just tracking the location and movement of touches in your view with touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

1120192
contains	elements
basically i d like to checked if a fileset contains elements according to regex

1120201
specifications	w3c
and here is the w3c specifications

1120203
entity-framework	data-access
entity-framework model data-access

1120211
value	field
for instances did you notice that you could have a sequences of field value value

1120218
updating	updates
using your regular model plain poco you can updates the view .when your model change but since your model does not implements dependency-properties most likely you won t be able to take advantage of updating your model .when the value in wpf control changes

1120237
any	set	lookup	any
i suggest creating a simple lookup table which you can initializer in the static constructor to set any combinations of characters to valid

1120247
imageview	textview
i put an imageview and a textview within a relativelayout that is used as list items and want the imageview to grow vertically with the line numbers of textview

1120281
specifications	w3c
they are selectors - see w3c specifications

1120297
python	java
i am interested in developing things for google-apps and android using python and java

1120305
highlight	cell
i m not sure what the fast scrolling code is that you re referring to but the table view cell should stay highlight through a push and pop of a view controllers only deselecting immediately after the next controllers is popped

1120305
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
the cell selected highlight blue

1120305
highlight	cell
if the datasource changes to another object that doesn t include a uitableviewcellaccessorydisclosureindicator in its generator cell you won t see it .when you refresh the table by pushing popping a view even .when that cell is highlight

1120356
.when	ready
.when a user presses the back button the load event doesn t fire but the dom content ready event does

1120391
derived-class	base-class
i will reiterate your question in base-class you are creating user and somehow you want to return derived-class

1120400
value	field
where is it modeled that field x is an enumerated value selected from a list

1120431
hash	md5
also you should avoid md5 in favor of a currently-strong hash algorithm such as sha1 sha-256 sha-512

1120434
haskell	fortran	haskell	python
to be able to checked or prototype programs that will be written in a different language some routines for numerical computing in c can be quickly checkeded or scale using languages that have appropriate functionality built-in such as fortran python or haskell

1120435
zend-framework	cakephp
take something from the zend-framework then take something from the cakephp and in the end you ll have something that will work for you and you will also have learned something note don t copy code just get an idea

1120463
restart	exit
you ll have to exit visual-studio and restart it

1120464
environment	restart
you have to restart the vs process .so it can pick up the changes to the environment

1120489
32-bit	64bit
depending on which runtime 32-bit or 64bit and whether you declare the instance-variables size and points explicit or have them synthesized by the runtime you may be able to access them directly as in

1120489
attributes	properties
in objective-c 2.0 the correct practice is to declare a properties for each attributes that you want to be puclically visible

1120531
json	xml
you can also use new features in 3.5 like binary encoding of xml or json encoding over http

1120531
windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows
and on windows-vista or windows-server 2008 you can use was windows activation service to hosts wcf service

1120566
contains	set
i have a report contains seven tables each table returning a different set of value for a list of id s selected in a parameter list

1120597
nvidia	ati
until windows-vista ati and nvidia supported a feature called horizontal span which combined two monitor into a single larger screens

1120597
remote-desktop	rdp
this feature allows the taskbar to span across both monitor allows games to be played in fullscreens across both monitor and allow remote-desktop connection to span both monitor without the span feature i have four monitor .so my total screens width is more than rdp s limit of 4096 pixels making span very annoying

1120603
javascript	dom
coding javascript application is often way more than just integration with dom and then asp.net-mvc and pac code architectures come in-place

1120624
rdfs	owl
the final thing to keep in mind is what semantic-web for the working ontologist model in rdf rdfs and owl call wishful named

1120626
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

1120626
firefox	safari
this is particularly the case seeing as you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly

1120629
binaries	install
mingw used to generator pretty much standalone binaries and maybe that is even more native than msvc s which required msvcrt a component that needs to be install sometimes

1120632
selenium-ide	selenium	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the selenium-ide is a firefox browser-extension no ie versioning available yet but selenium works in most web browsers including ie firefox safari and opera

1120641
http	ssl
by default versioning of windows internet-explorer that were release starting with the release of security updates 832894 do not support handling user named and passwd in http and http with secure sockets layer ssl or http urls

1120641
firefox	opera
if you are using firefox or opera you are ok as long as you configure the iis website directory security to allow basic-authentication

1120653
dictionary	arrays
read a plist with these two value into a dictionary and read them into two different arrays that i can use with my tables

1120653
dictionary	arrays
save the arrays back to the dictionary and then back to a plist

1120656
constructor	object
the directoryentry object returned by the constructor is no good

1120663
entity-framework	ado.net
i have a simple linq query on ado.net entity-framework as follows

1120665
design-time	designer
i imagine if you set up the sp before hand the ssrs designer has some means of showing you what data is available and to selected an sp at design-time

1120667
google-chrome	firefox
whereas other browsers such as firefox and google-chrome have the benefit of learning from ms s mistakes

1120684
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
code to firefox work around for ie make sure it works the same way in google-chrome and safari and ignore the rest

1120698
keyboard	mouse
basically it will put an http interface on java.awt.robot .so code in any language can simulate mouse keyboard events

1120702
firefox	safari
most important in my eyes you have a claim that it s you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly. this claim of a lack of symmetry is non-intuitive to my eyes but if true is quite a strong arguments

1120709
python	java
i am particularly interested in something written in python or java that can reduce the effort involved in developing android-emulator for 8bit processor 6502 6510 etc.

1120712
dictionary	arrays
the approach that would perhaps be the simplest is to store the data as an arrays of dictionary

1120714
show	next
how do you get the graphic that is next to the address bar show up

1120719
python	lua
it might also be worth looking at the facility in python lua other scripting languages to embed their runtime in a c program parts of the c code can then be manipulated with the scriptinging-language

1120745
selected	button
i have successfully colored the button and surrounded them with a black outline if selected or if they have the input focus

1120749
value	field
and you will have a recording with a six byte value for the filedata field

1120753
compact-framework	.net
does the .net compact-framework have built-in controls or api s that will do this

1120753
compact-framework	.net
i m a little confused why this wouldn t be supported in the .net compact-framework

1120757
python	c++
i m also open to learning new languages javascript jquery asp.net c# python or using new libs and or frameworks with c++ we only used the stl in comp sci ii and other languages

1120763
value	field
defined an appropriately named int field for your enum and initializer it to whatever value suits you best

1120771
project-management	project
for instances last year i created a fully functional project-management systemd that i now use for some of my project

1120776
functional-programming	imperative-programming
for someone learning functional-programming for the first time haskell is nice because it doesn t really allow for imperative-programming practices

1120784
sql-server	oracle
then i setup a replication between sql-server and oracle scheduling to replicate that single cell change from sql to oracle every 3 minutes

1120804
linked-list	arrays
better is a bit subjective depends on your goals how the data structure is used - a linked-list may be better to avoid copy over head into the arrays but this is at the expense of complicating the tracking of the buffering of the list items

1120810
binaries	install
my install is from the provided binaries for mac osx - qt 4.5.2 on the qt site

1120822
progress-bar	progress
within my statusbar class is a progress-bar which other classes doing work can tell to updates change bar completion and labels as they progress

1120824
python	c++
you can for example program a python scripting that printing metrics on a c++ project

1120835
pointers	stack
however i m curious as to why you d need this structure - why not keep a pointers reference or the actual list object itself on stack of each thread given that it s private to each thread

1120841
selected	checkbox
now selected the checkbox in the first row

1120841
selected	checkbox
and later it returns the selected value of the checkbox

1120844
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
see the activerecord api docs for more info especially the single-table-inheritance section

1120847
dictionary	arrays
i believe if you have dictionary in your arrays you should be able to get them back this way

1120848
linux	osx
my qt4 apps with a qmenubar show up fine under linux and windows but will not display under osx

1120857
revision	svn
how to embed svn revision into code url

1120871
firefox	opera
also works firefox 3 on windows and opera

1120873
value	field
you need to write a recursive methods that takes an object loops through its field obj.gettypes .getfield and printing the value of a field of primitive types and call itself for a class other than string

1120884
identity-column	sql-server
this same value is set to true automatically for the identity-column automatically as in that case sql-server is generator your row ids

1120890
version-control	git
they offer version-control hosting for multiple version-control systemd - including svn and git

1120933
contains	elements
this vector will undergo random reordering of its elements until it contains a sequences of ones greater than or equals to the desired minimum length of ones

1120939
environment	building
following the clue given about using versioning #s if that presents difficulties for you in your building environment it is also just as effective to put a url parameter at the end of your url

1120952
any	set
note that the redirection construct used here is similar to but not quite the same as the more usual pipeline cmd2 | cmd1 -- if the cmd are shell built-in while the pipeline versioning execute them in subshell and any variables they set the arrays a are lost .when they exit

1120958
compatibility	legacy
now most microsoft data sources allow both odbc and oledb access mainly for compatibility with legacy odbc data consumers

1120971
32-bit	64bit
mac binary package using cocoa for mac os x 10.5 32-bit and 64bit

1120992
firefox	safari
data-url work in firefox 3.0.11 and safari 4.0 and probably other compliant browsers but i can t get this approach to work in ie 8.0

1120995
directory	folder
the problem is that for a subfolder in the tutorials directory say www tutorials abc which contains an index.html using one url display the page as is whereas the other url show the folder contents and does not display the index.html file

1120998
any	set
events are perfect for any sort of state machine you might set up

1120999
initializer	setter
i have a class from someone else s codebase no source available that i need to utilize and i basically want an exception-handling to be throw if any piece of code anywhere tries to call a public setter within this class after it has been initializer

1121003
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
if there isn t i could probably make use of python perl or php favourite to achieve a file downloading

1121006
httpd.conf	hosts
you need to add a directoryindex directive to your apache configuration file such as httpd.conf for the section where you defined your virtual hosts

1121008
reflection	runtime
types definitions cannot be altered at runtime via reflection and hence it cannot be used as a device to make a types immutable

1121009
.when	ready
.when i am ready to push a versioning to the stage server i go through the files i want to stage and tag them stage

1121009
url-rewriting	rewrite
but you may be able to use apache url-rewriting to rewrite url s on stage to talk to a custom tcp ports

1121147
scriptaculous	jquery	slidedown	slideup
the slideup and slidedown methods come from scriptaculous not sure if they re directly compatible with the jquery effect

1121147
slidedown	slideup
slidedown didn t seem to do anything either probably because slideup was gone .so i swapped it for pulsate just to confirm it was working

it is quite clear that autotools are superior not because cmake can t do the same thing but because it is just much harder to do .so with it

1121403
autotools	cmake
for example cmake the most popular alternative to autotools has the following drawbacks

1121403
autotools	cmake
on the other hand if you develop on windows and for visual-studio then you can t use autotools and you need to choose cmake that provides such tools

if you re really afraid of accidental collision just do both md5 and sha1 hash and compare them

1121791
difference	factors
now if i call this template-function with int then i get a factors of 6 performance difference according to whether i defined const or not

1121791
multiplication	modulo
examining the disassembly show that in the fast const case the modulo has been turned into a multiplication and shift types thing whereas in the slow non-const case it s using idivl

1122143
build-server	teamcity
one way i saw was on the webinterface for the build-server teamcity

1122146
cos	sin
the motion of the centering of mass cm will just move smoothly along a straight line and the corner pointss will rotate around an axis through the cm assumed to be the z-axis here .so the equation for each corner points parameterized by time-t is p v t + x + r sin wt+s i + cos wt + s j where v is the vector velocity of the centering of mass

1122146
coordinate-systems	points
note though that the different coordinate-systems are fixed in spaces and not traveling with the tetrahedra. .so determine the rotation matrix and apply them to each trajectory the points and cm of each of the tetrahedra

setinterval	settimeout
you can also use the settimeout setinterval functions

1122377
plugins	add-on
there can be exterior clients of the model that only see valid states and interior clients plugins extensions add-on which have to be able to see what would otherwise be regarded as invalid states because they have a role to play in implements state transitions

1122379
schema	rdbms
if your rdbms supports it i would organize components according to schema which would allow you to at least maintain a logical separation by design

1122400
authentication	impersonation
because the lsa on the asp machine knows that the authentication is ok it will allow an impersonation of the remote user to access anything it has the rights to access under the control of the said lsa in other words everything on the local asp machine

1122436
sql-server	mysql
i understand what it is saying but this query would work in mysql how would i achieve this in sql-server

i m using it on python 2.5.2 with lxml and beautifulsoup

1122500
constructor	object
you should have one class-level random object initiated once in the constructor and reused on each call this continue the same sequences of pseudo-random numbers

1122517
constructor	private
if both a constructor parameter and a properties required the same validation you can either use a common private methods to validation the value for both the properties and the constructor or you can do the validation in the properties and use the properties inside your constructor .when setting the local-variables

1122530
progress-bar	progress
if you set isindeterminate true for the progress-bar it will not walk from 0 to 100 but just run left-right-left again and again some k.i.t.t.-effect you will want this only if you don t know where you are in your progress timeline

1122547
ip-address	proxy
i can easy ip ban them except they always come back under a different ip-address through a proxy or tor

1122547
lookup	any
.so i was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can lookup the ip and determine if its a genuine user or .someone behind a proxy in which case it would muzzle their account upon registration

1122552
order	add
you might want to add an order by also to specify which five project you want data from

1122576
reflection	runtime
it can do runtime analysis to realize that you are invoking the same function over and over again .so it can optimize out the reflection and virtual function-call

1122584
profiling	debugging
note that .sometimes switching on the profiling switches the xslt engine into a debugging mode .so that certain optimizations are not performed .so the profiling results should be taken with .some common sense

1122589
any	set
create a set before loops then add any items to be deleted to that set

1122598
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division
remember that division happens-before addition subtraction

1122605
show	next
as the code suggests i only want to show the latest 3 mymodel2 object sorted in reverse order by date although the next 12 do get loaded

1122616
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
however the transitions from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device wait a while

1122644
bazaar	git
tools like git or bazaar can take care of a lot of the tedious stuff automatically like package building upload etc

1122693
contains	any
templates should not contains any business-logic only presentation

1122698
required	checked
if you use a different numbering systemd it would required a bit more work checked the specific value

1122724
json	xml
i would recommend parsing your xml with one of the many xml modules i used xml-simple and then rendering it as json using json xs

1122737
emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	vim
i m using vim for my example but i m sure this is just as easy with emacs textmate etc

1122742
xquery	xslt
stylus studio include both xslt and xquery and with either you can write text files

1122742
xquery	xslt
if you have a xslt or xquery program you can choose to generator code to drive that transform

1122742
xquery	xslt
use the xquery generator code generator c# code... or xslt generator code generator c# code... options to actually create the code and attendant .sln file

1122745
implements	extends
then selected a themes to extends from subclassing it and implements the methods you care about

1122757
triggers	insert
you may also need instead of triggers on those view s to allow more complex logic for insert updates and delete operations

1122762
contains	any
parts of named can contains any numbers of words and there can be any numbers of parts of named

1122767
declarative	imperative
of course this depends on the actual schema of your datamodel and the exact queries but this is just a heads up .so you don t bring the imperative thinking mind frame of procedural-programming to the declarative world of sql

1122773
implements	abstract
i will choose 1 2 in a way that is having an abstract views presenter that contains generics behavior and creates abstract functions that could be possible specific behavior implements by subclassing

1122778
python	perl
the trick also works with python and perl

1122792
removeclass	addclass
you should use addclass and removeclass to achieve this instead of manipulating the css directly

1122806
python	perl	haskell	python	haskell	perl
the reason that this works is because python perl and apparently haskell are all interpreted-language

1122808
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now imagine that you have another asp.net-mvc application using windows forms and now you want to change it to webforms

1122809
filesystems	fat
both fat and ntfs are case-insensitive filesystems

1122818
removeclass	addclass
i agreen with benlumley you should use addclass removeclass methods

1122829
scripting	shebang
is named shebang and is a unix way of execution scripting

1122864
launchd	daemons
i have an application composed of a gui and 3 launchd daemons launchd command-line executable

1122864
launchd	daemons
i m planning to put the executable for the launchd daemons inside the .app bundle for the gui

1122877
any	set
but i set dbprop_multipleparamsets in my dbprops and its and insert statement .so it should not return any rowsets

1122900
constructor	object
i want to create a static-class or singleton class that accepts a reference to another object in its constructor

1122916
object-reference	instances
this is generally considered a bad idea because if you are going to accept either an object-reference or a types arguments that you plan on wrapping in a singleton-like wrapper you cannot guarantee that you hold the only instances of that types in the appdomain

1122917
arguments	default
coalesce allows multiple arguments returning the first non null expression whereas ifnull only permits the expression and the default

1122937
constructor	private
you need a private constructor and then a getinstance methods this methods is who should receive the param the constructor must be private and it can have params also but getinstance should pass it no you

1122941
contains	any
i want to efficiently checked if a table contains any rows that match conditional a and do not match conditional b where the conditionalal are arbitrary

1122969
getter	setter
one thing you can do may be sticking to the singleton sample you found and just exposing a properties setter if needed add getter as well and use it like

1122969
any	set
if you have to restrict the usage of your singleton object for example any operations on the singleton object before the reference is set need to be illegal you can have a private boolean flag for example hasbeenintialized and myreference setter will set the flag internally

1122979
rolap	ssas
now molap s numbers line up but in rolap land i m having major slowdowns because level 1 of my hierarchy has about 10000 members - ssas goes out to lunch on an expansion

1122980
value	field
that if you have a public methods s inside your class even though lets say you can get one of the value you need from a properties or private field in that class instead of requiring a param to that methods and using the param you should still required params and use the params or at least don t count them out .when you can specify some params

1122980
value	field
can someone explain the fine line here and help me come to a conclusion on the line between using a lot of backing field in your methodss or properties rather than some params you specify in the methodss..even though some of those params may still be passed a value from a backing field or properties .when another methods call it

1122988
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i ve got a uinavigationcontroller with a series of uiviewcontroller on it

1122993
populate	row
are you wanting the child information to overwirte what is in the parent grid show up as nested rows under the parent row or the easiest way show another grid below that grid and then on selection of the parent grid row populate the bottom grid with the subset information

1122994
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
in this case you would need to pop back to a specific viewcontroller in the navigationcontroller like .so

1122994
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
that code would pop to the third viewcontroller on the navigationcontroller s stack

1123014
installation	upgrade
if you set productcode as and leave upgradecode as a fixed guid you don t have to write a new upgrade install for each upgrade because your msi is both a new installation install as well as an upgrade install

1123024
codedom	.net
however from further browsing here it looks like the practical upshot is like what .net call the codedom

1123047
getter	setter
option 2 if x and y are exposed as properties you could have their getter setter access a member arrays of two elements and then expose the arrays as a readonly properties too

1123048
constructor	private	instances	private
note that the constructor is private we don t want anyone to be creating instancess of our singleton unless its via the instances operators

1123053
interface-builder	iboutlet
i have an iboutlet to the collectionviewitem from my view and i have that hooked up in interface-builder

1123064
value	field
however it doesn t defined the field anywhere no memory is reserved for it and no initial value is assign to it

1123066
comet	chat
i am doing comet chat with erlang and php

1123086
shell	bash	bash	zsh
however .bashrc is used by default .when using a bash shell .so if you are using another shell csh ksh zsh etc then your changes will not be reflected by modifying .bashrc

1123087
abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	inherited
usually you ll find the construct methods in the base abstract-class of the inherited tree and its purpose is to simply construct initializerr and sometimes initializer the correct subclassing

1123087
subclassing	base-class
after the correct subclassing is created the construct methods returns a base-class reference to the already created subclassing

1123090
ia-32	x86
this works on all platform the fact your asking about ia-32 x86 does not matter

1123112
default-value	default
now it will only set the default-value hvalue and the default gray class hclass if the elements value is or it has the default-value

1123118
contains	set	contains	elements
apparently it s difficult to prove this in comments given the character limit because rlbond appears to thinks that std set guarantees that it will never contains two elements with for his comparator

1123118
duplicates	elements
different elementss in the set have the same value of equality and hence compare the same with because during insert the set never compared the new elements against its duplicates

1123121
callback	methods
note that i changed the methods -- since it s not a form -- and i added callback for failure and exception-handling

1123123
configuration	environment
if your project are more than one level deep you should consider adding some configuration settings that let the javascript know more about the environment it is running in

1123137
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it s working correctly in safari and google-chrome but not in ie7 firefox 3 opera

1123159
derived-class	base-class
in this case you want polymorphism to work on your destructor as well through calling destructor on your base-class you want to end up calling destructor of your most derived-class not your base-class

1123169
derived-class	base-class
if you will or even might destroy object of a derived-class through a base-class pointers you need a virtual-destructor

1123200
pthreads	fork
does anyone know of a way i am thinking pthreads semaphores right now to guarantee a lock across process or barring that a way to stop a django server from fork

1123219
order	join
it seems that on some of the servers that we have the cost of hash join grouping by s and order by s is too low compared to the actual cost

1123239
dump	temp
even to duplicates winscp wanted to temp dump stuff to my local machine

1123270
design-time	design-view
any runtime-dependant code will fail at design-time .so trying to open your control in design-view will blow chunks

1123271
jquery	.post
i am trying to make a rest service that receives complex types from a jquery .ajax .post but i cannot seem to convince asp.net-mvc to hydrate my complex object in the controllers

1123295
http	ssl
i have set up tfs 2008 with ssl http on ports 8081 81 and 17013 etc.

1123300
instrumentation	profiling
the only way i see to do this is without any form of instrumentation to use the clr profiling api to tracking object lifetimes

1123310
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
in java one of the implementation of queue is circular arrays and the other one is linked-list

1123311
contains	any
table 2 has named i want to find every recording in table 1 that contains any of table 2 namedd in either the first named field or the second named field

1123326
put	get
this works out to something like get retr cwd put stor

1123333
linked-list	queue
a linked-list approach is advantageous because you can dynamically resize the queue with no extra effort - this is fundamental to linked-lists

1123333
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
also in a linked-list there is no unused memory in a circular arrays approach if the size of the queue is less than the maximum capacity of the arrays there will be empty slots

1123333
linked-list	nodes
each nodes in a linked-list needs to store a reference to the next nodes - and this adds up if the list gets big

1123337
dictionary	map
what i wanted was to be able to map all of the instances in a queryset into a single dictionary with a specified model field as the key

1123338
linked-list	arrays
free spots still take up spaces in the arrays which they do not do in the linked-list

1123338
linked-list	queue
for the linked-list it is easier to remove and add elements from the middle although that should not be needed at all for a queue

1123342
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
a queue implements as a linked-list doesn t have a fixed size while one implements as a circular arrays aka ring buffering typically has a fixed size though it would be possible to make one that resize much the way an arrayslist resize

1123342
linked-list	arrays
the linked-list implementation uses more memory per elements but the arrays implementation required more contiguous memory

1123342
linked-list	arrays
adding removing elements to the circular arrays implementation is very cheap as it just involves adjusting a counter and setting a reference while the linked-list implementation has to allocate elements .when adding and incurrs gc overhead .when removing

1123344
push	pull
i tried a simple pull followed by push but this yield my commit in duplicates

1123361
scheme	let
call cc is a little complex in that it takes in a function -- a conceptually easier to use construct is let cc which you can find in some implementation like plt scheme

1123364
push	pull
you need to pull from the one remote and push to the other

1123374
version-control	git
version-control svn mercurial git etc.

1123398
selected	listbox
hence for sorted listbox i am using the following code to set selected items

1123419
dictionary	arrays
asp.net wire format for model binding to arrays lists collections dictionary

1123420
restart	reload
.when weblogic thinks there s a change it reload the webapp by garbage collecting the classloader which is fine but it doesn t re-initializer all the servlets that are marked load-on-startup in our case and i m guessing yours the servlet serves no purpose other than to initializer the static variables there are no mapping to it and .so it cannot be invoke the static variables gets gced but not-reinitializerd and the server needs to be restart

1123431
authentication	impersonation
i see only anonymous authentication asp.net impersonation forms-authentication

1123437
put	get
how do i get it to put the value of the variables in1 in2 in3 and in4 into the list

1123493
lookup	any
c++ standards is more like a dictionary - something where you lookup specific things that concern you at any given moment

1123494
base-class	inherited
multiple classes inherited a base-class lets say inheritededclass1 and inheritededclass2

1123494
arraycollection	addchild
in mediator loops over the arraycollection and addchild the views based on data types

1123515
project-management	project
lessons about project-management based on how the failure was handled maybe the project should have been canceled much sooner before the team bought into it

1123529
python	ruby
in a dynamically typesd language like objective-c or python or ruby you often don t want to know what types of object it is

1123550
primitive	int
note that java autoboxes these object automatically since jdk 1.5 .so you can use and declare them just like the primitive no need for new int 1

1123550
primitive	int
.so although they are technically object and therefore extends the object class which the primitive int types does not you can do basic arithmetics with them

1123553
primitive	int
how to present the nullable primitive types int in java

1123558
binary-search-tree	nodes
struct nodes is private to binary-search-tree

1123567
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
however in every browser i ve tested .so far firefox ie google-chrome and safari .when i place a # on the url the behavior seems to be that the browser is downloading the entire swf first and then starts playing it with the end result that it takes a while for the swf to load blank screens the preloader kicks at a 100 and then the swf continue to the site

1123571
attributes	properties
it depends on how the attributes itself is declare - see attributesusageattributes.inherited properties

1123574
wavefront	.obj
the minus one is because wavefront .obj files are 1 indexed instead of c++ 0 index

1123579
arrays	map
turn on the linker map feature and look at how your data section is being allocated and see if there are large-data object or arrays that you don t need

1123583
attributes	properties
attributess applied to attributes class defination carry a properties attributesusageattributes.inherited that determines if an attributesd is inherited in the derived classes

1123592
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
it must also generator automatic binding python php java ruby etc. using an external tool swig

1123592
autotools	cmake
i ve looked into cmake autotools and waf

1123601
datagrid	textbox
my textbox is placed inside of datagrid s cell

1123607
attributes	properties
you can specify that by applying the attributesusage attributes to your custom ones and setting the inherited properties which is true by default

1123607
attributes	properties
this properties indicates if your attributes can be inherited by classes that are derived from the classes that have your custom-attributes applied

1123653
32-bit	64bit
i ve had an experience where moving from a 32-bit windows 2003 server to a 64bit windows 2003 server both running iis 6 and the performance of the asp.net 3.5 website was unacceptable

1123653
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit server would run a clear 2 seconds behind the 32-bit one consistently

1123658
.when	ready
have you considered using dojo.publishing to publishing a topic .when the widget is ready

1123693
arrays	loops
but why am i not able to just loops the arrays afterward

1123705
stateless	stateful
what looks like a stateless operation loops over each pair in a table is actually quite stateful

1123710
environment	building
from your dev environment if you include the following under building plugins

1123722
httphandler	httpmodule
or if you re comfortable enough can you just ensure that the httphandler and httpmodule not handler and modules sections are filled in properly in the web-config

1123742
python	c++
unlike some other languages eg python function arguments in c++ can not be qualified by named like the following

1123756
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
size_t abstracts the types used to hold the size of object because on some systemd this will be a 32-bit value on others it might be 16-bit or 64bit

1123756
32-bit	16-bit
wchar_t abstracts the types used for wide characters since on some systemd it will be a 16-bit types on others it will be a 32-bit types

1123756
unsigned	short
.so if you write your wide character handling code to use the wchar_t types instead of say unsigned short that code will presumably be more portable to various platform

1123780
sql-server	oracle
what you could investigate too are the schema in sql-server which also help you grant or manage permissions - but it s quite a different beast from oracle pl sql package

1123785
if-statement	loops
try adding brackets for the if-statement in the nestled loops

1123793
conditional	operators
you can have logical and or ... operators in join conditional

1123796

is there any methods to know whether a directory contains a subdirectories

1123810
json	xml
finally depending on the types of data returned xml json etc. you can use the appropriate ways to parsing that data

1123816
keyword	term
and your server function will get search term keyword user types in search-box as get request

1123827
linux	bsd
heh but for linux or any pthreads bsd svr# systemd vfork has been around for ages and provides simular functionality

1123832
environment	building
setting qmakespec environment variables either in the systemd or in project building environment doesn t change anything

in this first assignment i have to have the user-input some numbers ex 312 then add each numbers and output something like the numberss are 3 1 2 with the sum of 6. here are the codes

1123888
operators	keyword
i always wondered why there s an equals keyword in linq join rather than using the operators

1123911
gridview	listview
from experience though i can confirm that the gridview on a virtualized listview is amply capable of display thousands of items without severe performance panalties

1123917
implements	extends
if you have created your own table model that extends abstracttablemodel then you should also implements removerow methods

1123925
grouping	sorting
if you are creating an explicit collectionviewsource resource for grouping and sorting your items take care to note that the by-property sorting mechanism of the collectionview is known to be slow

1124000
specifications	w3c
the specifications at the w3c include some examples like this but not everyone supports them

1124001
arrays	loops
since you have to do a loops anyway it s a good idea to use a smaller arrays as a buffering to avoid keeping the whole file in memory and running into an out-of-memory with large-files

1124019
radio-button	button
the hot potato dropped in my lap .when the powers-that-be decided we need some sort of composite control similar to the asp.net radio-button list but instead of radio-button i want the items to be display as large rubber button

1124019
selected	button
the selected item s button needs to be indented for example or depict this graphically somehow

1124025
selected	button
or even better add it to the local intranet zone in internet-explorer tools - internet options - security tab then selected local intranet and click the sites button then the advanced button.

1124026
data-members	private
assuming it s a private data-members of types foo in class a you can t directly change it in the derived-class unless you change a s interface

subtract	add
i want an access query which can find total ie if types is a add it to total and if types is s subtract from total.can anyone help me

1124046
protected	public
or you should make a public or protected function which changes m_pa

1124060
.net	wcf
on the .net side you could use wcf to create a service reference

1124070
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox google-chrome safari and ie8 all showed the underline but ie6 was cutting it ofirefox .so no amount of searching for overrides css elements or whatever would have found this

1124084
binary	hex
the wikipedia page for the bmp file-format contains an example including all hex value of a 2x2 pixels bitmap image it should be very good at explaining the basis of the binary representation of an image

1124084
binary	hex
in general if you re really curious how the binary looks for a file you could always use a hex viewer and take a look yourself i normally use od on linux to dump the binary information of a file

1124207
nsrunloop	nstimer
what is the difference between nstimer nstask nsthread and nsrunloop and is there a guideline on .when to use each of them

1124209
protected	public
longer answer in c++ and most other object oriented programming languages you not only declare the types of a member but also its visibility public protected and private

1124209
constructor	object
especially in the later case you need to start worrying about object ownership which object is responsible for deleting the object stored in m_pa which is created in the constructor

1124223
rtsp	rtp
i want to broadcasting the screens not a static screens of my program using rtsp rtp since this way a mobile phone at least the more recent ones can view the streaming

1124233
contains	elements
building a new collections contains only the elements you want to retain

1124252
contains	elements
i like to create a top level model class that is a singleton and contains all the elements i might need

1124258
pixels	line
that should tell wpf to rendering each 1-pixels-thick border along a single pixels line

1124263
delphi	c++
also if i declare an external function outside my c++ class and called that from delphi i didn t get the access violation but didn t get the interface pointers neither

1124286
player	movie
a scripting in this movie is causing mactromedia flash player 6 to run slowly.

1124294

in words 2007 you can just selected insert - quick parts - field... and use the docproperty field to show the value of the custom field in a document

1124294
worksheet	excel
does anybody know how to display the value of a custom document properties in an excel worksheet cell

1124301
compact-framework	.net
since the target is .net compact-framework the express edition won t do neither will standards edition

1124330
triggers	insert
then write a triggers that runs on every insert statement and call the sp

1124341
linked-list	queue
only if there is a lot of insert deleting in the middle of the list or queue i d chose the linked-list variant

1124341
benchmarking	profiling
if you have performance issue and profiling show that the queue is the bottleneck which is unlikely benchmarking with both implementation of a queue and pick the one which is better

1124345
contains	elements	getter	setter
both components contains two methods that write new data to the struct in the arrays or delete arrays elements and the setter and getter for the arguments

1124345
getter	setter
the components deviate from each other only through theire arguments named the numbers of argumentss each init methods takes and the numbers of getter and setter

1124368
enumerate	except
i am thinking of a feature like explain plan except that it enumerate all possible or at least many execution plans and their associated costs

1124383
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
with me it s similar ie opera do it quickly firefox safari terribly slow

1124389
exception-handling	try-catch
inorder to catch exception-handling in the form constructor you need to surround witch a seperate try-catch block

1124401
exception-handling	try-catch
application.threadexception-handling event is called every time application throw an exception-handling however in your example the exception-handling is throw in the main thread you can add a try-catch block for it

1124408
configuration	environment
i get around this by doing what you suggest which is putting my spring configuration on the classpath .so even though i still use fully-qualified import they work under any environment

1124415
user-interface	drawing
you can use the main thread to collect user-interface events and do the drawing on a background-thread

1124449
double	int
the reason 100 doesn t work is that setvalue interpreter it as an int but canvas.top canvas.left are double

1124460
hide	show
an easy fix would be to also add a class .when you show the item and remove a class .when you hide the item

1124465
nsmutablestring	nsstring
however like java can i initializer a nsstring first then set its contents later or do i need to use an nsmutablestring

1124468
value	field
... basically this column is a concatenation of all additional field recording value

1124470
postgresql	oracle
other systemd like oracle and postgresql clearly distinguish between sql and procedural languages pl sql and pl postgresql

1124470
compatibility	legacy
by that time each vendor already had a burden of legacy applications to support and rewriting their databases to conform to the standards would break the compatibility

1124486
value	field
i used httpservice for reading xml but i want only a particular xml field value like the

1124502
lightbox	jquery
but .when there are other libs and frameworks hosted on sites such as github like this jquery lightbox do you think its best to link to the libs directly from github or should i downloading it and link to the local files

1124522
triggers	insert
we have to be able to average many comments a second which typically triggers 10 insert and 100 reads

1124528
configuration	logging
at a client site without access to a compiler or perhaps on a production machine i can change components around modify database configuration change logging levels etc

1124533
execute	prepare
for the dbo that the correcture will be execute we must should prepare an rollback mechanism

1124546
arguments	default
is there a way to setup a default arguments on install either using installutil or any other way

1124548
textbox	button
if i click the first button then it has to move to second activity and here user has to types something in the textbox

1124548
textbox	button
if he presses the button from the second screens then the value from the textbox should move to the first activity and that should be display in the first activity textview

1124550
logout	login
.so i added 3 methods login logout and dologin to userscontroller where login just does return view login

1124551
document-management	dms
rather than writing a custom dms document-management systemd you should probably consider buying one or using wss sharepoint as this will handle all the mundane details storage indexing meta-data and let you building your custom functionality on top

1124567
.when	ready
in my case the server will notify the client to fetch his data .when the data is ready

1124572
nano	vim
invoke the default editor nano vim

1124591
jmock	junit	subclassing	base-class
with junit 3 jmock provides a useful base-class for your tests mockobjecttestcase which as well as itself being s subclassing of junit s testcase it handles various housekeeping duties regarding the mock framework

1124594
ref	out
however for most common cases no ref out parameters few enough parameters to use one of the existing types you could get away with one of the func or action delegation

1124594
ref	out
.net 4.0 has func action types for huge numbers of parameters .so really you d only need to worry about out ref parameters. if the methods has a non-void return-type use func otherwise use action

1124602
python	java
i like antlr it supports c# as well as java python c etc etc

1124619
background-color	font-size
how can i set the default font-size and the background-color in tinymce

1124635
value	field
in my selected i use this to change it to a numerical value field called discountpercent

1124651
malloc	free
note that they re not malloc and free that are used but operators new and-operators delete

1124660
margins	padding
this is pretty sloppy for my tastes but basically it required text-indent instead of padding or margins to achieve the nesting

1124660
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve tested this in firefox 3.5 safari 4 and opera 9.6

1124663
directory	folder
faced the same problem this morning and got it resolved by copying the clickonce .app s directory from the user settings folder to somewhere like c my.app - i know its nasty and not very ideal

1124677
children	tree
is it possible to have the recording returned in tree order parent then children if a child is a parent then their children if not then sibling etc

1124683
javadoc	doxygen
also you can comment on all functions and types and use a systemd like doxygen or javadoc and then automatically generator the documentation which would make it searchable even outside an ide and presented in a somewhat nice way

1124694
python	java	python	php
i also noticed there a lots of libs on the server to convert plists into native object for php python and assume you can find libs for java or .net

1124732
value	field
write a stored produre to do your field editing and use sqlparameter to save the value

1124746
contains	any
these kinds of util collections classes whatever contains the low-level pieces of code - they are generics and don t seem to hold any relevance to a specific project

1124763
arrays	loops
the compiler treats arrays differently converting a foreach loops basically to a for-loops but not

1124766
contains	set
you need to set dll .lib location contains missing symbols in project setting

1124787
javascript	dom
if you do .so in firebug s html navigator the attributes order won t match the real order in the html .source as firebug display the dom tree generator from the .source and potential javascript manipulation which means that it can reorder the attributes at will.

1124799
keyboard	mouse
cheapest mac mini 1 gb ram 120 gb hd without mouse keyboard and monitor cost as much as mid-range dell or hp laptop 599

cross-compiling	toolchain
using a vendor provided cross-compiling toolchain apparently an openembedded derivative i m unable to embed the absolute-path to third-party open source compiled in house libs

1124811
strtotime	mktime
the best solution is to rely on php s own date time functions like strtotime or mktime

1124819
getdate	dateadd
selected dateadd dd 0 datediff dd 0 getdate

1124819
getdate	dateadd
selected dateadd dd datediff dd 0 getdate 0

1124821
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
for oracle sql-server and postgresql the queries above and both of your queries will most probably yield the same execution plans

1124838
textbox	button
the original use case for a query-string was the kind of page that had a search labels next to a textbox with submit and reset button under it

1124848
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
for other browsers firefox safari opera please do shared here

1124848
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vb6
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

1124864
direct3d	directx
there has been significant work regarding directx direct3d interoperability and performance see for example

1124866
arrays	loops
convert the set into an arrays and then loops until you ve selected enough random elements for the new subset

1124870
ienumerator	ienumerable
like other people have mentioned though the performance doesn t actually matter much the foreach will always be a little bit slower because of the ienumerable ienumerator usage in loops

1124871
getter	setter
basic code-generation specifically javabeans getter setter

1124882
constructor	private
i have a wcf service with a private constructor

1124908
postback	ajax
if you are using updatepanel this will cause the modalpopup to display in ajax fashion without page refresh.but you would still get a full postback worht of data between the client and the server

the sharepoint-list was obtained from the accepted answer to the question wss moss

1124922
order	add
then to add new order you can use it as follows

1124932
implements	abstract
if on the other hand the code that s being shared is rather minimal and simply invokes a private abstract methods that does the work .so that you re implements it in the real controllers anyway i don t know what it buys you

1124937
moss	wss
you re going to be banging your head against that thing a whole lot as you try to understand the mysteries of wss moss and friend and this is a good way to reduce long-term injuries

1124943
linked-list	nodes
.when you access elements 10.000 in a linked-list using the indexer syntax the linked-list will start at the head nodes and traversal the next -pointer ten thousand time until it reaches the correct object

1124943
arrays	loops	linked-list	arrays
as you can see in the case of linked-list s the arrays indexer methods becomes slower and slower the longer you loops it has to go through the same head pointers over and over again

1124943
linked-list	arrays
of course as jon said this really depends on the types of list if the list is not a linked-list but an arrays the behavior is completely different

1124961
silverlight	wpf
i still don t have any background about silverlight wpf and javascript which i think sounds good

1124976
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is a subclassing of uiviewcontroller .so your code would look .something like this

1124983
credentials	account
failing that like wds says it s encrypted credentials or prompt even creating restrict account for each user in the database

1124985
silverlight	wpf
if your game is a wpf application your easiest route may be to ports it to silverlight and serve it up on a webpage

1124990
keyboard	mouse
if you can modify it to accept input from the network as opposed to getting input solely from the keyboard + mouse still easier

1125001
stderr	stdout
alternatively is it actually writing to stderr and instead of stdout for some reason

1125002
silverlight	wpf
silverlight - allows you to run c# code with a wpf like interface on your client s browser and can integrated with your website through javascript

1125317
subtraction	addition
for this intuitive storage methods subtraction is a different operation than addition requiring additional checked on the numbers before they can be added

1125317
subtraction	addition
since you want the most basic operations addition subtraction etc to be as fast as possible you need to store numbers in a way that lets you use the simplest algorithms possible

1125319
subtraction	complement	subtraction	addition	complement	addition
two s complement allows addition and subtraction to be done in the normals way like you wound for unsigned numbers

what i ve done is create a base-class modeled somewhat off of the activerecord pattern that i inherited from and markup the inheriteded class with attributes that attach it to a stored procedure each for selected insert updates and delete

1125873
attributes	properties
the base-class uses reflection to read the attributes and assign the class s properties value to sp parameters and in the case of selected assign the result sqldatareader s column value to the properties of a list of generics

1125877
mousedown	mouseup
.so far i ve got the mousedown and mouseup events trapped but i m having trouble figuring out how to scale the cur.sor s movement which is measured in pixels to a change of the selected points arbitrary scale

1125893
specifications	w3c
my take on this despite that it is not required by the w3c specifications is that .when considering how spotty browsers are about the way they support anything i d make it as consistent as possible using colspans or empty cell to make sure that it s doing exactly what i want on all browsers

1125926
javascript	dom
if you want to access the dom like you would in javascript you are going to need rhino

.so .when a user click the button in the uiviewcontrollers that owns the button i create the new viewcontrollers whose view i want pushed into the screens this is nice because it al.so allows me to set up data in the view controllers and not have to delegation it to .some other object or use a singleton to get the data in the new view then i call my toggleview methods and the root view controllers does the switching

1126088
selected	button
i have a loops where my php reads a sql table and for each row it creats a selected tag and a button with it

i m not sure if theres any universally accepted set of step but the easiest thing to do is just break down each and every step as far as you can go

1127519
defined	declare
in c++ we can declare defined the structure just like class and have the constructor destructor for the structures and have variables functions definedd in it

1127533
value	field
if it is more important to know what a field value was at any points in time as opposed to the recording as a whole is then try the more abbreviated table-field-value-date approach

1127533
triggers	insert
consequently i d suggest creating the audit table identically to the initial table plus autonumbered surrogate key and triggers an insert of the same data into the audit table .when added to the initial table

1127567
put	get
it works fine the first time but .when i refresh the page it looses that reference because the control didn t get rendering again .so it didn t put the references out there

getter	setter
if .so you can think of a virtual event in exactly the same way instead of a getter and setter there s an add operation and a remove operation

1127918
constructor	object
to be able to unit test my c++ code i usually pass the constructor of the class under test one or several object that can be either production code or fake mock object let s call these injection object

1128125
background-color	font-size
for styles that are purely for aesthetical purposes such as background-color font-size and such you can still attach a class to give the consumer of your scripting an easy way to change the appearance of your scripting elements but don t required it

1128143
required	checked
to not go into too much internals there are several step here several conditional being checked the need to initializer data field etc and finally a call to the activator may be required

1128156
value	field
also this question should help you out further selenium how do i use javascript to clear a value from a form field

1128164
.when	ready
this way i can debugging my code normally and then just deploy the compiled service .when the dlls are ready

1128202

same results for sin cos floor ceil exp and log on 32-bit and

1129032
solaris	linux
64bit linux solaris and possibly other platform

1129033
stderr	stdout
now it required a little hacking on line 152 of timecodereader.m you need to change the output from stderr to stdout .so that applescript can read the result

1129038
stderr	stdout
i redirected stderr to stdout there was still no output .when i run it from the server

1129053
directory	folder
i tried keeping the international_test.resources.dll in the de-de folder or just put in in my apps directory

1129191
nested-loops	loops
does a compiler use stack similar to recursion to keep tracking of loops and nested-loops

defined	declare
the alternative approach would be to declare defined the function as virtual and do not defined the virtual definition for the sub inherited class

1129233
value	field
without actually seeing your output file for confirmation my guess is that you ve got to get rid of the field escaped by value

1129233
value	field
2 it is used to precede each character that mysql thinks needs escaping including the field terminate by and line terminate by value

1129236
malloc	free
since stack is a contiguous block of memory premanaged by the compiler there s no real concept of allocation and deallocation in the way that there is for heap allocation new delete or malloc free

1129236
pointers	stack
the compiler uses the memory it needs on stack and simply rollback the pointers later on

1129240
data-members	instances
for instances .when i first learned oop none of the books emphasized that each object has its own set of data-members

1129240
base-class	inherited
inherited is alright but teach .when it is appropriate instead of just adding to your base-class

1129296
sql-server	mysql
i was using a mysql database underneath and i tried the same exact insert with sql-server and the multiple insert with prepare statement worked

as you refactor them out you can use any mock framework i ve used easymock and i like it but there are others - jmock mockito

1129302
groovy	java
groovy works well with java it gets compile to bytecode and has mocking built right into the language

1129304

instrumentation works great for profiling and also has some preset modes that you can use to tracking down memory-leaks view how many instances of various object have been created monitor your opengl performance etc

1129317
primitive	int
starting from java 5 the compiler may box primitive convert primitive value int to their corresponding object int

1129325
grouping	sorting
- is .when you can arrange to walk over the results before groupinging rbg in a sorted way -- you actually don t care about the sorting save in the common case in which an order by is also there and just happens to be on the same field as the grouping by

1129325
value	field	accumulate	grouping
- but rather about the side effect properties of order -- that all rows in rbg with the same value for the grouping field come right after each other .so you can accumulate until the grouping field changes then emit yield the results accumulate .so far and proceed to reinitializer the accumulators with the new row the one with a different value of the grouping field -- make sure to just initializer the accumulators at the very start and just emit yield accumulate results at the very end of course

1129325
accumulate	grouping
if this doesn t work maybe you can hash the groupinging field and use a hashtable for the results being accumulate for that grouping -- at each row in rbg hash the groupinging field checked if it was already present as a key in the hashtable if not put it there with accumulators suitably initializer from the rbg row else updates the accumulators per the rbg row

1129345
contains	set	contains	lookup
you can still use a lookup for this purpose but make sure that you use set the error output to ignore lookup errors for the cases .when the lookup transformation does not contains an value for the match you are looking for

1129356
credentials	account
the passwd for the content access account cannot be decrypted because it was stored with different credentials

1129636
csv	xml
the file will likely be csv possibly xml

1129672
arguments	default
for value const though i agree that it should return reference-to-const default to the reference-to-default-value being passed in as second arguments but i guess the qt developers felt that was too much magic

1129682
click	mouse
then i listen for a mouse click event on the rounded rectangle

1129706
alpha-transparency	alpha
make sure to use alpha-transparency only on tile that actually use alpha and skip drawing blank tile

lgpl	gpl
are there any standards exception-handling to the gpl that i should apply instead of the lgpl and how does the lgpl apply to applications

1129736
digits	base
what you re doing is close to a conversion from base 10 your numbers to base 6 with abcdef being your digits

1129736
digits	base
if you add the next greater power of six to your numbers and then do a base-conversion to base 6 using these digitss and finally stripes the first digits which should be a b a 1 you ve got the result

1129740
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
it s possible - you can use readdirectorychangesw function to watch the file and react to changes or filesystemwatcher if your service is implements in .net

1129743
authentication	login
and by the way you are going to miss that kind of context anyway even if login is authentication

1129744

1129918
keypress	ctrl
i am using the class paste below to listen for the keypress event ctrl + alt + q

1129922
firefox	safari
safari and firefox 3.5 both have pretty good support for offline data but again people with older browsers can t make full use of it

1129943
textmate	vim
i m trying out vim after being a long term user of textmate and while i can see the .appeal of the .app even something as simple as selected all on vim called on the a command-line to paste into another .app seems needlessly complex

1129943
macvim	vim
also is there a way to get a simple gui wrapper vim this as well like how you have with macvim

1129958

1130035
compatibility	legacy
short answer offsetof is a feature that is only in the c++ standards for legacy c compatibility

1130035
base-class	inherited
this is because of the virtual inherited where the location of the base-class is stored into a lookup table

1130035
instances	private	protected	public
while this is a contrived example an implementation could use a lookup table also to find the public protected and private sections of a class instances

1130048
caliburn	prism
looking at the prism and caliburn frameworks as a wpf newbie what are their relative strengths and weaknesses

1130058

1130061
selected	checkbox
if i selected checkbox in grid automatically selected another

1130062
where-clause	sql
i am just confused with the execution sequences of an sql query .when we use grouping by and having with a where-clause

filtering	grouping
where is first then you grouping the result-of the query and last but not least having-clause is taken to filtering the groupinging result

1130097
feedback	account
constants feedback - provide snapshot feedback which describe current state of the transactional and calculated result-of transactional nb account before after committing a transactional

1130097
feedback	account
.so provide regularly requested prioritised feedback for transactional customer asks what will be the the outstanding balance on my account if i buy this item

1130098
keyboard	mouse
there is however no access at all to a midi device from silverlight either for input or output .so the input would need to come from mouse keyboard and you would need to play and mix the samples yourself

1130117
memcheck	valgrind
cachinggrind is a valgrind tool the framework that powers the always-lovely memcheck which profiling caching and branch hits misses

1130119
base	zero

having having is for filtering as grouping by expression says

1130194
protected	public
has the same access-control public private protected for all

1130207

a constructor is a methods of the object but it s a special methods

1130207
constructor	object
a constructor is called as part of the process of creating the object

1130218
put	get
you would use put if you work through a transactional-log -- you don t just remove some permission you add a transactional removing the permission to your transactional-log which also means each time you do you ll get an unique id representing that action

1130221
hide	show
i can make an explorer bar show hide using iwebbrowser2 showbrowserbar methods

1130221
hide	show
i want to use a single button to toggle between show hide

1130221
hide	show
there is a parameter for showbrowserbar to set for show hide

1130224
constructor	object
a constructor brings an object into a valid usable state and is called only once at the beginning

1130285
constructor	object
a constructor pull the object out of thin air thus must create the invariants

1130285

.when a constructor throw an exception-handling the object is assumed to have never existed

1130288
web-services	api
my conundrum is whether i should be exposing application logic to other sites and applications via a rest api or a set of web-services

1130294
getter	setter
does this mean that an interface shouldn t contains getter and setter

1130294
getter	setter
my opinion maybe not .so for setter but .sometimes i think that getter are valid to be placed in an interface

1130296
exponent	modulo
while i understand how this can be used to send secure data if i m not mistaken this libs cannot be used for the client to receive secure data from the server because the public and private exponent and the modulo are transmitted plain-text from the server

1130302
hide	show
this works but .when you run the report and selected to expand the grouping the little icons use use to show hide on the report is a + symbols instead of a - one

1130303
getter	setter
i don t see why an interface can t defined getter and setter

1130303
getter	setter
edit the comments suggest that getter and setter imply a simple field is used for backing storage

1130303
value	field
to my mind there s an implication that it s reasonably cheap to get set the value but not that it s stored as a field with a trivial implementation

1130303
getter	setter
fortunately that implication doesn t hold getter and setter are perfectly within their rights to compute things

1130305
arrays	map
currently i have a map class that contains an arrays of tile object representing of course each tile in the entire map

1130305
arrays	map
i m attempting to create a methods that will return a smaller arrays most likely example would be to display the currently viewable area of the map

1130310
arrays	loops
one thing i can think of that a compiler probably won t optimize is caching-friendliness if you re iterator over a two-dimensional arrays in row-major order say make sure your inner loops runs across the column index to avoid caching thrashing

1130311
arrays	map
you ll need to use use map on a splice of the arrays and map each row to a splice itself

1130315
alignment	wrap
right now am trying a dropdown box in jquery that will wrap the text if it exceeds the size..but again the problem is it works fine on an independent solution but .when i integrated it with my application it does not read the .css file and it does not do any formatting styles fonts alignment that it is supposed to do according to the .css file.any idea why this is happening

1130333
getter	setter
this touches upon the whole getter setter are evil topic which is addressed multiple time on this site and elsewhere

1130345
conditional	parentheses
as indicated by the error messages a while must be followed by an as the conditional it tests for must be enclosed inside parentheses

for instances pre-increment typically returns a reference to the object itself and post-increment typically returns a temporary copy of the original object prior to the incrementation

1130760
value	field
the compiler might instead read a pointers out of the object add an offset to that value to give the storage location of the field and then dereference

1130760
base-class	inherited
in cases where your compiler just .so happens to store the object in a simple way such as single inherited and normally even non-virtual multiple-inherited and normally field defined right in the class that you re referencing the object by as opposed to in .some base-class then it will just .so happen to work

1130760

1132418
vsts	tfs
i m using vsts tfs

1132439
repository	entity
sometimes there are instances where the repository for a specific entity in question is better off dealing with the general concerns surrounding a specific entity which means it will cross into dealing with other tables as a result without those tables specifically needing to exist as entities

1132439
repository	entity
instead that entity will either be discoverable via its id which will either be a properties of the parent entity or discoverable via the associated repository in relation to the parent entity

1132439
repository	entity
also it keeps the repository model clean without forcing you into messy orm territory which is generally the case if you create child object collections on an entity class

1132461
python	java
i suppose it s also possible that poseidon is focused on java code and that difference in java s specifications for inherited from python might be complicating things.

1132468
arguments	default
it s a default one too no arguments to the constructor and no properties set before it s used

1132496

as it is the datagridview is updates after every edit which if you don t required instant feedback is inefficient and a little visually jarring if you are updating many rows in the datatable one after the other

1132824
communication	messages
recently i got involved with a new product that uses a java frontend it runs on blackberry devices with a .net backend a messages broker that allows the java frontend to communication with our legacy vb6 com code because we didn t want to deal with com on the java side and it s easy to make .net work with our existing vb6 code

1132824
library-project	subproject
i created a new .net solution called companyname.productname.broker and ended up with two subproject a core class library-project that implements the majority of the broker code and a brokerconsole console project that allows the broker to started and stopped from the command-line the broker will be running on a server along with a rabbitmq message-queue server

the background-image will not give the top elements it s size you have to specify the width and height to match the size of the image

1133007
value	field
you re also specifying an extra field called player_id and giving it a value of 2383

1133007
contains	set
it s only logical that both play id will be 2383 because that s the id of the play contains this related set and that player id will also be 2383 because you explicit passed that value in

1133008
panels	grid
but see the below code in which i changed only the stackpanels to a grid any panels which respects the size of its children based on panelss size but stackpanels doesn t

1133009

dictionary	map	put	get
either the person who tried to get the object out of the map using a value identical to the one they put it in with or the person who can t seem to retrieve their object even though the key they re using is literally the same object that was used to put it into the map this is actually why python doesn t allow its mutable built-in data types to be used as dictionary key

1133013
arguments	default
i personally like python current approach default function arguments are evaluated .when the function is defined and that object is always the default

1133031

first project-management context money budget time developpers level expected life time of your project

1133190
32-bit	64bit
one key thing to note is that the time components can differ between 32-bit and 64bit pythons in some python versioning 2.5.x tree i think

1133190
32-bit	64bit
.so you will find things like hour min sec on .some 64bit platform while you get hour minute second on 32-bit

1133192
display	height
directly checked the css display or height seems like a hack but maybe that s what one is expected to do

1133319
return-type	arguments
the get_adapter function allows us to infer the arguments and return-type

1133327
tuples	any
since you aren t joining to any tables this tells me you should always expect one row tuples from your result

1133330
python	java
i m having similar issues coming from python for 10+ years and diving as it were back into java

1133330
python	java
i think one thing i m learning is that the simplicity factors of python is very different from that of java

1133330
python	java
where python abounds with high-level framework-- things like web.py java seems much more low-level

1133330
python	java
over the past few months i ve gone from saying what s the java way to do this easy in python thing to how does one building up this thing in java. subtle but seems to bring my thoughts around from a python-centric view to a more java-centric one

click	mouse
we re trying to see if specific key were pressed or if the mouse wheel rotated or mouse button were click to interrupt rendering

1133513
downgrade	building
since there is no supported downgrade path for mdf files your own sql-server has to match at least the latest express edition pushed through windows-update .so you ll most likely need sql-server 2008 sp1 building 2007.100.2531.0

1133519
authentication	impersonation
set up impersonation to run as the authentication user

1133548

python	php
however i m pretty confident in django...this will finally be the project that makes me leap from my home-grown php framework to a popular python framework

1133556

do you set any defined

1133559
pixels	line
the header contains information like how many bytes there are per pixels total width and height how many bytes per scan line

go to tools - options in the editor tab checked required variable-declaration or put option explicit in the first line of all your scripting

1136411
moss	wss
of course we re after limiting the numbers of licences required for the project and the client doesn t yet have licences for moss .so we couldn t simply use the sitecore sharepoint connector which from everything i read required the moss installation and won t work with bare wss

1136414

1136450
gnome	kde
kde s okular and the gnome evince multi-format readers both use the poppler libs which itself is based on xpdf

you need to read the help files on public private and protected visibility

1136660
slideshow	loading
i am assuming that you have an html page that has a flash elements your slideshow being loading in

1136660
slideshow	loading
or if you have access to the flash slideshow source you could make an external interface call to a javascript function that hide the loading graphic

1136676
any	set
do we need to set any path for my python code and mysql-python to successful run my application

1136677
membership	guid
under the hood there s a provider specific membership identifier which in the case of the sql membership-provider is a guid

1136688
value	field
i had a previous question that touch this topic ruby-on-rails how to get value from another field .when execution an onchange remote function in textfield but then i dugg a little deeper and realized that my problem is the datetime_select methods

value	field
in the onchange i need to get the value of a datetime_select field to pass as a parameter .when making the ajax call to my controllers

1136698
connection-pooling	pool
by default how long must connections be idle before the connection-pooling manager will close the database connection and remove it from the pool

1136717
double-quotes	spaces
if sfilecompletepath contains spaces it could solve it by adding double-quotes around it

1136721

taking what you have made what you could do is that instead of using doincreasesize as a boolean you could instead call that variables action and do

1136752
rad-controls	telerik
i am presently building my first real life application using rad-controls for silverlight from telerik

1136753
continuous-integration	teamcity
you could also look at a continuous-integration solution like cruisecontrol.net or teamcity

1136758
put	get
it can be hard to put yourself in the positioning of someone who really has no idea about what s going on in the background they just want to get their email or whatever it is working

1136776
javascript	dom
basically this isn t a problem with javascript or jquery - the actual issue is with the ie6 dom - .when html elements are added to the page by javascript rather than being in the page .when it loads ie can t garbage collect them unless they are created in a very specific way

1136776
attributes	properties
only use css and html 3.2 attributes - sounds dumb but ie6 creates extra object to store the extra attributes or expando properties and these also leak

1136776
javascript	dom
kinda related to 2 but as gradbot mentions ie6 has problems garbage collecting javascript variables - if they reference a dom elements inside an event fired from that elements you can get problems

1136776
javascript	dom
this is also compounded by javascript references to dom elements that have expando properties

1136777
version-control	git
instead of subversion use a distribute version-control systemd like mercurial or git

1136778
aggregate	grouping
the only value that you can selected without an aggregate is the ones in the grouping by clause

1136782

1136783
dictionary	arrays
i am trying to see whether a date stored in a mutable dictionary in an arrays is between two other dates

1136801
any	set
it really depends on what you want to emphasize any works over a list well sort of while os.path.join works over a set of strings

1136809
reflection	runtime
.something needs to process the annotationss .so it either happens at compile-time with an annotations proces.sor or at runtime with reflection yes i know there are even more exotic ways of doing it at runtime

1136825
arrays	loops
there is a huge difference in performance .when we use foreach loops to enumerate arrays collections for richtextbox

1136826
duplicates	contains	tuples	set	contains	set
if i have a set called seen that contains tuples in the form string1 string2 which i use to checked for duplicates would storing intern string1 intern string2 improve performance w.r.t

1136833
servicecontract	datacontract
the servicecontract and the datacontract must be the same on both ends - that s the basic requirement otherwise pretty much nothing goes at all

1136844
calloc	malloc
malloc or calloc .so the rules are

1136876
version-control	sync
i would recommend using a version-control systemd you should be using that anyway to keep the source in sync

1136882
haskell	lisp
since you re from the big fat c# java class based rigid static object oriented world i would suggest having a look at functional-programming languages like lisp and haskell to have a look at the design-patterns of those if you re looking for something fresh and interesting

1136888
text-editor	editor
since you ll probably not want to change text-editor from whatever you usually use just for editing latex docs unless you use an editor which can t do syntax-highlighting for latex as well as whatever else you code write in it i d recommend the simple following set of tools

1136915
beautifulsoup	html5lib
alternatively if you need to use translation functionality from python you can directly query the translation page and parsing it using xml html libs beautifulsoup html5lib

1136915
beautifulsoup	html5lib
actually i did that once and beautifulsoup did not work on google-translate but html5lib did

1136923
32-bit	64bit
business intelligence development studio the 32-bit development-environment for analysis service integration service and report service project is not designed to run on the itanium 64bit architecture and is not install on itanium servers

contains	set
i have a set of folder in resources which contains the configuration-files i need to save this folder in the user s path. if they don t have for this reason only i added the folder in resources

1136996
reflection	runtime
you need to use reflection even better use mef .so you can stick new modules on runtime or just by dropping a dll

1136999
postorder	preorder
consider the situation where you have two lists of nodes of which all you know is that one is a representation of a preorder traversal of some tree and the other a representation of a postorder traversal of the same tree

1136999
postorder	preorder
note2 using only the preorder or the postorder list would be even better but i do not think it is possible

1136999
children	nodes
note3 a nodes can have any amount of children

1137003
instances	private
about how to get the thread by saving the reference .when and where you create it for instances int the private member _updatethread

1137009
any	set
you should be able to grouping by it as any other column in the result set

1137017
attributes	properties
as you can probably tell i ve throw everything possible i have seen online into the properties attributes in the hope that it will work

1137020

i am using a methods which is called in a for-loop where i am setting the count to the total no.of parameters selected using a listbox but the filtering is done only for the last parameter

1137025
ostream	std
i replace the old buffering of an ostream like std cout with my own class .so that i get access to what ever is written to it

1137025
ostream	std
i al.so create a new std ostream object with the old buffering .so that i can continue to get the output to my con.sole besides sending it to my logger

1137044
data-structures	map
however it will be memory wise and you can map to elements to your data-structures

1137054
postorder	preorder
preorder and postorder do not uniquely defined a tree

1137054
postorder	preorder
the same ambiguity is present for preorder and postorder

1137058
children	nodes	postorder	preorder
edit the order of the children is preserve with this solution simply due to knowing the order of the nodes via the preorder traversal and then knowing the structure via the postorder traversal

1137083
selected	listbox
i have a string item3 and a listbox with item1 item2 item3 item4 how do i selected item3 in the list box .when i have the item named in a string

you can attach the events using the properties grid click the events button selected the event and use the combo box to selected the corresponding event handler

1137148
background-image	background-color
it maintains a background-color and background-image to give it the effect similar to what you d see in a desktop-application

1137149
selected	listbox
checkout my .post on setting selected item in a listbox without looping

1137164
arguments	default
hopefully it s enough to show that not execution the default arguments expression at the execution-time of the def statement isn t easy or doesn t make sense or both

1137205
credentials	security
if they run an application with their security credentials they can do what they wish

1137206
xquery	xslt
in functional languages such as xquery or xslt they cannot be changed once assign

1137211
javascript	dom
problem is that in javascript jquery i can get only innerhtml html dom of this page and it s differs from xhtml dom xml dom that have been parsing

1137211
javascript	dom
how can i get in javascript xml dom of xhtml page not html dom

1137223
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
also .when i install debugging fp for netscape browsers and standards fp for ie on my pc the result is the same - working in firefox opera google-chrome and grey background in ie

1137232
instances	self
using self in a class methods refers to the class and not the instances

1137238
updatepanel	gridview
i need that not to fire if i page a gridview that s in an updatepanel on the same page

1137264
slimdx	xna
i m doing c# interop with direct3d i know about slimdx and xna .so let s not get into the merits of this and i m calling d3dx10createmesh passing it my id3dx10mesh interface

1137273
panels	grid
alternatively you can defined the listbox panels as a grid but i don t recommend that unless your person object have an order properties which can be used easily to bind to grid.row

1137279
required	checked
if the user is supposed to enter data that will later be checked for validity you should not accept any of the data until the user completes the required field

1137331
value	field
a foreign key field can only store null or a value defined by the primary key field

1137331
key-value	key
if you try to change the foreign key-value to something not defined by a primary key you will get an error

1137334
pixels	line
at the end of my uitableviewcell i have a line of pixels that i cannot remove

1137334
selected	cell
the line will change color as the cell is selected

1137341
memmove	memcpy
i hoped and i vaguely remember seeing .so using memcpy would do this using compiler built-in intrinsics but based on disassembly and debugging it seems compiler is using call to memcpy memmove libs implementation instead

1137358
put	get
if i try to put the above line of code here i get the the data necessary to complete this operation is not yet available

1137360
triggers	insert
user can triggers insert mode for editing purposes

1137386
bazaar	git
if i were starting fresh i would look at one of the newer generator of distribute versioning tools like mercurial git or bazaar

1137403
shell	bash
i have written a bash shell scripting that reads a directory and parsing all the xml files in it in a for-loop

1137408
hash	md5
in lighting of the fact that googling membership-provider hashing algorithm turns up this answer as the first result and the gospel that will be inferred it behoves me to warn folks about using the membership-provider like this and using hash like sha-1 md5 etc to obfuscation passwd in databases

1137408
pbkdf2	scrypt
use a key-derivation function like bcrypt scrypt or if you need fips compliance pbkdf2 with a work factors sufficient to necessitate the hashing time for a single passwd to be as close to 1000ms or more

1137424
any	set	zero	nan
iam using an dijit.form.numbertextbox if no value is inside it returns nan is there any way to set it to zero

1137426
environment	building
this was in a team foundation server team building continuous-integration environment

1137439
contains	elements
real problem the search spaces should contains all permutation of two elements n time el1 and m time el2 where k m+n with these restrictions

1137439
python	ruby	scheme	lisp
i would prefer an explanation but code is also fine i can read c-like languages javascript python ruby lisp scheme

1137439
duplicates	elements
subtract this gain from the length of the permutation and you get the index at which you can start insert new elements without making duplicates

1137442
bluetooth	usb
however for the robot i purchased a separate bluetooth device a usb dongle

1137442
bluetooth	usb
i just need to send one simple string from my laptop to the usb bluetooth device that will be attached to the robot

after selected the date the value will be insert into the current cell

1137473
virtualization	vmware
...in other news vmware is a good virtualization product cough

1137476
ubuntu	linux
i know you said you were uncomfortable in ubuntu but if you re moving over to linux then you re going to be uncomfortable for a while

1137483
g++	gcc
interestingly enough this small demonstration program links just fine if i compile it with gcc but i get the same linker errors .when i try to compile with g++

1137483
g++	gcc
i was hoping .someone could help me figure out exactly what g++ and gcc are doing differently .so as to get the original program to link the original program is a c++ program and i can t just use gcc

1137490
getter	setter
you ll have to call the getter inside of the setter or use a wait notify to have the other thread wait until the one thread has both set and gotten the value

1137497
value	field
then you ll have to set the value of the field in the current list item as well as updating all other affected items

1137516
stax	sax
given your situation i would recommend using stax rather than sax

1137516
stax	sax
stax is a pull-model parsing api but has many of the same advantages of the sax approach memory usage and performance

1137527
oracle	mysql
be it mysql oracle mssql etc

1137532
selected	cell
yeah as ryan says it looks like you haven t quite set the correct size for the width of the selected cell row image

1137534
any	set
defined a range types then create a set of ranges and an extension methods to see whether a value lies in any of the ranges

1137537
callback	methods
as for stopping the above methods from user-mode it gets a bit trickier since you can t just register yourself as a callback to process creation or dll loading

1137560
swing	awt
and since swing awt apps don t have javascript selenium won t work on them either

1137583
specifications	w3c
it is well-represented by vendors and users of xslt product as well as by the members of the w3c committees responsible for the specifications

1137589
put	get
now that people have verified this could be useful where would i put a block of code such as this .so that it will get execute once and only once to create these tests

1137595
local-variables	class-members
a inline functuion behaves syntactically just like a normals function providing type-safety and a scoping for function local-variables and access to class-members if it is a methods

1137596
linux	osx
now i want to do the same for linux and mac osx but i don t know how to find the right function named

1137597
contains	any
the ab.solute divs are taken out of the flow of the document .so the contains div does not have any content except for the padding

1137598
testcomplete	qtp
popular not necessilary best are qtp silktest testcomplete

1137608
abstract-class	subclassing
recently i created an abstract-class let s called it a which defined the common behavior of its subclassing

1137608
subclassing	superclass
one methods i tried was by reconstructing an instances of the subclassing types from the parameters of the superclass .so that i would be handling the object with it s actual types thus avoiding typescasting

1137635
contains	any
i can t inherited from any of the things that i can apply to text as everything i need is either sealed or contains internal abstracts .so i m at a bit of a loss

1137652
updating	updates
unless you re updating existing rows then change insert-into to updates

1137655
value	field
how to insert a null or empty value in a mysql date types field null yes

1137663
return-type	arguments
you give up a lot of the ability for the compiler to perform checked on typechecked on the arguments and return-type

1137663
expression	evaluation
evaluation of the arguments is much different if the expression you pass into the functions have side-effects you ll have a very fun time debugging

1137665
zend-debugger	xdebug
i couldn t get xdebug to work properly with eclipse but zend-debugger and server combinations worked like a charm

1137677
implements	abstract
an abstract function must be implements by all concrete classes

1137677
implements	abstract
sometimes you want to force all derivative classes to implements the abstract function even derivative of concrete classes

1137690
contains	set
given a set of n-dimensional int pointss how do i find the smallest set of n-dimensional cuboids rectangles in the 2-d case such that an int points is in the set of int pointss if and only if it s contains in one or more of the cuboids rectangles

1137696
margins	padding
size the main div to be big enough to contains all the 15 tile divs and make all the tile divs the same width 1 3 the width of the parent div if there s no margins or padding

1137704
required	checked
edit i just checked this ctags.exe command-line inside the zeus editor and it seems to do what you required

1137708
base-class	inherited
i m not understanding why you are having them inherited from the base-class if you need to be checked the types

1137708
implements	abstract
abstract-class interface a defined a series of functions that b c and d should implements and then the function that takes an instances of a should only ever call those abstract functions

1137719
subclassing	accessor
try subclassing and overrides the +fadeduration accessor on the layer

1137732
qtablewidget	qtableview
the problem with the qtableview is that it seems to have no methods that returns the currently selected recording in the table .so i took the qtablewidget class which interhits qtableview

1137732
qabstractitemmodel	qtablewidget
error virtual void qtablewidget setmodel qabstractitemmodel is

1137736
primitive	int
int and all the other primitive wrapper

1137748
json	xml
one for request handling - one for header deserialization if i get input in different formats like subtmitted html forms xml-rpcs json etc. - one for controllers dispatching doing whatever i want to do with these data - and one for serializing the output in the desired format json xml html etc. and move every request through these levels until it is completed

1137754
virtual-machine	virtualbox
specifically should i be installing something like svn on the virtualbox or should i set it up on the physical mac and move all code from the virtual-machine to the mac every time i want to checked in code

1137770
reflection	runtime
you can checked this at runtime using reflection and throw an exception-handling to disrupt execution wrecking havoc for impolite users of your libs

1137788
browser-cache	caching
it s very possible that css is being caching in your browser .so simply clearch browser-cache it should help

1137805
parentheses	operators
the only operators with lower precedence are the logical-operators and or and not which may be used to evaluate call to list operators without the need for extra parentheses

1137805
parentheses	operators
if any list operators printing etc. or any unary operators chdir etc. is followed by a left parentheses as the next token the operators and arguments within parentheses are taken to be of highest precedence just like a normals function-call

1137812
httpwebrequest	webclient
.net has httpwebrequest and webclient for simulating a browser s request

1137836
any	set
my underlying question is whether it makes sense to set the max concurrent operations to a value larger than 1 and whether there is any danger in doing .so if the application may al.so be writing to addressbook at the same time on another thread

1137846
qtablewidgetitem	qtablewidget
the items in a qtablewidget are provided by qtablewidgetitem

1137868
value	field	numeric	zero
this field should be 11 numeric characters zero padded on the left hand side and will always hold the value in lowest common denominator in this case cents

1137871

i would be using the libs for digital-signature signing and verification and potentially for key creation although i won t cry if i have to make a call to something else for that functionality

1137879
arrays	loops
this will recursively compare the two arrays while having the advantage of not being needlessly circuitous and not requiring a loops

1137883
for-loop	arrays
iterate using a for-loop like you have over each elements checked the matching elements in the other arrays

1137944
user-permissions	account
since there are no real restrictions on the user account that can read and write from there you don t have to worry about user-permissions

1137945
debian	linux
i use os x and had problems .when connecting to a linux debian lenny

1137977
web-applications	security
i feel that this is a sufficient solution that works fine but i must admit that i m not enough of a security expert to identify potential holes in this scheme - all i know is that hundreds of non-restful web-applications use essentially the same login protocols _session inphp httpsession in j2ee etc

1137983
callback	methods
then the correct callback methods will be called

1137983
callback	methods
assuming the this instances implements myvisitor this will result in a callback on the visit b methods

1138087
autoscroll	panels
i have lots of radio-button in a panels with autoscroll set to true

1138099
derived-class	base-class
i bet you ve just created the c# properties wrong and if you removed the base-class and just sent the derived-class you d get nothing sent

1138110
implements	abstract
i would guess you don t really need all derived classes to implements the abstract methods but it definitely sounds like you have a bit of a code-smell in your design

1138126
unmanaged	c++-cli
.when we come to unit test the unmanaged classes in there from another c++-cli assembly we see the following exception-handling everytime we try to create an instances via new of an unmanaged class

1138127
compatibility	legacy
it s still in the language strictly for backward compatibility with very old legacy code

1138162
subclassing	superclass
due to olymorphism your subclassing can be initializer but referenced as the superclass

1138172
any	set
do not rely on any particular date-format being set

1138186
account	api
as of now there is no api for this but you can log into your authorize.net account and perform a re-bill

1138187
notepad++	textmate
i have the same situation although i develop both on osx using aptana and or textmate and windows parallels using notepad++ and or visual-studio depending on what i m doing

1138187
subclipse	aptana
i ve used both subclipse and subversive for svn support in aptana and both work pretty well i think i m currently using subclipse

alternatively and what i would reccomend is that if each containsers will always contains a single datagridview just add a datagridview to the user-controls at design-time the user-controls designer not the form containss the control

1138217
decimal-point	zero
now i have written some code that tostring s the decimal - removing all trailing zero and then analyzes the string looking for a decimal-point and count the numbers of decimal places to see how many trailing zero need to be added back on

1138232
loading	gif
the pdf s can be a little slow to load .so i d like to hide the object and display a loading messages gif until it s fully loaded .so the user isn t looking at a blank screens

the advantage of precompiled-headers is that the huge systemd libs header-files and other files that do not change at all or infrequently only have to be parsing once per building

1138348
mouseover	mouseout
your problem is that you re using mouseover and mouseout functions

1138354
button	popup
.when this happens the cpu windows popup and i have to hit the ok button on the error messages

1138361
g++	gcc
based on the question use libs compiled with visual-studio in an application compiled by g++ mingw and the msdn forum .post i can t mix vc gcc it does not appear you can link a gcc application with visual-c++ compiled libs

1138376
dictionary	arrays
if you have a setter for an immutable types string set arrays dictionary you need to use copy semantics

1138380
touch	drag
essentially the idea is that you overrides the uiresponder touch methods to analyze what kind of touch the device received and then either move the object to follow the user s finger or give it a speed in a directions depending on whether it was a slow drag or a swipe

1138390
maven-javadoc-plugin	javadoc
i m execution javadoc as part of a maven building .so the maven-javadoc-plugin is performing the actual javadoc cmd

1138402
profiling	debugging
.when dealing with debugging queries using profiling and ssms its pretty common for me to copy a query from profiling and test them in ssms

1138409
gzip	zip
if you are talking about actually compression the text not just shortening then deflate gzip wrapper around gzip zip work well for smaller files and text

1138417
arrays	loops
the proper way to iterate on the elements of an arrays object assuming you don t really need the index for something else such as replacing object in a mutable arrays is to loops on it directly this is called â œfast enumerationâ

1138445
selected	cell
i am using ultragrid from infragistics and facing a problem .when selected a cell value

1138445
selected	cell
whenever i selected a cell value it show as 0.000 as default

1138457
carbon	cocoa
for the os x versioning apple is throw away 64bit carbon .so can i mix carbon and cocoa classes in this libs

1138474
implements	extends
you need to extends smtpchannel -- that s where the smtp_ verb methods are implements

1138484
python	lua	python	c++	python	ruby	c++	lua
for adding a command-line-interface to an existing c++ application the closest modern tool is lua but even more powerful languages like ruby and python are not much harder to integrated with c++ applications especially with tools like boost-python and swig

1138489
any	set
.when it is compiled it s meta-information does not describe it as having any specific expectable result set output

1138500

copy-constructor	constructor	move-constructor	auto-ptr
looking at kenny kerr s auto-ptr it transfer ownership in its constructor -- essentially a move-constructor rather than a copy-constructor

1138544
input-field	selected
you could just named the input-field the same for all entries make the selected an input combo and give that a consistent named .so revising your code

1138544
contact	submit
.when you submit you get two arrays named venue_contactlink_contactdatas_type and venue_contactlink_contactdatas_data with matching indic for the contact pairs

1138564
carbon	cocoa
although on os x they both are compiled by gcc thus making it possible the carbon and cocoa libs are not really meant to be mixed

1138564
carbon	cocoa
both carbon and cocoa are full and separate windows libs

1138564
carbon	cocoa
however in os x 10.2 it is possible to mix them at the windows level a carbon .app can hosts a cocoa windows and anything later than 10.2 is supposed to be able to mix the libs down to the widget level

1138568
carbon	cocoa
apple published a good guide about mixing carbon and cocoa

1138575
required	checked
say for example the query is against a required systemd table of the database that is missing or the transactional is rollback in the middle of checked

1138605
touch	drag
though some of the answers i received were a little off the mark the best advice was 1- study apple s moveme example for how to touch an object and drag it around

1138611
arguments	default
i believe variables having default value are to be placed at the end of the arguments list

1138614

my application must run on 32-bit and 64bit versioning of mswindows

1138630
jndi	jdbc
it looks like you re delegation hasresourcepermission to jdbc while leaving both findsecurityconstraints and hasuserdatapermission in hands of jndi

1138635
selected	textbox
the date-display in the textbox is localized via cultureinfo and of course should be recognized by jquery to selected the correct date in the datepicker

1138654
silverlight	wpf
i was just going through some of the charting code in the silverlight and wpf toolkits and noticed that they also solved this problem in a kind of similar way .

1138668
attributes	properties
since i have control over both the xml elements correspond exactly to the object and the attributes to the properties of the object

1138674
selected	textbox
i think the textbox would be much more useful though .when upon selected we can extraction the staffid ie

1138685
textarea	textbox	contains	any	tablecell	cell
i have a row object which containss any numbers of tablecell and i m looking only for the cell that contains a textbox or textarea

1138698

you can put the original expression in the else part of the ternary operation but if you want to guarantee single evaluation of the expression then you ll have to use a temporary variables and an if-statement

1138761
boolean	int
unfortunately the valid column types are int float datetime date timestamp time text string binary and boolean

1138800

1138823
protected	public
here the protected clone methods in object is being overrides as a public methods.

1138847

web-applications	security	web-applications	scalability
cover issues that commonly affect the success failure of web-applications performance scalability security data-integrity server maintainence

1138856
compression	streaming
this algorithm doesn t give a brilliant compression ratio but it is incredibly frugal with memory and cpu resources and can also work on a continuous streaming of data - the decompressor maintains its own copy of the lookup table as it decompression thus the lookup table adjusts to the types of data being compressed

1138882
versioning	upgrade
one way would be to fetch the jad file using an http connection in your .app parsing for the versioning available on the server and only launchd the browser if there is a newer versioning available or after additionally asking the user if the upgrade is desired

1138902
hide	show
i m trying to create boxes of text that hide or show .when user click on a expand button

1138957
firefox	safari
i m testing this on safari and firefox with the exact same behavior

1138960
git-filter-branch	repo
i ve just had my first experience with rewriting the history of one of my repo using git-filter-branch

1138973
contains	elements
if you can t easily get the classes on the spans you can probably construct a similar selectedor using something like #spancontainer span to selected them by tag named descending from their contains elements

1138984
any	set
set up a polling routine against that folder to see if there are any new files

1138985

1139043
environment	building
i m being abstract since i don t know your building environment

1139058
firefox	safari
it s still a good idea to add in a few css3 properties in a progressive-enhancement approach using it to give an extra few touches to beautify a site s design to those with browsers supporting some css3 properties firefox and safari have about 25-30 market shared

1139061
contains	elements	hide	show
i took a slightly different route in that i chose to wrap all of the elementss of a given hide show elements in a contains div

1139061
hide	show
it allows you to have multiple triggers for one section if you need it and you can add an arbitrary numbers of hide show elements without worrying about numbersing them

1139061
hide	show
it has a few limitations such as the necessity that the hide show body is a direct descendant of the wrapper

1139061
hide	show
it s al.so nest-able .so you can have multiple levels if hide show

1139065
put	get
i think it d be neat to get a bunch of these and put erlang code on them

1139075
push	pull
you could approach this a numbers of ways but my only comment would be push don t pull

1139077
show	next
i d also like to show the previous next value if any of each properties if i could do that without getting too cluttered or distracting

1139083
using-declaration	typedef
typedef named and using-declaration used to specify the types do not contribute to this set

1139124

1139266
integration-testing	system-testing
for system-testing integration-testing that is testing things while they re working together i can recommend fitnesse

1139274

if you re querying a lot for some fixed set of strings occuring in the middle of some column add another column that contains the information whether a particular string can be found in the other column

1139307
queue	fifo
i could of course implements something that keeps a queue in shm with a known key or through a fifo but that s error prone.

1139329
contains	any
in that way any methods that you use in the rest of your code can get access to that same instances of the streamwriter by accessing it from the contains class without needing to create an instances of the class because it s static

1139354
javascript	dom
that doesn t seem to work well with the javascript dom

1139366
constructor	private
this is mainly due to using the primary constructor that allows you to use it s parameters as private properties in your methods not sure if i worded that correctly

1139368
hide	show
do you have some global pool of messagess that you want each user to see that you show on each page but not show again if he hide the messages

global-assembly-cache	gac
the application required that assembly myproject versioning 1.0.0.0 be install in the global-assembly-cache gac first.

1139453
protected	public
assuming that the state of the object cannot be accessed directly no public or package protected field and is not fiddled with by reflection you can put a breakpoints at the start of all of the object s methods and run through the scenario that makes the object dirty in the debugger

1139464
hide	show
obviously the user-interface view and controllers need to be able to access permissions to show hide components and to handle the permission-denied scenario

if you re not opposed to full frameworks i symfony cakephp and codeigniter all have some sort of activerecord implementation

1139522
required	checked
you can set this for all future created modules and vba code-behind forms and report by going into the vba editor tools options editor tab and ensuring required variable-declaration is checked

1139524
worker	fibers
threads or fibers see sys.dm_os_workers and a free worker will pick up next task from the scheduling s queue and run away with it execution it until the task is finished ie

1139552
put	get
for example i would like to be able to associate get with index and put with updates

in 2 years you will be gone and there will be a programmer that will waste a lot of time trying to updates your legacy code .when updating a configuration file would have been way easier

1139642
webserver	security	credentials	security
the user would authentication to the webserver but since the sql-server was on a different machine the credentials sent to it would be the webserver credentials and not the user there fore makeing any call to the sql-server fail because of security rights

1139642
webserver	security
some settings would need to be adjusted in active-directory to allow the webserver to be authentication for delegation and kerberos security will need to be set on your network as well

1139666
versioning	upgrade
during the process netbeans informed me something about an old client versioning of subversioning and now i want to upgrade it

1139706
json	xml

i d like to suggest a variant of the original question what does ruby have that python doesn t and vice versa

1139857
python	ruby
which admits the disappointing answer well what can you do with either ruby or python that can t be done in intercal

1139857
python	ruby
nothing on that level because python and ruby are both part of the vast royal family sitting on the throne of being turing approximant

put	get
you can put an object into a hashtable mutate it and be unable to get it out again

1140061
value	field
both the grid and the detail form were editable and as you changed a field in one the other would reflect the new value

1140062
background-position	background-image
if you give the submit class the background-image properties you can set the background-position properties independently for each individual button and avoid having to repeat yourself several time

1140083
value	field
second a way with in my opinion good balance between effort and effect would be to add an extra column then .when ever you change the value concatenation all the value add a secreat passwd to it better term would be salt run it through a cryptography hash algorithm and put the result in the extra field

1140096
open-session-in-view	interceptor
-you can use the open-session-in-view pattern where you use a filtering interceptor aop - styles logic to open a session .when server side logic begins and close it .when it s through

1140121
selected	cell
i need to selected one row multiple rows or a cell in ultragrid to copy from the grid

1140127
revision	svn
internally the systemd would take whatever was in trunk for the given package from svn i m sure you could adapt this really easily for git too generator a new unique tag with the log entry deploying revision 1.2

1140135
subclassing	base-class
then again that may be the way you want it. but if you have two different views that are .so similar in design except for a few specific aspects it .sounds like they should shared a common base-class and implements their difference in subclassing

1140172
transactional	audit-trail
you can implements a design that runs all database activity through a transactional table that serves as an audit-trail for the database

1140172
identity-column	unique-key
it should include a timestamp column a userid and some kind of context indicator what form was used to generator the transaction. and include an identity-column unique-key to expose out-of-sequence timestamps

1140172
transactional	audit-trail
sure a dba could run transactional through the audit-trail but at least you could verify by interview that the change sources really were what the audit indicates

1140173
icollection	ienumerable
i would suspect that your uniqueurls-collection is an ienumerable rather than an icollection or derivative and it doesn t have the count-property

1140178

i am trying to write a file to a sub folder of the directory my crontab scripting is in using file_ put_ contents

1140489
json	xml
.when you do your .post cmd you ll get json a separate methods with the xml format would give you xml

1140533
constructor	object
if these variables are intended to populate a form then you can safely pass the request.post object directly into the form constructor

1140533
value	field
the form will automatically pass the correct value to the correct form field and use default for key that don t exist and will still create blank field-for missing key see addendum

1140542
version-control	cvs
you can do this from the cvs command-line or selected then team add file to version-control

1140621
display	width
width enough to display 25 chars

1140625
javascript	dom
it s possible you could modify the dom after the showfeeddialog prompt has been created but you d have to create your own javascript to do that and it might not be possible within the confines of fbjavascript

1140629
callback	methods
if i simply mark my callback methods as synchronized should that be enough to ensure that each callback thread will run to completion in the order that the systemd received their data

1140637
mouseleave	mouseenter
in the following example i am animation the opacity properties to 0.0 .when the mouseenter and back to 1.0 .when the mouseleave

1140648
google-chrome	firefox
i copy-paste the following code that works in firefox 3.0 and ie7 but not google-chrome

1140658
google-chrome	firefox
all right this was actually google-chrome caching more aggressively than firefox and ie

1140688
javascript	dom
you find the elements through the document object-model dom which is just an abstraction of a document s markup into object for something like jscript sometimes called javascript

1140689
environment	building
this way we could have database connection strings for the dev test prod database preconfigured and not have to checkout in the properties file each time we wanted to building for a different environment

1140693
cvs	git
i m starting in c++ development but i like to use gedit for writing the files but like for ruby-on-rails and many other languages are some tools and configuration for gedit that makes develop more easy and comfortable and another question what is the best for c++ svn cvs git and others..

1140701
cryptography	security
heed the warnings that implements your own cryptography streaming cypher will probably leave yourself with security holes

1140704
any	set
you should set the appropriate http caching headers for that generator xml file .so any client request past that time will get the new versioning and caching it locally like any other static-content

1140705
profiling	trace
i ve managed to solve this by running all the pngs through pngcrush and remove all trace of color profiling and such

1140708
contains	elements
your xml fragment contains multiple top level elements which is not permitted by the xml standards

1140711
required	checked
sidenote one helpers data that subversioning stores on client are the pristine versioning of files which means that checked for changes you did doesn t required to connect to server which is slow .

1140711
version-control	git
git is distribute version-control systemd

1140711
push	pull
branches and tags with git ls-remote and git updates show you can pull get or push publishing data with git fetch or git-remote updates git push and if server is configure to allow it you can get snapshot of state of remote repository with git-archive --remote

1140711
git-remote	git-merge
you can then use git fetch or git-remote updates examine newly brought commit with git log and gitk not being limited to fixed output and then if everything is all right merge changes with git-merge

1140711
version-control	git
this is not specific to git but to all distribute version-control systemd although the way scm presents fetched but unmerged data might differ git uses remote-tracking branches in remote remotename namespace mercurial from what i understand uses unnamed heads

1140714
solaris	linux
i m a c++ developer who has primarily programmed on solaris and linux until recently .when i was forced to create an application targeted to windows

1140714
istream	ostream
i would be fine if the istream and ostream components were locked separately but that is not the case

1140717
version-control	git
regarding the choice of version-control i d go with svn or git

1140732
version-control	git
as for version-control - i would recommend git it is faster and has more features

1140733
kdevelop	cdt
ide - kdevelop eclipse + cdt - plugins for c++ code blocks

1140733
cvs	git
as for source control the choice is between svn this is right successor of cvs and git

1140741
value	field
you ll need to add a gettext-ed value for the labels of the field you overrides

1140748
lookup	any
you can lookup what attributes are on any textbox that ever was is or will be created right now for a particular versioning of the framework

1140788
istream	ostream
i.e. have a separate istream and ostream which you yourself lock .when they are invoked

1140794
firefox	safari
strange enough it rendering in ie6 ie8 safari and firefox but not ie7

1140826
delphi	c++	pascal	delphi
if anyone has such a algorithm in delphi pascal or c++ c# that would be greatly appreciated

1140828
firefox	safari
how does browser firefox safari detection that website you are visiting is infected

1140855

you say that you edited configuration environment test.rb

1140855
environment	execution
are you sure that your cucumber features are actually execution in the test environment

1140855
configuration	environment
.so if your project is similar then you will need to customize configuration environment cucumber.rb as well

1140888
any	set
after you set the variables .when you load the cell you are free to do what you please with the tableview or any other higher view without much hassle or overhead

1140909
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu intrepid ibex and using as compiler the gcc but .when i try to compile a c++ project file the compiler give me this error

1140915
wait	hang	breakpoints	hang
if i instead let it hang at the breakpoints for a few seconds the init methods is being called several time seems like it depends on how long time i wait before stepping over the breakpoints

1140915
breakpoints	hang
but it also seems that if i then jump back to the first page or another one only one httpapplication will start to take care of the request and everything is as expected - as long as i dont let it hang at a breakpoints

1140915
breakpoints	hang
if i let it hang at a breakpoints it begins to create new httpapplication s object and starts adding httpapplications more than 1 to serve handle the request which is already in process of being served by the httpapplication which is currently stopped at the breakpoints

1140916
g++	gcc
and compile c++ code with g++ cmd not gcc

1140923
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1140923
postgresql	mysql
i believe postgresql can use row level locking out of the box where mysql will depend on the storage engine you choose

1140923
innodb	myisam
myisam only locks at the table level and thus concurrency suffers but storage engines such as innodb for mysql can and will use row-level locking to increase throughput

1140923
innodb	myisam
my suggestion would be to start with myisam and move to innodb only if you find you need row level locking

1140933
parsing	comma
and a comma delimited file is significantly less complex to parsing

1140939
csv	xml
it can be serialization as an xml document pretty easily but csv cannot handle such a thing

1140952
xsd	xml	xmldom	xpath
xml also has complimentary technologies surrounding it xmldom xpath xslt xsd xml schema

1140953
csv	xml
a numbers of advantages xml has over csv

1140955
json	xml
these aren t the only two options you can also use json or yaml which are much lighter weight than xml

bonus points if there s a way to hide the spaces from the show whitespace characters

1140980
python	perl
eg python perl s split

1140995
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu intrepid ibex and compiling c++ files with gcc but .when i compile gcc makes a .out file that is the executable but how i can make linux executable

1141005
csv	xml
in general however there are cases of data representation you can solve with xml but you cannot solve with csv for example a tree

1141005
csv	xml
on the other hand any data that can be represented in csv can also be represented in xml although it s not guaranteed and indeed is also verified that it will be more efficient in terms of spaces ease of parsing etc

1141014
onmouseover	mouseover
fixing the problem is simple before you assign onmouseover store the lot_id in another local variables say lotidformouseover and pass that to the mouseover function

1141024
buffering	streaming
i left my hosts transfermode set to streaming and my client was set to buffering

1141025
selected	cell
the best advice i can give you is if you open up the ultrawingrid designer from the grid s smart tag then selected the feature picker and expand the selectedion nodes you should be able to configure the cell row column selectedion the way that you want

1141049
expression	brackets
the expression however are easier to read without the brackets

1141060
shell	bash
you need to set the environment variables term like .so assuming bash shell

1141062
csv	xml
among the reasons you may prefer xml over csv depends on the task at hand of course

1141062
csv	xml
xml supports a variety of data shapes like hierarchical where as csv is most useful .when the data looks like a table rows and columns

1141063
export	csv
i would like to create a sql query that will export a csv flat-file with order and orderdetail rows interspersed

1141100
export	csv
they don t have to be of the same data types since you re export to csv but they do have to be the same numbers

1141102
variables	boolean
function msghook variables messages tmessages boolean

1141105
ruby	php	python	php	python	tcl	python	ruby
or python ruby php tcl or even javascript

1141105
shell	bash
i still use bash to write shell scriptinging â but if the shell scripting has an if conditional other than a simple arguments checked i use a higher language â usually perl

1141106

1141106
contains	elements
assert there is an age elements contains a text nodes with value 20

1141106
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can do things like add test case with insignificant whitespace or single-quotes instead of double-quotes to be more thorough

1141126
click	mouse
almost anything can cause one of these to popup display an overlay on the map or a mouse click event for example

1141133

i ve tried compiling in firefox 3.5 ie8 google-chrome but all receive the same error

1141134
shutdown	restart
messages then close the file being used and the windows.however i cannot handle the case-.when user restart shutdown logoff .when my windows is still open.i cannot overrides wndproc since i am developing using wpf.i have also tried using this sample msdn code .this is what i did

1141141
basichttpbinding	duplex
i can t try the basichttpbinding or the wshttpbinding as this is a duplex service

1141147
ncover	nant
we use nant to building our project wix for the install and nunit and ncover for the unit tests and coverage report

1141163
firefox	safari
what is confusing me though is the fact that my application works beautifally in safari and firefox yet refuses to work at all in ie8

1141182
sql-server	ms-access
this would allow you to use sql-server instead of a single ms-access file

1141183
twisted	pyro
pyro might be easier to learn and use but twisted will scale better if you ever want to move into a very large numbers of player

1141183
twisted	pyro
my personal recommendation would be to use pyro if you re just wanting to play around with networking but go with twisted if you have grand plans for lots of player on the internet

1141197
direct3d	directx
direct3d hasn t used a types libs or cocreateinstance for any of its object since directx 8.0 almost ten years ago now

1141213
actionscript	haxe
it s small simple and written in haxe which for one is similar to actionscript and above that is a very cool language you should look into .

1141228
documentation-generation	javadoc
are there similar documentation-generation systemd like javadoc for c++

1141239
python	java
use one words or abbreviations for languages java c# vb.net python

1141258
nsmutablearray	nsarray
listofobjects would then be treated as an nsarray immutable although it actually would be an nsmutablearray

1141263
object-reference	instances
in oo each object-reference is unique and that s what you use to identify instances

1141271
for-loop	arrays
can i have an arrays of pointers to data void data where data 0 char var1 data 1 int var2 and data 2 char var3 .so that i could then use a single call to scanf in a for-loop to populate these variables

1141275
put	get
i think the engines that put together the visual representation and manipulate the dom need to get a lot better um ie i m looking in your general direction...

1141275
google-chrome	firefox
but i do think that speed is going to get better on firefox and google-chrome to such an extent that people really are going to start using it for mainstream application development

1141291
firefox	safari
i d be surprised if other good javascript engines like those in the very latest firefox and safari didn t do the same

1141305
setinterval	settimeout
you can use the settimeout or setinterval functions

1141323
uilabel	uiview
i have a line of uilabel text in a uiview which is regularly updates via nstimer

1141324
logging	trace
3 turn on service logging with activitytracing enabled and use the service trace viewer from windows sdk to analyze the log and see if anything popup

1141334
instances	self
from the addmusic example where self is the controllers or model contains the instances of mpmusicplayercontrollers

1141348
any	set
by the time you ve set up the arrays have you really saved any code

1141349
glut	sdl	compatibility	platform
if you still long for cross platform compatibility then your best bet is likely sdl which is very much like glut in that it is a fairly thin layer over the underlying abstractions but it provides a slightly richer event systemd and more opportunities for integration with hardware such as sound and joysticks

1141349
compatibility	platform
the nice thing about it is that it s almost certain to be present on even strangely configure hosts whereas any other solution will required either platform specific code or the presence of some cross platform compatibility layer

1141349
keyboard	mouse
if i wanted to keep things simple for a program that only needed to display 3-d graphics and interact only by mouse and keyboard then i d probably be totally happy with glut

1146921
callback	methods
after the ondomready event fires in your browser .when loading a page wicket will cause it s javascript enging to callback into your code using ajax to the respond methods show above at which points you can execute java code on the server and potentially add components to the ajax target to be rendering

1146929

multiplying	modulo
many hash-function combine the various elements in the data by multiplying them with some factors modulo the power of two corresponding to the words size of the machine that modulo is free by just letting the calculation overflow

1146940
factors	primes
if you choose a primes for the size of the table such a common factors is highly unlikely

1146940
factors	primes
on the other hand those factors are usually made up from odd primes .so you should al.so be safe using powers of two for your hashtable eclipse uses 31 .when it generator the java hashcode methods

1146948
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
you can get the new_index by itemscontainergenerator.indexfromcontainer source provided the source is the contentcontrol for the itemscontrol

version-control	git
yes - gitignore systemd only ignore files not currently under version-control from git

1146999
gitignore	git-add
if you ve already added a file called test.txt using git-add then adding test.txt to gitignore will still cause changes to test.txt to be tracked

callback	methods
you can even choose not to use your authentication callback for some methods

1147022
credentials	security
in your case i d suggest messages security with user named credentials - you need to configure this on both ends

1147043
forms-authentication	credentials
if your website already implements forms-authentication then you can bypass setting credentials yourself and use the forms-authentication cookies

the login credentials for an account that has permission to create

1147125
dictionary	arrays
dynamically creating input field in a form panels in gwt is pretty easy and fast and you can very simply and quickly downloading a json structure with the data you need for the input-field in your original html page load convert it to a dictionary or simple arrays in gwt and use it to populate your form

1147125
dictionary	map
if it makes sense you can format the json data as a dictionary and gwt s dictionary class will map directly to it

1147125
javascript	dom
i use these techniques all the time and they are robust and pretty much as fast as javascript can populate the dom

apart from erlang most languages followed imperative design-by-contract paradigms ada eiffel c++

1147250
delphi	c++
i you really want to protect your code you should write native-code using a native-code compiler c++ delphi

1147250
disassembly	native-code
this still does not guarantee that your code is 100 safe because any experience developer can read assembler and essentially disassembly the native-code program

1147254
any	set
however this means that any tempdata we set in the controllers methods isn t available

1147254
jquery	.post
.so my question was using jquery user-interface dialog what would people suggest as a way to submission data to the controllers without using jquery .post or ajax call

extends	super
the most counterintuitive concept i came across is the pecs producer extends consumer super from josh bloch

1147287
implements	extends
lots of portal servers support it and it s more portable across vendors because it s not as complex and it s not a specifications for vendors to implements and extends

1147306

1147641
python	ruby
ruby has method_missing python has getattr

1147642
mouseover	mouseout
i think you need to separate the handling of mouseover and mouseout events

1147642
mouseover	mouseout
presumably you want the mouseover handler to be attached to the top level menu elements and the mouseout handler to be attached to the hidden dropdown div with some state code to manage conflicts

1147653
click	mouse
what i basically want to do is that .when the left mouse button is held it click and click again until you let it go

foundation	cocoa
this is similar to the memory-management in cocoa and once the retain count of the core foundation object reaches zero it will be deallocated

1147748
compatibility	platform
it s certainly handy to have a mac around if nothing else to checked for safari compatibility but most of the better tools i ve encountered are pretty much platform independent outside of the .net world anyway and even they have mono

1147758
flickr	vimeo
oembed is also supported by many other website flickr viddler qik hulu vimeo etc

1147772
ubuntu	debian	macports	fink
on a mac you can do that too but macports and fink just don t are the same quality and .so updates as debian ubuntu fedora etc

all you have to do is extraction it and put it somewhere i prefer the libs folder in your python directory

1147812
configuration	logging
i am performing the basic logging configuration in my settings.py file

1147816
put	get
by autoreleasing the object all we re doing is saying this object will get release at some arbitrary points in the future. that means you can put the autorelease object into the arrays destroy the arrays and the object might probably still exist

1147858
versioning	upgrade
but if you do use the splitter then--yes--you will have to upgrade to a versioning that has a splitter before doing it

1147863
python	java	python	c++
i m thinking of using either c++ java or python

1147885
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged

1147890
openssl	apr
i install apr apr-utils neon and openssl with the --enable-shared flag

1147892
e-commerce	product
currently i have to think of a solution for generator and maintaining lots of static landing pages for a membership-only e-commerce site we sell product x y and z but only to our members and we want to make a seo-friendly landing pages for each product

1147906
server-side-includes	include
with php you can simply include all of the templates for re-use over and over again and then you only need to deal with the content itself which if you know how to use server-side-includes can be done by as easily as swapping .txt files that contains your content

1147923
access-control	authentication
you should also think about the acl access-control list a mechanism which allows an authentication user to do some things but not others on one or more pages

1147930
.when	ready
however the best option for you may be to use a selector as has been suggested .so you know .when a .socket is ready to perform another write

1147951
ubuntu	linux
bonus points if it runs under linux ubuntu

1147960
difference	factors
also doing something like this would allow you to compare performance on multiple variations of the processor by simply running the same program on them and could also allow you to factors in the motherboard difference

1147960
subtract	add
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

1147960
multiplication	division
.so for floating-point you can generally assume division will take longer because it s impractical to unroll the multiplication which is already a large circuit in and of it s self into pipeline of a multitude of multiplier circuit

1147977
dictionary	map
commonly .when people want to do this the correct thing is to use a data structure such as a hashtable dictionary map that stores key named and associated value

1147993
contains	any
.so back to my original question given the above code will the httpcontext.current be dispose along with any of the object contains in its items collections even if an exception-handling is throw

1148009
revision	updates
login to the production server updates to the revision or tag that s been deemed worthy restart the server and you re good to go

1148011
.when	ready
if that s too cumbersome i would work by packaging up a release set of files tested and working together .when ready also tagging it for easy rollback in svn -- say into a .tar.bz2 or .zip archive -- and send that to the server where it gets expanded

1148025
httpd.conf	hosts
but you will need to defined that map in you httpd.conf or virutal hosts configuration

1148027
python	perl
i know that there are languages like perl c python but don t know exactly if they are web based desktop based etc

1148034
snmp	mib
from previous experiences with snmp and can open i like the idea of object dictionary or information base mib as a generics way to describe a device and the field it send receives in messages

1148048
python	ruby
even better you can use the qt language binding for python or ruby

1148084
constructor	object
you could pass the currently global object into the constructor

1148106
audio	ogg
speex is not a real transport format -- it has no framing built into the protocols .so it is typically wrapped in an ogg streaming whose api is unfortunately more complicated than the speex api itself but i digress... .so audio x-speex really means speex in ogg

1148108
zend-framework	cakephp
on the php side there are a numbers of decent frameworks you could have a look into such as zend-framework or cakephp

1148108
joomla	drupal
you might also want to learn about some pre-existing cms systemd like joomla or drupal

1148109
csv	xml
i had a csv file that i converted to xml

1148117
python	c++
i ve no idea how good is this particular project aside from this spooky gpl license but i don t see why logging in action scripting should be any different from j2ee c++ or say python

1148154
nsurlconnection	nsdata
- void connection nsurlconnection connection didreceivedata nsdata data

1148165
python	java
the problem comes down to the fact that python only supports versioning 1.0 of the api whilst java supports 3.0

1148165
python	java
i al.so want it to be web-based .so i m having a look at google-.app-engine but it seems that only the python versioning of .app engine supports the import of gdata apis whilst java does not

1148167
children	nodes
here i keep invoking recursively the function searching the children elements of each nodes and adding the to a new xelement called taskoutput

1148174

i was wondering if silverlight 3 can be used to create line of business applications where i can use file-import export facilities read an xls file and open excel use a report tool like crsytal report or report service or

1148182
silverlight	wpf
i am new to silverlight and wpf and want to decide if i can skip learning wpf

1148182
silverlight	wpf
i know silverlight is a subset of wpf but i just want to concentrate in one of the two

1148187
32-bit	64bit
you can use intptr.size to find out whether you re running in a 32-bit or 64bit process as it will be 4 or 8 bytes respectively

1148199
expression-blend	wpf
depending on what platform you re using you can use expression-blend to edit your gui controls in wpf .net 3.5 sp1 to look however you want

1148209
32-bit	64bit
32-bit .app cannot load 64bit dlls without turning to out of proc solutions

1148214
32-bit	64bit
the only difference is that the old server is 32-bit and the new server is 64bit

1148216
text-editor	editor
which allows me to open text files in my text-editor without prepend the editor cmd

1148219
paint.net	photoshop
paint.net is as a freeware good for bitmaps and icons a mini photoshop

1148222
versioning	upgrade
you have to make sure your local sql instances is exactly at the same building versioning versioning like the hostsing provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hostsing provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the hosts s

1148222
delta	diff
there are tools like sql diff sql compare sql delta and other that can generator such a scripting

1148222
ready	live	.when	ready
.when the scripting is ready i can downloading a newer backup apply the scripting and upload the updates backup and restore it on the live hosts

1148237
shutdown	exit
it s good to set it .so your program doesn t get stuck if the main thread exit unexpectedly but it s not a good normals shutdown path except for quick hacks

1148251
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
also i don t know if this has to be done separately for the x86 versioning of ie to apply to 32-bit apps and to the x64 versioning of ie for the 64bit apps

1148255
put	get
simply get rid of the background and border put the background-url in the input selector and give it the right width and height

1148265
put	get
and once a day or once an hour you get the idea use a batch-file to parsing those files and put the data in database

1148266
json	xml
my other option is to output in xml or possibly json and then parsing the document and insert it into the page

1148266
json	xml
i ve noticed it seems that most larger site do things the json xml way

1148266
json	xml
or is there another reason to use xml json vs just retrieving html

1148266
json	xml
with an xml json response i would have to do

1148272
textbox	button
controls like textbox must be enabled for access and writing but .when user hits tab it will access only button

1148287
perl	php
i learned and developed a lot with java after php and a little perl and am quite happy i did that

1148287
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
i also did some small project with ruby ruby-on-rails and groovy gruby-on-rails in the meantime and played a bit with python django - but goin back to java-based approaches at the moment - but you re mileage may vary

1148287
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
with things like perl although it s really losing ground due to the power and oo features of the thers python and ruby you have generics languages that are easily available on most systemd can be used for shell scripting web and standalone gui developments alike - also very good directions

1148287
scheme	lisp
i still have plain c scheme lisp and scala - and many interesting frameworks - on my to-learn list

1148291
json	xml
generally json is a more efficient way to retrieve data via ajax as the same data in xml is a lot larger

1148302
keydown	keyup
the keyboard events are keydown .when you push any keydown keypress after keydown and keyup .when you let go of the key

1148302
keydown	keyup
if you hold down a key the keydown and keypress events triggers repeatedly until you let go at which points keyup fires

1148302
any	set
note pressing the enter key on a control that is set as default or pressing the esc key on a control that is set as cancel will not triggers any of the key-events for those controls.

1148302
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
also the enter event doesn t refer to the enter key it refers to anytime you enter that control whether by click your mouse into it or moving to it via the keyboard

1148306
json	xml
here are a few pros for sending json xml instead of html

1148306
json	xml
json xml preserve the separation-of-concerns between the server side scripting and views

1148315
python	c++
i have a c++ file class with read function that is supposed to read whole contents of a file just like python does into a buffering

1148324

highlight	cell
this works fine in firefox however in ie8 double click the cell causes the text in the cell to be highlight then display the search accelerator button over top of everything

1148341
highlight	cell
is there anyway to prevent ie from highlight the text in a cell .when its double click

1148353
.when	ready
.so .when i m ready to bring the latest image into my program to work with the camera drivers provides me with an intptr to where to image is already stored in physical memory .so i don t have to waste time re.sources creating another block of memory to store an image that s in memory already

1148354
invokerequired	begininvoke
or you can use the invokerequired and invoke or begininvoke methods on the control instances to have it execute code on the ui-thread

1148359
push	pull
the flow is do your commit locally push to online repo login to your server switching to the project and pull the changes

1148359
push	pull
one rules of thumb is to never edit project code on the server always commit locally and push then pull to the server

1148359
virtualenv	fabric
it also helps to use virtualenv to manage multiple-projects at the very least locally and a fabric deployment scripting to simplify the deployment process

1148361
json	xml
returning json xml gives the application more freedom compared to returning html and required less specific knowledge in different field data vs markup

1148383
any	set
.when i m running my com office add-in from within the delphi 5 ide using any of the office applications as the hosts breakpointss work fine .when using remote-debugging symbols and a properly set output folder but none of the non-delphi exception-handling like access violations in my code triggers the ide to break at that points

1148398
couchdb	hbase
you may also want to take a peek to hbase as an alternative to couchdb and to the adaptive object-model architectural pattern as a way to manage your data and meta-data

1148406
abstract	extends
it s not a class that extends mysqli but a full framework to abstract the db engine - with that you write a schema to describe you db s structure and you then use a pseudo-sql language to send queries

value	field
each datarow treats all it s value as object .so any value-type are boxed which adds a bit of overhead for each field

1148504
amazon-simpledb	couchdb
common interface for couchdb and amazon-simpledb

1148515
value	field
suffers from a minor glitch- the key and value field are not the same

1148523
delphi	c++	delphi	basic
i m learning c++ and know a little bit of visual basic and an delphi

1148523
delphi	c++
but i want to know is there some program like delphi but for c++

1148523
delphi	c++
something where you can drag a button to a form double click it the like in delphi and vb opens a code editor and you edit the code of the button but with a similar code of c++

1148542
delphi	c++
there used to be c++ builder a c++ versioning of delphi i don t know if this product is still being developed or not

1148547
amazon-simpledb	couchdb
the amazon-web-services analogue to something like couchdb would be amazon-simpledb

1148554
capacity	storage
you would have to be dealing with a few billion rows before this makes any significant difference in terms of storage capacity

1148559
web-config	app-config
the dal code was ignoring my web-config connection-string and trying to use the app-config value

1148561
combinations	permutation
doing combinations rather than permutation can be obtained easily by simply respecting the order of the input list

1148561
contains	any
if k n then the union of two bunches those that contains the first item of l and any of the combinations of k-1 of the other n-1 items

1148569
web-config	app-config
generally i let the top-level project defined this via either web-config or app-config

1148578
arrays	loops
the problem is that in both loops you index the same arrays of file s

1148582
javascript	dom
3 hide elements that javascript will control at dom load with javascript instead of hiding them in the stylesheet and later showing them with javascript since the user would never get to see them if they have javascript turned off

1148593
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
w3c browsers firefox safari opera etc.

1148594
selected	cell
because .when the user selected a table cell to rearrange it that cell does not get swapped with the cell they are moving it to

1148594
selected	cell
the cell they selected gets insert at the new row index and then the original cell is removed

1148603
ubuntu	debian
package submitted to debian will also make their way into ubuntu in due course

1148622
selected	button
at the beginning of each row is a textfield and a button that creates a .so that the user can browse an inventory and selected a single item

1148622
populate	row
i cannot figure out a way to get the variables being set in the back to the main page and just populate the textfield for that specific row and not redraw the entire page

1148622
any	set
i can t even get the to access any variables on the main page and i thought that it was just a floating div and would have access to all of the main page variabless that are set

1148631
python	ruby
i perfectly understand the importance of productivity not just execution speed but .when your program has to run for hours you just can t afford to write it in python or ruby

1148631
functional-programming	imperative-programming
i don t care if the language supports imperative-programming it might be a plus but it has to focus and encourage functional-programming

1148631
scala	java
on the other hand i wouldn t have done the same with java or even scala scala in particular seems to be lacking good tools which is really a shame

1148641
directory-structure	filesystems
compared with using the filesystems directory-structure to essentially create a btree analogue using a real btree is going to be far faster

1148653
height	frame
frameets seem like they might be simpler for recreating the diggbar where the bottom frame are perfectly matched to the height underneath the top bar pages are not cut off

1148672

nginx installation the webserver vhost proxy

1148753
margins	padding
if that works then some elements s padding or margins is causing the issue

1148775
scala	java
i m interested in learning scala for itself but would also like some advice on using it for testing java

1148776
web-inspector	webkit
you can see the browser s default in webkit s web-inspector and opera s dragonfly as well

1148784
haskell	ocaml
if you like using lists for most things and care about performance use haskell or ocaml

1148784
haskell	scala
if you re willing to use arrays more than lists or plan on programming using mutable state use scala rather than haskell

1148784
scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala
if you re looking to write threaded multi-core code use scala or haskell ocaml required you to fork

1148784
scala	java	scala	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala
none of scala ocaml or haskell have truly great standards libs but at least you can easily use java libs in scala

1148784
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml have a reasonable amount of 3rd party libs

1148784
scala	java
it s possible to write scala that s almost identical in performance to java c++ but not necessarily in a high level functional or oo styles

1148794
scala	java
you can certainly use scala to test java

1148798
user-interface	drawing
there also seems to be another project viewersvg that allows you to draw the whole user-interface or just some of its elements of your wpf application in your favorite vector drawing application

1148803
value	field
or should the controllers know that i want an rss field and populate the postingdateformat field with a different value

1148804
haskell	ocaml
in my mind there are three viable candidates haskell standards ml ocaml

1148804
haskell	sml
not to be found in haskell or sml

1148804
haskell	c++
ml functor and haskell types classes provide some of the encapsulation and polymorphism aka generics that are found in c++

1148811
32-bit	64bit
i am developing an application that has two dlls one is a 32-bit versioning another is 64bit versioning

1148811

1148834
silverlight	wpf
there is a big movement in wpf silverlight developers circles to move to a mvvm architected solution however they dont go futher than simple or general examples

1148843
early-binding	late-binding
it s the usual problem of binding -- you want early-binding for the use of i inside the function and python is doing late-binding for it

1148849
constructor	object
if .so parameterized from above pass in object through constructor all the way down

1148854
logout	login
let s take a login logged in as | logout fragment for example

executable	upx
compress your executable and any dlls using something like aspack or upx

1148903
notepad++	scite
you can edit usertype.dat file for a bit of syntax-highlighting but it s nicer to use an editor which has support for nsis files any scintilla based editor - scite notepad++ notepad2

1148907
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it looks like you are trying to implements uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

1148915
contains	sorted
the best i can come up with is this sql for producing a list of category sorted by the max price of the contains items

1148931
version-control	git
the mainstream systemd are subversion for centralized version-control and git and mercurial for distribute version-control

1148937
version-control	git
this one is a distribute version-control systemd that currently has a good windows support with git on windows and a shell extension with tortoisegit

1148939
version-control	git
unfortunately i don t think that git is an easy introduction to version-control

1148940
google-chrome	safari
remember that the webkit rendering in safari and google-chrome make all textarea resizable with a handle by default

1148947
put	get
.so i couldn t get jquery to do it but plain old javascript as ddkilzer suggested works .so i put together this function to apply the autocapitalize off option to all input with a specific class

1148955
url-encoding	url
.when i add the product description piece to the url best-product-in-the-world i get url-encoding issues

1148958
defined	declare
defined a standalone function namedd translatetocanvas which has nothing to do with the private methods you declare in your class other than happening to have the same named

1148962
contains	set
the only way to break out of that contains block is to set a width on it .so it overflows as you were doing

1148979
arrays	loops
do a loops with three iterator using an arrays to control which functionality gets called on each pass of loopss

1148980
contains	any
there you can see that a modern osx binary is likely to contains any of powerpc powerpc64 i386 or x86_64

1148987
positioning	slider
.when the touchesended methods gets called i return the slider to it s starting positioning

1149000

i also want to add that you must catch inorder of inherited from lowest subclassing to highest parent class

1149031
endpoint	uri
admittedly this is a lot like the uri of the endpoint moving

1149040
required	checked
or maybe something goes wrong somewhere between .when .obj was alloc d and the required call to release like you checked some conditional and return immediately by mistake because it slipped your mind that that call to release later on must take place

1149048
logging	trace
i suggest you make a lot of trace logging to allow simpler trouble-shooting

1149049
contains	any
this way your viewmodel won t contains any formatting logic and will simply do what they are meant to do - carry object from the controllers the the view

1149051
nsmutabledata	nsarray
i m working with objective-c and i need to add int s from a nsarray to a nsmutabledata i m preparing a to send the data over a connection

1149069
32-bit	64bit
what you are trying to do won t work the size will always be equals to a pointers 4 for 32-bit platform and 8 for 64bit and you will append some garbage pointers value to your data as opposed to the numbers

1149069
32-bit	64bit	powerpc	arm
what is going on is an internal implementation detail and may vary from release to release or even between different configuration of the same release 32-bit vs 64bit iphone vs mac os x arm vs i386 vs powerpc

1149073
quirks-mode	doctype
your current doctype triggers quirks-mode because it s missing the systemd identifier

1149077
revision	updates
to start with updates -r 1 will undo revision 2 and 3 in your working directory whereas backout -r 1 --merge will undo revision 1 while keeping revision 2 and 3

1149077
revision	updates
updates checked out an older revision in your working directory whereas backout creates a new one but normally you d commit after the merge above

1149081
administration	account
most exmaples out there use the account named as upn user principal named instead of spn but that is just for the convenience of samples as using a true spn would run into administration issues setting up the spn under an user account again why admins should do it...

1149082
click	mouse
that means pure css a hover setting is not the answer coz .when mouse move out or click other places the link will back to its normals state

1149084
sql-server	mysql
in particular sql-server and mysql

1149090
direct2d	gdi
if you re writing graphics code for windows 7 you should consider direct2d over gdi which has a programming model that is compatible with but very different than gdi s

1149100
installshield	inno-setup
in fact i wrote a small routine to reliably detection 3.5 which installshield wasn t doing with inno-setup

1149112
type-conversion	primitive
my guess is the conversion from pointers to bool is an implicit primitive type-conversion where the conversion to std string required the call of a constructor and the construction of a temporary

1149133
stderr	stdout
an example where this would be useful is some sort of customizable logging routines where you might want to send the output to stdout console.out stderr console.error or nowhere system.io.textwriter.null or anything else based on some runtime conditional

1149135
bash	zsh
his instructions assume bash but should work the same for zsh

1149140
launchd	daemons
the daemons as far as i understand it is just a convenient way to bypass having to manually launchd a program at boot

1149144
constructor	object
the constructor for an import_ object

1149144
constructor	object
the constructor to export_ always takes an object of types abstract_

you should also to make sure your webserver apahce nginx etc is sending the utf-8 http header and that your html files have a content-type meta tag

1149172
hide	show
this project uses a lot of rich integration and show hide functionality based on a complex set of combinations of application states closer to what you would find in a flash flex application perhaps

1149175
background-image	width
then you could set the image as the background-image for a disabled uibarbuttonitem and animate the button width incrementally to indicate progress

1149186
virtualization	vmware
just a quick query on anyone whos worked with xenserver i want to setup a nas at home but with virtualization i ve looked into vmware server and kvm i quite like kvm

1149205
crypt	hash
instead crypt is used to generator a hash of the passwd

1149205
crypt	hash
.when you types in your passwd crypt is applied to that and then the two hash are compared

1149205
crypt	hash
essentially the function of crypt is to translation the text into some new text from which the original can never be recovered but which has a low probability of generator the same hash for two different key

1149206
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a passwd key as a string and a salt character arrays which is describe below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1149209
digits	base
you could omit vowels from your selection of digits either using base 31 or adding some more characters to bring it backup to 32 or 36 or whatever

1149210
primitive	int
in general unless specifically stated somewhere in the documentation the rules of thumb in object-oriented programming is that the internal details of how an object chooses to represent its internal state is private to the object implementation and should be treated as a black box. again unless the documentation says you can do otherwise you can t assume that nsnumber is using a c primitive types of int to store the int value you gave it

1149211
value	field
.when that form submit via .post i want to be able to grab an arbitrary numbers of field building a list out of their value and then either re-send them to google if the addresses were changed or add them with their custom-coordinates into the database

web-config	app-config
should i have to updates web-config or app-config to map the view class to model somewhere

1149295
hide	show
the safest and simplest methods is to tracking .when the keyboard hide show

1149302
class-design	accessor
if the points of the accessor you want to add is just to test whether the function had the desired effect your class-design may violate another principles which is that a state-machine-like class should always make it clear what state its in if that affects what happens .when people interact with the class

1149308
remote-debugging	debugging
you may be implicit using remote-debugging if you are debugging a 64bit appliction

1149308
32-bit	64bit
visual-studio runs as a 32-bit process and uses remote-debuggingging under the hood to debugging 64bit applications

1149319
instances	self
a couple of language-features making your life a lot easier methods closures no need for delegation optional-arguments saves a lot of time compared to as2 optional-arguments which are rather a hack instances scoping re.solution you can access members of an instances from within an anonymous-function declare in a methods of that instancess .so no need for variables self this

1149335
constructor	object
in your particular example the object factory-pattern is a better solution than using reflection to invoke constructor

1149345
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is subset of wpf .so many features from wpf are simply not available for silverlight

1149360
silverlight	xbap
i think silverlight will eventually fade xbap out as said before it doesn t need the whole .net on client s box and also works accross platform browsers recently it also introduced more languages like iron ruby ironpython also it has better support for video-streaming

1149369
crypt	salt
without salt crypt is basically just a one-way hash-function

1149398
instances	self
if you design a types of which some instancess can evaluate as false by having __len__ or __nonzero__ special methods in the class it s advisable to follow the same precept have __init__ or __new__ for immutables if called without arguments beyond self for __init__ and cls for __new__ of course prepare a new if mutable empty or zero-like instances of the class

1149422
postgresql	mysql
the ruby-on-rails trunk has adaptor for mysql postgresql and sqlite which you could base your adaptor on

1149428
sql-server	oracle
i am raw on sql-server but oracle has selected for updates statements that can help you

1149430
delphi	basic
i think website are pretty much covered in previous answers delphi basic would be my suggestion .so here s a couple of books

1149448
sql-server	oracle
the following will work on sql-server 2005+ or oracle 9i+

1149451
contains	elements
and the configuration file contains noting the allowexedefinition attributes on the section elements to defined that a user configuration file and overrides the app.exe.config

1149453
protected	public
my preferred solution for this would be to provide protected accessor functions to communication clearly to the class s users that these are not part of the public interface

1149475
instances	destroy
this doesn t cater for instances of myobject being destroy

1149479
malloc	free
of course at this points you will probably want a deallocate function and make sure that this is always called to perform the corresponding free for the new malloc s

1149486
publishing	release
copy the x86 libs to bin release bin debugging and the x64 to bin publishing

1149495
filtering	sorting
i want the iterator to support paging sorting and filtering of the data and ideally not iterate over a memory copy but to not even selected the data in the first place perhaps linq-to-sql or entity-framework would provide somthing similar

1149495
filtering	sorting
i think doing a sql data reader may be the ticket but if i am not mistaken you need to keep the connection open as you iterate which doesn t seem to make much sense the other approach is to just selected the page of data return it and offer an iterator over that collections .when you get to the end it pull down next page this would work but means i have to cook up a lot of sql construct to support sorting filtering and paging but in the end that may be the solution

1149496
multithreading	wait
if the function itself isn t multithreading eg it doesn t spawn other threads process and wait for them to complete then the only issue is your machine

1149502
display	width
i am getting text data from a database and want to display in a labels x width don t know if width is important but i guess it is upto 5 line of text if in database the data is less then 5 line all will be display

i m thinking about learning ruby and python a little bit and it occurred to me for what ruby python is good for

1149581
python	ruby
.when to use ruby and .when python or for what ruby python is not for

1149582
silverlight	wpf
the flash-based charts by amcharts are pretty nice you d have to write your own server-side .net code to initializer them or use the wpf versioning with silverlight

1149595
python	ruby
i believe python is better for this than ruby but i could be wrong

1149596
python	ruby
both ruby and python are popular especially for prototyping but you can also building production software like ruby-on-rails zope and mercurial

then during the install methods you could simply create a folder in the windows directory by using the variables of the environment class

1149659
constructor	private	constructor	object
all java singleton patterns both this and the standards with private constructor and static accessor have this bad properties that if you to test them or test anything that even remotely depends on them can use this and only this object

1149659
spring	guice	dependency-injection	singleton
personally i would just avoid using singleton that way but rather introduce dependency-injection via guice spring or pico containers

ruby has an edges for munging textfiles awk perl styles

1149661
python	ruby
see what does ruby have that python doesn #39

printwriter	writer
use throwable.printstacktrace printwriter passwd to send the stack-trace to an appropriate writer

1149723
python	ruby
the core of python is somewhat cleaner than the core of ruby and if you learn the basic core of scripting with python first you will more or less as a bonus learn ruby

1149723
haskell	erlang
clisp scheme48 erlang or haskell should probably have been on my final list though

1149723
python	ruby
what can ruby do that python can t or what can python do that ruby can t

1149723
any	set
the points is that .when you set out to learn .something one usually have a hidden agenda .so you try to .solve your favorite problem in any language again and again

1149723
python	ruby
if your really are out to learn without have an agenda i think that python in it s most basic form is a clean and crisp way and you should be able to use the same styles .when using ruby

1149723
python	ruby
disclaimer i prefer ruby in a production commercial setup over python

1149723
python	ruby
i prefer ruby over python on windows

1149723
python	ruby
i prefer ruby over python on the things i do at home

1149723

1149762
wxpython	pyqt
.so my suggestion is use cython for gui use a framework like wxpython pyqt and you would be happy

1149772
deployment	install
updates if understanding classpath is your issue you need to know that anything web-inf classes and in jars under web-inf .lib in your deployment are in the classpath along with jars that are install on your .app server that all deployed .applications shared

1149796
value	field
for example if the field value of itemname for three document with no boost factors are

for example if you pass in a url parameter to your http-request object s constructor then that doesn t mean http-request should have a geturl methods which returns a url object on which the caller is then expected to call getprotocol getquerystring etc

1151438
callback	methods	contains	any
are they seriously saying that if my object has a string named field and i want to know whether the named contains any non-ascii characters then i must either defined a namedcontainsnonasciicharacters methods on my object instead of looking at the string itself or else add a visitnamed function to the class taking a callback inorder to work around the restrictions by ensuring that the string is a parameter to a function i ve written

contains	elements
you must add an event-listener to the parent elements contains all those nice elementss

1151771
traceroute	ping
i would like to be able to perform a ping and traceroute from within python without having to execute the corresponding shell cmd .so i d prefer a native python .solution

1151780
decrement	increment
that s rather an unpleasant race conditional which might at the least result in unanticipated semaphore decrement and increment

1151782
traceroute	ping
running interpreter as root is often frowned upon on security grounds and of course you do need to have root permission to access the raw socked as needed by the icmp specifications of ping and traceroute

1151782
traceroute	ping
but if you have no problems with that it s not hard -- this .post gives a workable ping and jeremy hylton s old page has still-usable underlying code for icmp both ping and traceroute though it s written for very old python versioning and needs a litte facelift to shine with modern ones -- but the concepts are all there in both the urls i gave you

1151844
qthread	qobject
from cjhuitt s answer isn t necessary anymore it was in qt 4.1 since connect default to qt autoconnection which now qt 4.2 does the right thing and switches between queue and direct connection mode based on qthread currentthread and the thread affinity of the receiver qobject at emit time instead of sender and receiver affinity at connect time

1151847
jquery	.post
use jquery s built-in support for ajax to make get .post ajax call it s very simple simpler than the updatepanel i would say and absolutely compatible with most browsers

1151854
google-chrome	firefox
edit looks like in firefox 3 and google-chrome you can t make alias .so easily

1151854
javascript	dom
.when prototype libs arrived they named their function which gets the dom elements as to save on typing reliability .when writing javascript code most of the time you start with selected some dom elements

1151870
environment	building
fyi best practice is to not have to rebuild your artifact for different environment - as that does not lead to re-produce-able building and other things could potentially change .when rebuilding

1151889
triggers	insert
you could write a triggers that substitutes the next sequences value for the jid column on every insert

1151896
value	field
in addition if you are planning on access int bool value from multiple threads then you should mark it the field as volatile

1151897
traceroute	ping
how can i perform a ping or traceroute using native python

1151897
traceroute	ping
however because python is not running as root it doens t have the ability to open the raw icmp sockets needed to perform the ping traceroute in native python

1151897
traceroute	ping
this brings me back to using the systemd s ping traceroute shell cmd

1151904
jquery	.post
non-ajax get .post using jquery plugins

1151912
any	set
and how do i set the svn to use any of those methods

1151929
traceroute	ping
the one case where i d bother looking for alternatives would be if i had to run correctly under windows too where ping and traceroute may have their own problems anyway -- let us know if that s the case for you and we ll see what can be arranged

1151930
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s available with both asp.net-mvc and webforms

1151954
positioning	slider
i need to integrated a dynamic slider into a webpage which sould have a draggable pointsers on it.as it is dragged the value on a corresponding box should also change.there should be no upper limit to the slider.it should have numberss ranging on its body which should change automatically .when the pointsers is dragged at runtime.i mean as it is dragged to the higher end the numbers s range should dynamically change from say 10-20 to 100-200.also as soon as the pointsers is left at any particular points of the slider it should return back to the orignal positioning from where it was dragged leaving the numbers s range changed

1151954
jquery	dojo	scriptaculous	dojo	scriptaculous	jquery
any framework jquery dojo scriptaculous etc. is welcomed

if calculation of the assign value is too complex or is cannot be assign to a field initializer i d have a protected or private default-constructor

1152110
ruby-on-rails	grails
my impression and that of my colleague who was there was that roo was good if you were generator a web-based crud application every few weeks - they pitched it as the pure java versioning of grails which is ruby-on-rails for java

1152128
user-controls	treeview
i try to bind the selected item of a treeview to a stackpanel or some other containers that can hold user-controls

1152128

idem if i place a textbox in it it will show the correct types of the selected item

1152142
loading	gif
i ve aleady created the modal-dialog form with a neat loading gif located in the centering that works perfectly on a button click event on its own

1152142
loading	gif
the reason i ve chosen this methods is because 1 i want to block any user integration with the form while the code is being execute and 2 provide the user with an indication that process is underway i dont know how to judge how long a particular piece of code will take to execute hence opting for an infinite loading indicator gif

1152144
value	field
but .when using this second styles the c# compiler generator the same initialization value of each field in every constructor present within the class

1152150
.when	ready
inorder to know .when the operation is ready set up a handler for the runworkercompleted event

1152159
positioning	slider
all you would need then would be to attach an event to reset the slider s positioning .when the user is done sliding and you would be set

1152160
fflush	stdout
this partially works in that i do get the contents of stdout but instead of as the progress messages are sent i get it once the command-line application exit and it seems to fflush stdout in one go

1152168
folder	dir
alternatively you can write the file to a temp folder and only after written move it to the target dir

1152170
comma	words
maybe explode all sequences into wordss let the wordss be key in a hashtable and the value is a comma separated list of all the .post the words is in

1152184
arrays	loops
i ve read that the jit compiler is smart enough to figure out you are looping through the entire arrays and would therefore skip emitting bounds checked code inside the body of loops

1152187
constructor	object
that object s constructor destructor could then call these methods

1152188
uiresponder	uiview
if i were you i would do the following subclassing uiview and implements whichever of the uiresponder touch methods are useful to you

1152192
perl	php
it can be used with php ruby-on-rails perl and until now for me worked like a charm

1152203
html5-canvas	canvas
how do i markup a page with an html5-canvas such that the canvas

1152212
silverlight	wpf
as for whether or not to use this standards my opinion is that because all the generics wpf silverlight control templates styles use this conventions i would follow the pack on this one also from my experience i like the part_ naming conventions as i find that local elements stand out well within my templates and styles

1152222
spring	jsf
e.g. struts or spring or jsf not all three

1152227
32-bit	64bit
the problem is that this is our developer machines with 3.3gb memory on a 32-bit os .so basically we either have to upgrade to 64bit and more memory which won t happen for a while or set up a virtual-server to do this with lots of memory which will impact production servers

1152231
stripes	jsf	stripes	wicket	wicket	jsf
yes with java you have web-frameworks like jsf struts struts2 wicket spring-mvc stripes tepestry facelets

1152237
getter	setter
of course it must be declare as a properties for getter and setter

1152242
jquery	.post
i use jquery .post function to go to server and bring the link to file downloading

1152242
internet-explorer	firefox
it works in firefox but in internet-explorer it show the messages to help protect your security internet-explorer blocked..

1152264
windows-applications	wpf
i think it depends on the skillset of your team but having said that from my experience wpf is much easier to develop windows-applications with

1152270
.net	wcf	silverlight	wpf
please don t forget about the following .net technologies win.forms silverlight wcf wpf wwf.

1152271
typename	typedef
typedef ing it further to vec_sz makes sense to shorten the typename

1152281
scala	java
also .when you have other languages like scala that compile to jvm byte code there s no rules that the byte code be easily represented back in java and likely isn t

1152310
subtract	time
subtract elapsedtime from remainingtime and you a somewhat accurate calculation for file copy time

1152323
sql-server	oracle
for instances ms sql-server and oracle has different named on typical functions and different ways to do calculations with dates .so a query to get me all per.sons edited the last 24 hours might entail different sql syntax just for those two database engines

1152361
photoshop	layer
as for photoshop there s import from photoshop and import from illustrator in blend 3 these is a really neat updates for blend 3 as it manages the layer from a psd .so that you have your layer within blend

1152379
put	get
the compiler will not be able to optimize out any of the computations that placed value in the arrays but you ll still get any other optimizations it can put in to make the code fast

1152384
order	add
you could add the images to the list in the correct order and access the image at the desired index position.but it will help you get rid of one of the selected statement but you will still need to have one for the different picturebox

1152405
postgresql	mysql
now i ll need to do the same with postgresql the project is getting mature and mysql

1152413
easymock	jmock
what i ve seen is while it is entirely possible to write the tests using any of the mocking apis - jmock easymock etc they typically work straight-off the logic is .so basic how couldn t they only breaking .when you change the code adding a value for example and that just makes them a burden on the codebase

1152427
compact-framework	.net
you may also want to look into user-interface framework for .net compact-framework 3.5 msdn article describing some of the features

1152430
32-bit	64bit
moving to 64bit windows will let your 32-bit application access the entire 32-bit address spaces and thus give you 4 gb addressable spaces

1152437
innodb	myisam
the technicians at my web hosts managed to save it but the tables are all converted from the original innodb to myisam

1152488
python	ruby
it is free and very easy to use has a clear documentation and tutorials is in constants development cross-platform and has binding to c d .net python and ruby

1152488
physics-engine	chipmunk
i would also suggest an excellent 2d physics-engine - chipmunk physics

1152488
python	ruby
it is very fast written in c has binding to python pymunk and ruby and probably more languages and is really really easy to setup

1152488
python	ruby
python or ruby with chipmunk physics and sfml

1152494
sql-server	mysql
as far as performance is concerned i know that this query can be quite performant on sql-server but i m not .so sure how well mysql likes it

1152507
command-line	cmd
the jviewmodel java command-line allows explicit setting of max viewmodel sizes various -xm cmd and you d think that would be designed to be adequate

1152517
mpfr	gmp
it also uses the gmp and mpfr libs to assist in optimizing call to things like sin fabs etc. as well as optimizing such call to their fpu sse or 3d now

1152544
value	field
you can use default to put the correct value in the primary key field eg

1152547
email-validation	validation
my form validation rules i have an email-validation too but that s irrelevant here

1152559
contains	set
what i need to do is this using jquery i want to grab the tooltip text from the nested anchor some_title and set this text to the title attributes of the contains div

1152563
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i d support both ie still has a big chunks of the user spaces with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

1152579
background-color	border-color
try nifty corners cube but it doesn t allow you to have a border-color different form the inner background-color

1152583
digits	zero
what can i do to add the leading zero .when the month has only 1 digits

1152591
ref	out
you also can t pass it as a ref or out parameter to a methods

1152591
assign	add
also sometimes .when i have a or as a field in a class i ll declare it readonly to indicate that i want to work with its members even add and remove items etc. but i never want to actually assign a different list or dictionary object to it

1152602
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
the other gotcha is that while ie8 has implements the postmessage api it has somewhat predictably done it differently from all the other browsers ff3+ google-chrome safari 4+ and opera 9.64+

1152640
bmp	gif	bmp	ico	ico	gif
formats are bmp gif ico cur jbg

1152668
communication	messages
but as far as i know the easiest way for different sessions to communication is probably to save all chat messages in a database

1152686
selected	textbox
.when a treeviewitem is click selected i would like another textbox to be focused

1152686
selected	textbox
the problem is that as soon as i add code to focus the textbox it looks like the treeview does not show its selected nodes anymore the treeitem is not selected at all or at least not visibly

1152693
value	field
another question that i have is how does sql handle the computation if a value in a particular field is divided by 0

1152712
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if your entity has its own subclassing you can do that by writing a custom setter that takes the data extraction the components via nsdatecomponents and reassembles those into a date via nscalendar

1152719
revision	svn
if i remove the measure-object then i get the details of the svn commit revision author messages date etc.

1152727
istream	ostream
important both istream and ostream must be ivars part of your class declaration

1152727
istream	ostream
presuming this is what i think it is you should be able to remove the fixed add sometihng like nslog self is p istream is p ostream is p self istream ostream and then wait for it to crash

1152727
istream	ostream
the value for istream and ostream should be the same as whatever nslog spit out

1152727
istream	ostream
for each of self istream ostream

1152737
user-controls	treeview
you can create a user-controls to display the treeview and the selection info on the right all in one

1152737
any	set
any other custom behavior i m sure you could create or set in styles templates here

1152738
input-field	selected
how to find the numbers of options tag in the selected dom elements since with that i want to open the settings panels with that numbers of input-field with the corresponding option value from the dropdown box in it and to change it again in the preview panels

1152744
value	field
al.so a const field value is stored as part of the metadata and .so is initializer in the relevant constructor of the class that declare it while readonly field will have to be computed at runtime

1152754
hide	show
i use other show and hide within my code for other elements and they work quite fine

1152754
hide	show
is there a specific usage of the show and hide methods in my case

1152757
hash	md5
if you put the md5 hash in the filename you could retrieve it and try to recalculate the checksum on the file

1152795
textbox	button
but now i would like to add controls like textbox button treeview ..

1152800
value	field
a readonly field cannot get a new value .so you can t create a second dbrepository and assign it to this field

1152800
value	field
if it s not readonly then you could write code which will re-assign a new value to this field

1152800
value	field
furthermore if cleanup of the dbrepository has a memory leak then reassigning new value to this field will cause multiple memory-leaks

1152800
value	field
2 you assign the value of _db to another field

1152800
value	field
use readonly to make sure others won t reassign a value to this field

1152804
subclassing	metaclass
according to the uml metamodel both are two independent subclassing of the relationship metaclass

1152804
associations	model
however it is true that in your scenario i d just model an associations between the two classes and not a dependency

1152816
player	movie
loops - tells whether or not the flash player should attempt to restart the movie .when it finishes playing it

1152845
contains	elements
your custom droplist elements should contains few divs or other html elementss as droplist items

1152849
javascript	dom
in javascript you can manipulate dom css properties for example

1152849
font-size	height
if you simply want to specify the height and font-size use css or styles attributes

1152851
font-size	height
don t the height and font-size css properties work for you

1152861
font-size	height
if you want to set a height that is not proportional to the font-size i would recommend using something like the following

1152863
difference	count
note that count can also be used if you wish to include all recording in the table in sql is there a difference between count and count fieldname

1152865
moss	wss
next to that there is a timerjob that runs to sync the information in ad and sharepoint though i m not sure whether this is moss feature only or that it s also available in wss

1152875
value	field
the eventsmain class is from the data context and is representing a table that has a whole load of field of which in this case the linq query is assessing the value of a couple of bit field and two datetime field

1152886
panels	grid
i can do this happily in a test .aspx page with no issues by just putting my grid in the panels as normals

1152886
panels	grid
.when i run the page and view the source i can see that the panels is rendering as a div that surrounds the grid

1152886
panels	grid
instead the rendering div for the panels has no height and witdh settings and is therefore somehow smaller than the grid

1152908
any	set
is any of them set to false by mistake

1152913
buffering	streaming
the boost docs only mention throw an std failure for streaming errors and letting other error propagate eg a bad-alloc from trying to allocate a buffering however the boost code does not seem to catch these instead relying on the user code to handle them but all my existing code relies on the good bad etc methodss and the clear methods in cases where it needs to try again after an error

1152915
keyboard	mouse
what you see is the behavior of a program that does not process windows-messages .so consequently it will not redraw parts that become invalid and it will not react to keyboard or mouse input for example moving or resizing with the mouse or .app activation using the taskbar button

1152923
parentheses	braces
as regular expression go we don t have something like a counter for braces or parentheses thus we have to honor the possible order of things

1152930
internationalization	localization
are you asking about internationalization localization

1152951
attributes	properties
i think there must be an attributes to hide a public properties from the datagridview

1152953
protected	public
although to actually use it outside the class the methods is in you need to set the access of samplemethods to public rather than protected in all of the cases it appears .so

1152956
carbon	cocoa
the same goes for using carbon instead of cocoa

1152960
constructor	private	protected	public
i have tried changing the types of methods private protected etc but there is often conflicting needs by fxcop and the unit tests fxcop saying it doesnt like constructor with virtual methodss but the unit saying that the methodss should be public protected virtual or protected internal virtual catch 22 a lil bit

1153002
.when	ready
on the other hand is execute only once .when the dom is initially ready loaded

1153018
derived-class	base-class
if you have a base-class with a vtable pointers this-pointers can likely be shared with the derived-class

1153018
derived-class	base-class
you simply create a vtable for the derived-class which adds its own methods after that of the base-class

1153060
arrays	map
performance-wise you may be better to store the map locally as your own arrays and draw it to the screens as a set of untextured quad

1153076
target-platform	platform
it appears counter intuitive to me knowing that the target-platform is a arm based mobile platform

1153076
mips	x86
x86 mips yadda yadda yadda...

1153090
32-bit	64bit
i need to detection whether a given .dll or .exe file is 32-bit or 64bit

1153090
value	field
this field can take up to about 20 value

1153096
ruby-on-rails	django
however most of the information i find on ruby-on-rails versus django is out of date and based on much older versioning of the frameworks .so please forgive me

1153096

1153129
ruby-on-rails	rspec
you forgot at least one advantage of ruby-on-rails -- enhanced testability via rspec cucumber

1153142
export	csv
i would initially suggest creating a csv file and export to excel but you seem to required something more sophisticated

1153148
gethashcode	equals
i could also use a but this would necessitate calling gethashcode on every incoming string as well as equals which would be a waste if there are only 3 strings in the list

1153148
tree	trie
as the strings are unicode a standards trie structure will not work although a radix tree patricia trie might

1153157
haskell	prolog
i feel i am not good at both p .so i was thinking of starting learning prolog and haskell

1153169
compact-framework	.net
uncheck the deploy the latest versioning of the .net compact-framework .

1153177
base-class	inherited
it uses an abstract base controllers that is aware of the site it is being called for - by creating controllerss that inherited from this base-class you have automatic access to the current site for the current request

1153179

1156472
gethashcode	equals
implements a greater precision gethashcode64 the overrides gethashcode 32-bit will return int gethashcode64 and equals will return this.gethashcode64 other.gethashcode64

1156486
gethashcode	equals
say you add two object to a hashset that have the same hashcode then the containers will use the gethashcode first to find where approximately in the hashset the object is then use the equals on all the matching object to find your exact object

1156487
gethashcode	equals
it s a good idea to keep the implementation of equals separate from gethashcode because they do quite different things

1156496
gethashcode	equals
edit equals methods then can use gethashcode but only to return false .when hash differ

1156518

1157081
expression	evaluation
the preprocessor can not only do evaluation of expression as in the #if and #ifdef clauses but it can also open other files and insert them using #include and even do text substitution using #define clauses

1157116
deep-copy	object
the interesting thing is that we backed it with binaryserializer simply because it s a convienent and virtually foolproof way to make a deep-copy of an object without all the hassle of reflection or forcing developers to write and test clone methods

1157119
python	c++
not c++ not c# and certainly not python

1157119
python	perl
.so if perl is ok does that mean i can .somehow kludge .something together with python

1157120
keydown	keyup
instead of using focus you can change the input value on keydown and keyup

1157127
communication	messages
if the communication involves frequent messages and is on the same systemd you ll get very good performance because windows won t actually write the data out in the first place

1157129
printf	scanf
i m running out of ideas for my beginning c class and the only topics i ve discussed .so far are data types variables the printf scanf functions

1157139
constructor	object
but once a constructor is called the instances of the object is already created regardless of whether it was passed valid arguments

1157139
arguments	default
of course i could always set the named to some default like unnamedd myclass if the arguments is invalid but in this case i d rather just prevent an invalid named then trying to assume some alternate behavior

1157141
web-applications	web-services
i guess that .when my rest web-services are available then some of my web-applications and console applications will be able to use rest web service as data service to get add updates and delete data to databases

in other words prompt for a numbers in decimal and a numbers systemd say 2 for binary or 16 for hex and then output the numbers in that systemd

1157154
constructor	object
if not passing a named is a valid way to construct the object offer a parameterless constructor

1157156
constructor	object
but once a constructor is called the instances of the object is already created regardless of whether it was passed valid arguments.

1157156
constructor	object
the object is created non-null only if the constructor returns normally

1157201
constructor	object	any	set
i usually set the field in the constructor as in myclass1 because i find it easier to be able to look in one place to see all the stuff that happens .when the object is being initializerr but is there any case where it is better to initializer a field directly like in myclass2

1157217
pthreads	usleep
yes - older pthreads standards defined usleep .so this is available on linux

1157217
pthreads	usleep
usleep has since been deprecated and subsequently removed from pthreads

first declare your functions as normals but mark them as inline the inline specifier instructs the compiler to place the body of the function at the function-call rather than call the function normalsly if its possible to

1157274
put	get
as an added bonus this mechanism is self-documenting .so these would automatically get put into your generator document

1157287
json	xml
omar al zabir provides a pretty good example of using asp.net-mvc to provide restful service that are fluent in both xml and json

1157287

constructor	object
before the constructor for the object

1157456
value	field
field it will overwrite any value

1157469

1157486
expression-templates	type-deduction
overrides type-deduction for expression-templates

1157486
decltype	auto
expression-templates often defined types that should not be used directly a case in points is the return-value of if auto or decltype are used on this kind of object unexpected behavior may ensue

1157509
default	reset
note that .when you develop the user file will occationally be reset to the default but this only h.appens .when building the .app

1157549
input-field	selected	value	field
i want to display a dropdown selected field with value 1 to 20 and depending on which value gets selecteded in that field that s how many input-field i will display to a user to fill out on the page without refreshing of course

1157549
input-field	selected
.so if i selected 4 in the dropdown box initially there are no input-field show as the default should be 0 right underneath it 4 line of input-field for named email should be created all with unique identifier and such for storing into mysql

1157558
constructor	object
it feels really clunky and totally bloats the constructor of the data object

1157564
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe streaming solve the lazy-evaluation problem but in any case this feels like unnecessarily ugly

1157577
selected	textbox
this will insert a textbox after the selected on the page

1157589
input-field	selected
all you need to do is find out which numbers is selected .when the user changes the dropdown then loops through that numbers creating two input-field for each iterator

1157593
oracle	mysql
the best way is to write a procedure which pull information from the metadata of the db oracle - all_tables mysql - information_schema.tables and run the count query

1157605
value	field
in scala according to the uniform access principles clients read and write field value as if they are publicly accessible even though in some case they are actually calling methods

1157651
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
off the top of my head that include perl php python and java but not javascript

1157651
contains	any
another nice thing is that you don t have to know anything about the tokens except that they start with slashes and don t contains any square brackets

1157651
contains	any
by the way this regex contains a lookbehind that can match any numbers of characters

1157675
exception-handling	try-catch
then you can log exception-handling in the try-catch blocks and you can subscribe to currentdomain_unhandledexception and application_threadexception to catch any unhandled exception-handling and log those using the logger

1157689
lookup	any
is there any way to make this lookup faster

1157693
textbox	button
this dropdown button should have an arrow points downwards and the search textbox next to it

1157736
ruby-on-rails	django
django people it s easy to add ajax support on django but an abstraction like in ruby-on-rails still makes it quite worth it i reckon

1157736
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
as the current python is faster than the current ruby 1.8 that makes django itself way faster than ruby-on-rails there s alot of benchmarking about this on the web

1157736
ruby-on-rails	django
some people might not agree for me as they can find workaround to use ruby-on-rails as website and django as web application

1157740
any	set
if you do not know checked for which arrays do not have any elements in them and set breakpoints before using the function objectatindex xyz

1157746
debugging	trace
i haven t yet found a way to debugging or trace through j-link applications something that i need to do to understand the sample applications

1157749
difference	factors
here s what i m getting at if i were to recording the two signalss over a long period of time and then artificially slow down or stretch out the high speed blue signals by a factors of 16 9 it would have the exact same frequency as the lower speed red signals and the two signalss would have some measurable phase difference the time difference between a red signals interrupt and a blue signals interrupt

1157753
subtraction	time	multiplication	subtraction
multiplication by 255 results in a subtraction of 1 -- every time

1157753
difference	zero
as the ratio 255 256 is very close to one the only difference this makes is an off by one the value you get is the expected value minus one -- except if you expected zero in which case the result is correct

1157762
order	add
this query will also work if you have multiple users with the same value unless you add a second column to order by you will not know which one you will get back though - but you will only get one row back per grouping

1157778
python	java
jpython is an implementation of the python programming language which is designed to run on the java tm platform

1157778

contains	elements
this means that notificationsgroup will contains the elements collections of notifications

1158099
authentication	login
retrieving the nativeobject causes a comexception-handling if anything whatsoever goes wrong for instances if the authentication failed the exception-handling is something like login failure unknown user named or bad passwd and if the ldap server is unreachable or timeout something like the server is not operational.

1158105
abstract-class	base-class
if that s the case you could call your class basetechnology base-class or abstractbuilding abstract-class or ianimal interface

1158114
sequences	unique
given two sequences how to get all the elements belonging to both the sequences or all the elements unique to one of them

1158121
directory	folder
it does not need to be copy-paste to inetpub wwwroot folder but it does need to be a virtual directory

1158134
subclassing	inherited
the answer is - inherited from std runtime_error or a similar std exception-handling subclassing

1158140
swing	swt
if you also want to have a rich client then you need to buser-interfacelding the user-interface in a technology you are not familiar with like swing or swt and design implements the communication mechanism

1158143
nested-class	inherited	protected	public
well i have a parent class with a nested-class declare in the protected tab with a protected class variable.in another unit i have a child class which inherited from the parent class..when i try to access something protected public from the parent class -it works but .when i try to access something protected from the nested-class it doesnt work

1158149
json	xml
your client can be made using swing assuming you are developing desktop or servlet + jsp assuming you are developing webapp and connect to your server by calling the rmi object json object xml that is exposed by the server

1158151
order	add
if your plugins does one thing add a menu item to order pizza it makes little sense to split it up you re just introducing complexity

1158158
text-editor	editor
i think the best way to do is to put a control through dialog editor on a dialog set it s visual styles to the ones of your choice and then open the .rc file in a text-editor and copy the styles of that control from there

1158161
swt	rcp
other desktop libs eg netbeans rcp eclipse swt are more modern but have other idiosyncrasies

1158173
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
but that won t work on oracle mysql postgresql or ibm db2 of course.....

1158181
linked-list	arrays

1158181
linked-list	arrays
create a linked-list from the reversed arrays

1158210
artifactory	nexus
the simplest way to do this is to use a repository manager like nexus or artifactory which will both manage the metadata for you

1158211
vbscript	vba
as i said in my comment vbscript is very much like vba but the downside is that there s no strong-typing .so you don t get intellisense etc

1158214
http	ssl
the future project makes it very easy to redirect automatically to an ssl page with but it doesnt seem to make it easy to get out of this context and automatically redirect back to http

1158218
linked-list	nodes
you could use a recursion that accepts a linked-list and inverts it by calling itself with two halves of the linked-list where if the input is just two nodes it inverts them

1158247
implements	abstract
look at java.util.hashmap and java.util.map i understand you are looking for a dictionary equivalent in java and not referring to the abstract dictionary class which is implements by hashtable

1158281

1158317
terracotta	hazelcast
use another high-level framework like terracotta or hazelcast

1158317
communication	messages
.when the amount of communication between the nodes increases 1000s of messages per second and or messages up to 100kb etc

1158326

it gives you automatic service-discovery service leasing and downloadable proxy .so that the actual client-server communication-protocol is up to you and not enforced by the framework you can choose http rmi whatever

1158350
lookup	any
you should be able to use perfmon to get the cpu use of any process by id - just lookup the use for your process id

1158353
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i d suggest looking in the help of fogbugz itself specifically fogbugz in two minutes and the basic of bug-tracking sections

perl	lua	perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	lua	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
i know that there is lua which is popular in game dev and languages like python perl php or ruby which seem to be more targeted as stand-alone applications but my knowledge in the deep architecture does not allow more educated guesses tagged lua and python because they would be my favorites but as long as it runs on x86 windows linux and mac os x i m open for other scripting languages as long as they are easy to implements into a c application

1158406
revision	svn
in the past i was using something like the idea you are describing fetching the svn log between last revision pushed to production and head analysing every line and in the end calculating what to send to the server

1158408
python	ruby
python and ruby are usually interpreter

1158415
constructor	object
the logic behind that is the following the constructor is a methods that transforms a chunks of memory into a valid object

1158442
protected	public
i fixed it by making the child entity a protected rather than a public properties on the parent entity

1158450
constructor	object
it is not recommended another way because if the constructor returns without erros it means you have construct an object correctly and you can use it anywhere

1158462
internet-explorer	firefox
is add code to serialization the return object then display it as xml using internet-explorer or firefox both of which show nicely formatted xml

1158468
exception-handling	try-catch
but if you find that callers are all surrounding the construction with try-catch then you can provide the static helpers function in 3 as well since with a bit of preparation the exception-handling can be made impossible

1158476
one-to-many	entity
i have entity user with one-to-many relationship to usertousercategories

1158478
gridview	listview

keyboard	mouse
though the callback for mouse and keyboard do simplify things i never timed it but glut always felt a little slower than using opengl through interop

1158553
keyboard	mouse	glfw	glut	freeglut	glfw	freeglut	glut
it also has nice .net binding for freeglut and glfw a glut alternative which offers mouse and keyboard callback too

1158554
execution	exit
entry and exit coverage which finds how many functions c++ java or procedure pascal were execution from the beginning to the end

1158567
highlight	selected
i believe that the ie developer toolbar is also using something like outline under the hood .when highlight elements for inspector in selected mode

1158580

web-config	app-config
one of the things that you can add to the application without having to add a reference to it into the code is a custom trace listener by writing something like this into the web-config or app-config

1158657
constructor	object
personally i would lean towards validation the arguments before constructing the time object something like timbo s answer and i would then have an assert in the constructor to verify that they arguments are valid

1158671
input-field	checkbox
what i am trying to accomplish is to have checkbox labels display after checkbox input-field to the right of them

1158681

1158697
handler	service
first i tried to fill the data in a raw way .so created mxml tag for http service and added handler

1158713
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
calling dispose on the sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader object which is what the using block does .when it exit closes them correctly

1158713
error-handling	try-catch
the downside to this approach is that if you need error-handling using a try-catch you have to either wrap it around the whole methods body or use several of them to handle connection errors differently from reading errors etc.

1158737
value	field	hide	show
how do i show or hide context menu items based on conditional for example some item field value true or false

1158764
any	set
you can set to any value you like and it s completely unrelated to javascript s this

1158766
json	xml	yaml	ini
as a general serialization format that s both human-readable and human writable has excellent python support and well any language support really you might want to consider using yaml or json over ini files or xml

1158769
put	get
i ve found that putting the classloader switching code the first block as a static-block in your test case it will get loaded before hibernate but that depending on your unit test structure you may also need to put the same code in other places yuck

1158771
python	lua
it supports python and lua your preferences and many other languages

1158773
perl	awk

1158833
gethashcode	equals
i think you need to overrides equals and gethashcode on comment

1158833
gethashcode	equals
note if you defined an iset of composite elements it is very important to implements equals and gethashcode correctly

1158833
gethashcode	equals
and an example of implements equals gethashcode

1158846
conditional	operators
operators means if conditional then result else other_result all in one line

xlsx	xls
also the new apache-poi versioning support almost seemless both xls and xlsx at the same time

1158951
nsmutablestring	nsstring

selected	listbox
the tabcontrol is to display tabs for the items that are selected in the listbox .so that the tabs come and go as the selection changes

1159048
implements	final
the final solution i found after some refactoring is to implements variant b but to pass a visitor instead of the result collections

1159063
hidden-field	input-field
you could have the value of the input-field copy-paste to a hidden-field whenever focus leaves the input-field which should do what you want

1159068
alter-column	alter-table
shahkalpesh s answer is fine if your database engine supports alter-table alter-column

typically you d have a private protected constructor and a public static factory-method to create the time object

1159198
caanimation	uiview
i did the exact same thing now with caanimation rather than using an simple uiview animation block

1159200
contains	any
this probably is a silly idea - but if you re stuck with the html that is you can t edit it but you do have the ability to apply any javascript on the page - why not simply reading the data that the table contains to memory that is convert it to some javascript data structure then just remove the original table using javascript and then using it create any html that suits your needs

1159207
32-bit	64bit	environment	building
i ll assume you already have vc++ 2005 express and the psdk install and activated the win32 application building in vc++ and running 64bit windows well it maybe works in 32-bit windows too but the exe will not run in that environment

1159207
windows-server	windows-xp	environment	building
1 start - all programs - microsoft platform sdk for windows-server 2003 sp1 - windows-xp 64bit building environment - set windows-xp x64 building environment debugging retail - doesn t mather which one at this moment

1159207
environment	building
2 start the vc++ 2005 express ide run the vcexpress.exe file with the useenv swich your install dir of vc++ 2005 express common7 ide vcexpress.exe useenv this will clear out all default bin .lib include-path and add only those that the set windows-xp x64 building environment debugging retail batch-file sets for you

1159210
arrays	loops
how can i get it to successfully loops through the arrays and display the next item s messages in the cell one after the other

1159217

superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
ensure that your subclassing are substitutable for the superclass and that they add some significant appropriate functionality besides otherwise don t use inherited

1159271
common-lisp	scheme
not even all scheme interpreter implements them and i m not aware of any common-lisp that does

1159289

with relational dbs you follow links of a predetermined depth a fixed numbers of join between sets with results progressively filtering and grouping while graphing are usually navigated to arbitrary and recursively-defined depth not a predetermined numbers of join

1159314
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox 3.5 now supports the nth- pseudo-class which was what i was using to target my css for safari and google-chrome

1159315
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
there is no need to have a loops here - what you want to do is to use the index of the table cell and get the corresponding elements of your arrays it is unclear are you using an arrays or a dictionary

1159322
common-lisp	scheme
it has much better support for new learners and you won t have to translation from scheme to common-lisp

1159339
dictionary	arrays
we use that to grab the corresponding story dictionary from your arrays

1159384
contains	any
parts and parts category tables contains half a million recording each .so any gain would be great

1159413
joomla	drupal
i m planning to make it available to everyone just like drupal and joomla

it s the nature of environment configuration

1159513
jndi	jdbc
create a dbconnectionstring resource named in a properties-file that points to jndi jdbc myproject resources dbconnectionstring and make sure all environment declare that same resource

1159513
environment	building
you will be defeating the purpose of trying to eliminate manual intervention because then you ve added an indirection step that will need a code change to points the code to the correct resource named and building to package the changes into your .war file .when moving between environment

1159513
environment	building
this way we could have database connection strings for the dev test prod database preconfigured and not have to checkout in the properties file each time we wanted to building for a different environment

1159514
administration	account
the account running the code will need administration permissions on the target computer inorder to interact with the service

1159514
credentials	account
i ve only used this in a fairly tightly-controlled situation running from a user account with the same credentials on the source target machines but in my experience all operations work as expected

1159548
mousedown	mouseup
is there a way javascript can detection click or mousedown mouseup that happen on flash object

1159548
mousedown	mouseup
attaching the mouseup mousedown and click events to the flash object using attachevent addeventlistener

1159576
export	csv
my application has a function which can export some data to a csv file and then copy-paste to pc

1159591
any	set
your versioning approach sounds fine providing your locking provisions ensure in all cases that a set of revision for nodes at any time-t represent an integral state of the graphing

1159613
common-lisp	lisp
common-lisp does not support tco in its standards because of unclear integration with the rest of the language not all computer architectures support it directly think jvm not all compilers support it some lisp machine it makes some debugging tracing stepping harder ...

1159613
arguments	default
for use with sicp i would recommend sbcl since it compiles always by default has tco support by default and the compiler catches a lot of coding problems undeclared variables wrong arguments lists a bunch of types errors ...

1159613
sbcl	ccl
now you should use sbcl ccl allegro cl or lispworks

1159613
scheme	let
let s defined scheme named for some functions

1159635
websphere	ibm
i m running java-server faces on a ibm websphere 6.1

if it were the case that wss sp2 required .net 3.5 i m pretty sure that both the documentation would reflect this and the install would checked for this requirement as well

1159658
web-services	api
the api will be used in web-services and a client application

1159658
web-services	api
we have currently looked at hdf5 and found the api is horribly lacking in the .net arena cannot do web-services but has size speed we are looking for

1159673
pascal	basic
the only downside is that if you need to write custom scripting within the install eg verifying serial numbers etc then you need to have a basic knowledge of pascal

1159691
export	csv
export to a csv file is typically not very difficult

1159691
export	csv
to export data to a csv file do the following pseudocode

1159746
substring	ends-with
if it ends-with the substring you want to get rid of use the above

1159753
constructor	object
i known that typename type2 was unnecessary but i need a way to pass a class object that have a constructor with parameter like class a to the templates

1159760
administration	enterprise

1159766
output	mode
they also appear in the visual-studio output windows .when in debugging mode

1159772
key-value	key
ref is used if the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key or if the key is not a primary key or unique-index in other words if the join cannot selected a single row based on the key-value

1159789
boost	stl
you can use boost reference_wrapper to store references in stl containers

1159792
binary-tree	tree
if binary-tree balanced tree format isn t too much effort you could look into storing it in newick format

1159792
linked-list	dictionary	binary-tree	linked-list
obviously being a binary-tree it s very fast to query though again probably no faster than a dictionary from a json object however it has no linked-list styles hierachy object graphing to worry about

1159797
constructor	object
the constructor of this types allows one-time initialisation of the object list

1159797
any	set
following the pattern set forth by libs types such as arraylist which can be initializer from any collections but not an iterable would lead me to use

1159807
declarative	imperative
i suppose my ultimate question is this fundamentally is t-sql a declarative a procedural or an imperative language

1159810
aggregate	grouping
grouping by the customer id and the year and date components of the date and use the max aggregate to get the latest date from each grouping

1159817
debugging	trace
also note that debugging.write will only function if the debugging building flag is set while trace.write will only function if the trace building flag is set

1159817
debugging	trace
setting the debugging and or trace flags is easily done in the project properties in visual-studio or by supplying the following arguments to csc.exe

1159829
hotmail	gmail
most email clients have problems reading css in html email including gmail and hotmail

1159837
exception-handling	try-catch
these test methods are always execute in a try-catch block where every types of exception-handling is treated and depending on the exception-handling the framework takes the appropriate step

i m having trouble writing an xpath expression to selected nodes that contains certain elementss while excluding siblings of this elements that i m not interested in

1159857
show	next
to display tools â options â debugging checked the box next to tools â options â show all settings

1159878
sql-server	oracle
this will also happen with a single connection to a resource manager that doesn t support lightweight transactional such as sql-server 7 2000 oracle and other rdbmss

1159904
any	set
unfortunately i have never set this up only seen it used .so i can t offer any details on how to implements it

1159914
contains	set
if the other cell contains textbox as well you will need to find them and set their text value

1159932
value	field
flexibility to report on value for single user across all users 1 field many field is very important -- data-visualization most will be chronologically based all photos for july 2009 for all users

1159932
value	field
value_type - varchar - used to determine what field in the value table will be filled in if int then value of this field will submit data into the value.type_int field - and all other .type_x field will be null

1159932
value	field
i understand that this approach will mean recording in the value table will only have 1 piece of data with other .type_x field contains null s.

1159961
authentication	login
things like user authentication having the user only have to login once etc

1159972
constructor	object
the advantage of this approach is that you can use your caching with object that have different numbers of arguments to their constructor

1159979
icefaces	liferay
i had a lot of experience with portlets in conjunction with ajax jsf icefaces and liferay portal and i wouldn t recommend them to anyone - everything looks good .when reading tutorial and real hell in practice

the recommended way to add styles to a html elements is by assign it a class a identifier that can be repeated on the document or a id a unique identifier that shall not be repeated in the document

1160045
value	field
in testing i found that gettypes will return the proper types even if the currently-loaded assembly s versioning does not match the value in the assembly-qualified named s versioning field

1160053
cvs	git
administrating clearcase beast is far from obvious or lightweight in difference to other scm-systems like cvs subversion or git

1160089
uinavigationbar	uitabbaritem
within each i have a uinavigationbar a uiviewcontroller and a uitabbaritem in that order

1160102
arrays	loops
the reason you can use them in for-each loops is because sun added in some syntatic sugar for arrays it s a special case

1160115
subroutine	scoping
to either the subroutine themselves or the contains scoping a program or another module

1160119
revision	winmerge
if you really need to do this then checkout each revision not single-file commit from clearcase and then manually copy the files over a new svn-checkout using a tool like winmerge to make sure all file adds and deletions are copy-paste over as well as changes

1160119
revision	svn
if this is too much manual work due to the numbers of clearcase commit although you could probably automate this without too much difficulty then consider just committing major revision to svn points release manually

1160119
revision	svn
if that is not feasible then consider not bringing over any revision history from clearcase - just start fresh with svn

1160120
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if you don t want to use the http api then abstraction apis are available in multiple-languages - ruby python perl and others

1160140
highlight	selected
in netbeans selected highlight the project that contains the zipfile

the simplest way to avoid this problem is to checked if you are in postback before setting the value of your hidden field

1160160
children	tree	children	nodes
i have several different types of tree nodes each of which may have anywhere from 0 to 5 children

1160171
arrays	loops
how do i loops through the arrays .so i can t printing them back out

1160175
loading	gif
ajaxload - ajax loading gif generator

1160181
contains	elements
you could create a function contains a for-loop which adds the elements to a multidimensional-array and call that function again until the tree is complete

1160184
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked the application in latest versioning of ie firefox and google-chrome running flash 10 and i ve also fired up a virtual-machine to test it out in ie 7 with various release of flash 9 instead of flash 10

1160189
calayer	uiview
uiview to act as responder contains a calayer tree that include the image from a file

1160189
transparency	frame
it made it easy to make the frame transparency leaving only the vehicle image

32-bit	64bit
this problem will occur .when running in 64bit mode with the 32-bit oracle client components install

1160243
updating	updates
this makes sense to me - i don t see how sql-server could determine what rows need updating .when other rows change for any function that could be implements without the process of updates being horribly inefficient

1160246
value	field
edit re-read your question profit isn t a field but you might want to populate a table with your profit value instead of re-calculating it each time

1160251
triggers	insert
is there anyway to be able to access xml text columns from the deleted and insert tables in a triggers

1160262
contains	any
of course you have to be careful to put quotes around value that already contains a comma and to then escape any quotes in the value

1160272
arrays	loops
the second pass will just simply loops over the arrays created in the first pass and display them after it has been properly sorted and escaped for output

1160290
oracle	mysql
mysql s describe table oracle s user_tab_columns table etc.

1160294
kdevelop	kde
kdevelop is bounded to particular kde i believe because kde api and can not be replace if required

1160299
attributes	properties
i thought supplying a different messagesname properties on the webmethods attributes would fix this problem but here is the entire error messages i get

1160322
temporary	copy
after you ve validation the certificate you can copy the .so or .dylib to a random temporary location and then verify that the copy-paste .so or .dylib has the given checked sum

to keep this usually the rt tasks have very limited access to the hardware or there are minimal arbitrations at very low-level

1160347
grouping	sorting
using sql-server 2000 i ve done what you suggest prefixing object with a grouping code and sorting

1160362
udp	tcp
stack doesn t need all sorts of bells whistles doesn t need ipv6 and i don t need any stuff on top of it webserver ftp servers etc.. in fact it s possible that i ll only use udp although i can envision a couple scenarios where tcp would be preferable

1160375
arrays	loops
if you want to format the data in the arrays just loops through it and use regex to remove the underscores.

1160388
any	set
.so the set stuff above + any blank line cause the difference

1160417
subclassing	inherited
although if you have a lot of columns that are only used by one subclassing sti probably isn t the best inherited model to use

1160436
input-field	checkbox
the disabled pseduo class only works with input-field like text radio checkbox etc

1160442
attributes	properties
webcontrol implements the attributes properties like this

1160448
32-bit	64bit
is there any way to detection a 64bit java install in a 32-bit environment

1160448
deployment	install
the java deployment toolkit detection nothing but i was wondering if there was some secret browser way of detection the 64bit install client-side

1160459
oracle	mysql
consider the query it runs on both oracle and mysql

1160465
build-process	release
i ve seen problems like this addressed by having a set of headers in module b that get copy-paste over to the release directory along with the .lib as part of the build-process

1160482
domain-object	repository
there are two things that i will pass into a repository or more likely service depending upon what the purpose of the call is - either a set of parameters like you give in your second example or as a construct domain-object if applicable

1160518
internet-explorer	firefox
works with internet-explorer 6 7 8 and firefox 2 and 3

1160532
scala	java
if you re concerned about scala performance it s good to be familiar with 1 how java bytecode performs and 2 how scala translation to java bytecode

1160545
getter	setter
synthesize will generator getter and setter methods for your properties

1160545
getter	setter
dynamic just tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are implements not by the class itself but somewhere else like the superclass or will be provided at runtime

1160545
subclassing	superclass
uses for dynamic are with subclassing of nsmanagedobject coredata or .when you want to create an outlet for a properties defined by a superclass that was not defined as an outlet

1160548
implements	extends
public class foo extends java.lang.object implements scala.scalaobject

1160548

directory	folder
we have our web-services in another folder in our virtual directory .so i tried adding a web-config that did a clear on the namespaces but that did not appear to work

1160557
binary-tree	tree
it is effectively a reverse inorder descent of a binary-tree o log n except at each step you need to find the top of the tree o n

1160567
sql-server	mysql
one more not sure if supported with mysql though - works in sql-server

1160569
jdom	xom	dom4j	jdom	dom4j	xom
i would suggest something like tag-soup for java which fires off nice sax events which you can use directly or using an xml module of your choice raw dom jdom dom4j xom etc...

1160569
python	ruby
the tag-soup page also lists a numbers of references for other languages suck as beautifulsoup for python rubyful soup for ruby and others

1160577
telnet	ftp
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

1160580
directory	folder
the only thing i had to modify is that i couldn t fing the .dll in the directory it says on the pdf i downloading the openoffice.org sdk and there they are in the basis sdk cli located in the folder created by the openoffice.org under the program files

1160603
scrollable	panels
apart from the appearance panels is scrollable whereas groupbox isn t and groupbox has a caption whereas a panels doesn t

1160614
put	get
the callback appears to be trying to get the nowtime field and put it in a control on the page

1160615
versioning	upgrade
e the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is n

1160620
device-orientation	portrait
this works as long as .when the program is launchd the device-orientation is portrait but not if the initial orientation is landscape or upside down because self dorotationstuff makes changes relative to the difference from the previous orientation

1160634
append	input
-a --append append standards input to the selection

1160634
append	input
-f --follow append to selection as standards input grows

1160635
placeholder	required
edit i mean if you really need to replace those placholder value write code in your service to determine .when someone does a get implying viewing from a browser and play with the response changing the placeholder value to whatever you required

1160639
data-access	ado.net
i m looking for answers or reasons why ado.net is better than ado with regards to data-access .when it comes to windows forms applications

1160669
jquery	.post
i want to know -- is it possible to do the .post via jquery and still get the same behavior

1160671
domdocument	domxpath
another probably better way would be using domdocument loadhtml on the html content loaded from your file the output of file_get_contents and work with the methods of domdocument and why not domxpath

1160673
data-access	ado.net
ado.net is a modern toolset for data-access

1160673
entity-framework	data-access
in particular linq-to-sql and the entity-framework take data-access to new height

1160679
tcp-ip	tcp
without doing some serious tcp-ip mungling you can t expose two applications on the same tcp ports on the same ip-address

1160707
queue	fifo
this isnt really correct but i thought of an waiting room it actually isnt a queue with a certain scheduling as fifo hrrn or such

1160720
mongodb	mysql
i m interested in sending all ruby-on-rails application logging to a database mysql or mongodb either in addition to or instead of to a logfile

1160735
base-class	metaclass
you could probably use a base-class or metaclass to generalize this but i haven t bothered with that yet

1160739
stderr	stdout
are you handling the spawned process stdout stderr properly

1160756
getter	setter
there is another subtlety not yet mentioned synthesize will let you provide an implementation yourself of either a getter or a setter

1160756
getter	setter
this is useful if you only want to implements the getter for some extra logic but let the compiler generator the setter which for object is usually a bit more complex to write yourself

1160756
value	field
if the value is being produce by something else calculated from other field then you have to use dynamic

1160759
margins	padding
right now i have just some margins padding background colour and fonts styling set for the h1 h2 h3 etc tags

1160761
versioning	upgrade
how do we upgrade our svn from versioning 1.4.4 to versioning 1.6

1160768
assign	add
then for every recording in your urls table you lookup the domain in your temp table assign that recording the numbers stored there and add a large numbers to that temp table s numbers

1160770
silverlight	xbap
what i m not clear about is what features and or niceties are either present or lacking in xbap and silverlight applications

1160770
silverlight	wpf	silverlight	xbap
i know for a fact that wpf is robust enough to be used in full-scale business applications but what about xbap and silverlight

1160800
unsafe	out
this turned out to be a problem because among other things it meant embedding a login iframe in a windows was unsafe because then a malicious site could replace the login iframe with a spoofed versioning

1160849
machine-code	disassembly
if that s not enough debuggers can also show you the a disassembly versioning of the machine-code along with the processor s registers

1160875
any	set
isloaded true if the contentpane has data in it either specified during initialization via href or inline content or set via attr content ... attr href ... false if it doesn t have any content or if contentpane is still in the process of downloading href

1160880
hide	show
click hide the first menu item that was open the second show the second menu

1160895

duplicates	elements
i m currently enumerating through nsmutablearray or nsmutableset elements to find duplicates and remove them

1160908
silverlight	wpf
wintellect wrote a good comparison between silverlight and wpf published here

1160908
silverlight	wpf
from personal experience in wpf and silverlight i ve found that sl is fully capable for lob apps

1160922
keyboard	mouse
i have tried setting a breakpoints within the beforecollapse event but it not triggers unless the user explicit collapse the nodes via the mouse or keyboard

1160929
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	set	contains	elements
a set never contains duplicates elements .so simply creating an nsmutableset should guarantee uniqueness of value

1160934
any	set
option explicit is set elsewhere in the file to avoid any confusion from typos

1160935
value	field
note i am assuming dt as the datetime field value as the weight field

1160946
hide	show
i am using jquery to show hide lists but it takes two click on a link instead of just one to show the list

1160950
variables	boolean
the most practical way of doing this would be to add 4 boolean variables lets call them a1fired a2fired b1fires and b2fires

1160961
exception-handling	try-catch
perhaps wrapping the submitchanges call in a try-catch block will indicate any exception-handling that have occurred

1160987
arrays	map
the thing is that map call your mysub in arrays context checked what wantarrays gives you from this sub

1160993
fwrite	fopen
you don t need to do any fopen fwrite stuff to save your image

1161002
any	set
.when i run the set up apache-tomcat-6.0.20.exe for windows-xp i get the messages from the tomcat setup as failed to install tomcat6 service checked your settings and permissions .i have the permissions.the only thing i think that is different from the setup needs is the jre versioning.but the tomcat-preconfigured-6.0.18.zip downloading from coreservlets.com works fine with the j2se 6 jre.the setup always stops .when the setup dialog box display the messages using jvm c program files java jre bin client jvm.dll .there is no any other service or another versioning of tomcat install even as a service

1161004
exception-handling	try-catch
more specifically what if the exception-handling is throw inside catch block of an try-catch clause

1161031
implements	abstract
the problem is that the f# compiler wants me to implements the abstract members

1161038
internet-explorer	firefox
in windows on internet-explorer of firefox ctrl + f5

1161089
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	listbox	selected	button	listbox	textbox
.when the user selected a item from the listbox and click the edit button a user-controls with the details of that item is display with the various properties bound to textbox

1161094
swing	swt
both of them based on the notion of changing bean properties value which would work for swt or swing

1161101
web-applications	security
i am trying to use fortify source code analyzer for a research project at my school to test the security for open source java web-applications

1161111

it will also need to create multiple recording in the new exclusion table one for each of the comma separate value after the exclude key words in the availability string

1161128
python	ruby
write simple scripting in ruby python basic to read data from the source parsing it and put into destination database

1161131
windows-xp	windows
this didn t work on both windows 7 and windows-xp on 2 different machine + 1 virtual-pc vmware-workstation

1161133
rollback	commit
you could bind to a copy of the real collections and then only commit the changes on an ok click or you could rework your data object to allow transacted changes whereby you can call commit or rollback depending on the dialog result

1161146
exception-handling	try-catch
you should not write any code in a catch block that could throw another exception-handling but if you need to you could nest another try-catch block around it

1161147
groovy	java
i am trying to get jaxb to work with a groovy class of mine however it appears it doesn t work but the java versioning does

1161148
selected	button
the sound plays once but then the second time i selected the button it stops the sound the third time starts the sound up again

1161186
crypt	salt
crypt is not a reversible algorithm it uses a one-way function which is rendering more difficult to brute force by the addition of salt to the encrypted value

1161207
click	mouse
how do i simulate a mouse click there .so i can continue loading and parsing pages

1161217
value	field
are you setting the value of the id field in the line

1161225
contains	elements
that is i would like one xml document to contains an elements whose value points to the primary key or something similar maybe the root nodes

1161235
template-engine	velocity
use a template-engine something like velocity to execute a preprocessor step

1161235
environment	building
your building scripting could run the templates applying properties from the building environment to output java source code that is ultimately compiled

1161237
key-value	key
you could store your code a dictionary key-value .so that the key is the named of the methods and the value is the string of the function

1161250
llvm	gcc
i dont know about mips i tried arm and llvm code was around 10-20 slower than the current gcc

1161250
llvm	gcc
interesting test between gcc and llvm clang for mips

1161250
llvm	gcc
the difference between the llvm and gcc produced code is the instructions being placed in the branch defer slot

1161266
jtable	jlist
personally i implements them .when i m going to use object in a jlist jtable or other structure that uses tostring or .when i m debuggingging yes eclipse has debugging formatter but tostring is easier

1161273
typename	typedef
typedef typename c iterator c_iterator

1161277
crypt	salt
the way that the crypt is salt will pretty much guarantee that what you re trying to do isn t going to work

1161280
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve tried handling mouseenter and mouseleave on the parent and both child controls but this means the action begins and ends multiple time as the mouse move across the control

1161281
propertygrid	treeview
i m working on extends the errorprovider to the propertygrid and treeview controls

1161291
put	get
doesn t work - osx you need to put quotes around the otherwise you ll often get bizarre error messages because it can t cope with spaces in file named

1161301
textbox	button
for example if i have a social security textbox and wanted to encrypt it and ship it off to another server i would do that through a hidden server scripting after posting back to the current page via a submit button or something of the sort

1161306
versioning	upgrade
i said continue thinking that the server versioning would be upgrade as well to support the latest versioning

1161306
downgrade	upgrade	versioning	upgrade	versioning	downgrade
it turned out that the server versioning won t be upgrade for some time from now and what that means is that i have to somehow downgrade my local crystal-reports versioning to a lower versioning

1161306
versioning	downgrade
would appreciate if someone can points me to the right directions on how to safely downgrade the crystal-reports 2008 versioning to a lower versioning

1161322
put	get
if you want to get really paranoid put the time of first request into the viewstate and refuse to use the viewstate after x minutes

1161340
python	java	python	perl
there are several different web-services -- various technologies used such as java .net python perl and possibly more in the future -- belonging to different organization and the access to those web-services has to be restrict

1161346
decompression	tar
tar files are stored header file header file and the compression is on top of that .so it s possible to decompression as the file it s downloading and use the files as they become available

1161346
linux	osx
you can create gzipped tar files easily in windows using winrar commercial or 7-zip free and on linux osx and cygwin use the tar cmd

1161387
children	nodes
essentially it boils down to a trick with bit-manipulation if a nodes has 5 children then there are 2 5 32 different possible subtrees as each child can independently be present or not present in a subtree

1161387
python	java	python	c++
the code would be a bit more verbose in java or c++ or whatever since i took advantage of python list comprehensions in a big way

1161389
triggers	insert
maybe creating a triggers in the db to run after a row insert that updates that row

1161401
directory	folder
put all shared assemblies into a .lib directory under your main trunk folder and reference them into your website from .lib

1161408
svnadmin	dump
you may get a more optimised repository structure if you dump out the contents with svnadmin dump create new blank repository svnadmin load the old dump

1161408
.when	ready
your clients can upgrade separately .when they re ready

1161417
crypt	salt
even then crypt 3 traditionally involves 25 rounds of des with slight modifications to the algorithm based on the salt .so you d expect it to be at least 25 time slower to brute-force

1161417
crypt	hash
newer implementation of crypt 3 are way beyond brute force since they re based on better hash algorithms than the des-based one that old crypt 3 used

1161426
subtract	time
if you need how long ago it was modified you would need some other javascript to subtract dlm from the current time

1161427
attributes	properties
example properties with attributes added

1161460
default-value	arguments
any parameter given a default-value is necessarily an optional arguments

1161462
silverlight	wpf
i ve heard rumors that the user-interface for windows-mobile 7.0 will be silverlight wpf based

1161465
contains	any
what i want to do is pretty simple given a pdf ps djvu file contains a paper book find the author and title of the paper any other metadata would be good but less needed

1161477
display	width
the problem occurs .when there is no data to be display in col1che or maybe even in any of them although i m not sure .when there is no data this span collapse and its width is not honored

1161503
contains	set
or is this a set of package that contains the actual data-mining algorithms

1161509
contains	elements
remember tbody thead and tfoot are subdivisions of table and must contains tr elements

1161515
account	api	myspace	twitter
also if you have an rpx plus pro account you can make simple rpx api call to set a user s status and .post activity on facebook and twitter myspace

1161518
arguments	default
cmd only supports either the oem codepages by default or utf-16 with the u arguments to cmd as output encoding

1161528
arrays	loops
a better option would be to include it inside a constructor loops through the arrays and assign its value to .so you can access it in any function of your class

1161549
json	xml
json is a light-weight data-interchange format think of it as xml on a diet

1161549
json	xml
basically any place where you can use xml for serializing data you can use json instead

1161553
associations	model
javax.datamining.associations this package contains java classes describing the settings and model for the associations mining function

1161561
selected	button
you can al.so add a shortcut button in any toolbar by right-cliking on the toolbar area selected customise and then dragging the relevant external tool link unfortunately vs refers to them as this .so you will have to figure out which one to choose to a toolbar

1161562
actionscript	mxml
if you extends the radio-button class in an actionscript class rather than an mxml file - is there a better way of saying that

1161562
radio-button	button
you ll want to add the textinput in the create children function the textfield itself is created in button s which radio-button subclassing createchildren methods

1161569
value	field
rows and nedstatusid has only 10 possible value then any restrictions on that field would always yield approx

1161571
json	xml
json is relatively light-weight data exchange format at least .when compared to xml or html and is most useful .when exchanging small amounts of data between a web client and a webserver service

1161576
domdocument	domxpath
.so far i have been using domdocument and domxpath to query for that nodes but i m hoping there is a better way that i am missing

1161580
stdin	pipe
i m using python subprocess module to interact with a program via the stdin and stdout pipe

1161591
display	width
display block will not help you here because .when float is activated the elements is automatically switched to block mode whatever its initial mode .so your width should work

1161594
owasp	xss
in fact refer a guide like the owasp xss prevention cheat sheet on the possible cases for usage of output encoding and input validation

1161594
user-input	output
ultimately a simple thumb rules will help - if you do not trust user-input enough or if you suspect that certain sources can result in xss attacks despite output encoding validation it against a whitelist

1161594
security	owasp	security	esapi	esapi	owasp
do take a look at the owasp esapi source code on how the output encoders and input validation are written in a security libs

1161606
worksheet	excel
i ve been trying to replace all # in a excel worksheet using a winform application.

1161630
quirks-mode	doctype
having the xml-declaration above the doctype forces ie6 into quirks-mode .so that explains why it s not working properly in ie6

1161631
interpolation	cosine
you can try to implements your own cosine interpolation which will keep local extremes because of its nature

1161655
firefox	safari
have tried in safari a couple versioning of firefox and ie7 and all look just the way that they are supposed to

1161673
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1161696
private	self
_prefixed_with_underscore_variables for private self variables attributes

1161698
tostring	equals
for example .when a field is added or removed tostring should be updates appropriately you should be doing this already for methods like hashcode and equals

1161700
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
it uses a clean well defined rest api using json as the transport for the data and there are also clients available for php python and perl which make it pretty easy to talk to the api

1161714
value	field
you could try to encrypt the ssn field value on the web browser by writing an encryption function in javascript and then sending the encrypted text in a hidden-field to the server but you have to pass the algotihm and any encryption key to the browser which means anyone listening in that could see the clear-text ssn could also see the encryption code and thus reverse any attempt you make to encrypt the ssn

1161716
blackberry	nokia
it s a plugins that automatically changes the ruby-on-rails format from html to mobile for nokia blackberry iphone and palm users

1161717
communication	messages
they both communication by passing messages

search-engine	seo
we are looking for some tips over a performance and search-engine optimisation seo technique

1161734
silverlight	wpf
i m writing an application silverlight and wpf using the mvvm pattern and the prism framework

1161747
arrays	loops
i found that built-in functions are much faster than loops .when process large arrays

1161760
value	field
you cannot just return a hash or an id you have to return uris or a uri templates plus the field value

1161766
key-value	key
something like a lightweight couchdb restful key-value etc where you just send it the key and it responds with appropriate value

1161787
parentheses	keyword
printing keyword with a left parentheses

1161793
order	join
i may be missing .something here but the only difference between left and right join is which order the .source tables were written in and .so having multiple left join or multiple right join is no different to having a mix

1161802
margins	padding
extra spaces around nav ie sometimes has default margins padding different from other browsers

1161810
scala	java	perl	c++	perl	ruby	python	java	python	c++	python	ruby	python	perl	erlang	python	erlang	perl	erlang	scala
ok .so i decided to learn python perl c++ java objective-c ruby and a bit of erlang and scala under my belt

1161817
selected	button
however what i have is a button on the page which .when click show the user what they have selected

1161817
selected	button
the problem is that .when the button is pressed the child gridview is hidden how do i if it has been selected display keep it open display

1161834
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
or is there a better way to achieve this with sphinx and thinking-sphinx

1161837
openfiledialog	winforms
it has an insert picture dialog that embed the openfiledialog onto another winforms dialog

1161838
assign	add
for the grid i use rendercontrol to get its html code and for the image i just add an img html tag and assign the url to its src

1161842
subtract	time
.when you subtract a datetime from another datetime the result is a timespan representing the amount of time between them

1161842
subtract	add
inorder to get the date you can use the add methods or the subtract methods overload of a datetime object that accepts a timespan

1161844
contains	set
what exactly do you have the asp files codepages set to both on the page contains the form and the page receiving the .post

1161865
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
tabcontrol is itemscontrol .so you shouldn t be shy to bind its items.source to listbox.selecteditems

1161868
any	set
if any parameters are output you will need to set them explicit

1161881
callback	methods
you can using asp.net-ajax callback to web methods placed in aspx pages

1161884
contact	submit
if you wish to defend the reputation for your taste of colours place a contact web master link which leads to a disclaimer saying your colour scheme is deliberate because you are forcing users to design and submit and vote on a colour scheme

1161887
double	int
what happens if i cast a double to an int but the value of the double is out of range

1161903
sql-server	oracle
for example with sql-server you can write your way clause .so that columns are in any order and indexes will get used but with oracle you end up having to specify the columns in the order they appear in the index inorder to get best performance with the index

1161906
json	xml
json is mostly used as a lightweight and more human-readable alternative to xml in ajax web apps

1161907
pascal	delphi
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

1161918
ddms	adb
you can get to the stack-trace via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

1161922
json	xml

1161989
order	join
to me this looks like something that someone did over time maybe even originally starting with inner-join realizing they wouldn t work and changing to outer join but not wanting to bother changing the order the tables were referenced in the query

1161989
order	join
you may also need to change the order of the join inorder to convert to all left join

1162113
crypt	hash
by design intent crypt is a one-way hash

1162113
crypt	salt
jeff had a blog .post on rainbow tables too . salt helps protect against rainbow tables because you would need a table set for each possible value of the salt but the size of the salt used in the classic implementation of crypt is only 12 bits .so that isn t as huge a block as might be hoped

1162411
python	c++
functional-programming ideas from functional-programming are increasingly finding their way into more mainstream languages like python c# linq lambda etc. and even c++ lambda in c++ 0x

1162441
forms-authentication	credentials
using the basic forms-authentication is almost perfect i set the auth mode to forms and have a short credentials section in web-config and use a simple login aspx page that uses formsauthentication.authenticate and formsauthentication.redirectfromloginpage

1162441
authentication	login
if a request comes from a certain ip-address i want to automatically authentication the request and not redirect that request to the login page

1162441
forms-authentication	credentials
my other option is to create my own httpmodule to do this but it seems if i do i lose the nice functionality of the forms-authentication methods and their integration with the credentials section

1162456
versioning	upgrade
right now whenever ruby-on-rails is updates and i upgrade the frozen versioning in my application by installing the new gem and refreezing it inorder to commit it into my repository i need to do two step first delete the old versioning and second add the new versioning

not exactly sure about your situation but we had a problem with a pop-up windows that also display a printing dialog box .when loaded

1162594
32-bit	64bit
because you must explicit specify the location but sizeof intptr is not a compile-time constants unlike c++ sizeof it is impossible to use pointer-sized members in explicit struct .when your assembly should be usable in both 32-bit and 64bit process

1162596
python	java
once at a safepoint the entire viewmodel has stopped with regard to java code much like the python viewmodel stops at the gil

1162630

this assembly could contains the exact same datacontract types that the server is using but could potentially contains a set of types intended solely for the use of the clients

1162635
reflection	runtime
however reflection since it s a runtime analysis of already compiled types required quite a bit of overhead

1162645
debian	linux
in fact most linux distributions are still on svn 1.5 e.g debian lenny

1162647
authentication	logout
as i ve said earlier if the authentication ticket in the cookies wasn t accepted by the server with no other information about the user then persistent cookiess would not work and no matter how often the user selected remember-me next time the server wouldn t remember them this is why i recommend that you don t rely on just the authentication state but also some value in the session which wouldn t exist for the fiddler request after logout because the server will have destroy that information

1162655

it can also affect the performance of evaluation expression in the debugger for the same reasons

1162776
value	field
problem is that the recording is added but with no value in the appropriate field

1162777

this is the results from a different aix 5.3 machine the only difference i can see is that it is running dbd oracle 1.22 and dbi 1.607

1162845
dbd	dbi
any ideas for further things i can try other than upgrading dbd oracle and dbi hesitent to do that straight away as this is a production machine

1162850
fflush	stdout
the real issue seems to be that if a process doesn t explicit fflush its stdout then anything written to stdout is buffering rather than actually sent until the process is done .so as to minimize io this is apparently an implementation detail of many c libs made .so that throughput is maximize through less frequent io

1162850
fflush	stdout
if you can easily modify the process .so that it fflush stdout regularly then that would be your .solution

1162855

it is good practice to set any pointers you are no longer interested in to nil

1162858
multiplication	division
i need to do calculations division or multiplication with very large numbers

1162861
children	tree	children	nodes

1162861
children	tree	children	nodes
put another way if 5 children is the maximum then some of the possible tree made of only 5-children nodes will have nodes that have for example two actual children and three null pointers

1162861
children	nodes
this is practically the same as having a nodes with only two children

1162876
vbscript	basic
and i create a visual basic exe or just a vbscript to be run from the shell with the following info

logout	login
the logout action clears the login session variables but on the next page the user is still logged in to my site but not facebook

1162881
logout	login
the user can logout of my site if he hits the logout link again .so i m thinking that .when he first tries to do this he gets a new login session on my site because facebook_client - get_loggedin_user is still returning .something

1162882

1163118
getter	setter
provide getter and setter functions for access to static file scoping variables in your module

1163135
.when	ready

it seems that even though the inkpresenter is closest to the user the mousedown mousemove mouseup events are received by the image elements

1163330
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseup
thus it would be the first to receive the mousedown mousemove mouseup events generator by the user however in this case the image receives them

1163341
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
maybe you help your scalability using nginx to serve directly from memcached but that s obviously not going to change the performance of php perl python ruby

1163341
postgresql	mysql
if you use mysql or postgresql you re still going to have to design your database correctly for scaling regardless of your .app language and any tool you use to start clustering mirroring is going to be outside of your .app

1163341
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
i think in terms of memory usage python with mod_wsgi daemons mode and ruby enterprise ruby with passenger mod_rack have pretty decent footprints at least comparable to php under fastcgi and probably better than php under mod_php apache mpm prefork + php in all the apache process sucks a lot of memory

1163346
spaces	output

i want to know how to do some operations on highlight line with v operators like providing tab to selected line comment those line etc

1163550
uilabel	uiview	instance-variables	local-variables
also removed view because it was gratuitous a uilabel is a uiview you were stack three view 2 of which have nothing but a single subviews which covers its full frame. and it elided the uiviewcontroller view properties in general it is bad to make local-variables with the same named as instance-variables or properties there are compiler-warnings you can turn on to avoid that

1163558
user-controls	ascx
the best alternative would probably be to create an ascx file or in other words a web user-controls

1163578
multiplication	division
this worked for me except i had to use floor to remove the fractions part of the division before the multiplication

1163578

set up an event handler on the click event of the header to change the styles of the div below to display block and ensuring that any other content s are hidden do this by using a css class on each content for example

1164544
margins	padding
having both outline and border should show you the effects of margins as well as padding

1164548

duplicates	elements
as pointed above best approach .when dealing with duplicates content inside the same domain is putting a canonical elements points to the preferred url

1164618
callback	methods
there are a few points to make here firstly you can get postback off controls that are dynamically generator .so long as you re-generate them with a consistent id at the start of the each postback event once you ve recreate them asp.net will re-connect the viewstate and whatnot and then triggers your callback methods after that

1164634
google-chrome	safari
worth mentioning that safari s javascript-engine is still faster than ffx s while google-chrome reigns supreme

1164810
python	java
i have a large existing codebase written in 100 java but i would like to use python for some new sections of it

1164810
python	java
i m aware of the jython project but it looks like this represents a way to use java and its libs from within python rather than the other way round - am i wrong about this

1164810
python	java
if not what would be the best methods to interface between java and python such that ideally i can call a methods in python and have the result returned to java

1164820
passenger	thin
if this is production use .something like passenger or thin .so that they re easy to stop the process or restart the servers

1164837
python	java
you can find information about embedding python in an existing java .app in the user guide

1164837
python	java
i recommend creating java interfaces to represent the operations that you plan to use along with separately-packaged implementation classes that wrap the python code

1164847
python	java
you can either call a command-line interpreter to run python code using jyton or use python code from java

1164865
put	get
put larger things in it and you ll get scrollbar

1164869
contentcontrol	itemscontrol

scriptaculous	jquery
there are plenty javascript frameworks you can use like jquery mootools prototype scriptaculous etc

1164902
.when	ready
it s mostly automated since all the vms grab their updates from our sus server and we know .when they have updates ready to go

1164906
updating	updates
i don t know of an automated solution for all of your viewmodels but i would recommend using windows-server updates service to keep tracking of the updates status of every viewmodel and provide a local windows-updates repository to speed up the updating process

1164916
value	field
i created a new wcf service that s a wrapper around that old web service -- the new service just wrap those methods and maybe updates the value of a few field but it exposes the exact same methods and returns the exact same types

1164942
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot do that in other browsers firefox google-chrome al.so .so even if you could do it in ie it would have been pointless

1164946

i d say you could get that up and running in a couple of hours - then you could put your feet up for a few more hours while it did its work -

1165028
contains	set
my resulting page does contains a foreach loops but since i m using a paginated set i m guessing using that numbers to fake a ranking numbers would not be the best approach

1165046
updating	updates
i would recommend updating slightly differently as your tblmailinglist user will not be valid to be updates in your repository

1165047
json	xml
in addition wcf service now offer more design flexibility by supporting architecture such as representational state transfer rest javascript object notation json and plain old xml pox encoding

1165048

1165085
python	java
these benchmarking also report the source code-size and python was significantly more concise than java and c#

1165105
ref	out
what is the difference between ref and out

1165125
ref	out
i should also add that unlike the very similar ref modifiers the compiler won t complain if the out parameter was never initializer

1165131
ref	out
ref parameters are passed both into and out of a methods

1165144
selected	textbox
alex one simplest option i can think of is that instead of having the textbox for the email-address in send document page you have a people picker control and and use that to fetch the email id of the selected user

1165155
exponential	inverse
human hearing is logarithmic .so you want an exponential function the inverse to apply to the linear output of your slider

1165180

for one i found out that the mips processor is 64bit and not 32-bit like i was initially told for the embedded device that i was targeting

1165180
32-bit	64bit
after a little research i saw that a grouping at n-ix was portsing mono to supports the mips 64bit architecture based off the 32-bit ports that was already done

1165218
put	get
if you really wanted to use nsscanner you could put something like that in a loops and keep checked for a no return-value and if you get that you can increment the scanlocation and scan again

1165220
value	field
i want to store those custom value in a mysql table but i don t want to create a field for each possible parameter

1165222
click	mouse

put	get
i disagree with this .so i thought i d put it to .some other developers to get a third party opinion

1165240
instances	private
the ms unit test assembly has privateobject and privatetypes which make access to private instances types members pretty straight forwarding

1165263
.when	ready
the idea is that most day to day development takes place in trunk and .when you need to temporary isolate changes for work on a major feature or spike you take a branch from trunk into branches which you can then merge back into trunk .when you are ready to integrated as well as being able to continue to merge ongoing changes from trunk into your feature branch

1165263
.when	ready
the tags folder is .so that you can both branch to a tag .when you are ready to take a snapshot of a particular versioning of your code as well as using this folder for building and deployment

1165263
environment	building	.when	ready
for building and deploy you create a branch from trunk to tags test and from tags test to tags production and then you merge your changes from trunk to tags test .when you are ready to promote your changes to the test environment

1165266
unsigned	zero
one clever way you could do it would be to insert zero between the components parsing into an unsigned long average the numbers convert back to a hex string remove the zero and finally parsing into an unsigned int

1165317
contains	elements

1165370
abstract-class	derived-class	derived-class	inherited
generally you should consider interfaces as contracts that some types implements and abstract-class as nodes in inherited hierarchy that don t exist by themselves there is an is a relationship between the derived-class and the base abstract-class

1165379
environment	building
human beings are creatures of habit and building efficient work methods memories and psychology based on environment and tasks we perform most often

1165383
put	get
if you put quotes around the elements named with a . you can get it

1165391
selected	listbox
but selected as either a listbox or combobox never really had much need for items spanning multiple line

1165397
arrays	loops
but i d prefer to use a foreach loops as some of the items returned are arrays and with the repeater i ll end up doing more

1165402
value	field
.when i create an instances of this class nowhere in the code do i specify the value of the enum field but it seems to default to the first item in the enumlist and not a null value is this how enums work

1165405
command-line	cmd
how can i run excel from command-line cmd scripting such that it doesn t prompt if i want to enable macros in the spreadsheet i am running it with

1165409
base-class	inherited
a base-class offers the opportunity to building an inherited tree where more complex classes of a common types are built on the foundation of a simpler base-classes

1165409
base-class	inherited
the classic and annoying example in oo is normally a base-class of shape and which is inherited by triangle square etc

1165409
base-class	inherited
the main points is that with an interface you need to provide the entire contract with every class that implements it with an inherited tree base-classes you are only changing adding the properties and methods that are unique to the child class common properties and methods remain in the base-class

1165410
haskell	lisp	haskell	python
maybe you could learn and switching to python haskell lisp etc

1165413
haskell	prolog	mercury	prolog
for example write something in haskell prolog mercury oz or factors

1165414
default-value	default
default-value for enum types is 0 which is by default the first elements in the enumerator

1165417
contains	set
set the month appropriately and now your filtering would contains the folder as well

1165444
lookup	any
you can start your enums at any value such as 1 but .when they represent a lookup value in a database you generally want them to match up

1165445
contains	any
if you put that route above your string route that doesn t contains the constraint for d+ then it ll filtering out any routes containss int and anything that doesn t have int will be passed through and your string route will pick it up

1165449
coordinate-systems	points
on the other hand if the two coordinate-systems have different origins but they are still not rotated with respect to one another we will need two sets of points x 1 y 1 u 1 v 1 and x 2 y 2 u 2 v 2

1165457
while-loop	for-loop
would it run fast if i change the most outer for-loop to while-loop

1165466
while-loop	for-loop
the only difference between a for-loop and a while-loop is the syntax for defining them

1165466
for-loop	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop
actually the for-loop is a little better because the i will be out of scoping after loops while the i will stick around in the while-loop case.

1165467
entity-relationship	er-diagram	entity-relationship	diagram	er-diagram	diagram
you should really consider your whole database structure and do a er-diagram entity-relationship diagram first

1165470
plugins	add-on
tfs 2008 does not include this functionality .so you ll have to re.sort to a plugins add-on

1165521
subtraction	time
this subtraction is just calculating almost 200x201 2 x 200-1 time and it is very little numbers for computer

1165522
callback	methods
its callback methods populate a page full of textfield with results from the calculation

1165522
any	set
my little mutex works as follows .when any of the events are fired i set a flag that means wait for the callback. any subsequent events that fire checked the flag before doing anything

1165541
order	join
rather than change the order of the join s in the from clause just to be able to use a left outer-join i would instead use a right outer-join and this would not bother me

1165557
python	java	python	php
currently i prefer to program in python but my job wants me to do shell scripting java javascript php and idl that s interactive data language not interface description language

1165563
hide	show
create a single instances of the tooltip and use it whenever you like to show it using the settooltip methods and use hide methods to hide it

1165590
contains	any
if you don t see any data then it means the field is-empty or contains only whitespace

1165594
for-loop	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop
even if the hypothesis of the while-loop being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are execute more time

1165609
hide	show
i would then hide all divs that don t have the selected class and show the div that does have the selected class

1165614
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
keep in mind that there are dangers to this including sql-injection as well as a hosts of other permissions problems that can arise since it s dynamic-sql but it s the only way to accomplish this in the database layer

1165621
32-bit	64bit
it might do .so in the 64bit jit but not the 32-bit versioning or vice versa - you get the idea

1165626
execute	prepare
there is prepare and execute which can run a sql statement from inside a user variables .so could probably use .something similar to untested

1165627
selected	button
in jquery i d like to selected all grouping of radio button where there are no button checked

1165627
radio-button	selected
or is there a way in which i can selected all radio-button grouping and iterate through the grouping

1165636
selection	highlight
however .when a user highlight a words and presses ctrl+b the selection s fonts weight is changed to bold but the button doesn t reflect the change since the richtextbox.selectionchanged event is not raised

1165658
annotations	mapping
if i checked the mapping output file i can see that my inner class that has the annotations and it s members are keeping their named unobfuscated

1165659
numeric	digits	digits	base
it s far too large and cpu intensive for regular 5 digits zip codes numeric decimal is stored as base 10 and required more process power and it doesn t properly store longer zip+4 codes which have a dash

1165665
gethashcode	equals
however one idea that comes to mind is to create a separate class to just represent the key and overrides its equals and gethashcode methods

1165665
gethashcode	equals
they would use the individual field using case-insensitive comparison in equals and xor ing the hashcode in gethashcode

1165673
sequences	unique
consider this using a standards issue sequences table of unique int value

1165674
h.264	mp4
it can only play back the two forms of flvs soresen spark and on2 v6 and h.264 video in a few different containers mp4 .mov that conform to some specific requirements

1165695
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_13-b03-211

1165700
google-chrome	firefox
.when i hardcode the fade works as expected in ie firefox and google-chrome

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i want to set mouseover and mouseout event for the image to disp the employee info in a pop-up box

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i need to write some jquery code for mouseover event to get the data from the action and code for mouseout to close pop-up box if it is showing on

1165733
processor	cpu
you need to have as many threads running as there are cpu cores available inorder to be able to potentially use all the processor time

1165751
oracle	mysql
we have a mysql oracle etl using informatica that works great for all statements except delete

1165752
build-process	release
for the next release we wanted to clean up the build-process and someone suggested migrating to builder

1165757
perl	awk
i ve been trying to find a way of sorting this with standards command-line tools bash awk sort whatever but can t find a way apart from using perl or similar

1165762
radio-button	selected
thru radio-button i am selected the data from gridview

1165762
selected	button
actually it should not happen at a time user can selected only one button which i could not do

1165762
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
my second problem is .when i am selected particular radio-button that details should be display in textbox

1165762
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
.so once i selected particular radio-button those details should be display in corresponding textbox

1165762
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
i have done the insert coding for this but couldn t do selected thru radio-button and dispalying in textbox

1165768
arrays	map
both arrays are 30x30 as determined by the height of the map

1165795
double	int
however .when you copy a value-type a struct like int or double a copy of the entire thing is made the value of a value-type is the thing itself

1165795
ref	out
however in both cases ref and out any changes made to a within the trysomething methods are persistent to a

1165795
ref	out
i think this covers all use-cases of out and ref

1165805
textbox	button
i have a form which has a input textbox and submit button

1165812
substance	nimbus
as a suggestion two very good looking and professional looking enough look and feels in my opinion are substance and also nimbus which will ship with later release of the jre as the default lnf at least that s the plan and which can be downloading separately from java.net

1165821
ubuntu	debian
how to building a debian ubuntu package from source

1165823
order	add
you can also add an order by to each sub-query to further tweak the value returned for the additional columns

1165829
swing	swt	look-and-feel	swt
i would recommend sticking to swing or swt and seeing what you can do with their look-and-feel mechanism but don t expect miracles

1165845
xsd	xml
i have generator an xsd file from an xml snippet using xsd.exe out

1165856
configuration	logging
the project is larger .so i would be interested in keeping the code required for logging into a logging configuration file

1165860
assign	add
i need it to checked if there is already an object with a properties to the one i m about to assign and then depending on which the properties is i either want to change one of its properties or still add a new object

1165890
duplicates	elements
hash match right semi join hash table2 and removes the duplicates elements from the hashtable while building it

1165896
stderr	stdout
i have seen this cause problems for example .delete_on_error rules donâ t always run if stderr is redirected to stdout

1165906
put	get
1 put all the win32 call used into function-pointers and pass them in to the functions or classes depending on how many time they are hit that use them and use this to get mock results

1165918
digits	base
two binary digitss allow you to write a single quaternary base-4 digits which is the first base higher than or equals to 3

1165919
inherited	accessor
because ichild only inherited from iparent it cannot see the implementation the get accessor of parenttext because that exists in parent not iparent

1165932
radio	click
now to keep m_val up to-date it is probably worth putting a click handler on all the radio button in the grouping

1165949
shell	bash
the default shell on ubuntu is bash

1165954
triggers	insert
another similar solution is to use a triggers to insert the recording you want to delete into an audit table and then delete the information

1165959
swing	awt
if you re pure swing awt no problems

1165967
double	int
i ve run across a numbers of cases where a pattern for accessing items in a keyed collections like a dictionary is encumbered by the fact that the types of the key is not a simple types string int double etc and isn t something that you would want to promote to an actual named class

1165967
gethashcode	equals
unlike struct s these dynamically generator classes provide an implementation of both equals and gethashcode - which are designed to work well with dictionary and hashtable implementation in .net

1165967
gethashcode	equals
i ve hijacked this feature to create an opaque key - essentially a generics class that allows you to create key on-the-fly by providing the types that are part of the key - and using an anonymous-class to actually provide the equals gethashcode behavior

1165971
textbox	button
.when the user hits the insert button to insert the image into an html-editor next to the control the validation fires off if nothing was in the fileupload textbox

1165995
keydown	keyup
try listening for keyup or keydown instead of keypress per this .so .post

1166013
factors	digits
the most important factors is that double being implements as a binary fractions cannot accurately represent many decimal fractionss like 0.1 at all and its overall numbers of digits is smaller since it is 64bit wide vs

1166021
gethashcode	equals
the equals gethashcode will be fine

1166022
setinterval	settimeout
you would have to make your process code use settimeout setinterval from the start this code would end up working in both a worker and on a normals website

1166034
contains	elements
.so even though the elements actually contains xml elementss you want .net to pretend it is really a string

1166069
contains	any
might not contains any data whatsoever

1166072
jscrollpane	jtextpane
i have this jtextpane wrapped in a jscrollpane that is backed by a htmleditorkit

1166072
any	set
is there any way to get an event from either text.getdocument or text that will notify me .when the panels is finished loading .so that i can set the scrollbar then

1166075
firefox	safari
my current solution is working in safari but in firefox only the end quote display although the spaces for the beginning quote is there

1166097
.net	wcf
if you re looking to stay specifically within the microsoft .net world one thing that could be worth looking into the the federated security model that can be employed by technologies such as wcf windows communication foundation

1166120
python	php	python	c++
i write code in c++ or c# on side project while at work am forced to dangle between php and python

1166129
any	set
often this is set to .domain.com to make it available on any subdomain

1166153
gethashcode	equals
system.array does not overrides gethashcode or equals .so they use reference equality

1166155
decrement	increment
i would then increment that value .when a new story is submitted and decrement the value .when a story is deleted

1166161
contains	any
this will return any recording that contains the contents of filterid

1166163
xsd	xml
is there a way to refer to a grouping of non-nested xml tags in xsd schema

1166165
.when	ready
have a restful-authentication ruby-on-rails 2.2.2 .app i m getting ready to launchd but getting weird behavior .when i hit the site from ie7 or 8 not firefox 3.5 3 mac or pc hitting the domain in ie7 gets you an ie dialog

1166188
margins	padding
there for each elements you can see the offset margins border and padding of the elements

1166189
linux	unix
all standards unix applications have been ported to all other general purpose operating systemd in use today .so its hard to claim that you can benefit from an environment unique to linux

1166199
double	int
you can use it for any order types like int s or double s

1166204
revision	svn
in later svn versioning 1.5 merge behavior improved svn now remembers which revision of a branch were merged and which not but the base problem still exists

1166226
constructor	object
following-on from this question is it possible to detection whether one is in design or runtime mode from within an object s constructor

1166232
versioning	upgrade
.so far we ve only been rolling out complete versioninging either versioning 1.0 or versioning 1.5 but no upgrade from 1.0 to 1.2 to 1.3 to ..

1166232
versioning	upgrade
.so any customer that get versioning 1.0 cannot upgrade to versioning 1.2 or 1.3 or even the latest

1166232
versioning	upgrade
checked the table in database that stores the versioning info and depending on it run different scripting to upgrade database

1166233
versioning	upgrade
this started happening after a versioning upgrade but happens to no one else

1166235
gethashcode	equals
equals the gethashcode methods for the

1166246
click	mouse
why aren t the events being extended properly in my simulation but .when you click down with the mouse they are

1166260
display	width
create an id for each field then using css set the display to inline-block and the width to whatever you want

1166288
reflection	runtime
mono s runtime include support for garbage-collection thread management the io-layer the ioremapping layer the interface to the operating systemd support for the decimal types reflection .so you can still do things like types.getmethods for example

1166330
hide	show
assuming your using prototype you should use the ajax.responders to do the show hide

1166338
revision	svn
if the svn client you are using is giving you an error you could always branch from the revision you want to merge in then use that branch

1166339
filtering	grouping
the query is just a reference to an implementation of which in turn knows about another along with appropriate delegation for filtering grouping etc

1166349
put	get
the question is why if i get the numbers of task from an external source the workflow doesn t work but if i put a constants numbers of tasks the workflow works well

1166379
solaris	linux
the problem is that i need to use this information in a portable program that will run on multiple platform windows linux mac and possibly solaris too

1166388
qtextedit	qcombobox
the sizehint calculation won t be entirely trivial and will be way easier for qlineedit than for qtextedit which is secretly a qabstractscrollarea but you can look at the sizehint and minimumsizehint implementation for inspiration also the one for qcombobox which has a mode to do exactly what you want qcombobox adjusttocontents

1166401
contains	elements
this returns an arrays with the elements which contains -

1166401
contains	elements
i want to do the inverse of this .so all elements not contains - are returned

1166408
mersenne-twister	generator
.so far i ve been using the c# mersenne-twister found here to generator random numbers

1166429
dictionary	map
another alternative to an if-statement is a map dictionary in c# i believe that has a lookup based on the types to either a builder object or the object itself if it is immutable or to an instances of the object that can copy itself

1166433
authentication	login
the problem is that the wiki won t use the .net authentication .so request directly to will re.solve without forcing a login

1166444
zooming	drag
but suddenly i drag the map without zooming and delta value become 0.0

1166462
32-bit	64bit
it turns out that the com-interop assembly had issues running in 64bit which the server was on we switched it to 32-bit and it ran fine

1166474
output	mode
batch-file mode in which the output of

1166474
contains	set
site contains a set of assemblies

1166486
any	set
any decent executable should have a set of calling parameters that will do nothing

1166493
numeric	digits
where s is a two-character digits sequences xx like 00 01 and d is a numeric file-descriptor

1166507
malloc	free
my concern is as follows say there is an incorrect mixup in the use of malloc free and

1166517
linux	unix
there are no tools to my knowledge that are available only on linux or unix

1166519
gethashcode	equals
if you want something more ad hoc i ve found that the code that resharper generator for equals and gethashcode is fine

1166523
document-ready	ready
are you talking about using the document-ready function to fade something once it s ready

1166524
constructor	object
you should always use new and delete in c++ as only new and delete will call the object s constructor and destructor

1166524
malloc	free
if you find you must use both for instances if you re integration with a c libs thorough code reviews should carefully scrutinize any uses of free to determine whether or not they correspond to a malloc and whether or not they are being used in a c context

1166527
malloc	free
the same goes for malloc and free

1166527
malloc	free
al.so new and delete doesn t necessarily use malloc free for its allocation .so you might end up corrupting your heap as well

1166537
malloc	free
the easy way to not get them mixed up is never to use malloc then you will never be tempted to call free

1166537
malloc	free
the infrastructure to create to avoid this problem is called code review though in this case a quick grep malloc or grep free on the codebase will probably suffice

1166550
malloc	free
always use delete for things allocated with new for things allocated with and free for things allocated using malloc

1166550
malloc	free
new and new allocate from different heap than malloc and using the wrong free delete will attempt to deallocate from the wrong heap

1166558
malloc	free
to answer the second question if you control both malloc free and-operator new delete you can stash extra information to associate with pointers returned by both that tell you how they were allocated

1166581
malloc	free
never using malloc free in the first place or

1166590
malloc	free
never mix new delete with or with malloc free

1166590
malloc	free
atop of this the use of malloc free in c++ is questionable at least

1166604
abstract-factory	factory-method
abstract-factory pattern is different from factory-method pattern

1166646
configuration	environment
this can be affected by the tz environment variables your os locale settings or your ruby-on-rails configuration in environment.rb

1166648
instrumentation	profiling
it would do things similar to what profiling tools do .when they instrumentation your .app

1166668
versioning	upgrade
in the short term how do i upgrade from .3053 to .3082 and in the medium term how do i ensure my entire team is on the same .net runtime versioning

1166670
selected	cell
any controls you happen to have on the table cell are totally unrelated to uitableview s ability to allow you to selected a row using didselectedrowat# .

1166677
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
as a points of reference if i ever use this in real code the most likely place i envision it is as part of a business-logic-layer where i use this code to wrap a methods in the data-access-layer that just pull data from a lookup table

1166679
xsd	xml
only thing i can think of is that the server is connecting to the web to access xsd files for xml validation or similar

1166680
order	add
edit i should add i ve run a query on this query object and done an order by clause in this query of the query

1166687
contains	any
no assert on the inner details of the data or any other business-logic - that stuff in contains in separate tests

1166712
versioning	upgrade
i really like the idea of redgate s sql packager which will diff your two database versioninging and then create a sql scripting a c# project or a stand-alone executable to upgrade from versioning 1 to versioning 2

1166729
typedef	struct
why should we typedef a struct .so often in c

1166729
typedef	struct
typedef struct rsquo

1166735
contains	elements
second the img elements cannot contains child elementss as far as i know .so you cannot use the find cmd with it

1166739
csv	xml	export	csv
it will handle a few import export formats csv sql and xml

1166745
defined	declare
usually .when you have to declare self referencing structures like lists you use both because the typedef has not effect until the structure is defined unless you make a forward-declaration for example

1166750
nsinteger	int
note that i ve converted from int to nsinteger throughout

1166760
primitive	int
nsthread doesn t take primitive like int or char .so you have to use nsnumber

1166765
environment	building
but i ve found that keeping environment as synchronized as possible cuts down a lot of works on my machine types issues and also cuts down on developer helping developer troubleshoot why things don t building or work correctly on their pc

1166778
typedef	struct
usage of typedef for struct in c is explained here

1166783
typedef	struct
not sure about referring to static functions and typedef in the unnamed struct .when you do the definition this way - i never do

1166806
highlight	selected
with the currently selected site highlight

1166817
authentication	login
if they are not authentication they will be redirected to login

1166818
implements	extends
extends the delegation range could be implements via currying and partials function application

1166896
exception-handling	try-catch
this is not completely true - there are a few exception-handling that can escape a try-catch out-of-memory stackoverflowexception etc.

1166898
malloc	free
malloc ed buffering or buffering returned from a c api which caller must free must be assign to a private pointers field of an object

1166898
value	field
in that case you can call free on a value recently copy-paste out of a private field during replacement rather than on the field value directly

1166898
malloc	free
in other words stick a wrapper around anything that uses malloc free

1166898
malloc	free
then in code review if you see a call to malloc free anywhere else it s wrong

1166903
exception-handling	try-catch
if you must implements tryxxx using a try-catch pair around xxx rather than the preferred xxx implementss in terms of tryxxx and throw on false result catch the specific expected exception-handling s only

1166926
aggregate	grouping
the aggregate variant takes 4 rows and aggregate them to 2 rows with a sort grouping by

1166934
preserve	copying
they mostly return references to the contains items and if you preserve the reference in passing these things around no copying will occur

1166938
attr	src
for instances you could call #imgthumbnail attr src value

1166953
python	php
is there a versioning of the php arrays class where all the elements must be distinct like for instances sets in python

1166954
contains	elements
returns a jquery object which could contains a numbers of dom elements

1166990
any	set
as arvo also said make sure that you do not have the new page after flag set for any of the sections as this could cause it as well

1166994
attr	src
src is however both a html attributes and you can access those with the attr methods

1166999
json	xml
create an web handler that returns the recording as json or xml and make the road id a query-string parameter of the handler

1167015
logout	login
one thing that may be useful to note is that .when you change a user s grouping membership you will have to logout and back in again grouping membership will take effect .when you login and don t normally change otherwise

1167049
unmanaged	c++-cli
one thing i ve found useful is to delve into c++-cli .when dealing with unmanaged c++ libs

1167065
komodo	vim
i have tried eclipse with pydev vim with pythoncomplete pida and also komodo but none of them could give me autocmpletion for methods named or members for the classes belonging to pyqt4 or pykde4

1167081
put	get
what i have to put in stop event inorder to get the identifier of a draggable elements

1167086
gnome	kde
is it different in gnome gtk and kde qt

1167108
keydown	keyup
my keydown and keyup methods are as follows

1167111
put	get
how can i make it .so .when you selected .something from the list the numbers enclosed in parentheses does not get put into the textfield

1167140
compatibility	platform
if you use qt you get even compatibility with other platform like windows for free

1167154
build-system	cmake
i m building a cmake based build-system for our product

1167167
sql-server	oracle
the canonical example of this is database access code you aren t going to be accessing you db in sql-server and then suddenly switching to oracle

1167180
bytearrayoutputstream	dataoutputstream
as an alternative you could use dataoutputstream to store the int s in a bytearrayoutputstream

1167221
updating	updates
you re retrieving into l_l_itmengageitem and then updating a field on l_l_itmitem which you then call updates on

1167242
export	report
basic report export to excel

1167255
pointers	stack
make the strtok return pointers to this stack area outside the function

1167255
strtok	strdup	strdup	free
the older way to work with strtok was to use strdup in the allocate and free later

1167256
authorize.net-cim	subscription
you could use the authorize.net-cim api for storing retrieving the payment profiling then manage the subscription end of it yourself

1167309
tortoisecvs	svn
i know there is tortoisecvs but i m wondering if there is an easy way of sucking down source code in a cvs repository just using svn tools without having to install cvs tools

1167322
protected	public
perhaps you could defined a few asp placeholder think of it as zones within your user-controls and make them available via public or protected if you only want the inherited class to be able to change them properties

1167342
ref	out	unsafe	out
.so are the ref and out keyword like pointers for c# without using unsafe code

1167343
any	set
you then need to set up a continuous-integration systemd .so that any time that anything gets checked in it s all built and unit tested and deployed and integration tested

1167343
.when	ready
in the case of the database this would involve running all the updates or create scripting against a clean database to make sure they ll run .when you re ready for production

1167349
contains	set
will it dynamically building a list of object contains field identical to the columns in the result set

1167372
any	set
tooltipservice allows you to set the tooltip to be any content

1167372
contains	set
.so set it as a panels contains both an image and text

1167385
ref	out
out ref parameters can not do that .so no they are not the same as pointers

1167391
ref	out
you can say ++ on a pointers but not on a ref or out

1167391
ref	out
you can t perform the same operation as ptr++ on a ref out make it address an adjacent location in memory

1167391
pointers	stack	ref	out
it s a safe bet that they are internally just pointers because stack doesn t get move and c# is carefully organised .so that ref and out always refer to an active region of stack

1167391
ref	out
edit to be absolutely clear again if it wasn t already clear from the example below the points here is not that ref out can only points to stack

1167391
ref	out
conversely .when ref out refers to object in the gc heap it s no surprise that those object are able to be kept alive as long as necessary the gc heap is designed precisely for the purpose of retaining object for any length of time required by their referrers and provides pinning see example below to support situations where the object must not be move by gc compacting

1167394
webforms	asp.net
you do still need to building out the entire html of the page but you get all the wonderfulness or not of the asp.net webforms page lifecycle .when you do this

1167395
cvs	git
cvs2svn is a tool for migrating a cvs repository to subversion or git

1167395
binaries	install
if you just want to pull the source code down from the repository you can use the cvs binaries to do that without having to install tortoisecvs

1167396
ref	out
as a side note if you use fxcop to analyse your code using out and ref will result in a microsoft.design error of ca1045 donotpasstypesbyreference.

1167414
ref	out
ref and out are only used with function argumentss to signify that the arguments is to be passed by reference instead of value

1167421
selected	cell
i ve set all readonly -type options to false i ve set editmode to editonenter i ve added a row and selected a current cell programmatically i ve tried calling beginedit but all to no avail - i can t edit the cell s contents

1167426
attributes	properties
but for some reason i was able to include other attributes also even though they donâ t map to any properties of class a

1167426
contains	any
any idea why .net didn t notice that songpoem contains an invalid attributes

1167441
any	set
i thought i was getting close until i realized that you need to set base sdk for all configuration in the project settings inorder for the cross-compiling to be called and for any cocoa-touch frameworks to be found and properly handled by xcode

1167454
selected	textbox
i have a page where a user can either selected a vendor via dropdown or enter a vendor numbers via textbox

1167477
hide	show
still i d much rather just hide the grid and show a no recording found messages div block

1167488
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	oracle	rdbms	acid
regardless of what database you use ms-sql oracle postgresql mysql-innodb etc.. there s a lot of overhead in implements acid properties in a rdbms especially .when disks are involved which means queries are going to block

1167524
put	get
you can change this though get the carbonel package then put the following into your .rprofile

1167540
versioning	upgrade
that said once you begin developing your os you may find that you need to upgrade to the full non-express versioning

1167551
communication-protocol	client-server
because i didn t want to implements a communication-protocol for my client-server based application i implementss a rmi client and a rmi server on both sides for the information exchange between the two components

1167551
daemons	systemd
currently i only set the systemd properties java.rmi.server.hostname on both sides to the network-interface which should be used for the data exchange and registered the default ports for the communication with rmi daemons

1167573
build-system	qmake
i am putting together a build-system for my qt .app using a qmake .pro file that uses the subdirectories templates

1167573
revision	svn	contains	any
however i have now added a tool to the project that generator a versioning numbers contains the building date svn revision etc that is used by the main .app - i can building this versioning tool first but .when it is built i want to execute it before any more targets are built it generator a header file contains the versioning numbers that the main .app includes.

1167578
directory	folder
isolatedstorage required less collaboration with your iis admin .when it comes to granting ntfs rights to folder outside of your virtual directory

1167587
fpdf	fpdi
i am using fpdf fpdi to building a pdf templating systemd

1167587
embedded-fonts	fonts
to be clear i want to reuse these fonts not just have them applied to the import page but offer the option to rendering new text in one of the embedded-fonts

1167615
environment	building
the downside is we have to manage three sets of environment jars and the building team has to be careful not to deploy the incorrect one

1167643
exception-handling	try-catch
you could try-catch absolutely every exception-handling possible .when you go down the wrong execution path until you hit a path of execution that doesn t break but that is far worse than if s

1167657
put	get
simply put a templates is more specialized than another if you can replace each types-parameter of the latter templates with some types and in result get the signature of the former

1167657
contains	set
then the candidate set again contains both templates however #1 is more specialized then #3 and as such is selected

1167664
python	java
python ain t java

1167672
contains	elements
also there s a b elements that contains a string of text that looks like an a elements but isn t because it s enclosed in a cdata section

1167677
button	popup
the problem is .when i click the search button the modal-dialog popup but the databind methods never gets called

1167682
selected	button
this is the function that is fired .when the button is pressed that reads through the parent grid seeing which publications have been selected

1167712
xsd	xml
if you run your test xml file through the xsd.exe tool by microsoft twice first turning the xml into a xsd xsd.exe yourfile.xml -- yourfile.xsd and then generator a c# class from that xsd xsd.exe c yourfile.xsd -- yourfile.cs that can deserialize that xml content you ll end up with something like this long and not very pretty.....

1167725
rollback	commit
if you have other sql cmd or what ever then use transactional run as stored-procedures as you want intercalated with data that does not come from database the commit or rollback

1167728
constructor	object
and although the constructor creates and returns a uri object trying to access some of its properties throw uriformatexception

1167749
spring	guice
the use of some inversion-of-control framework in this instances is the most flexible solution -- spring was recommended in earlier answers guice is another excellent choice which is very easy to start with

1167770
any	set
this works well for any situation where the numbers of subtyping is increasing over time and the logic can be expressed as a set of configurable strings numberss etc

1167816
constructor	object
you are creating a initialvalues object and calling the constructor for it

1167817
any	set
it s fine as long as you don t need to do any checked to see if the value are set the right way

1167833
put	get
inorder to get this to work you must put your code in the same assembly as the aeccpointstyle class

1167847
versioning	upgrade
of course you ll need to add a reference and i absolutely hate adding reference to office because you get tied to a versioning of office and i hate updating code every time we upgrade

1167867
authentication	login
firefox doesn t seem to realize that .when you enter a username and passwd for a site it should attempt that authentication on all subsequent frame before asking you to login again

1167870
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
you should set the svn ignore keyword of your project directory to ignore the directory which contains automatically generator files as they can be generator at any time and do only take up spaces in your repository

1167870
directory	folder
if you ignore the gen folder this also means that you don t need to set the exclusion pattern for this directory as subversion doesn t create a .svn directory inside ignore items

1167903
pylons	django
it appears to me that django and pylons have different ideas on how middleware should work

1167903
pylons	django
i like that pylons follows the standardized pep 333 but django seems to have more widespread adoption

1167903
python	java	security	esapi
the project that involves said middleware is porting a security toolkit called esapi from java to python

1167903
pylons	django
see below for links to django and pylons middleware info

1167915
unmanaged	c++-cli
all you are doing is calling functions from the sfmt.dll and c++-cli is automatically handling the conversion from unmanaged to managed

1167944
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
ie 8 google-chrome firefox opera

1167946
labview	matlab
i also use matlab labview and visual-c++

1167949
vb.net	vb6
i am replacing a vb6 application with a rewritten counterpart in vb.net

1167949
updating	updates
most of all it made it convenient to continually updates individual letters by updating only that dll and dropping the dll on top of the old one

1167952
hosts-file	hosts
if the program is connecting using a dns named example.com you can use the hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts to make that named map to a different ip-address

1167962
mongodb	couchdb	mongodb	neo4j	couchdb	neo4j
you can explore some advanced cutting edges technologies such as mongodb couchdb project voldemort and neo4j for some even more efficient tools

1167968
display	height
you can hide a row via display none if you want but i assume that browsers will always give boxes a minimum height of 1px

1167978
string-length	zero
perform a dense coding of the input to positive int - with an alphabet size of n and string-length of m you can code the string into int between zero and n m - 1

1167985
transparency	outline
the menuitem s transparentcolor was set to black .so it made the outline of the image disappear which was black with about 50 transparency

1167997
arrays	map
also if your enum has a huge numbers of value jon skeet s map alternative is likely to perform better than any arrays iterator

1168013
reflection	runtime
use reflection and load the assembly dynamically at runtime

1168035
python	ruby
it would be nice to have something similar for python and ruby

1168047
associations	model
i m using this associations in my article model

1168052
processor	cpu
cpu utilization is oftentimes running at 100 on all four processor now this never happended on the sql 2005 server

1168052
processor	cpu
it appears that whenever i have four process waiting on this resource cpu hits 100 on all four processor

1168055
where-clause	sql
i think the easiest way will be to just use an sql where-clause fragment via the conditional parameter

1168084
output	cat
use to assign the output of cat to your variables like this

1168089
any	set
currently this is not done by any tool plugins i know of except for clearcase eclipse-plugins where a recursive option can be set to show a dirty state on package of a project if one of the files is checked out

1168090
put	get
if it is global across all sessions you could put it in a class_variable rather than an instance_variable but that can get messy once you start having multiple ruby-on-rails process each which will have their own copy of it or if you re running in threadsafe mode you can end up with nasty concurrency bugs

1168108
nunit	nmock	nunit	moq	nmock	moq
i d really suggest you start with a simpler framework such as xunit.net nunit together with mocking ones such nmock and moq

1168113
filtering	sorting
you can use a derived table for filtering and sorting like this

1168114
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to use the official jquery-ui-autocomplete with an asmx web service in an asp.net 3.5 webforms application

1168114
jquery	.post	json	xml
i figured out how to make the web service respond to the http-get call but i cannot figure out how to make it return json data even though the service returns json data .when i call it using jquery .ajax with types .post .when called from the autocomplete plugins it always returns xml

1168121
mod-rewrite	mod-alias
is this possible to do through mod-rewrite or mod-alias

1168130
pylons	django
for pylons the term middleware means wsgi pep 333 middleware whereas django means its own internal mechanism for middleware

components which have no value assign to any child properties will also be set to null .when being retrieved from the database

1168142
xsd	xml
i am trying to represent the following xml in xsd i m working with the visual-studio xsd editor as i really don t know xsd very well

1168144
jquery	.post
i m using jquery to .post an ajax request to my create action in which i have the following block

1168152
implements	extends
you can extends your current service class which implementss isearchuser and let it implements icreateuser as well - in that case you could add a second endpoint to your service configuration

1168168
defined	declare
in turn the delegation is the view underneath or .something and it will conform to the protocols defined by the aboveview and as part of it it will have to declare the methods didmakecirclegestures .so as a result .when one makes a circle gestures in the aboveview the underneath view that conformed to the protocols will be told of the event and it can take appropriate action

1168175
ruby	php
i m fixing some php scripting and i m missing ruby s pretty printer

1168202
scala	java
i thought i would start with scala since i am java literate make the transitions easier and be more reusable since they can talk to each other and .so my question is in your experience does learning a functional language make sense

1168211
python	java
favorite languages c# java python

1168212
comet	chat
i recommend reading the tutorial building a comet chat application with streamhub

1168216
tf-idf	corpus
a very popular weight is tf-idf which uses a words s frequency in a document and its frequency in a corpus

1168224
directory	folder
there should be a sibling directory to your solution directory called testresults which contains the folder used for each test run

1168227
asp.net-mvc	webforms	entity-framework	nhibernate
with .net it s classic webforms the new extension asp.net-mvc along with various orm solutions like linq entity-framework nhibernate etc

whatever time is selected by user should be display in a textbox

1168271
put	get
is there any possible way to get around this or do i just need to limit the amount of items put into a room 2500 was about the limit i found to work

1168287
put	get	contains	any
if it contains something like .. .. index.php or something like this - you get the idea this could allow someone to put any file they want on your server

1168287
webserver	upload
you might al.so want to checked the mimetype of the upload file .so you don t get executable for instances -- and you should make sure files upload are not executable by the webserver

1168309
logout	login
sql-server general statistics login sec logout sec user connections

1168315
ruby-on-rails	django
if you want a lot of short-lived webpage that together form a web application django and ruby-on-rails by themselves are suited for this

1168315
cappuccino	sproutcore
cappuccino and sproutcore are also designed for this

1168327
firefox	safari
now that ie8 is a forced updates there should be better support but i can t speak from experience on ie nor firefox or safari etc

1168334
ref	out
100 correct -- not to mention ref out parameters modifiers as well as unsafe-pointers

1168344
key-value	key
because map.find takes a key and returns a key-value pair iterator

1168356
any	set
this will ensure that if you call any methods on the parent class in your constructor the parent class has already been set up correctly

1168356
constructor	object
since every class in java inherited from object object constructor must be called somehow and it must be execute first

1168356
constructor	object
enforcing super to appear first enforces that constructor bodies are execute in the correct order which would be object - parent - child - childofchild - soonsoforth

1168362
constructor	object
i am fairly sure those familiar with the java specifications chime in that it is to prevent you from a being allowed to use a partially-constructed object and b forcing the parent class s constructor to construct on a fresh object

1168366
udp	tcp
it supports tcp udp icmp...

1168366
icmp	tcp
it s also very useful if you want to see where along a route that a tcp ports is being blocked like by a firewall where icmp might not be

1168395
python	java
i would argue python simpler than java on this basis because it s object-model whilst complex is simple in terms of reduction into a simpler form

1168395
semantics	keyword
the numbers of keyword lines-of-code and the complexity of semantics like identifier resolution for a simple problem

1168424
cakephp	symfony	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
search for cakephp and codeigniter and maybe symfony i m not sure all do the rest thing.

1168427
constructor	object
it doesn t seem to like using aggregate-functions in the object constructor though

1168430
repository	entity
should lookup get their own repository interface shared one with the associated entity or should there be a generics ilookuprepository interface

1168433
object-reference	instances
it works fine in the program but it can t be display in designer - it says object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1168451
multiplication	division
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168453
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
you ll need to use nsdateformatter to format the nsdate returned by your uidatepicker

1168479
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb --target i586 package.spec

take into account that i m not using the credentials of the currently logged user i m specifing the domain account i have the passwd

1168532
value	field
i m stuck trying to defined an xsd contains a field that can have only one of the following three value

1168550
arrays	map
equally valid would be an arrays load followed by a dereference but in this case there is no named to map to the null value just an index off of another value

1168552
authentication	login
the login and authentication is all homebrewed and i d like to switching the application to use pam instead

1168557

1168561
any	set
a methods to set the errorlevel to any numbers you desire

1168566
multiplication	division
most compilers will turn multiplication and division into bit shifts .when appropriate

1168568
32-bit	64bit
what you are asking for is essentially to run 64bit code in a 32-bit memory mode with awe enabled ie lose all the real advantages of 64bit

1168592
tcpdf	fpdf
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

1168616
multiplying	division
for division by a constants the compiler can often convert the operation to a multiplying by a magic numbers followed by a shift

1168616
multiplication	division
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1168619
packaging	building
for my packaging requirement i need to split artifacts generator during the building and all dependencies into separate folder

1168626
windows-xp	windows
this behavior isn t new to windows 7 - it s been this way at least as early as windows-xp possibly earlier i don t have access to anything earlier to test

1168628
textbox	button
i have an asp.net-mvc page with a very simple-form on it one textbox and a submit button

1168644
perl	c++
unlike in c++ where an object may be accessed using a pointers typesd to a parent perl always knows the real types of an object .when operating on its reference indeed the field pseudohash is essentially a vtable kept on every single object instances

1168677
python	java
but then this is python why write it like it was java

1168678

1168753
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen + graphviz or dot

1168757
decrement	increment
for every call to new you can increment a counter and you could then defined a finalize to decrement this value

1168765
decrement	increment
you could have a counter you increment in the constructor but .when to decrement it

1168794
windows-xp	windows

1168863
insertion-sort	quicksort
programmers aren t as educated on algorithms as they used to be - this could be related to the high level languages as people just use their language s built-in sort instead of choosing quicksort over insertion-sort

1168865
for-loop	loops
you should open the file before the for-loop and then put the line inside loops

1168872
logout	login
for login logout django has an authenticationmiddleware feature you can probably use although i am not sure if you can solve your problem with it

1168876
javascript	dom
to be honest many of the problems i routinely trip over are actually dom quirks not javascript per se

1168883
push	pull
i have set it up to pull rather than push only because that s the way i got past the login issue

1168965
json	xml
now they need to have an xml parsing and a json parsing

1168975
json	xml
if this is an xml interchange format that will be standardized by the w3c and used by millions then dear god do not use json

1168976
constructor	object
more specifically one of the properties of my object is id and i d like to be able to pass this into the constructor of another form in the event handler

1168988
credentials	security
with transportwithmessagescredential you re specifying that you ll use messages security to secure the individual messagess which required the client credentials username and passwd

1168988
credentials	security
transport security using http and a valid ssl-certificate works in the same way a website does it doesn t required additional credentials certs from the user

1168996
buffering	streaming
this is an interesting reaction to deferred execution - most people view it as a positive in that it allows you to transform streaming of data without needing to buffering everything up

1169004
contains	set
the int class takes a string in its constructor to set the value assuming the provided string contains only numeric text

1169006
ubuntu	debian
google also has a nice profiling as part of the google-perftools -- which are include in debian ubuntu and possibly other distros

1169012
required	checked
i didn t use the built-in methods because later in the form i would required to write another methods to checked for greater or equals and lower or equals and

1169034
hash	md5
.so even if you hash the passwd with say md5 the md5 hash is still sent in plain text then intercepted and can then be posted back to the login page by the third party

1169046
buildpath	libs
in the java buildpath section go to the libs tab and add your libs there

1169072
selected	button
from the pop-up that appears .when you release the mouse button selected the ibaction that you want to connect the event to

1169072
player	movie
or you could try creating an ibaction on the movieplayer.appdelegation and connecting the event there in which case you would drag the connection to the movie player .app delegation icons in the mainwindows.xib windows

1169073
configuration	installation
.so i m pretty sure that the problem is not with the weblogic installation and not with the ear but with the domain configuration

1169076
security	owasp
owasp provides a lot of insight into security issues that are the biggest problems in applications today

1169108
glassfish	weblogic
personally i would go with the .app server s transactional manager regardless of whether it was websphere or weblogic or glassfish or whatever

1169118
webforms	asp.net
i m using the entity-framework as my orm for an asp.net webforms application

1169118
uniqueidentifier	identifier
i imagine i could add a uniqueidentifier column to my recording and a matching properties to my entity-model but it seems redundant to effectively have 2 unique identifier for the row

1169122
value	field
this is very fast and provides value for the field .so you don t have #name errors

1169135
execute	prepare
not too familiar with using mysql in c but according to what i can see in the mysql.h file you should call mysql_stmt_prepare to create the statement and mysql_stmt_execute to execute said prepare statement

1169140
filtering	grouping
a filtering can be used to apply before after logic across a grouping of controllers a uri or to a specific action

1169149
arrays	loops
i m often confronted with the following situation i have some data in a table nested arrays and need to loops over all items in it

1169155
build-system	qmake
i ve tried to do a lot of stuff with qmake as a build-system over the years

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
there are some fundamental issues that separate common-lisp and scheme which make trying to use the former with sicp a pretty bad idea

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
.so in scheme you have a clear separation .something is either a list or one of the primitive-types of value -- but in common-lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is al.so a symbols

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
in addition to this you get a hosts of slightly different behavior -- for example in common-lisp the head and the tail the car and cdr of the empty list is itself the empty list while in scheme you ll get a runtime error if you try that

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
to top it off you have different named and naming conventions for example -- predicates in common-lisp end by conventions with p eg listp while predicates in scheme end in a question mark eg list

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
mutators in common-lisp have no specific conventions some have an n prefix while in scheme they almost always have a suffix of

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
also plain assignment in common-lisp is usually setf and it can operate on combinations too eg setf car foo 1 while in scheme it is set

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
his third option -- rewriting functional loopss expressed as recursive functions as common-lisp loopss dotimes dolist and the infamous loops can work for a few simple cases but at a very high cost the fact that scheme is a language that does proper tco is not only fundamental to the language -- it is al.so one of the major themes in the book .so by doing .so you will have lost that points completely

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
in addition there are some cases that you just cannot translation scheme code into a common-lisp loops construct -- for example as you work your way through the book you ll get to implements a meta-circular-interpreter which is an implementsation of a mini-scheme language

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
people who are familiar with all of this should not be surprised after all the circularity of the evaluator means that you re implements a language with semantics that are very close to the hosts language -- .so in this case you inherited the common-lisp semantics rather than the scheme tco semantics

1169169
common-lisp	scheme
for example many common-lisp compilers will never optimize this call funcall foo bar while scheme compilers will optimize foo bar like any function-call expression because there is no other way to call functions.

1169169
scheme	lisp
finally i ll note that much of the above is very good flamewar material throw any of these issues into a public lisp or scheme forum in particular comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.scheme and you ll most likely see a long thread where people explain why their choice is far better than the other or why .some .so called feature is actually an idiotic decision that was made by language designers that were clearly very drunk at the time etc etc

1169189
unchecked-exception	checked-exceptions
the throw clause is enough .when you have checked-exceptions and there s no good purpose on god s green earth for unchecked-exception

1169205
linux	unix
finally if you are on a unix platform such as linux or mac you should take a look at crontab as it is designed to set up recurring programs to run and particular time periods

1169226
where-clause	sql
the plus of doing this is that you can construct much more complex queries as you have control over much much more than just the where-clause of the sql query

1169230
registration	login
i am working on a project that required user login registration

1169230
ssl-certificate	ssl
i d like to avoid setting up private ssl since i am using a shared-hostsing provider and would like to hosts multiple domains off of the same plan but since a private ssl-certificate required a dedicated ip i can only have 1 certificate per plan...but would still like to secure all of my sites

1169238
value	field
i have data that comes out of a db in a normalize way with a field for year state and value

1169238
value	field
i would like to do analysis on the data and need it formatted where each year is a field and not a recording.so i would like the data where each recording is a state and then theres a field for each year and each value for those field are the value for that year and that state

1169241
webforms	asp.net
viewstate - this is useful .when you ll be posting back to the same page frequently something you re practically forced into doing by asp.net webforms

1169241
webserver	upload
again hash have their own problems but i want to points out that several items on my list talk including query-string about upload data from the client web browser to the webserver viewstate query-string cookies and cross-page .post

1169241
webserver	upload
512kpbs still a typical broadband upload rate in many areas is nothing .when compared to the gigabit ethernet or faster connection that likely sits between your database and your webserver

1169246
ubuntu	linux
i m running xterm initializer with utf-8.en.us running ubuntu linux and mono

1169248
contains	elements
in r how do you test a vector to see if it contains a given elements

1169272
credentials	security
microsoft s own product often use form field to submit ad credentials i know outlook web access and internet security acceleration server both do this

1169290
32-bit	16-bit
.when you are working with 32-bit int and 16-bit shifts there will be carries with your + operation and bit-wise or ing with the or operation

1169306
postgresql	mysql
however i don t think sqlite has rich enough stored-procedures to do something like this you would need to use mysql postgresql or similar

1169330
sql-server	mysql
i understand that some databases have native support in r mysql but you can connect to other dbs like ms sql-server using rodbc

1169361
contains	any
itext itself does not seem to provide any datamodel for glyphs and fontss but i believe it can let me retrieve and updates the binary streaming that contains the fonts

1169367
any	set
what s that in abstract new set of tools for building a middle-tier or better yet the service-layer on top of a middle-tier in any sort of application including enterprise class applications

1169372
cassini	iis
you can find out how cassini differs from iis here

1169379
click	mouse
button are just controls that respond to mouse click

1169397
sql-server	ms-access
this types of queries really benefit from being move up to sql-server as a view you then link to that view from ms-access

1169402
radix-sort	quicksort
the speed advantage of radix-sort over glib quicksort is about 2.5x for double-precision floating-point numbers at n 1000000 on my 64bit intel laptop

1169417
buffering	streaming
an alternative albeit less efficient solution suggested by the blog .post is to turn off the streaming s output buffering

1169418
user-controls	ascx
for example i have a user-controls ascx with a labels inside

1169444
expression	brackets
expression can span multiple line if wrapped in brackets

1169467
parentheses	braces
count parentheses brackets and braces and don t generator nl tokens while there are unclosed grouping

1169470
any	set
allowing access to a particular set of data through a _get parameter is much more accessible to any user that happens to be using the application

1169478
keydown	keyup
i think you first problem is that you are using the keydown event .when you really want the keyup event

1169484
show	next
user click on next page the last time i saw him he was on page x .so he should now be on page y .so .when he s requesting the site the next time i ll show him page y.

1169488
rar	zip
compression with rar vs zip

1169493
profiling	trace
if you don t want anything invasive in your code then you have to go the profiling trace way

1169499
nsurlconnection	nsdata
you can t do it directly via nsdata however nsurlconnection would support such a thing by loading the image asynchronously and using connection didreceivedata to checked how much data you have received

1169500
verilog	vhdl
before plunging into verilog vhdl or buying an fpga dev kit i d recommend taking an introductory class on digital design

1169510
javascript	dom
depending on how you were creating the elementss in javascript the javascript-engine probably created a valid elements to place in the dom

1169539
for-loop	loops
i can imagine doing for-loop for each state then doing the regression inside loops and adding the results of each regression to a vector

1169542
substitution	replace
but note that this only works well for the case where you have only one or a very small numbers of substitution to make and those substitution are not pattern based because replace can only handle one substitution at a time

1169547
value	field
this way you still have all the field if normals form and you can still for example updates and save your model which woudn t work if you change the int value fetched from the db to string

1169549
order	add
to fix this add it into the order by

1169571
implements	abstract
absclass implements the properties of iclass as abstract properties to be defined in the classes that derive from absclass

1169589
silverlight	wpf
in wpf silverlight can i get the calculated value of a uielement after a transformation is applied

1169608
malware	website
the string i am trying to deal with is a malware scripting which infected a website i wrote but do not hosts

1169611
contains	any
i m trying to import an excel file into sql-server but if any of the column contains numbers value like 12355484645 and .when it s insert into sql-server the value will become 1.05e+010

1169640
contains	set
this will set a variables called in your view that contains

1169659
environment	building
if not how do people allocate and reserve building-numbers in an automated building environment

1169683
textbox	button
i am having two textbox and a submit button

1169683
textbox	button
.when i am loosing my focus from the first textbox custom validation is doing validation.but i want that validation on button click only

1169688
ssl-certificate	ssl
ssl encrypts the entire request and response including the hosts header - and a webserver does not know which ssl-certificate to use to crack open the messages before attempting to route it - this is why an ssl site must have a dedicated ip-address

1169693
spring	jsf
another methods is to use the postconstruct attributes to have a methods do the initializing for you once spring jsf has made the bean for you

1169703
.when	ready
i use sqldatasource dscontactemail to get information about that person to place on the contact form but how do i get information out of dscontactemail from the code-behind for .when i m ready to send that mail

1169703
put	get
i put a formview on the page to display the person s picture and i can get whatever i want from that dscontactemail with #eval email for example but how do i get that from the code-behind

for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure systemd later on i m trying to compare md5 hash

1169739
buffering	streaming
i use a buffering streaming for the reader and writer no dice

1169744
order	join
i ve had quite a few wins with using selected straight join and order the tables according to their size

1169744
order	join
straight join stops mysql guess which order to join tables and does it in the order specified .so if you use your smallest table first you can reduce the amount of rows being joined

1169758
contains	elements
just a guess that the contains elements of the before needs to be block .so it can listen to the margin-top.

1169776
hash	md5
c317db7d54073ef5d345d6dd8b2c51e6 is the md5 hash for 4hj2yq7qdhd9sdjfash9testpw

1169782

apache-config	httpd.conf
also checked ur php-ini and httpd.conf or whatever your apache-config file is to see if all modules are configure correctly

1169808
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen
if your website is going to be used locally a little odd but it could happen then you can use fopen fwrite and fclose in php to work with local files

1169815
webserver	security
if you think about it it would be a significant security flaw if a webserver could arbitrarily save files to user desktops

1169828
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit solaris sparc systemd can an apache server built-in 64bit mode load a 32-bit plugins

put	get
any model resource can accept a get operation to query its state a put operation for setting its state .post for append to it and delete for removal

1169941
shell	bash	shell	tcsh	tcsh	bash
use ps to identify the pid of the shell process bash tcsh etc then kill that.

1169944
pylons	web2py
if you want simplicity use web2py or pylons

1169946
children	tree
note that if you kill a process higher up the process tree its children will usually go away as well

1169959
subtraction	addition
it would overrides add and sub .so you could do addition and subtraction by simply using operators + and -

1169960
scheme	let
this is the way object are traditionally created in scheme in sicp -- to have a let defined a bunch of variables the instance-variables initializer to their initial value and in the body defined a bunch of functions which are methods that have shared access to the instance-variables

1169963
contains	any
i want to checked whether any one of the arrays object does not contains any value how can it be done using junit 4

1169972
oracle	mysql
i do not think mysql has support for tree-like structures as opposite to oracle for instances

1169986
attributes	properties
the .styles properties is a means of accessing and setting inline styles like the styles attributes

1169998
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
given a certain state of one of my uiview i d like it to respond to touchesbegan and then cancel any further touchesmoved ended that continue from that particular touchesbegan event

1169999
search-engine	web-crawler
content that gets loaded immediately say with a secondary http-request as in your example after the initial pageload is usually visible to the search-engine web-crawler

1170001
copy-constructor	constructor
a constructor generator from a class-template is not a copy-constructor there s a footnote in 12.8 class.copy that clarifies this .so won t prevent the compiler from generator a copy-constructor for you

1170002
revision	updates
i am currently developing a j2me application for the i290 and would like to be able to updates to new midlet revision in my application using code

1170009
triggers	insert
the best option is to use an insert triggers on your master table that obtains the corresponding older row s children and insert them in the child table

1170009
triggers	insert
since .when the triggers occurs it doesn t know which master recording the current insert recording s were copy-paste from you ll need to tracking the primary key of the original recording in a column in the master table which i ve labeled copy-pastefromid here

1170009
triggers	insert
insert is a special table available within a triggers that contains all of the rows being insert into your master table in that transactional

1170009
triggers	insert
i used for after insert rather than plain old for insert because i m assuming your child table s foreign key enforces referential integrity with the master table .so i think you have to only triggers this action after the insert actually occurs

1170011
linux	unix
however it s a unix linux tool and you might need cygwin to run it on a windows machine

1170049
ip-address	hostname
second one informs that php can t resolve hostname into ip-address - i d look into dns configuration and or hosts-file

1170057
contains	elements
the stylesheet does not contains a document elements

1170064
margins	padding
assuming that you have access to the html of the page itself try the margins or padding css styles on the tag

1170065
margins	padding
it sounds like there are margins or padding given to the div elements via css

1170065
margins	padding
just get rid of the margins padding definition or adjust the value as necessary

1170088
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
if i wrap the socket in a bufferedoutputstream bufferedinputstream life is great

1170088
bufferedoutputstream	dataoutputstream
but wrap the socket in a datainputstream dataoutputstream or even have dataoutputstream bufferedoutputstream sock.getoutputstream is extremely slow

1170119
wgs84	utm	wgs84	gps
the basic idea is to convert gps coordinates which are in wgs84 coordinate systemd to distance from some points - in case of utm northing is a distance from the equator and easting is distance from one selected meridian

1170128
any	set
i have a mysql query that checked an employee scheduling db and thanks to a previous stackoverflow question returns any days that the user is not working as no work .so that if the user isn t working on thursday the query fills in that date even though the date does not appear in the original result set and .so i don t have to fill in those blanks via the php scripting

1170152
32-bit	64bit

temporary	copy
i ve posted a copy at temporary for you.

1170178
ref	out
it s part of c# just like ref and out

1170178
ref	out
placing the new keyword forces you to think about whether that is really what you intended to do or not just like requiring ref or out .so that you have to think about the contract your code is providing

1170185
websphere	ibm
i need to use sun jce provider in an application that is running on ibm websphere

1170185
ibm-jdk	jsse
the other question i wanted to ask is is there any way i can continue using ibm-jdk default jce jsse and other and use only sun jce wherever required

1170200
click	mouse
i am trying to building my first jquery plugins it basically creates a button from div with mouse over click states etc the following code works for the basic button however i want to create a highlight methods to assign a class to replace the normals class

1170237
nunit	nmock
nunit nmock ncover for testing

1170241
height	frame
what you can do is defined the height of your frame large enough to allways contains the full page within but then you will allways have a windows scrollbar that reflects the full height of the size you definedd on the fram even if the contents does not required it

1170243
code-coverage	ncover
ncover takes care of code-coverage metrics you are meant to integrated with your test cases

1170246
reliability	scalability
what to concern yourself with is not the length but the complexity reliability usability and scalability of the methods and whether the code can be refactored into a simpler easier to read less complex versioning

1170254
jquery	.post
as for jquery side of the things use the ajax methods instead of .post methods to run different functions for different response from your server

1170262
google-chrome	safari
it works great in every browser except safari and google-chrome

1170263
directory	folder
typically .when you deploy a user-controls in sharepoint you put your control in the controltemplates folder which is mapped to the _controltemplates virtual directory in iis by default sp has access to this folder

1170265
search-engine	web-crawler
perhaps for caching which usually include css or thumbnails or some such it might be a factors but for search-engine optimization and indexing and what not css shouldn t be relevant to a se web-crawler

1170271
reliability	robustness
you measure the quality of a methods by its specificity efficiency robustness and reliability

1170274
getter	setter
multiple properties can shared a single getter or setter differentiated by an ordinals index

1170274
value	field
this might give you ideas for other ways you can refer to your field by index instead of having two completely separate field-for such related value

1170284
environment	restart
easiest is to set a os environment variables at the systemd level or for the user coldfusion runs under and restart the service

1170288
updating	updates
updates is updating the query

1170346
show	next
there isn t a + icons next to the .resx file which will expand to show the .designer file

1170360
backslash	regex
assuming your first code is a literals regex you need to escape the hyphen in the character-class with a backslash

1170375
versioning	upgrade
after we get to a persistent points we upgrade to versioning 2 we need to be able to let the old instances continue to run with the old versioning of our assemblies

in addition what are some general tips for debugging latex errors in doxygen

1170416
ms-access	oracle
adding on to the previous answers another major difference with oracle and ms-access is concurrency

1170416
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
oracle as well as mysql and postgresql and some others can handle multiple transactional and commit basically if you use a database with a website a more secure and stable database would be oracle likewise an application

1170417
tostring	equals
is anyone aware of a libs that uses the the techniques annotations and classworking describe in this article for automatically generator the standards object methods tostring equals and hashcode for standards java classes

1170422

how can i make them appear side-by-side scale .so they are the same height on screens filling the whole width of the page or containers div without changing the aspect-ratio of either image

1170426
configuration	environment
from the servers view open your server configuration and will show a page with your server named runtime environment etc

1170464
revision	svn
svn log revision properties

1170465

attributes	properties
as above use the outputproperties attributes to set the value to a properties for use in ant

1170480
attributes	properties
.when i add an x named properties to my base user-controls all of my attributes on the user-controls reference start throw errors

1170497
vba	vb6
this vb6 code is compatible with vba

1170530
gedit	gnome
nobody has mentioned gedit .so i will for windows it s on gnome linux too

1170548
sql-server	oracle
i m working on converting a stored procedure from sql-server to oracle

1170551
any	set
if you want to use any kind of templating then you need to look to other technologies which you can set up to output xhtml rather then doing anything intrinsics to xhtml itself at least if you want to approach the problem sanely

1170559
where-clause	sql
this works fine but because i m using enumerator instead of queryable it s pulling back all the recording from the database before running the where function on them .when i want the where-clause to be added to the sql query generator by nhibernate

1170592
.net	wcf
.net ria service wcf service

1170603

it looks like the 32-bit executable has the 64bit versioning embedded in it and extraction it if necessary

1170643
32-bit	64bit
i d like a tool which automates this - takes 32-bit and 64bit executable pack them together somehow and insert stubs code to launchd the right executable according to which platform its gets run on

1170657

1170678
32-bit	64bit
roll 64bit and 32-bit versioning of an .app into the same binary

1170683
any	set
in other words accessing any pages in the working set will not cause a page-fault since the page is in ram

1170683
contains	set
as for the other two i m not 100 sure probably working set contains sharable memory such as memory-mapped-files and private working set contains only pages that the process can use and are not shareable

1170685
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
also i d recommend you checkout sharpdevelop it is mostly compatible with visual-studio solutions and project files and has built-in support for ironpython project

1170693

1170693
attributes	properties
the following html using dojotype and other properties attributes works fine - the bordercontainer and contentpanes appear correctly in both browsers

1170698
versioning	upgrade
they may simply need to upgrade their axis versioning

1170707

i would suggest nix based linux would be great if it is possible because you can get the package easier with the built-in package manager e.g apt for debian yum for fedora etc

1170716
linux	osx
i want to draw transparency windows with alpha channel on linux gtk and osx

1170720

1170740
directory	folder
once i get the access to this directory i will create a nested directory inside it with different extensions of files but the problem is .when i tries to access this folder by unc path it is giving me error like could not find a part of the path comp01 ibc

1170752
versioning	upgrade
the way i would try to solve this is by getting the other developer to upgrade to visual-studio 2008 as you are able to target older versioning of the framework in the compiled binary is there any reason for them not to upgrade

1170758
arguments	default
the main ideas are to use default value or to create alternate constructor or to checked the numbers and the types of your arguments inorder to choose which methods to apply

1170794
basic	vb6
my question is how can i call this helloworld function from microsoft office visual basic which i think is vb6

1170820
python	java
on the side note if you really really reallllllyyy must do jip java in python then multiple dispatcher methods are possible with some additional code eg

1170835
tcpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdf	fpdf	fpdi
we have chosen to use fpdf over over tcpdf due to compatibility problems detailed on the fpdi website as fpdi is the core component in this dropping fpdi was not an option

1170869
button	popup
i have my own search button as a uibarbuttonitem and therefore on the keyboard that popup .when editing begins on a uisearchbar i would like to constantly hide the search button on it as it is unusable

entity	pojo
with this setup you can now create a lazy-evaluation mapping from the owning pojo entity to the owned pojo entity even if table_a is owned by table_b

1170879
tostring	equals
i find that automatic tostring generator is not usually what you want .when scouring log files and most ides will have tools to allow you to generator hashcode and equals implementation although granted these do not automatically reflect any schema modifications within your class

1170890
google-chrome	firefox
.when i visit this url in firefox google-chrome etc the decent browsers all is well the browser correctly selected a plugins such as acrobat reader to rendering the file within the browser

1170897

what you should also consider is that for every release-cycle of your software you not only updates the software domain model but also need to take care of updating the database .when your domain model changes

1170987
rendering	redraw
to save a little performance you may checked if a redraw updates is neccessary at all before carrying it out .so no unneccessary rendering is performed .

1170988
attributes	properties
basically i m getting a messages to process updates a few attributes on it and send it to the messagesbox while initializing a correlation based on a specific properties lets call it msgidentifier

1170994
authentication	login
the authentication is handled by the browser itself rather than a login page on the website which doesn t look nearly as nice and doesn t allow you to have all the surrounding helpers functions like forgot your passwd

1170995
perl	tcl	python	java	python	tcl	python	perl
depending on the implementation chosen there are perl java python along with the original tcl you can then use the corresponding gui toolkit swing to java

1170996
required	checked
tracking down the problem required lots of helpful people like me to checked the website on their computers to see if the problem is just you or more widespread

1171001

1171064
logout	login
django also contains basic-authentication login logout functionality and has the concept of users and admin-users built into it

1171087
attributes	properties
i d probably have a projectassignment entity to break up the nary as.sociations between user project and role - it will probably grow extra attributes as time goes on say you want to tracking changes to the assignments over time .so it gets startdate and enddate properties

1171112
webrequest	webclient
otherwise you should just stick to the webrequest and webclient classes

1171133
compatibility	legacy
to have compatibility with legacy code

1171155
virtual-functions	base-class	function-pointers	virtual-functions
impossible to overrides functions properly .so calling them on the base-class invokes the one in the containers of the base without using function-pointers which is possibly more overhead than virtual-functions

1171160
compatibility	legacy
having compatibility with the legacy code means that it should be able to run on the new versioning of jvm without compilation

1171169
put	get
if they don t understand i would say that maybe you could put together a presentation on design and get them up to speed .so you can have those is this a good design conversations

1171242
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve been looking around and i ve seen that the ado.net entity-framework will allow me to achieve this using entity splitting but i wondered if there s an easy way to accomplish the same thing in linq-to-sql and if not what the affects are in terms of integration the .net ef with my asp.net-mvc .app

1171246
value	field
by using a proxy scripting written in either c# or php you can get access to the value of a title field and return that to your jquery ajax process

i am using a loops to traversal all the children of the div and for each nodes found i am removing it with removechild and append an newly created nodes

1171363
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to use the mouseenter mouseleave events since they seem to look in detail for the divs they are dealing with as seen here but nothing changed

1171373
sql-server	oracle
if it was sql-server i know how to query the metadata but how do i do this in oracle

1171390
contains	elements
i originally said lower_bound but if the vector contains multiple equals elements then upper_bound selected the insert points which required less work

1171390
order	add
if it s not fast enough you have to find a way to add items in batch-file and validation at the end or else give up on contiguous storage and switching to a containers which maintains order such as set or multiset

1171390
priority-queue	heap
a heap does not maintain order in the underlying containers but is good for a priority-queue or similar because it makes removal of the maximum elements fast

1171394
click	mouse
you should look whether the click mouse ups and mouse downs are triggers on the stage and if .so what their target is .

1171404
panels	grid
the panels in the middle is quite annoying because my scatterviewitems can easily get lost behind the grid and since the grid is locked in positioning there is no way for me to retrieve them

with mechanize and beautifulsoup you have a great start

1171422
decimal	hex
colour value tend to be originated by designers such as myself who would never encounter hex notation anywhere else and are much more familiar with the decimal notation which is the main way of specifying colour in the apps they use -- in fact i have met quite a few who don t realise how a given hex value break down into rgb components and assumed it didn t directly relate to the colour at all like a pantone colour systemd reference eg pms432

1171431
value	field
in your .dbml designer make sure that the id field is marked as auto generator value

1171431

1171533
debugging	trace
makes the code much cleaner and easier to trace debugging

1171538
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
.when you create an asp.net-asp.net-mvc view page it inherited from a class as you said called viewpage - which in return inherited from the page class from asp.net webforms system.web.ui.page and implements the iviewdatacontainer interface from asp.net-mvc

1171541
communication	messages
additionally many programs and third party libs confuse wm_user and wm_app such that you may have programs communication cross process via both wm_user and wm_app via â œdangerousâ messages that are used to make sensitive decisions or include pointers parameters

1171541
windows-xp	windows
why aren t console windows themed on windows-xp

1171543
decimal	hex
if a designer were to use both types of color value in the same stylesheet they might opt for decimal value over hex codes for consistency

1171547

the basic idea is that you defined two tables and the identifier of the main table is used as the identifier of the related table with the understanding that the related table may contains duplicates identifier

1171551
adventureworks	northwind
the reverse is proven by how boring the northwind adventureworks demo s microsoft insists on using are

asp.net-mvc	webforms
you seem to be looking at this through a webforms perspective - something asp.net-mvc is not

1171570
contains	any
while your code works asp.net-mvc is largely about separation-of-concerns your controllers should contains the logic code of working with these cookies while the view is responsible only for rendering the page along with any viewdata the controllers passed to it

1171572
javascript	dom
for more fine grained control i will use javascript jquery to manipulate the dom directly rather than rendering partials

1171579
margins	padding
inorder to account for that you might need to change your margins padding by the width of the border

1171591

does website deployment project automatically include prerequisites for deployment or we should initially required to install all prerequisites at deployment enviounment before installing website

1171702
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know this is not asp.net-mvc but even in webforms i still think it s a good idea to have some separation between your data-layer and your webpage

1171704
subclassing	base-class
you could write your own textwritertracelistener subclassing which overrides the writeline methods decorates the line and then passes the decorated string to the base-class implementation to do the actual output

1171718
aspect-ratio	scale
where cliprectangle is the rectangle of the original image you wish to scale into the new bitmap you ll need to manually deal with aspect-ratio

1171732
deployment	install
a website deployment project will not do this for you - you will need to install this prior to your deployment to the webserver

1171753
double	int
if it won t use them up any time soon go with int otherwise double the key size and go with bigint

1171766

1171798
conditional	operators
operators control the types of the conditional expression

1171807
rollback	commit
the only function that the begin transactional commit transactional and rollback transactional cmd provide is to allow you to put two or more individual sql statements into the same transactional

1171813
value	field
since you in your structure have specified the fixed size for each of the field you don t need to pad the value with spaces in your code

1171824
webforms	asp.net
i have a submit button and back button in my asp.net webforms

1171833
absolute-path	realpath
i know it is possible to get an absolute-path of a file with realpath function

be sure that it s gethashcode and equals is based upon the two contains elements

1171874
artifactory	nexus
if you use an internal repository manager obligatory nexus and artifactory references here the overhead of purging the local repository is greatly reduced - you ll just have an increased local network traffic load

1171886
implements	abstract
you could generator iuserclass or iauthclass and implements this abstract interface into a concrete class and then i would go for a situation where the auth class implementsation took an iuserclass .when authentication to populate or the user class was given an implementsation of iauthclass to authentication against

1171888
updating	updates
.when i m updating several tables and the code logic might change down the road i can updates the stored proc and avoid a recompile

1171897

1171902
value	field
the id 502831 is not a row in my table and seems to be the next id that would be used if the row had been inserted. the problem is if i selected against those field with the same value

1171930
textbox	button
.so beside this splitdown button i have a textbox which is basically a search-box

1171930
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
.so as the above code-snippets show the 2 menu items as twb and pwb i have to fill the textbox .when twb is selected from the dropdown button and al.so the same text should be display on the button too twb

1171930
textbox	button
if i click pwb from the dropdownbutton i should get the pwb named on the button and the same pwb named should be display in the textbox too

1171931
latitude-longitude	location
you are saying that you actually get nan .when the two location have the exact same latitude-longitude

1171961
gethashcode	equals
create a custom key class and implements equals and gethashcode .so that any one component of the key is sufficient to find the entire key

1171971
value	field
your value in the field are numeric .so the extra single-quotes aren t needed

1171973
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms .when setting uiculture en in the page directive a response.write page.uiculture returns the string english instead of the two letter language code en

1171994
execution	exit
execution gets to the event handler for that ontaskchanged where a taskcompleted variables gets set to true which will exit the while-loop

1172000

1172006
compact-framework	.net
messaging in the .net compact-framework

1172012

1172037
cakephp	joomla	zend-framework	joomla	zend-framework	cakephp
if you don t feel like learning then perhaps invest in a framework like cakephp or zend-framework or a ready made systemd like wordpress or joomla

1172069

.net	wcf
installing wcf as part of the .net

1172101
xsd	xml
i ve been looking around for a way to programmatically parsing xsd files to generator an xml mapping .so that i can take any xsd file and create a parsing that will parsing any xml file that conforms to it and my google-fu has been coming up short

1172101
xsd	xml
are there any other options or standards libs available that will produce an xml file parsing from an xsd file

1172110
updating	updates
since you re updating part of your .app s visuals it would probably be wise to start with the fact that flash updates the screens on a fixed scheduling - once per frame - and it issues events before and afterwards

1172110
updating	updates
also even if you decided to call your updates every nth frame instead of every frame unless everything you d be updating is outside of the dirty rectangle it will be redraw every frame anyway regardless of whether you ve move it or not

1172115
children	tree	children	nodes
if the result-of the move never intends to change the topology of the tree .when x becomes the parent of its old parent y it gives all its children to y then the simplest might be to decouple the notion pyramid nodes from the users with one-to-one relationship

1172115
children	tree
since the topology of the tree does not change this would automagically take care of the children having a correct parent

1172120
background-image	height
it basically involves applying a background-image to the parent elements of the floated elements which makes you believe that the two elements are the same height

1172125

or the webserver that was cracked which allowed the attacker to upload code

1172183
ocaml	sml
aside from that there is an eclipse plugins for sml nj called ml-dev and odt for ocaml

1172213
push	pull	versioning	upgrade
you could upgrade your spring versioning it s unlikely that you ll have any problems and if push comes to shove you could pull just that org.springframework.transaction.jta.websphereuowtransactionmanager out of spring 2.5 and add it to your application

1172229
updating	updates
the main problem i faced is creating the necessary validation for every linq object in my project and updating the validation if the maximum length of the field is updates

1172238
document	editing
adding the extra xml document consolidates this data outside the stylesheet for easy editing and that is the approach i m going with and it works btw

1172248
http-redirect	request
every link i click on actually performs a .post request contains details of the page i want to the page i am already on the response with which is then an http-redirect to the page i want

interactive	chaco
while chaco generator attractive static plot for publication and presentation it also works well for interactive data-visualization and exploration

1173878
contains	any
don t think there is any built-in mysql function to do this .so you are probably best using php to do the work for you using either or to create an arrays contains each words

1173878
arrays	loops
then loops through each words in the arrays and count them

1173880
udp	tcp
for example .when i was working on the python logging package before it became part of python i had a test i didn t use pyunit unittest - it was just an ad-hoc scripting which fired up in one test four servers to listen on tcp udp http and http soap ports and then sent network traffic to them

1173885
updatepanel	gridview
even in trying to find an answer to this problem i haven t found any clear explanation especially one not discussing gridview on how to resolve the following error i receive .when running a program with an updatepanel

1173894
lookup	any
every time you call object s methods properties or just reference any variables you perform internal hash lookup

1173906
supervisor	worker
you link process to the supervisor hierarchy of your application for two reasons 1 to be able to restart your worker process if they crash and 2 to be able to kill all your process .when you stop the application

1173925
debugging	exit
if you run rather than debugging then visual-studio will open a con.sole windows that pauses after your application exit .so that you can still view the output

1173957
mkv	avi
most of the video containers avi ogg mkv mp4 have their own metadata formats

1173988
reliability	scalability
.so ultimately choosing between a server back end and a file-based .solution like jet ace is going to depend mostly on how valuable in terms of money the increased security scalability and reliability of a server database is

1173988
postgresql	mysql
sql-server-express seems to me like the much more natural upgrade path for such an .app though it has a 4gb limit on the total size of the database .so you re not gaining all that much over jet ace s 2gb limit and one could certain consider open-.source databases like mysql and postgresql that are entirely cost-free in terms of licensing

1173993
loading	gif
a google-search for loading gif returns quite a few examples

1174003

please note that i m not talking about building extensions plugins to cms systemd like drupal or joomla but full blown website scripting

1174031
cucumber	webrat
i m using webrat with cucumber and i would like to test if a radio-button is checked already .when i am on a page

1174048
arrays	loops
you cannot use a foreach loops to set value in an arrays

1174060
arrays	loops
the foreach loops goes through the value of the arrays not the indexes of the arrays

1174060
for-loop	arrays
to be able to index the arrays you need to use the traditional for-loop like this

1174066

the interface used by the base-class can be public which execute the desired code before passing information to the protected virtual-method

1174067
json	xml
including xml and json

1174083

1174084
arrays	loops
don t confuse loops counters and arrays values.

1174094
gzip	zip
for the most part if your server load is below 0.8 regularly i d just gzip anything that isn t binary like jpegs pngs and zip files

1174132
base-class	inherited
inherited all the shapes of the program from a base-class that implements the copy-paste

1174160
contains	elements
if elements is a htmlelements object then the .nextsibling methods itself does not contains a cast that would produce that problem but it does call another .nextsibling methods through an interface reference which means that reflector alone won t tell me which object is involved here

1174184
revision	updates
you can updates to older revision but you can t make changes there

1174184
directory	folder
first figure out what changes need to be made to get from r9 back to r8 of the repository folder svn repo trunk associated with the current directory the first .

the duplicates link contains a link to something like i m talking about

1174215
xsd	xml
i ve used the eclipse xsd libs to parsing xml schema in the past

1174227
function-call	inline
this new versioning may be less efficient with function pointers arguments as the particular function pointers is only derefenced and called at runtime whereas your function pointers templates can be optimized possibly the function-call inline based on the particular function pointers used

1174237
calayer	uiview	caanimation	calayer	caanimation	uiview
you will have to create a custom uiview or calayer to do the drawing and create a properties arc degree that can be animated with a caanimation object

1174239
dependency-properties	attached-properties
attached-properties are dependency-properties and as such support dependency properties value inherited

1174239

1174253
value	field
in the value view you can see the value for field in a methods that you are stepping through if the class was compiled with debugging tokens or the value of the arguments passed in if the class was not compiled with debugging on

1174269
temporary	copy
or since you can specify a directory simply construct as part of your unit test code a temporary directory in the temp directory of your computer copy a single assembly from your unit test project to it and ask the plugins systemd to scan that directory

1174280
click	mouse
now if someone move the mouse over a button menu and click once all it does is set focus to my windows

1174280
click	mouse
.so what i d like to do is repeat the mouse click .so it looks as though a single click both changed focus and pressed the button

1174296
constructor	private
controllers has a private constructor

1174298
show	next
i m trying to produce a linecharts using flot but i want the data labels to show up on the charts - meaning i want the value of each points to appear next to that points

1174299
getter	setter
i know i can work this around by defining getter and setter but what if i just want a simple public properties

1174299
getter	setter
i usually use getter and setter if there is something to do .when i set or get a properties but what if i just want to store a value

1174319
momentjs	datejs
if you are doing a lot of date work you may want to look into javascript date libs like datejs or momentjs

1174328
derived-class	base-class
wouldn t all instances of derived-class also be a base-class

1174328
derived-class	base-class
but i would think c# would be smart enough to know that a collections of derived-class has all the same properties as a collections of base-class

1174340
click	mouse
mouse click simulation seems a little messy here but you can always simulate any mouse click at any x y via the sendinput api through p invoke

1174357
defined	declare
i m not an actioscript programming but interfaces in java for example are meant to defined behavior not state .so intrerfaces in jave simply declare methods that the class implements the interface needs to defined

1174369
webforms	asp.net	textbox	button
i have a standards asp.net webforms with multiple textbox autopostback false on it and a save button

1174369
textbox	button
pressing enter while in any textbox is causing the server side click event of the save button to be invoked

1174369
textbox	button
if i put another button above the save button then it gets its click event invoked on any press of enter on a textbox

1174381
textbox	button
make sure your textbox are set to multiline as textmode if not enter key is execution a cmd button causing the postback

1174386
click	mouse
pressing the left mouse button simulates click down the screen.

1174386
click	mouse
what you want to do is hold down the right mouse button and drag since the right mouse button simulates a screens tap without click

1174391
derived-class	base-class
in the general case for collectionss that are modifiable it is not the case that a collections of derived-class has all the same properties as a collections of base-class into a collections of fruit you can insert banana apple and pear -- in a collections of orange you can t .so you see it doesn t have the same properties under modification

1174404
social	rating
but for a mockups i did not implements any of the social network design-patterns such as a login rating grouping etc

1174408
input-field	textarea
this is true for any webforms if you press enter while an input-field has focus the form will be submitted except textarea

1174412
configuration	logging
or you could use logging controlled by runtime options configuration files or registry settings for how verbose your logs will be

1174420
.war	jar
the tomcat run goal is intended to work with .war project i m guessing yours is a jar project

1174420
.war	jar
note i d recommend having a separate .war project to your jar project then adding the jars as dependencies to the .war

1174427
constructor	object
this is a little more verbous well you can always pass in an object to the constructor but it is much safer throw more reasonable value and is faster since avm2 is faster .when execution strictly typed code in contrast to dynamic code you actually make use of the interface .

1174445
http	ssl
i m pretty sure this is because the url is using http ssl protocols

1174447
getter	setter
however having just a getter or a setter with no implementation should work

1174467
fadeout	fadein
i think you can try using fadeout fadein too

1174476
python	java
though your example is in python and this is in java i think you should be able to follow the logic

1174528
contains	set
you need to have a pre-populated table or a function returning a table result set to join with that contains all the 1-hour slots you want in your result

1174532
configuration	environment
if you don t attach a debugger then the program will exit .so you could try wrapping the debugbreak call in a messagebox or .some other conditional codebase on an environment variables or configuration item

1174541
triggers	insert
what you could do is create an instead of insert triggers something like this

1174550

1174569
icollection	ienumerable
it looks like ienumerable icollection ilist and their generics equivalent are in separate branches

1174601
optional-parameters	named
another option is to hold on for the moment and then compress it all down .when c# 4 comes out with optional-parameters and named arguments - .so long as you don t need to call the code from any other languages which might not have those features

1174604
constructor	object
i see parameters to the constructor as being things which are either a necessary for proper construction of the object or b unchangeable after the fact

1174612
boolean	int
generally you will need a data structure to hold your date string boolean and int

1174613
constructor	object
but if you used the factory-pattern you can still keep the old constructor and the class implementation without introducing new code into the object

1174623
json	xml
can you do that with a web service that returns json as well as one that would pass back xml

1174642
any	set
if the dns is set up properly what do the access and error logs from nginx look like .when you access the dev sub-domain do they have any entries in them

contains	any
john ballinger attributies can contains any character data

1174651
json	xml
using attributes can keep xml competitive with json

1174675
constructor	object
if you move a constructor arguments to being a properties bear in mind that this will allow the consumer of your object to change that properties at any points

1174746
configuration	environment
on ce there was no configuration systemd .so it couldn t easily be ported to that environment and therefore causing serious fork in code that could have otherwised worked on nicely on both frameworks with only a couple of modifications

1174746
implements	abstract
i was calling that but through a static manager.dowork which was invoking its instances s dowork which usually ended up being common code in the providerbase class which checked the arguments did some work and finally called an abstract internaldowork which was implements in the customprovider class.

constructor	object
the constructor properties on an object is a pointers to the function that is used to construct it

1174783
constructor	object
if the object was created using curly-brackets the arrays literals notation or using new object then its constructor properties will

1174783
constructor	object
it seems that by using an object-literal as the prototype of an object you rendering the constructor properties almost worthless

i explicit set showindisplayform showineditform showinnewform value to true however .when i deploy feature and create list based on definition all i get is only a single title field in all forms

1177846
firefox	opera
unfortunately this is not supported in firefox 2 opera 9 or any versioning of ie

1177930
cassini	iis
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1177935
environment	restart
my advice would be to go into the the environment options and turn on the autosave options .so that you can restart delphi and not take a million years to find what you had open

1177939
lookup	any
if you want to find out what any methods does in ruby you can use the bundled ri tool .so you could types ri enumerable.inject to lookup the docs or search ruby-doc

1177960
click	mouse
.when multiple mouse button are pressed each press release and click results in a separate event

1177978
calayer	uiview
they are different named because uiview and calayer are different and have different terminology associated with them but they are functionally equivalent

1177998
append	input
note that will append the new character to the end of the string even if the input caret is in the middle of the string which most users will find highly confusing

1178006
variables	boolean
what i used to do to ensure that multiple button being pressed at once were treated as such was i would have a boolean variables for each button and .when it was pressed i would set it to true and .when it was release i would set the boolean to false

1178006
variables	boolean
then .when it came time to perform an action i would checked for the boolean variables sometimes i would have the actionlistener redirect to the methods call for determining what action was to happen next after setting the boolean

1178016
push	pull
the reason push won t do it by default is that it s trying to remind you to pull and merge in case you forgot

1178021
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object. stack-trace at subsonic.query.update.getcommand

1178024
contains	any
the real url does not contains any

1178028
moss	wss
sharepoint currently moss 2007 wss 3.0 makes custom dev a very painful and slow process

1178037
value	field
.when we generator the updates statement we compared the current value of every field to the value as they were on load and only updatess the changed field

1178046
ms-access	mysql
the fonts stinks ms-access always badly reformats the query it sometimes adds in metacharacters that break mysql and lastly but worstly if it can t parsing the sql it won t let you have access to it

1178052
32-bit	16-bit
a 32-bit aarrggbb value converted to a 16-bit argb value would be something like this

1178063
sftp	ssh
sftp ssh file transfer protocols gets my vote if it s a possibility

1178063
ftp	ssh
pretty much tunnel ftp through an ssh connection

1178063
web-services	security
...you could also try creating web-services that conform to the ws-security policy for messages based security depending on the model you go with your messages is encrypted using anything from username passwd pair to an x509 cert

1178067
csv	xml	export	csv
it can export the messages in binary or text csv no xml sorry

1178078
any	set
what is your mac os x intel based lisp setup of any dialect how do you like it and how painful was it to set up

1178090
click	mouse
the other items only refresh .when the user does something like mouse over another item in the list or click a different control

1178115
triggers	insert
set up a triggers on the table bar on insert that checked to see if the current row s id is present in the table already and reject it if .so

1178132
loading	gif
you can create an image that show a loading gif

1178132
.when	ready
this provides a callback to you notifying .when the flickr image is ready

1178132
loading	gif
then just swap out the loading gif for the image from flickr

1178133
player	movie
you have release the movie player

1178133
callback	methods
it seems you have release it elsewhere in your code probably in the callback methods

1178169
append	input
.so the most recent input you ve created has one copy of the click handler and append one 1

1178173
python	java	python	perl
i like using regex s for quick and dirty text clean-ups but i ve repeatedly run into issues where the common backtracking nfa implemtation used by perl java python .net show exponential behavior

1178175
asp.net-controls	dropdownlistfor
this isn t to do with asp.net-controls such as dropdownlistfor i tagged it asp.net-mvc

1178177
hide	show
in the load handler for the flickr image you would hide the loading image and show the flickr image

1178212
dfa	nfa
the resulting dfa s states represent power sets of the states in the nfa

1178212
dfa	nfa
the states in the nfa are linear to the size of the regular expression and therefore the dfa s states are exponential to the size of the regular expression

1178248
filtering	grouping
whenever i create a new site collections in wss i want to ensure that i can filtering the people picker to only show he relevant users for that grouping - can i automate this or would i have to manually do something like the above stsadm cmd

1178263
gridview	listview	databound	gridview
if this source is databound make sure the databound control gridview listview etc has their datakeynames properties set

1178272
value	field
with the proposal many tools that process annotations will have to checked whether a field s value is null lest they throw a nullpointerexception

1178282
any	set
acceptable yes but if you are using prism or di of any sort then it would make more sense to resolve it from the containers and then set the datacontext either in code or using a markup extension depending on your exact solution

1178293
required	checked
then .when i need to checked if an assembly is already on disk i can just checked the dictionary but this required me storing the public key in the database

1178312
jformattedtextfield	jcombobox
there is a data entry dialog with some input-field of different types jtextfield jcombobox jspinner jformattedtextfield

1178312
click	mouse
.when i activate the jformattedtextfields either by tabbing through the form or by click it with the mouse i would like it to selected all the text that it currently contains

1178312
jformattedtextfield	focuslistener
i did use a focuslistener focusadapter that call selectedall on the jformattedtextfield but it doesn t selected anything although the focusadapter s focusgained methods is called see code sample below

1178318
any	set
you might test this using a set of dependencies that is appropriate for your test rather than for any test of this object

1178346
aggregate	grouping
you can do it but the output is repetitious and therefore wasteful all the single items in a grouping will have the same aggregate data

1178358
freebsd	linux	linux	unix
it has a cocoa-bridge and the user-interface is written with it but based on a portable substrate - .so the same development-environment is available for windows and unix linux freebsd

1178390
selected	cell
if you mean you want the cell that was selected here s how

1178449
textbox	button
i have a view that has a single textbox and a couple button s below it

1178457
put	get
if you don t put a leading then you get the normals ruby-on-rails generator error messages

1178470
instrumentation	profiling
the only profiling i can find for wince is the remote call profiling which required the application be built with the platform builder .so the instrumentation hooks can be compiled in

1178473
selected	cell
it returns the path to the row selected not the row or cell itself

1178480
updating	updates
after the logic for updating the panels i ve tried various combinations of invalidate and repaint but the result is still the same - the gui does not updates until i say resize the windows

1178482
selected	button	value	field
on those field that differ between the two the form display toggle button in-place of the value allowing the user to selected which field on which trade to use as the valid value

1178494
command-prompt	command-line
this would give you the command-line with quotes that you would use at the command-prompt

1178544
environment	building
i have a nant scripting that does a full building and deployment to our dev environment

1178566
jquery	.post
the jquery function which makes the ajax .post request should return false

1178600
uitableview	uilabel
i have a view with a uilabel and a uitableview

1178624
json	xml
you could certainly use a textfield to store xml or json or any other form of text

1178640
.net	wcf
i ve done this with wcf and the data-members attributes but i can t upgrade this project to wcf right now as it is very large and the test server is win2k no .net 3+ for win2k

1178652
value	field
that way you could at least perform a contains query on available_fields to filtering results to only those with the field your trying to get vaules for but then the positioning is arbitrary .so you d still have to go through each result and process available_fields get get the positioning of the value

1178664
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods you have defined above are instances methods

1178665
put	get
put this in mysql.ttinclude to get stored-procedures generator

1178666
swing	awt
other stuff like validation invalidation etc. is left over from awt days i believe and revalidation does a better job and was added specifically for swing

1178674
common-lisp	lisp
ready lisp is a binding together of several popular common-lisp package especially for mac os x including aquamacs sbcl and slime

1178676
fflush	gets
i like the idea of a caching that gets fflush .when a threshold is reached

1178710
any	set
is there any way to set the document-root dynamically with php or to include an .htaccess or some such thing in a single folder on a server

1178722
javascript	dom
in terms of the javascript validation itself simply attach functions that updates the appropriate parts of the dom with success failure messages to the onchange etc

1178768
tga	png
encoding from multiple input image files jpeg png tga etc.

1178773
double	int
bool double int etc

1178794
diagram	erd
most of the architects here feel that creating uml diagram does not justify the time involved although we always have a erd and some informal flowchart kinda diagram for all project

1178801
arrays	loops
i used echo to printing out â data and it contains the data as expected but the same code without the line loops does not seperate the parts of my data into the arrays..in fact the arrays size of user remains empty what has gone wroung

1178823
push	pull
.when you push and pull on that branch it automatically pushes and pull to the remote branch that it is connect with

1178830
solaris	linux
in our project which supports multiplatform linux solaris and windows and coded in c and c++ we are using onc rpc for ipc

1178890
put	get
using eval allows you to get the content into your page but asp.net will not be able to put it back into an object for you

1178915
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
the simplest way to do this with recent versioning of jquery is to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events rather than mouseover and mouseout

1178925
build-system	cmake
if you intend to continue to support multiple platform you might consider moving to a cross-platform build-system like cmake or waf

1178929
any	set
the framework takes care of setting the actual reference to the properties by using a two-pass technique where they are all created first then those references are set avoiding any order issues

1178959
factors	primes
take multiplying primes vs factors into primes

1178965
put	get
is there a way that i can get the application to get the current user_id out of the site .so i can put that behind the scenes and prevent users stuffing the ballot box or voting as .someone else

1178966
multiplication	division
this involves multiplication and division but depending on how your numbers are represented you may be able to turn the division into multiplication or bit shifts if you re very lucky

1178967
findcontrol	asp.net
most suggested looping some said .net 2005 doesn t support direct refenece using string named and findcontrol methods was asp.net only.

1178982
32-bit	16-bit
you can extends as needed maybe going up to 32-bit angle and 16-bit tween angle and linearly interpolation in between very quickly

1179017
keyboard	mouse
open systemd preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

1179046
worksheet	excel
where i generator my own image and paste in to excel worksheet please can you tell me why its background-color is always blue

1179059
checkbox	textbox
my application has several screens all having several textbox checkbox combo-boxes not anything more

1179065
scheme	lisp
new lisp is an easy-install from the os x gui install from a os x package making it the easiest install of all lisp except perhaps for plt scheme

1179065
common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
if you are new to lisp and not too picky that it be common-lisp you should look at plt scheme

1179077
registration	login
the idea then would be to provide 2 links 1 for login and the other for registration both passing along destination information

1179093
panels	grid
you can see the below 2-row grid and a tabpanels as the header panels

1179114
credentials	account
if not create an account with the credentials provided

1179122
expression-blend	wpf
plus with the new expression-blend 3.0 that was release yesterday they have sketchflow wpf apps that you can shared with others and get feedback files from

1179124
32-bit	64bit
i ve verified that it works under 64bit windows running as a 32-bit program killing another 32-bit program but i ve not figured out how to embed the code into a windows program either 32-bit or 64bit

1179145
populate	row
200 queries instead of 1 will make the rdbms initializer dataset parsing the query fetch one row populate the dataset and send the results 200 time instead of 1 time

1179153
xlib	gdk	motif	gdk	motif	xlib
i m not using gdk or qt - just plain xlib xt and motif

1179154
getter	setter
from what i ve read properties and synthesize are used to tell the compiler to to generator getter and setter for various properties of our class

1179154
attributes	properties
.so i am confused .when i see the .source code of an .apple example the gktank that uses only one class for the whole game apart from the .app delegation and still most of the attributes of that class are defined in properties and are synthesized even if no other class will try to get set them

1179178
value	field
if i m understaning correctly i think you want to selected based on a criterion but also if the field has a value of null

1179182
arrays	loops
getting all the rows in one associativity arrays will also not make much difference to your scripting since you no doubt already have a loops for grabbing each individual row

1179182
arrays	loops
all you need do is modify this loops to iterate through the arrays you are given very minor tweak

1179197
click	mouse
i am writing an application to fully control the mouse click movement

1179197
click	mouse
for instances if i have the application running form fully transparency fullscreens then if i click the mouse button in normals case it will bring the application in background in focus - i need to stop this from happening click the button and nothing visible should happen on the screens as i need to process all the mouse activity and send it out using this application

1179204
getter-setter	getter	getter-setter	setter	getter	setter
by encapsulating the members as a properties with getter and setter the implementation details of the field may change while those details are abstracted by the getter-setter

1179211
put	get
i can t just put i in there as the counter for loops and get four instances out named player1 player2 etc

1179223
dictionary	arrays
from reading this example and from my slim knowledge of python it must be a shortcut for converting an arrays to a dictionary or something

1179251
contains	any
but even here you should have an arrays and checked that class is an authentication module before execution any code contains it as it s user-input and user-input can t be trusted

1179276
aggregate-functions	sum
item.name must appear in the grouping by clause or within an aggregate-functions such as sum or max

1179286
dictionary	arrays
the most basic solution for this would be to store the player in either an arrays or a dictionary keyed on the player named

1179292
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	wcf	asp.net-mvc	webforms
there is sharepoint infopath without sharepoint asp.net webforms with different controls for each runtime asp.net without webforms asp.net-mvc silverlight and wcf

1179292
webforms	asp.net
if i want to move away from using asp.net webforms and dataset what s the best way to move right now for data driven forms

1179313
python	ruby	ironpython	ironruby
ironruby and ironpython in silverlight the dynamic-languages and silverlight integration let you write browser applications with dynamic-languages like ruby and python

1179313
ironpython	ironruby
please visit ironruby or ironpython s website for using them in silverlight

1179328
sql-server-express	sql-server
edit to more clearly answer your question asp.net-mvc linq sql-server 2005 or 2008 choice sql-server-express etc

1179351
contains	any
this isn t necessarily any faster than doing the contains checked except that it will do them efficiently due to linq s streaming of results preventing any unnecessary contains calls..

1179358
hide	show
i can show and hide the tabs by grabbing their clientids and manually setting the visibility and display styles

1179370
dictionary	arrays
the search index could either be a sorted arrays for binary-search or a dictionary

1179370
dictionary	hashmap	duplicates	lookup
a dictionary would likely prove faster - both because dictionary are hashmap internally with o 1 lookup and a dictionary will naturally eliminate duplicates value in the search source - thereby reducing the numbers of comparions you need to perform

1179370
dictionary	arrays
populate the tokens into a search index either a sorted arrays or dictionary

1179409
reliability	robustness
but for things that need a bit more robustness or reliability i suggest that sleep is evil the problem with sleeping is that the thread is i m assuming windows here... is truly asleep - the scheduling will not run the thread until some time after sleep interval has passed

1179410
value	field
if you need to grouping an or with different value for each field you have to manually quote the value

1179416
callback	methods
with the callback methods

1179425
doxygen	latex
i would assume that doxygen is just passing the .tex file to the command-line in which case there should be a latex logfile with specific line numbers where errors occurred

1179466
variables	boolean
i would then remove the boolean cases of the variables by replacing them with string versioning with value of true or false

1179474
filtering	grouping
after that you just need to traversal the list once and filtering into new lists by the grouping column

1179488
arrays	loops
i am trying to loops through some of the lower levels of arrays items but .when i do it seems to only return one of the arrays items

1179496
contains	any
with the .net entity-framework and linq i m having a problem finding the best easiest to read understand way to implements a search for whether or not an entity collections contains any of several possible value

1179500
authentication	login
.when visiting the website and trying to authentication on the login page the user gets redirected back to the login page

1179500
authentication	login
i created a debugging page that the login page redirects to after a call to formsauthentication.setauthcookies that display information about the authentication cookies

1179503
sequences	unique
the customer id which started at 1001 the sequences of the order they made then the unique id from the order table

1179503
put	get
i suppose if you put dashes or spaces in you could even get us a little insight into the customer s purchasing habits

1179507
double-quotes	single-quotes
i would use double-quotes .when single-quotes cannot be used and vice versa

1179508
webforms	asp.net
learn the asp.net page lifecycle if you re doing webforms see

1179517
order	add
sequentially starting at some numbers 2468 and add some other numbers to it say the day of the month that the order was placed

1179526
reactive-programming	frp
the broader rx linq to events project sounds like functional reactive-programming frp in .net

1179534
export	report
some of my users will export these report to an excel workbook or a words document

1179534
export	report
.when the users export the report the report engine does not include the link in the office document

1179539
triggers	insert
you could fix this by putting a triggers in the database to clean up the entry - .when an insert is attempted instead do proper escaping on the input and then continue with the new insert input

1179540
click	mouse
what needs to happen is .when the mouse is click on the panels or frame - for now lets just say panels

1179559
submission	contact
upon submission the form the selection they made on page1.php in the pricing calculator as well as the contact info on page2.php are emailed to me and they are redirected to the home page

1179559
value	field
the second form uses hidden value to echo the info from page1.php and has three more field namedd named email and details

1179563
fdt	swc
well one possibility is to do the majority of your development with flashdevelop fdt or flexbuilder soon to be called flash-builder and have your output be a swc

1179563
fdt	swc
we building the majority of our flash project in this manner or sort of in reverse where we building the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development-environment we prefer fdt

1179572
put	get
also if you put in the form on page 2 with your variables posted from page 1 they should get passed right along

1179575
value	field
you would need to make page2.php read all the value from page1.php and store them either in a server side state session or a client state cookies or maybe hidden field in the form

1179577
void	main
you use this signature in c# static void main string arguments

1179588
cucumber	webrat
if i visit it will redirect to but i can t get the cucumber webrat tests i ve written to pass as i always get an error like this

1179598
arrays	loops
with both the above options you then have an arrays which you can loops over in a similar way to what you are doing now inorder to generator the html

1179599
value	field
in this case it .sounds like page1.php does not have any side effect and just passes on value .so the form on page1.php should use and the code of page2.php that reads these field can find them in

1179604
variables	boolean
is used to flip a boolean variables

1179613
credentials	security
i am trying to find out if using transport credentials types of none anonymous will pose a definite security risk

1179617
google-chrome	firefox
updates i tried using google-chrome instead of firefox and this particular problem doesn t appear

1179627
click	mouse
oh and if you want it to show up on any mouse click add a mouselistener and call show on the popupmenu

1179627
click	mouse
that will show it on any mouse click

1179634
spring	jsf
these use web-frameworks like struts or jsf or spring if you re a java programmer which provide elegant implementsation of dispatching request of mapping from request to classes that implements the request

1179638
joomla	drupal
i m building a cms like drupal and joomla

1179653
haskell	c++
bringing concepts to c++ would bring its types systemd almost to the same level of power as haskell typesclasses and it would ve been awesome - a language optimized for speed letting you do whatever you want and yet strictly typessafe unless you use escape vents while still remaining fast

1179653
boost	stl
it was also supposed to fix the long-standing problem of stl and boost and templates libs in general being hard to use because of lax compile-time duck-typing nature of c++03 templatess and the consequent troubles with compiler error report

1179664
ostream	std
then you can provide your own descendant of std basic_streambuf wrap it in a std ostream and use standards c++ i o on it

1179669
realloc	free
i m aware that there is a realloc function that would allow me to resize the memory block and it s paired with a free function

1179669
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
is there an equivalent keyword to realloc in c++ that would allow me to achieve the same goal .when the memory is paired using new delete rather than malloc or realloc and free

1179690
puts	gets
this suggests that it only gets messagess that are sent sendmessages which call the windows procedure directly not posted postmessages which puts the messages in the messages-queue

1179700
callback	methods
instead give the runnable task a callback that it can invoke at the end of its run methods to report the results of each execution of the task back to listener in other threads

1179714
sql-server	mysql
their intermediate plan is 16.95 per month with sql-server or their value plan is 7.95 per month with mysql

1179715
boolean	int
in vb int are converted to boolean automatically 0 - false everything else - true

1179728
version-control	git
git is distribute version-control systemd while subversion is centralized client-server version-control systemd

1179728
version-control	cvs
repeat myself a bit in centralized version-control systemd like cvs or subversion almost all cmd are process on server and involve network

1179728
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
in distribute version-control systemd like git mercurial or bazaar where you have local copy clone of a whole repository almost all cmd are performed on client

1179776
attributes	properties
datacontract need to have the properties you want serialization decorated with the data-members attributes

1179789
contains	set
create a batch-file that a call a python scripting or whatever that generator a temporay batch-file contains the appropriate set cmd

1179789
windows-xp	dos
it still seems to work under windows-xp be it report we re running dos 5.00

1179794
base-class	superclass	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	superclass
if i pass a subclassing object in as a parameter to a methods which takes a parameter of types superclass i should certainly be aware of that and know the internally the called methods will be working with the superclass aka base-class object only

1179794
subclassing	base-class
it seems to me only the unreasonable expectations that providing a subclassing where a base-class is requested would somehow result in subclassing specific results would cause slicing to be a problem

1179801
sniffing	traffic
you can add new styles and disable them just like in firebug though you don t get the traffic sniffing load time though

1179803
any	set
the result-of the compari.son function is an expression like the above which does not evaluate to true .so selected does not accept any elements .so you get an empty set

1179811
value	field
in other words using adcurrency for ado or oledb.currency will work for decimal value being saved to ms-access currency field

1179830
instances	self
in python this distinction is made more explicit by conventions the first parameter passed to a function is either named something like cls or self and indicates that the function might operate on the class .when it s a class methods or the instances the types you re more used to .when it s an instances methods

1179851
lighttpd	apache
on webfaction to save process power and more importantly memory it is better to serve these from your secondary apache server or even better from nginx or lighttpd without having to go through mod_python and django

1179859
membership	guid
i have seen some suggestions of using the member id as a query-string parameter however i feel this maybe open to abuse as the custom membership table i am working with uses int intead of guid s as the id field

1179860
digital-signature	signing
signing your macros with a digital-signature may do what you want

1179887
substitution	replace
a substitution variables is replace with its value .when the sqlplus client reads the cmd before it even send it to oracle for parsing

1179888
32-bit	64bit
i have found that 64bit jvms have been slower than 32-bit versioning

1179888
32-bit	64bit
however with the latest versioning java 6 updates 14 i have seen many of my tests are marginally faster with the 64bit versioning vs the 32-bit

1179888
32-bit	64bit
whether your program uses a 32-bit or 64bit versioning is down to the choice of jvm you use

1179900
configuration	environment
change the include_all_helpers configuration to false in any environment where you want to apply the configurationuration

1179900
configuration	environment
if you want the configuration to apply to all environment change it in application.rb

1179903
malloc	free
you malloc in every loops iterator but only free once at the end

1179905
shell	bash
during installation of your program just prompt the user and have a dos batch-file scripting or a bash shell scripting downloading and copy the jce into the proper systemd location

1179918
arrays	loops
in javascript it looks like a split a foreach loops on the arrays of terms pushing a term after changing a | term to or back into an arrays and a re join

1179927
pdostatement	bindparam
call pdostatement bindparam to bind php variables to the parameter markers bound variables pass their value as input and receive the output value if any of their associated parameter markers

1179928
put	get
i have a div tag and i need to put one ascx on the left that will get swapped out from time to time with another ascx and then a static ascx on the left

1179952
selected	cell
if you are hosting this composite cell in an nstableview that should be sufficient to get the correct background for selected rows

1179972
python	java
.some of them have been simple enough that the code has ended up in java and other changes have been complex enough that i wanted multiple sql statements and .so i ended up embedding them in shell and python both for portability scripting

1179974
postfix	dovecot
here is a tutorial for using postfix for sending mail and dovecot for accessing mail via imap

1180017
selected	textbox
i was thinking of doing a jquery selected on the textbox in the ascx and reducing their widths

1180023
hide	show
jquery using show and hide would work

1180035
javascript	dom
it allows you to easily inspect the dom debugging javascript and look at css styles for various page elements

1180043
windows-server	windows-xp
exlcuding windows-server os iis6 needs windows-xp pro 64bit and iis7 needs vista

1180057
any	set
next i m not sure what you mean by set to any purpose

1180057
any	set
and the description of the open ssl cmd and configuration file hasn t show a place that you could set any and have all of these turn on

1180066
32-bit	64bit
there are also some hacky methods to install iis5 on xp home but i don t think that there are hacks for iis6 on xp 32-bit thought 64bit xp apparently has iis6 available

1180068
rounding	currency
i have the need to format a decimal numbers as currency but i do not wish for any rounding to occur in the process

1180084
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
would return a wrapped set of any input radio that contains regular in the styles attributes

1180115
reportlab	pypdf
edit pypdf and reportlab look good but neither one will allow me to edit an existing pdf are there any other options

1180120

i also have convenience-methods to initializer and add entities with various attributes

1180161
codeigniter	cakephp
i have looked at zend cakephp and codeigniter and i have not been able to find an intuitive way to accomplish this

1180186
value	field
add a conditional compare listname field you can compare value in the field in your case your approve column

1180192
attributes	properties
i believe that the css width properties value will take precedence over the textarea s cols attributes it did in my browser - firefox 3.0 but you d want to test in other browsers

1180204
oracle	mysql
does oracle have an equivalent column types to mysql s text types

1180237
callback	methods
asp.net-ajax callback to web methods in aspx pages

1180246
children	nodes
the view is set up to cascade events to all of the children .so the root nodes can receive all updates i think i did that part correctly and the layer can match the target because it knows which layer it s rendering

1180257
value	field
.so my question is how should i go about keeping .some field from being on the page but al.so keeping the value in the database all with one stored procedure

1180260
union-all	union
even though its a union and not a union-all

1180274
dictionary	map	hashtable	set
python dictionary and set are both unordered containers which map to the basic data structure of a hashtable

1180296
value	field
i am trying to updates a field in a table by increasing its int value by 1

1180301
if-statement	while-loop
.so if you wanted to do 2 things in one leg of an if-statement or if you wanted to do more than one thing in the body of a while-loop you d need to brackets those statements with begin...end

1180306
if-statement	loops
where it is necessary is for loops and if-statement etc where you need more then one step.

1180317
if-statement	loops
you will need them for while loops and cursor which you will avoid if at all possible of course and if-statement well techincally you don t need them for an if statment that only has one line of code but it is easier to maintain the code if you always put them in after an if

1180337
textbox	button
is it just a textbox or button

1180340
google-chrome	opera
the browser might be mozilla ie opera google-chrome or any other mobiles device such as sonyericssonk610i samsung-sgh-e370 sonyericssont700 or nokian73-1

1180342
fatal-error	error-log
if by nothing happens you mean the visitor stays on the registration page and doesn t advance checked the javascript error-log for your browser and ensure that a fatal-error isn t keeping the form from being submitted

1180344
contains	sorted
i essentially have a sorted static list that contains various time that an event is supposed to happen

1180344
updating	updates
if any items above the current item will need updating before the the current item sleeps then go ahead and updates them

1180347
malloc	free
but if you start using malloc then you must do housekeeping be sure to call free at the right time memorize the size of the arrays somewhere and perhaps even have a size different from the arrays capacity you allocate more to avoid doing too much reallocs

1180349
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.11 gecko 2009060215 firefox 3.0.11 .net clr 4.0.20506

1180356
instances	self
that self arguments tells python what instances of the class the methods is being called on

1180360
value	field
instead you are setting your private field value something you don t have the ability to reference if you use the shortcut

1180390
click	mouse
i m currently trying to solve a problem where i need to find the positioning in a piece of text in a jeditorpane based on where the mouse was click

1180404
any	set
one trick can be to write code in default view which would actually set the month for you or redirect to any other view

1180405
value	field
i think the problem is you want to do the updates of all field in a single sql updates regardless of their value

1180407
value	field
it s certainly possible to have viewstate tracking value of properties for controls but not store data in the __viewstate hidden form field variables

1180407
value	field
viewstate will only be stored in the hidden __viewstate field after the statebag for a control starts tracking changes to properties value

1180411
shell	bash
in this case it seems that because fabric runs from within shell control is give over to fabric .so i can t use bash s .source built-in to .source .virtualenv myvenv bin activate

1180412
value	field
create these two tables and notice both of them have an id value set to auto-increment but the info table also has a pm_id field that would hold the id numbers of the data row that it refers to such that you re sure each row has a primary key in the info table that you can use to selected from

1180416
put	get
because the only thing that i get is the size of the longest path equivalent to the height and i cant put in the arrays the value regarding to the height of the bst.

1180420
parentheses	keyword
another difference between functions and language construct is that some of those can be called without parentheses like a keyword

1180441
groovy	java
groovy compiles to jvm-bytecode just like java

1180441
groovy	java
groovy has slower runtime performance to java in most areas since it is a dynamic-languages

1180441
groovy	java
you can have java code in your grails .app in addition to groovy code

1180445
triggers	insert
as janie wrote this event is triggers before the insert but you should be able to access the beforeproperties .so you don t have the use the itemadded event

1180460
json	xml
i was hoping someone has done this and can points me to a simple way if there is one to allow the user to login directly in my .app and then for me to go and fetch their contact for them preferably in xml but json would also do nicely

1180463
hide	show
that gives you an opportunity for example to hide a spoiler in final page but show it in normals view in the editor windows

1180466
put	get
extra bonus points if someone can show how to not only get the count but put some conditional too like count of only post which have been approved

1180469
directory	folder
the problem seems to be that eclipse does not realize that the directory src mycompany logging is a package directory --- instead it thinks it s a source folder in its own right analogous to src and that logentry is part of the default package in that folder

1180528
python	java	python	ruby
the sun cloud api seems to be a good candidate judging from the way it s documented and a statement by the author to the effect that ruby java and python implementation were in the works

1180535
.when	ready
acquirerequeststate is called .when asp.net runtime is ready to acquire the session state of the current http-request

1180535
.when	ready
if you interested in getting username you can do that in authenticationrequest which is raised .when asp.net runtime is ready to authentication the identity of the user and before the acquirerequeststate

1180547
contains	elements
and you d have two ctp files under views elements myfirstelement.ctp and mysecondelement.ctp that would contains the html you d like rendering

1180552
credentials	account
if the credentials are correct the identifying information of that cac is associated with the user s account in the systemd

1180553
varchar2	clob
a clob cannot be used in a grouping by clause and is much slower to use than a varchar2 in most cases

1180554
tree	trie
to optimize contains you need a tree or trie structure of your positive negative words

1180559
any	set
if i set any of the seo settings to yes and perform a search from search form left side on home page it is showing the results on index.php properly.but .when i click on the named link from the search result it should open the .profile of the person in popup windows but pop windows show

1180601
methodology	waterfall
i didn t hear the term but in the agile or scrum methodology the implementation happen frequently than the traditional waterfall model but obviously not continuously as in continuous implementation

1180606
stderr	stdout
warning this will deadlock if the child-process generator enough output to a stdout or stderr pipe such that it blocks waiting for the os pipe buffering to accept more data

1180606
stderr	stdout
i do need the return-value from the execute and do parsing and use both the stdout and stderr

1180607
actioncontroller	activeresource
one caveat of this solution this changes the logger level for all of activerecord actioncontroller actionview actionmailer and activeresource

1180641
stderr	stdout
if the application writes a lot to stderr and nothing to stdout then your process will sit waiting for data on stdout that isn t coming while the program you re running sits there waiting for the stuff it wrote to stderr to be read which it never will be--since you re waiting for stdout

1180641
stderr	stdout
another simple approach is to redirect stderr to stdout .so you only have one incoming file set

1180641
stderr	stdout
this lets you read in a nonblocking way you get data whenever data appears on either stdout or stderr

1180676
key-value	key
basically for every elements within the arrays you are breaking it into its key and its value ie countreis key-value

1180679
account	api
for instances the application in this case had a user account tied to a web application .so on load the application would initializer the singleton object and .when the user signed in it would keep a reference to the user object in the singleton .so that user info could be referenced for api call

1180727
put	get	administration	integrated
.when i deploy it to an iis 6 site with integrated windows-authentication turned on all request get .post put and delete work fine for me because i am an administration on the box

1180727
put	get
.when they try a put or delete request they get an http 401.3 access is denied error

1180732
checkbox	button
in your submit button s eventhandler you would loops through each tablerow cell then determine whether the cell s children control contains a checkbox

1180732
gridview	datalist
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1180745
widget	button
a simple-form with modelchoicefield display as radio button the inherited widget

1180745
radio-button	selected
i m using an onchange event to .post everytime a user selected a radio-button

1180751
any	set
should i do this by setting both time value to null and .when any queries are run null will be dealt with as need be perhaps reversing the time left and time arrives .so it comes out to zero on both ends or should i have both time arrived and time left both set to the expected shift end time .so that it works out to zero

1180769
authentication	login
this login form has two textbox one for user named and one for passwd and .when the user submit the form they should be authentication and there user info insert in the session

1180776
environment	building	environment	execution
the xbean.jar versioning is the same in the building and execution environment

1180814
double-quotes	spaces	double-quotes	single-quotes
how can i replace all occurrences of double-quotes and single-quotes with a spaces with javascript regex

1180818
pointers	stack
basically you have to choose the right types of the pointers to get the address you want on stack

1180828
constructor	object
the only barely reasonable case i know of is .when you want to pass a pointers to the object itself to its constructor

1180828
linked-list	nodes
for example say you have a cyclic linked-list nodes

1180829
core-animation	catransform3d
for catransform3d 3-d core-animation transforms you can refer to their documentation which does a good job of explaining the fundamentals

1180829
core-animation	catransform3d
if you re interested in examples i describe how i improved some opengl rendering tasks by using the structure here and i have source code for an iphone application that does 3-d rotation and perspective effects using catransform3d and core-animation here

1180830
put	get
also there are things that get put on stack that you may not be aware of return address stack frame registers etc. and not jumping past .when trying to grab things higher up on stack

1180852
children	tree
i wonder if there is a way to setup a virtual filesystems for a process and its children .so that several process tree will see different c building directory private to them only all at the same time.

1180859
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework 3.5 redistributable

1180860
getter	setter
we re often told we should protect encapsulation by making getter and setter methods properties in c# for class field instead of exposing the field to the outside world

1180860
any	set	value	field
but there are many time .when a field is just there to hold a value and doesn t required any computation to get or set

1180864
protected	public
.so .when you have an integration points with other classes - any public and generally protected member you want to plan for future growth

1180885
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
today i get this error terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - nscfnumber decimalnumberbydividingby withbehavior unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0xd1fb10

1180886
key-value	key
updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from other overwriting existing key

1180892
binary	hex
use dumpbin all to dump all details of a binary to a text hex dump

1180905
attributes	properties
do i create a new class for every attributes table and have the primary class hold these as properties

1180910
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome though text-decoration none is ignore and the underline stretch unattractively across the bottom of the icons

1180923
attributes	properties
if the relationship between main table and attributes table is 1 1 there is one or only one activerecording in attributes table for a given recording in main table i would have a properties for every attributes in attributes table s

1180923
attributes	properties
main entity class would then have a properties for each attributes table which would be a list of types since there can be many recordinging in attributes table for a given recording in main table

1180925
button	popup
i m making an edit button which popup a modal box with a form to edit it

1180927
spritebatch	xna
basiceffect and spritebatch object are just shader that the xna team bundled with the release

1180970
click	mouse
it stopped all the bubbling on the click event of the button ie if you try checked the document body it won t have mouse click event anymore

1180971
cvs	git	difference	factors
part of that is that i ve been using cvs for almost a decade and git for under a year .so i ve had a lot more opportunities to get into trouble with the centralized model but difference in the properties of the workflow between the two model are al.so major contributing factors

1180971
difference	factors
the only difference between discarding data and losing it is that you meant to discard it. the biggest contributing factors is probably a quirk of my workflow habits - my working copy .when i m using a dvcs is often several different copies spread out over multiple computers .so corruption or loss in a single repo or even catastrophic data loss on the computer i ve been working on is less likely to destroy the only copy of the data

1180973
getter	setter
if you need to execute some code .when properties is read written make it readonly or lazily fetch from the database then you should use normals getter setter getage setage

1180974
ip-address	proxy
this is all fine except that myservice needs to know the client ip-address which always turns out to be 127.0.0.1 due to the proxy

1180985
contains	elements
in that part it contains the definition of all user-interface elements fonts default value etc

1180986
google-chrome	firefox
my current implementation is below which works in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome

1181002
ubuntu	linux
i ve attempted this thus far on my mac os x machine and on a linux ubuntu virtual-machine that i m running

1181002
ubuntu	linux
here is the results from the entire build-process from my ubuntu linux v9.04 machine.

1181010
arrays	loops
in the getpeople loops i am alloc ing a person retaincount 1 then adding it to arrays

1181011
contains	set
set your environment variables pythonstartup to points to a file that contains for example

1181014
bazaar	git
none of the current dvcs i know of git bazaar hg support this well

1181030
put	get
no get variables for a hacker to exploit and a pretty easy to put on another blog or business card url

1181032
put	get
i d like it not to focus .so much on patterns and other principles as much as just how to get started and actually put my thoughts in a professional document that i can use to building my project from

1181041
nsmutablearray	nsarray
as far as nsarray and nsmutablearray addobject someone else will have to comment

1181041
getter	setter
synthesize basically creates setter and getter for you and if you call out retain specifically the setter is going to retain the object passed in to it

1181061
nested	order
the order of the resulting arrays doesn t matter but if the original arrays has three words lists then the resulting nested arrayss should be three wordss long

1181062
arrays	loops
in the code above the arrays should own the object not you outside of loops you don t even have reference to it except through the arrays

1181067
python	php	ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails python on django php on not sure -- maybe zend

1181067
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
if i misunderstood you and you d rather stick with java gwt seems pretty cool -- it s the only real way to avoid explicit writing javascript if you do want to learn and use .some javascript i per.sonally am in love with dojo but jquery is substantially more popular those are two good popular frameworks you should consider though there are others of course like for all languages i mentioned .so far

1181098
logistic-regression	glm
glm for generalised linear model eg for logistic-regression

1181105
authentication	login
assuming i am using safe login scripting are there any security holes in simply performing an additional query upon successful login against the roles table to discover the user s authentication level and storing this into a session variables

1181110
authentication	logout	authentication	login	logout	login
as for the systemd you re using that is acceptable and is a good way to save database call but keep in mind that it will required the user to logout and login again for any authentication changes to apply

1181117
private-members	instances
note that this methods does not have access to private-members of fooclass but it is accessible through any instances of fooclass

1181118
library-project	libs
i ve tried creating a new static library-project then i added the project to my main project by going to preferences- link- libs and adding my library-project but the code-completion feature does not find the .h file of my library-project .when i try to #include it the project also won t building

1181126
lookup	any
accessing private from within any of your functions will be quite a lot faster than accessing public because the location of private can be determined reasonably well just with a static lookup by the javascript engine

1181135
fflush	stdout
however even .when i explicit fflush stdout the server seems to wait for the scripting to complete before sending the response to the client

1181144
spaces	output
and what can i do to ensure that clientid does not output comma spaces or other characters that can cause problems in javascript

1181158
nofollow	noindex
how about noindex and nofollow

1181177
pascal	basic
from basic pascal assembly and a spattering of various classes in programming languages class

1181207
any	set
please test against an input set and report any failure .so i can adequate it

1181223
constructor	object
umm although you set item1 in the first appcontroller object the one that is created by the application because it was associated with a nib file you are creating a second appcontroller object directly through the default init constructor whose item1 was never set

1181249
windows	ms-dos
on unix and i think ms-dos and hence windows follows unix closely enough here that it is not a difference between the systemd then you can have any numbers of consecutive slashes at any points in a pathname and it is equivalent to a single slash

1181265
.when	ready
each of us can freely branch each and every feature we need to work on get it working in a sandbox without interference from our shared repository and .when we are ready merge it back in

1181270
imagemagick-convert	gimp
i have tried gimp jpeg2ps and imagemagick-convert to convert my jpeg files into eps files

1181277
administration	account
the issue is .when i access i suppose in web browser we can browse the content of wsdl and i create a new website which uses ports 9999 and run application-pool under administration account i am met with the following error any ideas what is wrong

1181316
versioning	upgrade
if i have multiple webserver written in erlang running load balanced and mnesia is used for the backend database what is the best way to upgrade the whole systemd to a newer versioning

1181318
.net	wcf
in the .net 3.0 wcf directory c windows microsoft.net framework v3.0 windows communication foundation run servicemodelreg -r

1181326
jquery	.post
in jquery there s a very helpful ajax function using which you can send get .post request to any webpage and use the retrieved information which can be html in your page

1181332
syntax-highlighting	textmate
combined with textpow it allows you to rendering the same syntax-highlighting that you see in textmate on to things like webpage

1181342
python	c++
one of my favorite list of algorithm problems is project euler they are pretty diverse and you can solve the same problem many time for optimizations and you will find lots of communities c++ c# python .

1181346
httpd.conf	.htaccess
i m not sure if i m putting the rules in the right place and i understand that you can do this in a httpd.conf file and not the .htaccess

1181358
put	get
after you get the transformed string you can just use eval and put its value into the residual or f vector in your case

1181404
while-loop	loops
if you don t want for loops how about a while-loop

1181449
contains	any
any named that contains characters that are not 7bit ascii

1181462
python	c++
i ve been seeing some examples of python being used with c++ and i m trying to understand why would someone want to do it

1181462
python	c++
what are the benefits of calling c++ code from an external language such as python

1181464
click	mouse
how does one control the mouse cursor in python move it to certain positioning and click under windows

1181468
python	c++
it s likely the c++ code is faster smaller than equivalent python

1181475
python	c++
calling c++ code from a python application

1181475
python	c++
highly dynamic-languages like python are typically somewhat slower then native-code such as c++

1181475
python	c++
features of c++ such as manual memory-management allows for the development of very fast libs which can then be called from python inorder to gain performance

1181475
python	c++
calling python code from a c++ application

1181476
python	c++
generally you d call c++ from python inorder to use an existing libs or other functionality

1181481
python	c++
because c++ provides a direct way of calling os service and if used in a careful way can produce code that is more efficient in memory and time whereas python is a high-level language and is less painful to use in those situations where utter efficiency isn t a concern and where you already have libs giving you access to the service you need

1181481
python	c++
i can t speak for python specifically but i ve heard people talk in terms of tripling their productivity by doing most of their development in it and using c++ only where show to be necessary by profiling or to create extra libs

1181491
variables	boolean
i use the bool types for variabless as i was used to in c++ and i try to put the value of functions or properties i expect to be boolean into my variables

1181503
push	pull
i would like to learn about ajax push and pull concepts

1182145
contains	elements
assuming every elements has a elements and they all contains valid int you could use

1182150

but .when posting back by textchanged event of my textbox my requiredfieldvalidator appears but still i can submit my form with nothing in the textbox

1182153
constructor-overloading	base-class
i m referring to both constructor-overloading in a simple class and constructor-overloading while inheriting an already overloaded class meaning the base-class has overloaded constructor

1182162
constructor	object
the reason for this is that it makes it much clearer what is the construct state of the object is - really you can think of the primary constructor as the only real constructor the others just delegation to it

1182162
subclassing	superclass
for subclassing where the superclass already has overloaded constructor i would tend to assume that it is reasonable to treat any of the parent class s constructor as primary and think it is perfectly legitimate not to have a single primary constructor

1182195
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
opacity is applied in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie and opera

1182200
any	set
this minimum set is computed by removing from the list of available options any options appearing on the left hand of a composed constraint

1182200
any	set
cccx is the numbers of combinations possible by taking the minimum set replacing any grouping for which there s an option on the left hand of ccx with that option and then removing any options on the right hand of ccx

1182200
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
since there are no two ccs with the same left hand and the minimum set does not contains the left hand of any cc by definition then any two cc can be distinguished by at least one option which is selected for one but not for the other

1182200
contains	set
for the second proof note that the set of ccs contains by definition all valid combinations for options on the left hand

1182200
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
if this combinations does not contains any left-hand option then it must be a combinations from the minimum set by definition

1182200
contains	set
since the set of ccs contains all valid combinations for the left hand then there is one cc with the same left-hand options

1182200
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
the minimum set does not contains any option in the left hand of any grouping

1182200
any	set
any option that is incompatible with that left hand must appear in the right hand and any option from that right hand must be removed from the minimum set

1182200
any	set
since no options on the minimum set where incompatible between themselves to begin with there can be no unsatisfied constraint in any combinations on a cc

1182200
grouping	sorting
also by sorting the rules before-hand successive rules in the same grouping may be discarded without even testing for incompatibility with the right data-structures

1182204
value	field
whats even weirder is that .when i view the table in navicat - i notice the field of abbreviation is-empty for that tuples which has the required value but .when i hover over it or highlight it - i can see the value

in vb.net i ve found that using the monitor class to lock the private instances variables is really handy

1182436
double	int
please do note that although some msdn documentation claims that reading to or writing from a value-type int double etc is an atomicity operation and hence thread-safe this is seldom true in actual vb code

1182442
perl	php	webforms	asp.net
i have programmed in perl asp classic then coldfusion then php then asp.net webforms then asp.net mvc...the only thing that they all have in common is the underlying database-design patterns best practices for a given set of technology and...html javascript css and photoshop

1182544
ssms	ssis
your developers will not be able to use .some features sql-agent jobs ssis bi olap dm report builder full replication mirroring and .so on will not be able to test against large loads of data will not have the management tools ssms at their disposal

1182547
heuristics	greedy
the reason why is actually pretty simple the path will always try to have the lowest heuristics possible because it searches in a greedy manner

1182548
png	gif
that png or gif that s only 10kb might actually be much much greater in size once the browser loads it in memory

1182561
selected	checkbox
from there i add a column of checkbox .so they can selected bug-tracking items to go with the release request

1182562

1182589
linked-list	arrays
as the 2 previous replies suggest you can use an arrays of pointers a linked-list etc

1182606
jedit	vim
i have tried aptana radrails vim with ruby scripting jedit with ruby support etc

1182640
printf	scanf
in particular the non-floating-point versioning of printf and scanf save spaces by not including code to handle e f and g

1182648
contains	elements
i have elements that represents the menu button and another not-related maning it is not a child that contains the menu items mixed stuff images etc

1182648

it should hide back .when i leave the button or .when i leave the content div in case i m selected items or doing stuff there

1182648
mouseover	mouseout
i solved the problem using hover insted of mouseover mouseout

1182673
python	java	python	c++	python	ruby
then i branched off and learned c for memory-management in a low-level language and then ruby + python to learn another interpreted-language then scheme to learn the functional paradigms then objective-c and then java c++ and c#

1182673
ruby	php
if he wants to do web work i suggest he learn html it is a great way to get into computers without being a real language then php even though a lot of people here don t like it its a good first language and then javascript and possibly ruby

1182673
python	c++
if he wants to get into windows programming i suggest he learn c++ and c# and python starting with python or c if he daring...

1182673
python	ruby
if he wants to learn mac programming learn c objective-c and either ruby or python

1182685
haskell	prolog
several implementation for prolog naturally and haskell as well as a unfortunately unmaintained prototype for java jck

1182686
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you probably serialization to a stringwriter or directly to a stringbuilder

1182695
bison	yacc
templates metaprogramming can be used to easily write recursive-descent language parsing and these can be inefficient compared to a carefully crafted c program or a table-based implementation flex bison yacc

1182707
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you do not have to replace webforms controls with something else from asp.net-mvc

1182708
google-chrome	firefox
both of the above approaches work on ie firefox and google-chrome browsers

1182722
variables	boolean
putting something in an if-statement is simply evaluation the variables there as a boolean

1182725
endpoint	uri
to prevent the service from abort idle sessions prematurely increase the receive timeout on the service endpoint s binding.http get error uri there was an error downloading

1182725
bad-request	http-status
the request failed with http-status 400 bad-request

1182753
deployment	install
deployment that run the rake gem install can act kind of wonky especially if you upgrade a framework gem you have to do these manually

1182753
versioning	upgrade
obviously you want to try to run the latest versioning to make upgrade less painful

1182763
compile-time	hardcode
the trick about templates metaprogramming or generics in general is that it allows a lot of computation to be move to compile-time and it enables flexible parameterized code that is just as efficient as hardcode value

1182764
linked-list	nodes
a relatively simple fix would should be isolate that code a bit and have it say generator a linked-list of nodes before the rest of the process step

1182764
linked-list	nodes
once you building the linked-list however you should just be able to do a for nodes n mynewlinkedlist instead of the

1182810
stderr	stdout
however the best way of solving this problem is two create two threads one for stdout and one for stderr which read those respective streaming until exhausted and do whatever you need with the output

1182810
stderr	stdout
however this buffering the stdout stderr of the subprocess in memory and you get those returned from the communication call - this is not ideal for some scenarios

1182810
stderr	stdout
another example is in a package i maintain python-gnupg where the gnupg executable is spawned via subprocess to do the heavy lifting and the python wrapper spawn threads to read gnupg s stdout and stderr and consume them as data is produced by gnupg

1182810
stderr	stdout
data produced by gnupg to both stdout and stderr can be quite large in the general case

1182818
selected	checkbox
examples include the two-pane list of all items and list of selected items or a list of all recording and a checkbox beside each one that applies

1182837
calloc	malloc
i m currently facing the following problem every several hours my server crash with a segfault and the core dump show that error happens in malloc calloc which is definitely a sign of memory being corrupt somewhere

1182838
dbghelp	dump
if the web-app has the access rights to do .so and you can deploy new code the environment then you can manually create the dump file with the use of the dbghelp api

1182851
textbox	button
then i click on the add button which adds new user-controls item to the panels and this new control gets value from previous one to be more even more confusing new control do not get all value only form the disabled textbox control and dropdownlistfor

1182859

calayer	uiview
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels i wonder how that would look .when i create a calayer only

1182871
plugins	add-on
i even tried disabling all my add-on and plugins but to no avail

1182873
fault-tolerance	scalability
nosql-style dbs such as googles bigtable and couchdb are massively scalability and very cheap but can get very complicated to write an .app on top of as developers have to deal with all kinds of data consistency fault-tolerance issues in thier .application layer

1182878
google-chrome	safari
mozilla s and safari google-chrome s engines are just trying to make life a little easier

1182882
knapsack-problem	bin-packing
i just remember that a fellow student used evolution strategies to solve the problem of how to optimally distribute a set of files onto several dvds for archival which is i think an application of the knapsack-problem or bin-packing problem and it worked quite well

1182888
firefox	gecko
firefox and other mozilla browsers iceweasel etc use gecko

1182888
google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
safari google-google-chrome and konqueror use webkit although on 04 03 2013 google announced that google-chrome will use its own fork from webkit named blink

1182893
onmousedown	mousedown	click	mouse
after reviewing the suggested answers i need to clarify that what i was attempting to do was to take action on the mouse click in the mousedown event actually onmousedown methods of a control

1182893
click	mouse
because it appears that .net will always raise two mousedown events .when both the left and right button on the mouse are click one for each button i m guessing the only way to do this would be either do some low-level windows messages management or to implements some sort of delayed-execution of an action after mousedown

1182897
calayer	uiview
.so is it any useful to make a calayer only instead of an uiview that comes along with a whole bunch of them all those trees...

1182903

webserver	upload
.when using flash to upload a file to a webserver it send cookies from ie only

1182933
numeric	digits
it is a direct mapping of unicode digits characters well really their offset to their numeric value

1182942
arrays	loops
most likely you could hack something together to make the inner loops use arrays without changing all that much code

1182962
cursor	row
it sounds to me like you d be better of not using a cursor and simply selected a row at a time

1182972
calayer	uiview
you use calayer .when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and .when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview

1182976
png	gif
gif images only support transparency not transparency unlike other formats like png that have full alpha support .so you can do things like have 40 transparency pixels

1182979
arrays	loops
to loops over each result you can simply loops over the result properties like an arrays for example like this

1182988
contains	elements
in my canvas elements i want to add a draggable text over an image.user should able to move it within the canvas area.i could add text by using some api functions but i have no idea of movable text.do i need to use div tag to contains text

1182996
diagram	erd
viewing the second diagram as the physical erd model - there s no benefit to having two tables with a one-to-one relationship

1182999
order	add
now i need to add a possibility to close order with specifying a reason why order is closed for example offered price is too high for customer not available customer asked to close the order

1182999
order	add
i think that if i just add closereasonid column to order table it will not be good

1183007
logout	login
i would like to know about managing user s login and logout on iphone native apps

1183009
value	field
i am trying to access request parameters on a webpage and trying to set a hidden field value to the passed parameter

1183012
compression	streaming
the zipping algorithm works on streaminging and adapts its internal codings to what the streaming contains to achieve its high compression ratio

1183024
checkbox	textbox
then you can have anything you want in there - a table textbox checkbox etc

1183028
onmousedown	onmouseup
in onmousedown you simply remember the button pressed and in onmouseup just checked what button were remembered as well as clear the state for the button

1183030
decrement	increment
go right until you hit your upper column bound decrement your upper column bound go down until you hit your upper row bound decrement your upper row bound go left until you hit your lower column bound increment your lower column bound go up until you hit your lower row bound increment your lower-bound and repeat until your upper and low row or column bounds are equals or until your running count is m n

1183036
jface	swt
there s a tutorial on using jface and swt to create a file explorer you might find useful

1183070
any	set
any time you customize a styles use cellstyles and then with cellstylesmanager set it

1183073
calayer	uiview
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance-variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated

1183101
assign	add
now if you add an entry to your database the id will be automatically updates from the value assign to it by the database

joomla	drupal
two most important features i m looking for that i couldn t find in any popular cms blogging engine from my favorite textpattern to wordpress joomla and drupal are

1183127
contains	any	contains	elements
i have an arrays that can contains any numbers of elements

1183127
contains	any	contains	elements
each elements contains an id and an arrays called options also with any numbers of elementss

1183127
value	field
each key is the id field + an option arrays value and the value is an arrays of the next elements and then the next and .so on

1183127
contains	any	contains	elements
because the arrays can contains any numbers of elements i m assuming i would need to include some types of recursive function

1183129
updating	updates
it would be much easier for me to updates the table by simply updating toggle_14 to off rather than parsing a csv changing it and reload it

1183142
value	field
the field togglestate in the scenariotoggles table will hold the on off value

1183145
mousedown	mouseup
i would personally use the mouseup and mousedown events for a more cleaner way to handle it and to avoid interop

1183146
value	field
there s no way for the query to skip items just because one field has duplicates value

1183150
versioning	upgrade
if there s a fundamental problem with the upgrade you can keep using the old versioning until the problem with the libs is fixed

1183151
boolean	int
i m constantly running up against this .when writing queries with linq-to-xml the value properties of an xelement is a string but the data may actually be an int boolean etc

1183167
value	field
in my actual project i retrieve the struct internally and then copy all the field value from the struct to the matching members on the instances of the class passed to the methods by the client

1183168
python	php
i can t provide a php one but a python one

1183176
selected	textbox
the user-controls has a simple combobox where the user selected the id for the user and therefore the person recording with that id should be loaded its data fetched from the database and then the firstname lastname and email will display in the textbox

1183215
executable	upx
or you can create a single compressed executable with all the needed assemblies that is auto decompression .when started like the popular aspack and upx do for windows executable

1183224
filtering	grouping
optimally the grouping-by-title step could be done first .so the inner groupinging first by .source to compute the index then by index to filtering out duplicates can operate on small numbers of object in each by title grouping since the # of document in each by-title grouping is usually under 100

1183234
updating	updates
if you updates an int this often results in a new object created which is many order of magnitude than updating an int value

1183252
while-loop	infinite
i currently have my project running two separate threads one for mfc operations like views formviews application windows etc. and one for an infinite while-loop in its main function

1183252
debugging	exit
however for certain situations .when i run my program in debugging mode i have noticed that one of the threads exit status was a 1 in other words it returned a non-zero numbers to the operating systemd

1183256
authentication	login
personally i get the user to enter their login info once store it in a preferences file then use that saved information .when ever the server request the user to authentication - if your using nsurlconnection then you can use something like

1183271
required	checked
i m not familiar with restful-auth .so i don t know the exact checked that would be required

1183273
dsa	rsa
what this means is do not roll your own rsa dsa whatever encryption algorithm

1183295
grouping	sorting
sorting and grouping post

1183295
grouping	sorting
or sorting and grouping elements

1183317
contains	any
well what you could do is you could first filtering the line which don t contains any html tags with something like

1183326
itemtemplate	expander
i have an expander in the itemtemplate of a listbox

1183326
selected	listbox
i need the listbox item selected .when the user expands the expander because as far as the user is concerned the item is now selected .when it really isn t

1183335
input-devices	keyboard
michael groom general sales manager at cherry electrical product comments the klingon keyboard is the first step in providing pc input-devices for all federation cultures and will aid communication between earth and other cultures within the federation that fall outside the domain of starfleet cmd

1183340
textbox	button
i modified the datapager controltemplate and added a textbox with an x named of testtextbox inside the datapager s border right before the standards datapager button but i can t seem to get a reference to that textbox in the user-controls code-behind

1183358
jface	swt
you can implements this in your own swt jface application as well

1183358
text-editor	editor
the sample application is a sql editor and it is describe in chapter 26 building a custom text-editor with jface text. there s actually an online overview of the chapter here

1183368
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
works across ie firefox google-chrome safari and supposedly opera too but haven t tested that

1183378
difference	factors
obviously there are a lot of factors that could make a difference in your specific case but there is no meaningful performance difference in running mysql queries versus using include

1183382
credentials	account
where the username and passwd are provided as the credentials for my local desktop account

1183386
filehandle	stdin	stderr	stdout
it handles the complexity associated with invoking gnupg which would normally involve creating multiple filehandle other than stdout stdin and stderr among other things.

1183404
selected	listbox
updates if you need to avoid the automatic collapse .when you selected another item make listbox selectedion mode to multiple

1183405
put	get
and if you want to skip line until the closing tag you can do that where i put -- but it s becoming to become harder to read understand and parsing html by-hand might not be such a good idea if you want to get to something complicated

1183409
vba	vb6
not sure how well it works with vba but in vb6 this is what i would use

1183420
python	php
if you had no experience in either python ruby-on-rails or php which would you go with and why

1183424
base-class	inherited
i learned at that moment that you can t inherited the constructor of the base-class

1183428
tuples	set
.so based on the tuples above i might add 405 id1 10 id4 to the set and would want the output to have id4 id2 id3 id1 inorder

1183428
contains	sorted
data is a dictionary contains the lists of sorted data

1183429
contains	elements	show	next
if you provide it with the schema it will not only validation the xml it will also provide intellisense - it will show the valid next elements or attributes and will even show tooltip contains documentation from the schema

1183440
python	php
ruby-on-rails python and php would all be excellent choices for developing a web service in

1183440
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	django	cakephp	drupal	drupal	django
all the languages are capable with of course ruby being the language that ruby-on-rails is written in have strong frameworks if that is your fancy django being a good python example and something like drupal or cakephp being good php examples and can play nicely with mysql

1183442
python	php
i have developed in python and php and my personal preferences would be python

1183447
webserver	nginx
if you use nginx apache nginx is my preferences to run your .app on passenger then why couldn t your chosen webserver just serve your static files

1183459
udp	tcp
i m rather new to the topic of network-programming never having done anything but basic tcp udp on a single local machine

1183465
constructor	object
object creation in a loops quickly goes quadratic simply because of all the overhead of initializer the member variables calling the constructor up the inherited chaining etc

1183475
put	get
2 to get put a index in every item you can use the selected extension methods passing a func selectedor function

1183477
arrays	loops
because the buffering will be constantly changing its a nethack like game i want to change the arrays every loops

1183481
associations	model
as for question #2 your activerecord model article should behave just fine .when configure with a belongs_to associations to an activeresource model

1183490
submitchanges	datacontext
.when you call submitchanges on your datacontext is will do all the database changes which the datacontext knows about

1183495
webserver	upload
however after upload the .html and .swf files to my webserver and going to the site i get the following error

1183507
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
does this methods work for major browsers ie 6+ firefox safari google-chrome

1183516
json	xml
i used xml but since oauth works at the http level it works equally well for json

1183517
solaris	linux
in this case a java-api would need to be implementable across multiple versioning of windows multiple versioning of linux solaris and various other third party platform

1183531
constructor	object
how much work is it reasonable for an object constructor to do

1183541
worksheet	excel	macros	vba
i have a vba publishing macros in excel which generator a published workbook based on a master configuration worksheet and a numbers of worksheet with the data

1183545
constructor	object
the constructor should create a valid object

1183545
constructor	object
if the object can be used for other purposes without parsing the information first than consider making two constructor or a separate methods

1183548
constructor	object
a constructor should set up the object to be used

1183549
constructor	object
because i learned the hard way that while you are in the constructor the object is in a incoherent intermediate state which is too dangerous to handle

1183549
constructor	object
there are plenty of examples out there where the constructor is at the centering of the actual activity of the object but there is also plenty of examples of the opposite

1183554
double	int
my question is whether there s a clever way to derive from the basic types int float double etc

1183554
data-members	private
it defined every operation an int can do and just applies that operation to a private int data-members

1183561
binaries	install
there have been some experimental binaries release for windows but it is very early days for windows versioning of couchdb - expect some issues if you are doing a windows install

1183570
constructor	object
it is good rules of thumb to only initializer field in constructor and otherwise do as little as possible to initializer the object

1183570
constructor	object
using java as an example you could run into problems if you call methods in your constructor especially if you subclassing your object

1183570
constructor	object
this is because due to the order-of-operations in the initializer of object instance-variables will not be evaluated until after the super constructor has finished

1183570
constructor	object
set the html as a field on your object and then introduce a dependency on parsing with it needing to be called either right after the constructor is finished or include some sort of lazy-evaluation parsing by adding something like ensureparsingd at the head of your accessor

1183570
constructor	private
to follow up with the java example above you can do this without fear if you ensure that only private methods and therefore not eligible for overrides by subclassing are called from within a constructor

1183578
filepath	unc
i admit it s not like you re off doing network i o in the constructor unless of course a unc filepath is passed in and you re not going to have to wait long in the constructor unless there are networking problems or you generalize the class to be able to read the html from places other than a file some of which might be slow

1183579
authentication	login
you need to decorator your controllers actions with authentication and set up the correct login page in the web-config .so whenever an action that is decoratord gets called it checked if the user is logged on and redirects to the proper login page if not

1183587
data-structures	tree	value	field	unique	words
i don t think btree or other traditional sorted data-structures red-black tree etc will help you because they keep order by key not by corresponding value -- in other words the field they guarantee as unique is the same one they order by

1183587
duplicates	elements
with a rather simple pure python implementsation based on python dictionaryionary for uniqueness and python sorts on a not-blazingly-fast laptop i get 5 seconds for the original construction essentially a sort over the million elements starting with them as a dictionary and about 9 seconds for the updates with 20 000 new id value pairs of which half overlap thus overwrite an existing id and half are new i can implements the updates in a faster way about 6.5 seconds but that implementsation has an anomaly if one of the new pairs is exactly identical to one of the old ones both id and value it s duplicates -- warding against such duplication of identicals is what pushes me from 6.5 seconds to 9 and i imagine you would need the same kind of precaution

1183590
any	set
i don t see any possible way to set this binding in xaml

1183593
contains	set	contains	elements
however keep in mind that if you simply need to apply the same settings to just another set of elements the selector key of the options object can contains a comma-delimited list of selectors just like a regular css file

1183594
logout	login
if you have a user class it should be checked for incoming login logout parameters along with cookies and assign them to class-variables

1183594
.when	ready
if you have a database class it should make the connection to the database .so it is ready .when you are going to start a query

1183594
.when	ready
they are simply ready for .when you are going to call that first methods

1183601
sql-server	mysql
sql-server seems to have really terrific tools and features enough to make me consider using it instead of mysql even though i m doing development on an open source stack

1183611
sql-server	mysql
in other words the way i see it is if you don t really care about keeping it open source all the way then sql-server is the way to go but if you do just use mysql it ll get the job done

1183622
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
don t ignore postgresql -- every bit as open as mysql not in the middle of a muddle caused in mysql s case by acquisition by sun then by oracle core developers leaving fork into drizzle mariadb ourdelta ... and just about as functionally rich and sql standards compliant as ms sql-server if not more i miss recursive ctes a lot .when i have to use mysql -- both sql-server and postgresql have them though just as the sql standards required

1183626
twitter	tweets
yes you can a few sites i have allowed access to my own twitter account have had there scripting run nightly to .post there spam tweets on everyones account that they had access to

1183636
perl	awk
if you do want anything fancier or more than one result etc then awk as suggested in other answers is perfectly fine but a pipeline mix of grep tail and cut is quite a traditional unix-y approach and still quite workable for simple cases and some complex ones but awk or perl may be more appropriate for those

1183640
constructor	object
the only other thing i could come up with was to pre-populate the menu object in the base viewmodel constructor

1183644
z-index	tooltip
the tooltip seems to be set such that it s z-index is always above all other elements nearby it move the tooltip once it appears it is getting too close to the top of the page bottom of the page etc.

1183644
z-index	tooltip
.so far i have been able to get the z-index of the tooltip to appear correctly by append the tooltip to the body as opposed to the map

1183645
scala	java
can scala be used to scripting a java application

1183645
scala	java
i need to load a piece of scala code from java set up an execution scoping for it data exposed by the hosts application evaluate it and retrieve a result object from it

1183645
scala	java
the scala documentation show how easy it is to call compiled scala code from java because it gets turned into to regular jvm-bytecode

1183645
scala	java
but how can i evaluate a scala expression on-the-fly from java or if that is easier from within scala

1183645
scala	java
scala does not seem to support it and i could not find anything in the java scala interoperability docs that does not rely on ahead-of-time compilation

1183647
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this methods doesn t required javascript doesn t cause to lose cleartype text in ie and is compatible with firefox safari opera ie6 7 8.

1183648
directory	folder
include_once dirname file . directory ... and what this does is if im inside of a folder and im trying to include a file that is one level up into the current page it wont work

1183648
directory	folder
and instead of it using the main root directory it include the folder im inside as well

1183664
constructor	object
because of this you need to call the parsing in the constructor as your object would be in a non-useful state otherwise

1183664
constructor	object
for languages that only have object java you could just create a static methods in a class that had no accessible constructor and then invoke the parsing and return all of the parsing value in a map or similar collections

1183716
python	c++
i am attempting to create python binding for some c++ code using swig

1183717
revision	updates
first i used updates to revision to updates one of my directory to an old revision because we had to undo some changes

1183730
revision	updates
updates your working copy to head then perform a reverse merge to the revision you desire

1183742
stderr	stdout
it could be that this program is poorly written and output its information to stderr instead of stdout

1183756
hide	show
obviously we can enable disable show hide more responding to user s actions instead of enraging users

1183760
dbus	gtk	gnome	kde
both gtk and qt have binding for dbus most desktop environment or at least gnome and kde expose various service via dbus and many desktop applications can be controlled via a dbus interface

1183771
ruby	php
i have some experience in all two of your three choices php ruby with ruby-on-rails

1183775
directory	folder
otherwise try duplicating the directory and deleting the .git folder in the duplicates directory

1183825
enterprise	legacy
if a page request takes 30 cpu seconds to process due to massive integration with a legacy enterprise application through the four queries per page - then there s no way

1183843
django-cache	memcached
what you ll need to do and there may already be an open source implementation of this i don t know is write a django-cache backend for this api they re pretty simple you can use the existing memcached backend as the basis for your new one

1183848
coverity	klocwork
solutions like coverity and klocwork have an extensible rules set where you can write your own ruless

1183863
account	api
in the past i relied on google s account api for user registration

1183867
jquery	dojo
if the front-end-in-the-browser developers are using a good framework suc as jquery or my favorite dojo jsonp should be no harder for them than plain json

1183870
constructor	object
i defined the function constructor for this object initializer it via

1183916
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter uses an internal stringbuilder to write to

1183918
constructor	private	constructor	object
a possible option is to move the parsing code to a seperate function make the constructor private and have a static function parsing html that construct the object and immediately call the parsing function

1183932
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
- bool tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller shouldselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

1183936
postgresql	mysql
my postgresql is rusty .so if the mysql query works on postgresql i d like to know

1183956
postgresql	mysql
by the way i ll be using pylons a python framework and mysql 5 though i m open to postgresql if there are any weird utf8 restrictions i converted the whole database which was previously latin1 to utf8 by the way with iconv

1183977
document	editing
sharepoint should be used as a foundation for business user collaboration that being storing finding and editing each other document

1183979
macros	vba
have you considered some-sort of vba macros

1183984
cucumber	webrat
finally the pragmatic book on rspec still in beta is a great resource on how to use cucumber webrat and rspec together and drive your application development with bdd

1183989
contains	elements
also one needs take special care if the arrays contains odd numbers of elements

1184000
associations	model
i m trying to create an associations between two model using join conditional rather than a foreign key

1184006
click	mouse
the button image remains in the down state until the user click on the mouse on the menu or elsewhere on the form or even outside of the application

1184006
dialog	pop-up	click	mouse
i need to detection this mouse click .so i can redraw the button in the normals image and if i am using my own dialog as the pop-up menu to hide the menu

1184006
click	mouse
how do i detection this mouse click .when i am using a dialog form to act like a tpopupmenu

1184014
selection	cell
does anyone know how i can remove the shadow before the default cell selection styles gets applied

1184014
selection	cell
checked cell.selected in tableview cellforrowatindexpath before setting the shadow but this obviously doesn t work since the cell is not redraw after a selection

1184018
python	c++
i required to do a project as a part of my final year of engineering graduation studies.can you suggest some project pertaining to distribute systemd and artificial-intelligence together and which required python c or c++ for programming

1184028
cryptography	openssl
cryptography mcrypt openssl

1184028
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
database mysql postgresql sqlite oracle mssql couch

1184041
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that in code below event-listener not being fired in ie working just fine in firefox and google-chrome

1184049
selected	cell
that s the last thing that s called right before the cell is actually display .so you can query its selected properties and set the text shadow accordingly

1184060
value	field
i m trying to use the value of another field inside an in

1184089
installation	environment
java_home e sun sdk jdk bin please set the java_home variables in your environment to match the location of your java installation

1184106
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
safari google-chrome use the webkit rendering engine which incorporates css rendering and the dom i would say it s one of the best rendering engines in addition to opera s - i think it could be of use

1184108
macports	fink
from the documentation it appears that fink and macports install versioning 1.2

1184139
ggplot2	lattice
lately the author has been doing a visualization series comparing lattice and ggplot2

1184140
arrays	loops
loops over the arrays and insert each line

1184149
while-loop	infinite
webserver use an infinite while-loop

1184150
google-chrome	safari
same in google-chrome and probably safari

1184155
linux	bsd
most tutorials give elf for linux and aoutb for bsd yet with the latter logical choice

1184155
mach-o	elf
yet mach-o fails as a format and if you man nasm you get only bin aout and elf file-format - man ld is no more helpful - mach-o is the option to make the mach-o format for os x

1184157
required	checked
for include required files this option applies as well but note that for relative-path include any path that doesn t start with on unix apc has to checked inorder to uniquely identify the file

1184173
constructor	private
let you re factory-method do the parsing and pass the parsing result to a private protected constructor

1184180
hash	md5
modern hash algorithms not md5 can be considered collision-free

1184181
json	xml
i still haven t really used json in a real world project - i pretty much always rely on xml

1184185
hash	md5
you can also hash the file eg md5 hash but then you can t list the files the user put in not with a meaningful named anyway

1184188
json	xml
we have started moving all our xmlhttprequest call over to json since its at least 4x smaller than our old xml format

1184192
32-bit	64bit
the classes you don t include will be initializer in-proc and this initializer will just fail because of 32-bit 64bit incompatibility

1184203
json	xml
you will need to make a web service to return the data either as pre-formatted html or in some data structure like xml or json

1184207
postgresql	mysql
there are some things mysql has and postgresql doesn t replace for example - usually if something is not in postgresql there are good reasons for it and or a workarounds

1184209
attributes	properties
naively we might think to use xml sub-elements for list items and xml attributes for named properties

1184209
json	xml
xml is simply a poor fit for its most common application representing object hierarchies and json is a better fit

1184212
dedicated-server	dedicated
you say it s a dedicated-server but is this server dedicated to a single web application

1184213
qitemdelegate	qstyle	qitemdelegate	qpushbutton
if you want the cell to look like qpushbutton s you should probably inherited from qitemdelegate and implements paint to use qstyle to draw you a qpushbutton something like this

1184236
arrays	loops
or if you want to loops through an arrays you can use for..in iterator

1184241
ia-32	x86
of course all of the following applies only to x86 and x86-64 assembly for ia-32 and amd64 processor and operating systems.

1184241
freebsd	linux	freebsd	osx	linux	osx
while every os is different most modern oses follow a general pattern you load the numbers of the systemd call you want into a register typically eax in 32-bit code then load the parameters how you do that varies wildly and finally issue an interrupt request it s int 2e for windows-nt kernel or int 80h for linux 2.x and freebsd and i believe osx

1184241
windows-xp	windows
linux 2.6 kernel and i believe windows-xp and newer though i have never actually attempted it on windows also support a newer faster methods to make a systemd call the sysenter instruction introduced by intel in newer pentium chip

1184241
32-bit	64bit
amd chip have syscall but few 32-bit oses use it though it s the standards for 64bit i think

1184245
.net	wcf
i am developing a wcf service using vsts 2008 + .net 3.5 + c# and it works fine .when i also use vsts 2008 to develop client using add service reference function to automatically generator client web-services proxy code

1184268
linux	unix
i have two linux machines on which unix sort seems to behave differently

1184269
selected	button
in the manifest editor selected the runtime tab and selected the add button on the classpath panels

1184276
directory	folder
poking around a bit in iis and discovered that for whatever reason the scripting folder had been made a virtual directory

1184292
protected	public
it differs from having to make a base-class and then extends it with a cat and a dog and therefor have to make the sound methods protected or overrides the public eat methods

1184306
contains	elements
positioning absolute positioninging the elements relative to the contains block

1184331
constructor	object
i agree with the posters here arguing minimal work in the constructor really just putting the object into a non-zombie state then have verb functions like parsehtml

1184335
rhino-mocks	moq
in general that is not particularly easy to do with moq since it has no concept of order expectations unlike rhino-mocks

1184335
callback	methods
you might be able to use a callback together with setting up the end methods to toggle a flag that determines any further behavior of the mock but it s not going to be particularly pretty

1184345
selected	cell
.when i selected a table cell i want to show another table controllers view but with different tabs on the bottom

1184349
.when	ready
.when your working directory is in an intermediate state that you are not ready to commit run git stash or git stash save some text

1184360
ironpython	ironruby
it seems to me that if i want to provide scripting capabilities in my .net .app i can use the dlr and .so enable scripting in ironpython or ironruby or whatever other iron languages are available for the dlr or hosts a powershell runspace

1184363
json	xml	xsd	xml	contains	elements
xml has better tooling in the form of xslt xsd integration into many languages vb.net s native xml say and linq-to-xml and it s more naturally open - it s easier to extends xml with a new elements without disrupting the old schema whereas a list in json contains unnamed items making functional collision more likely

1184363
javascript	dom
finally though most languages have decent xml support javascript in particular does not making building xml something a pain unless you use a few helpers functions the dom does not win any design prizes here

1184363
json	xml
i use xml for all data-interchange and likely to be longer-term complex api s and json specifically for lightweight client-server stuff where a strict api isn t needed and thus xml s imperfect match to oo and slightly heavier weight transmission are a drag that s not matched by any of it s benefits

1184363
json	xml
if you re going to do a quick bit of ajax updating json works fine and lets you avoid the oo xml impedance mismatch and the smaller serialization is icing on the cake

1184376
frame-rate	fps
how can we run a opengl applications say a games in higher frame-rate like 500 - 800 fps

1184380
contains	set
this control can then use a controltemplate to start a storyboard contains the animation .when the visibilityproperty is set to true

1184385
selected	cell
the user can selected the images to view from a uitableview the table view has custom cell which display thumbnails of the original images in varying sizes

1184406
directdraw	direct3d
aoe 2 is a directdraw application not direct3d

1184412
python	java
however most validation code is much easier to write in languages like c# java python etc

1184419
put	get
after worked on many small add-on i want to put those add-on on my server .so that people can downloading it and use it .so that i can get the feedback from the people ..but .when i am downloadinging it from my server it is a xpi file getting following error

1184421
for-loop	loops
since you are just calling a subroutine from the for-loop there is no way for this subroutine to exit loops directly

1184423
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
as a secondary consideration clients often have less choice about which db they use postgresql mysql oracle etc than which application language they have available

1184436
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
for relatively small ones stackoverflow bbc etc a normals relational-database should be enough - like mysql postgresql or oracle

1184471
contains	any
any calculated hash contains less information bits than the original data and can never be as unique

1184482
value	field
the solution that microsoft implements was to add a separate boolean field or properties you can set to say whether or not you are supplying the value

1184488
directory	folder
currently i am publishing the application and placing that folder in the server and creating virtual directory and providing windows-authentication

1184518
push	pull
now however i want to be able to push and pull from this remote repository without having to specify where i m pushing to or pulling from

1184522
margins	padding
padding margins clipping another complex one i wouldn t recommend

1184523
primitive	int
by int i am referring to the primitive int

1184524
primitive	int
the exact size of an int is implementation dependent but can be something like 28 bits this types behaves like a java primitive int it will overflow

1184524
arbitrary-precision	bigint
an int is a types that can contains arbitrary-precision int like the java bigint

1184528
postgresql	mysql
as to skaffman s points you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you

1184528
postgresql	mysql
the time to make the switching is highly dependent on you application environment however if you need clustering and replication to work properly 100 of the time then postgresql will not let you down as mysql has for me in the past

1184529
scala	java
ted neward wrote a series of article on scala aimed at java developers and he finished it off by demonstrating how to write a mathematical domain language in scala which incidentally is a statically-typed language

1184536
contains	elements
there s no way they can sit side by side in their contains elements .when they both take up the whole width

1184536
margins	padding
edit i agree with sneakiness wet the width to something lower than 50 because the margins and padding have to fit too

1184546
actionscript	mxml
amf an http-based binary format that performs serialization between actionscript mxml and server side languages

1184546
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
adobe offers blazeds open source and lcds commercial implementation of amf for as java but there are third-party implementation of amf for as php as python as ruby as .net

1184549
jquery-ui-accordion	themeroller
the jquery-ui-accordion uses css generator by themeroller

1184549
mouseleave	mouseout
you might want to try stopping the propagation of the hover event to see if that prevents the mouseout on the child from triggers mouseleave on the parent

1184549
callback	methods
edit i just noticed that your hover methods only has one callback

1184554
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are very widely used by a huge numbers of startups because its open source and there is a lot of support out there for people using it

1184565
contains	any	environment	execution
a plain int object has the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment large enough to contains any value in the range int_min to int_max as defined in the header

1184566
oracle	mysql
also mysql being owned by oracle now and several branches off of the main functionality means that mysql

1184566
oracle	mysql
they all have their advantages like mssql working will with the other microsoft technologies like linq where as mysql having a large open community support and oracle being the workhorse of the commercial sector with lots of ability to embed application logic right into the database

1184569
icmp	tcp
ethernet does not care if it s transporting icmp tcp if they are valid or not

1184619
attributes	properties
you won t be able to change the visible properties as it s a server side attributes that isn t rendering as part of the control

1184634
diagram	erd
i started my first mysql project designing the erd logical and physical diagram

1184634
diagram	erd
however he uses a relational-database diagram where he designs interfaces and other parts first before making the erd

1184637
authentication	login
very low-level authentication types methods which would redirect to a login page.

1184639
object-reference	instances
i get this error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1184657
fadeout	fadein
...and you can always use jquery to make it fadein or fadeout

1184680
firefox	opera
if you worry that the onscroll event does not work in opera firefox you can try changing

1184699
arrays	map
the map a .plist is loaded and then the object are created and added to the arrays it belongs to

1184699
arrays	map
would you send that to the controllers which would checked for everything walls monsters etc in the map other arrays and then return the result

1184702
json	xml
if i don t want to expose the state of my object but i still need to display it in html xml or json let s say how would i go about doing that in an asp.net-mvc environment

1184712
defined	declare
as defined power is stateless and has no side-effects on any enclosing class .so it should be declare static

1184722
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
as it happens i believe that someone s who s become proficient in say oracle can become fairly competent in sql-server or mysql in a fairly short spaces of time you state it s going to be used for your financial systemd - perhaps you really need input from a consultant who s worked on implements and or supporting financial systemd - for example i understand that sybase is popular in city types firms

1184728
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby donâ t have the same integration to windows as does powershell

1184729
font-size	width
ensure that all sizes are declare in em units an em is the width of a single letter m in whichever font-size is currently being used

1184731
directory	folder
_root is the path to the directory where the application folder resides

1184743
getter	setter
now the goal of getter and setter is to provide an interface to properties of a state of an object which might not have anything to do with how it is actually implements

1184743
getter	setter
granted most of the time these properties are field in the object and the getter and setter just shallow shell

1184743
getter	setter
on the other hand you have the freedom to change the internal implementation because the getter and setter will ensure interface compatibility

1184743
getter	setter
if however these properties are too related to the actual implementation and not .so much with what the object is about then you should consider removing such getter and setter

1184754
oracle	mysql
i d say if you want to compare apples to apples then it is mysql vs sql express vs oracle express

1184754
oracle	mysql
or if you have then it is the mysql support license ms-sql standards vs whatever oracle s cheapest offering is

1184754
oracle	mysql
similarly if you choose your os then unix flavors run mysql or oracle but mssql is windows only

1184754
oracle	mysql
mysql and oracle work on both unix and windows of course

1184759
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately live doesn t support hover .so you have to split your code and defined mouseover and mouseout event handler

1184770
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the navigation bar display fine

1184776
python	ruby
i am sure the python and ruby folks have their own thoughts as well and then of course there is delphi

1184777
environment	building
as long as i completely control the building environment such that all pieces and parts are built with the same flags and use the same runtime libs and no one has a statically linked crt libs am i ok to pass stl object around

1184806
versioning	upgrade
.so could you tell me how can i upgrade my ruby to new versioning

1184816
cgbitmapcontextcreate	core-graphics
if you can t avoid it you can use core-graphics to create a bitmap context using cgbitmapcontextcreate where you have access to the backing store and can manipulate the backing store directly

1184826
textbox	button
the user click the edit button on the first view fires off an event you could call it a cmd with a single parameter the id value of the textbox in this case

1184858
nsdocument	appkit
even nsautounbinder misses some cases for the nsdocument and nswindowcontroller if apple can t get it working correctly for 2 classes they specially rig up those of us without access to innards of appkit have basically no chance

1184877
boolean	int
even plain int and boolean can cause interop problems and more complex structures like nested arrays with optional value are very difficult to make work across different type-systems

1184880
interop	vsto
the client will at least need the vsto runtime versioning 3.0 is now the latest primary interop assemblies

1184880
optional-parameters	named
do give vb a chance it works better for vsto development then c# at least until you can use c# 4 and named optional-parameters

1184882
children	tree	children	nodes
basically it deals with the annoying deletion cases -- .when you delete a tree with 2 children who both have 2 children such as the root but also any other nodes in the tree

1184882
children	nodes
what rotate does is basically swap children traumatizing i know between the involved nodes in a very local area .so that the order of children smaller on the left bigger on the right is maintained

1184882
binary-search-tree	nodes
due to the mathematical recursive definition of a binary-search-tree you can view each nodes as its own sub-tree hence my initial statement left unchanged

1184891
uiresponder	uiview
without subclassing a uiresponder class uiview and overrides its touchesbegan withevent methods is it possible to get informed of touch-events of a uiresponder class

1184897
linux	osx
on osx and linux it looks like this

1184914
arrays	map
make your map a two-dimensional arrays

1184950
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1184951
mathml	xhtml
because svg is a full xml dialect it can be easily mixed with other xml applications such as xhtml and mathml

1184955
mousedown	mouseup
.when i mousedown and mouseup over the elements i get the down and up alert however i also get the click alert of the li s event handler too

1184955
mousedown	mouseup
i thought that this should be prevented from by the call to event.stoppropagation in the mousedown and mouseup handler

1184963
mousedown	mouseup
the key here is that click mousedown and mouseup are distinct events

1184963
click	mouse	mousedown	mouseup
although you might think of a click as being a mousedown followed by a mouseup in reality you might have click events triggers by user actions that don t even involve the mouse as well as combinations of mousedown and mouseup that don t result in any click events at all

1184972
put	get
one way to do this is to make a new table in your database in which a user is put as .soon as he logs in to the chat - even non-members can be helped this way as they will probably need to have .some alias anyway .so .when they come into the chat they either have to choose a named or get one randomly - this named can be linked to an id that only goes in the chatroom with which you can easily start conversations to .someone

1184982
sqldatasource	gridview
i ve just done a quick test with a gridview and sqldatasource and gave me the new value as expected

1184986
attributes	properties
is there an easy way to do a side by side comparison of all the attributes events properties of a successful checkedlistbox with that of an unsuccessful checkedlistbox programmatically

1184996
reflection	runtime
you still can t use this methods with a types that s determined at runtime unless you use reflection

1185009
row	col
don t be misled by the two-arguments form of getcomponent like for any other containers the two arguments are pixels coordinates not row and col indic -- to retrieve a component by row and col you ll instead be using the single-argument form indexing starts on the top left and proceeds rightwards then downwards

1185031
required	checked
instead of server.transfer i allow the process to continue in the background which made required i checked for validity then only execute the remaining code

1185036
doxygen	latex
i use both doxygen and latex

1185036
latex	tex	doxygen	latex	doxygen	tex
.when compiling formula doxygen will take the contents of your latex equation copies the ones that haven t been generator to html _formula.tex relative to the output_directory specified in the doxyfile attempt to compile the tex file and then copies the result to png files

1185040
spaces	output
you should also checked whether any of your include files accidently perform some output by having a spaces or line break in front of their first or after their last

1185056
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby as well as anything other language targeted for the dlr will likely remain more familiar to the developer audience

1185060
ironpython	ironruby
but we do have a start on that in the form of the hosting apis we ship on codeplex w dlr and ironpython project and also w ironruby over on github

1185060
ironpython	ironruby
therefore every language more or less has it s own hosting story except for ironpython and ironruby right now

1185066
32-bit	64bit
the macros are awful but .when you have to write code that is portable across 32-bit and 64bit platform they are a godsend

1185085
getter	setter
- per points of extensibility and generally supply getter and setter methods or properties or whatever s appropriate to the specific language to access and change that instances

1185085
python	ruby
i often recommend this high-ceremony approach for this specific purpose even in dynamic-languagess such as python or ruby which would also allow more informal approaches via duck-typing and the ability of an object of class to directly reach into the internals of another -- such dynamic abilities are generally speaking quite useful but for this specific purpose as i think of changing a class behavior at runtime a more highly architected and controlled approach in my experience leads to better-maintainable and clearer code this bit is controversial many developers in dynamic-languages communities like monkey patching approaches even in such situations but a dozen years of successful development practice in dynamic-languagess mostly python have made me otherwise inclined

1185098
subclassing	nsobject
i m not comfortable enough with the framework yet to know for sure if those methods would be called if they were implements as a category on or subclassing of nsobject

1185106
linux	osx
i m on osx but i anticipate having the same problem for .when i later need to install moddims on a linux production server

1185123
haskell	sml
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1185128
rhino-mocks	moq
my inspiration for adding this feature came from moq and rhino-mocks which are .net tools.

1185134
python	java
examples of that would be rmi in java python pyro module etc which will provide some functional parity with dcom

1185187
sql-server	mysql
how would i go on changing this to use a mysql server instead of sql-server

1185188
configuration	installation
each installation has it s own configuration such as printer settings

1185211
expression	evaluation
the result-of the expression evaluation is passed to the function rather than the expression itself

1185266
html-input	htmlbutton
here is good libs for html-parsing object like htmlbutton html-input s are not created but it is a good points to start and to create them yourself if you don t want to use html dom

1185299
priority-queue	heap
if you could then you could mess up the internal heap structure of the priority-queue

1185301
background-color	transparency
using just one image isn t possible with transparency but if you know what the background-color will be you can flatten the image on that color then you ll be able to use just one image use the same css as now but add small-white-left.png to the left in small-white-sprite.png then use that for both elements.

1185302
exception-handling	error-handling
you now add checked-exception-handlings to the interface and .so every client and every cmd are bound to do error-handling and are coupled to the exception-handling

1185376
subclassing	nsobject
fruit object being an nsobject subclassing

1185406
python	php
i m looking for a function similar to php s session_start for python

1185418
python	php
python is not a web language in itself like php .so it has not built-in web features

1185426
contains	any
if anyone knows any good website to start learning and one that specifically contains rotation please let me know

1185429
pointers	stack
the methods only gets a pointers to stack and has to have a mechanism to work out the types and numbers of parameters

1185432
browser-plugin	google-chrome
if you re not willing to use a browser-plugin and you re not trying to do your own user-interface program then your only other option is to use canvas and google-chrome experiments as kitsune has suggested

1185434
click	mouse
you click your mouse and the see through part it takes a picture of

1185437
python	php
as someone who comes from php and is working his way into python i can tell you that django is a good way to start dealing with python on the web

1185438
pointers	stack
you can use a stack and push the pointers to the nodes as you encounter them

1185438
pointers	stack
nodes by simply popping out the pointers from stack

1185447
joomla	drupal
drupal joomla as mentioned wordpress

1185450
scala	java
to answer your original question scala does not have an eval function just like java does not have an eval

1185450
scala	java
jruby scala and java mesh very nicely together

1185450
scala	java
it s quite easy to have part of your system.in java part in scala and another part the bit which required eval in ruby

1185454
waveform	pcm
it can play midi files by converting them into pcm waveform data

1185468
hide	show
my end goal is to ensure zoom controls are always display on the screens instead of the default hide show behavior

1185490
solaris	freebsd
this feature is only expected to work on os x solaris and freebsd

1185496
python	php
speaking as someone who went from php to python and never looked back i think it s useful to understand how sessions work under the hood

1185569
fiddler	charles
i ve found fiddler a little slow as well and i ve switched to using charlesproxy instead however if you always have them running and have them logging all browser integration then they will make your machine slower as all browser request all go through the fiddler charles proxy systemd and be logged and use up memory

1185578
managed-code	native-code
you can t because of the security sandbox of silverlight you can only use security transparency managed-code and native-code certainly does not quality

1185578
.net	wcf
if you absolutely required some sort of functionality only available in com you can invoke com from fulltrust .net code on the server which some hosters do not allow and write a wcf service or even asp.net web service if you want to be old school facade that your silverlight application can call provided that you don t need something only available on the client

1185585
subclassing	base-class
each subclassing can implements a handleresponse or similar that s called from your base-class connectiondidfinishloading

1185602
sinatra	sequel
it was rather stupid we initializer sequel in a before filtering in sinatra

1185623
python	java	python	ruby
c and objective-c are rather much low-level languages compared to languages such as java c# python ruby and others

1185623
printf	scanf
the printf and scanf families of functions and their ilk use a format string as one of the fixed parameters and the format specifiers found in the format string indicate the numbers and types of extra arguments passed in

1185638
any	set
of course at any given step what we will actually have is a set of remaining possibilities v and a set of possible guesses we could make g and we will need to pick the guess which maximize the entropy

1185638
contains	any
thus we can discard any partition that contains a score mapped to more than this many solutions

1185640
internet-explorer	firefox
then using firefox with the fireftp plugins or using internet-explorer if that is your choice you can upload downloading the file

1185642
static-methods	unit-testing
one thing about static-methods classes is that they don t facilitate unit-testing at least in php but probably in other languages too

1185686
.when	ready
the issue is that the click functions are attached to the html .when the document is loaded on dom ready

1185686
hide	show
that said an even easier methods for the functionality you want is just to use hide and show on two already-existing divs

1185703
value	field
a more efficient methods would be to use a separate model with no field whose key named is made up of properties named + value

1185703
put	get
by their get first put later nature ndash

1185719
value	field
lets say you have a cars pricing db that among other things classifies cars to luxury and low budget and you re dealing with missing value in the cost field

1185725
hide	show
in the case where the countryid doesn t match i would hide the selected probably clear it s value too and show an already existing input that was previously hidden

1185737
inline-code	code-behind
for example declare a button variables for button1 in your code-behind and set the commandargument attributes in the page s pageload or pageinit instead of using inline-code and eval

1185739
bad-request	http-error
http-error 400.0 - bad-request

1185742
postgresql	mysql
is there an equivalent to postgresql s dblink for mysql

1185750
svg	vml
i would take a good look at dojo or more specifically dojox.gfx which allows svg rendering using canvas vml for ie or silverlight

1185760
double-quotes	single-quotes
try that notice that in the i used double-quotes instead of single-quotes

1185777
listboxitem	selected
the first time someone expands an expander it selected the newly expanded listboxitem

1185777
listboxitem	selected
if someone expands another expander the previous listboxitem is deselected but remains expanded the newly expanded listboxitem is selected

1185777
listboxitem	selected
if someone collapse a selected expander the listboxitem is deselected

1185777
listboxitem	selected
if there are several expanders expanded someone collapse a non-selected listboxitem expander the previously selected listboxitem remains selected

1185785
httphandler	httpmodule
but unlike file types such as .aspx and .ashx file types such as .js and .css that you have used in your example are not by default registered with the asp.net dll within iis .so .when they are requested iis doesn t pass the request through the asp.net pipeline .so no httpmodule or httphandler will run

1185790
url-rewriting	rewrite
enter iis7 url-rewriting or any equivalent rewrite module

1185799
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome

1185820
python	java
i m not sure about python but append strings like this is a big no in other languages like java and c#

1185825
google-chrome	firefox
not sure how it works in firefox and google-chrome since there is no handlearrowkeys function

1185838
keyboard	hid	keyboard	mouse
i am a .net developer and i want to turn my usb hid device mouse dance pad guitar or drums specially drums into a keyboard with few key i know

1185840
mstest	nunit
i have some class libs with nunit tests and i want to convert the project to use the vs 2008 mstest integration

1185843
32-bit	64bit
my general trick for ensuring things compile 64bit or 32-bit mutatis mutandis is

1185846
ruby-on-rails	django
i am as i m sure many of you are pretty familiar with ruby-on-rails asp.net-mvc design pattern as well as django and others mtv design patter

1185865
value	field
.when you updates - you tell the network that the fact has changed but it doesn t yet tracking it at a field level that is tbd .so it may cause more work then is necessary as all these activations are created that are not really needed as they are using field that didn t actually change in value

1185874
accelerometer	magnetometer
i have a xyz accelerometer and magnetometer

1185878
python	c++
the python manual says that you can create modules for python in both c and c++

1185894
display	height	display	width
i m not sure of a good way to get around this - maybe set width and height manually at first either in xaml or the constructor then set up the binding once it has been display

1185896
cryptography	key-pair
signing an assembly with a strong named required a cryptography key-pair

1185911
python	c++
it will generator python wrapper and interfaces for c++ code

1185917
value	field
in list context it returns a list of the various field that make up a time value

1185954
python	c++
the boost folks have a nice automated way to do the wrapping of c++ code for use by python

1185957
python	c++
the extends python documentation 2.6.2 says that you may use c++ but mentions the followings caveats

1185957
constructor	object
object with constructor cannot be

1185957
constructor	object
the first restrictions global or static object with constructor cannot be used has to do with the way most c++ compiler initializer object with this types of storage duration

1185957
python	c++
if you have object with static storage duration in your python extension and the python interpreter is not compiled and linked for c++ then this special initialization code will not be created

1185957
python	c++
the second restrictions functions that will be called by the python interpreter in particular module initialization functions have to be declare using extern-c has to do with c++ name-mangling

1185971
dbd	dbi
one of the gem is looking for ruby 1.8.x probably the dbi or dbd gem

1185980
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i really want to built-in all 5 well-known browsers ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari but right now i am having to right click the actual html files and open them in different browsers

1185985

radio-button	selected	radio-button	button	selected	button
the way it is setup now depending on which radio-button you selected it show a different layout for the windows different labels button etc

1185996
credentials	account
.when you do this the windows credentials it uses are of the service account which is systemd by default but could be something else if you set it that way

1186010
callback	methods
you should set up your callback .so that your file open is in a try except and retains a reference to the output file handle your write call is in a try except and you have a callback_obj.close methods which you use .when retrlines returns to explicit file_handle.close in a try except -- that way you get explicit error-handling messages can t open|write to|close file x because y and you save having to think about .when your files are going to be implicit closed and whether you risk running out of file handles

1186024
search-engine	seo
as viewstate is a hidden input at the top of the form page this can impact seo as the actual content of the page may not get fully process by the search-engine if there is too much viewstate

1186030
isapi-rewrite	isapi
presuming you can required that persons hosting on iis have dedicated hosting or can at least get an isapi module install checkout iconic s isapi-rewrite filtering

1186033

according to oop abstract-class are needed to model those object that have no existence in the real-world but serves as a base-class for several real-world object

1186095
macros	vba
it can be difficult findoug out what classes do what .so a good first approach is to turn on the macros recorder in powerpoint do the operation that you d like to automate in vb and then look at the vba code that the macros recorder has created

1186100
subclassing	superclass
you create superclass to contains common behavior among subclassing

1186100
subclassing	superclass
in some cases the superclass cannot be a complete class because each subclassing must provide an overrides or extension

1186100
subclassing	superclass
we provide a abstract superclass because we need subclassing to provide the missing features

1186101
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class can have state that s shared with all subclassing

1186106
value	field
the only situation where i d use and i ve used them to mimic the javascript prototype object in php 5.3 static-members is .when i know that the respective field will have the same value cross-instance

1186109
dictionary	arrays
updates i understand that programmatically one could put more than one item in the pasteboard using additems as kevin ballard points out or by setting the items properties to an arrays contains more than one dictionary

while embedded stack overflow can be caused by recursive functions getting out of hand it can also be caused by errant pointers usage although this could be considered another types of error and normals systemd operation with an undersized stack

1186117
contains	elements
you need the children methods for accessing xml elements which contains a namespace

1186143
typedef	struct
however this conventions is a remnant of older versioning of c where this syntax was required inorder to named struct and .so nowadays you can simply write .something like the following omitting the typedef and the typedef namedd

1186145
twitter	tweets
this is .so the tweets fetcher can run asynchronously as a javascript and if twitter is down or slow it won t affect my site s page load-time

1186146
rollback	commit
if your connection is closed without a commit postgresql will automatically issue a rollback

1186146
rollback	commit
if your connection stays open after your transactional you might want to issue a rollback or a commit but generally a rollback is less costly inorder for your next transactional to execute in a clean state

1186152
windows-vista	windows-xp
i have just move from windows-xp pro to windows-vista ultimate

1186154
fltk	gtk
use a cross platform libs such as gtk c++ wrapper gtkmm qt wxwidgets or fltk that wrap the specific os s api

1186154
fltk	gtk
for the examples given gtk gtkmm is license under lgpl qt is under various licenses including proprietary option wxwidgets is under its own wxwindows licence with a rename to wxwidgets licence and fltk is under lgpl with exception-handling

1186155
python	java
i realize this is a dated question since .appengine now comes in java but i have a python .appengine .app that i want to access via gwt

1186160
subclassing	base-class
if your subclassing needs custom drawing code it is recommended you use uiview as the base-class

ruby-on-rails	rspec
for learning purposes i m looking for open source ruby-on-rails project that exemplify idiomatic usage of rspec for bdd

1186184
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i can find project but i m not experienced enough with ruby-on-rails or rspec to know whether what i m looking at represents best practices

1186186
attributes	properties
i would leave the title properties alone for accessibility purposes and modify slimbox.js to read the title attributes immediately on page load store it in a custom properties called caption or something and them programmatically remove the title attributes to prevent the tooltip

1186188
webforms	asp.net
an asp.net webforms page has a dropdownlistfor and a listview

1186194

1186258
google-chrome	firefox
.when view this page in google-chrome or firefox it looks great

1186263
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseup
one way to handle the user-interface you mentioned would be to use mousemove mouseup and mousedown events of the trackbar

1186265
callback	methods
i think a much cleaner methods would be a before_save callback in the model or an observers

1186268
jquery	.post
rick strahl also has great .post on is blog regarding using jquery ajax

1186274
arrays	loops
but say i have another object arrays with the same numbers of object as is there any valid php syntax that would allow me to simultaneously access rows on both object within the same loops using the foreach statement

1186274
for-loop	arrays
i know i could do this with a regular for-loop by accessing the indic of the arrays but this wouldn t be as clean

1186284
selected	textbox
but .when i selected a date from the datepicker it s not refreshing the grid automatically like the dropdowns do i have to click the textbox again and press enter

1186292
subtract	add
you could create a class for numeric value but then manipulating it would required methods as add subtract etc

1186303
arrays	loops
which would effectively enable you to loops both arrays at the same time

1186322
gwt-rpc	gwt
obviously this is more of a gwt replacement than a gwt-rpc replacement

1186327
debian-based	linux
if you are using a debian-based linux .

1186338
spaces	output
.when you use the trace statement in as3 you can pass in multiple parameters and as3 will format the output .so that there is a spaces between each

1186340
python	c++
however since swig won t do it in generator c++ it s still entirely possible to do this in python using a small metaclass

1186379
memcheck	valgrind
i then used valgrind memcheck tool but the messages it gives are cryptic and not very conclusive it show leaks in graphical elements of qt which on scrutiny can be straightaway rejected

1186387
sequences	unique
the sequences will be used for x12 edi transactional .so they don t have to be unique forever

1186390
perl	php
i prefer solutions using php but solutions in perl or java would be very helpful as well

1186391
abstract-class	subclassing
you might want to implements a subclassing of mouseadapter an abstract-class that provides empty implementsation of all of the methods defined in the interfaces

1186398
libcurl	curb
you rather need something like libcurl or curb on rubyforge which are ruby binding for libcurl or patron on rubyforge

1186398
put	get
these libs can make a request header as per your liking setting content-type choosing among get put .post delete head etc. and obtain the response and probably follow 302 redirections .when needed

1186406
macros	vba
simply recording a macros of a pivot-table creation and translation the resultant vba into your language c#

1186406
recording	playing

1186416
selected	checkbox
if i have a checkbox with a labels describing it how can i selected the labels using jquery

1186440
memcheck	valgrind
you said you tried valgrind memcheck tool

1186456
any	set
its easier if you use something like jquery where you can selected the elements and then even if it doesn t exist any operations on the selecteded set will not throw an exception-handling

1186458
required	checked
further in many methods based on the layoutmanager2 interface boxlayout required the panels to be passed in and it performs a checked that you have passed in the right one

1186464
stateless	stateful
since windows forms are stateful opposed to stateless for webforms you can just use a field in your form class

1186492
button	popup
if you press one of the button the buttonviewcontroller popup another viewcontroller detailviewcontroller modally

1186498

1186552
lighting	shading
problem is i can t find a sample which demonstrates how deferred shading can support .so many lightinging simultaneously - i found one demo which was very simple with a single lighting in code sampler and an nvidia hdr sample butnothing beyond that

1186552
lighting	shading
would anyone know where i should go for a good introductory tutorial with code on how to have deffered shading with lighting

1186552
lighting	shading
al.so i only know how to make directional lighting in deferred shading code and it s nice an dall but .somewhat different to regular ways of rendering lighting .so i was wondering if there wree tutorials or anything i could find or just reading material that would help me figure out how writing shader and special fx in deferred-rendering works

1186554
put	get
however if there is a possibility that you will need more this can get wasteful .so i agree with other answers you should put them in a collections of your choice and use it to loops through them to see which ones are checked

1186555
blacklist	whitelist
if it s easier to blacklist actions by attributing actions for which this logic shouldn t be performed than whitelist actions you could create a suppresswhateverlogic attributes and apply it to the methods you want to be blacklist

1186556
any	set
if what you want is to return any a object that have any object within the bobject set that match you would want to use the any operators modifiers

1186560
any	set
not sure how popular that is with other windows-users but the following set of utilities come in handy and can be used by any editor capable of binding key functions to cmd

1186563
click	mouse
it seems that there are similar functions but one of them says that it only finds windows in the current process and the other says that it is for locating the destination of mouse click

1186572
assign	add
here s the rub - .when i add a new task through tasks new i also want to specify a list of users assign to that task which the form is returning in params users_list id

1186595
c-preprocessor	macros
in gcc how can i checked what c-preprocessor definitions are in-place during the compilation of a c program in particular what standards or platform-specific macros definitions are defined

1186601
value	field
if you would use verticalfieldmanager with custom checkedboxfield you could iterate over all field on screens or any manager and checked if its checkedbox field then take a value

1186605
boost	stl
before becoming a c# developer i was a hardcore c++ stl com programmer but never really used boost back then apart from playing around with a smart pointers from boost

1186654
arguments	default
i noticed that if createnowindow false does absolutely nothing .when the filename is points to a windows executable if you have access to the source code of the winform .app then you might be able to provide a command-line arguments which controls the default visibility of the form and do something like this in the winform .app startup code

1186710
value	field
if you want to treat foo as value object - that means that you can trust that once you set it s field they will remain that way no matter where you pass your object use third methods

1186713
defined	declare
there is an explicit relationship defined with extension methodss the extension methods declare which types it is extends with the types of the first parameter

1186717
stateless	stateful
the straightforward difference is that static-methods are stateless whereas non-static-methods are stateful

1186720
private-members	instances
an instances methods has access to the private-members of the class it is defined in whereas an extension methods does not

1186720
derived-class	base-class	instances	private
but then an instances methods in a derived-class does not have access to the private data of the base-class

1186725
transparency	frame
each frame is the character in some pose and transparency pixels filling the rest of the 64x64 spaces

1186726
put	get
selecteditem is the closest to what you re looking for but since it s an object you have to cast it to the types of the items you put in the listbox to get additional properties

1186754
margins	padding
don t mix margins and padding on the same elements

1186766
32-bit	64bit

textbox	button
for a panels with one textbox and one button which is its default button the defaultbutton event fires only once as editing textbox details again and pressing enter event doesn t fire

1186807
javascript	dom
frameworks are just a result-of an extended period of time using a specific language and the features embedded within them just make things which are usually tedious trivial - a great example of that would be the javascript libs jquery where even .something as simple as assign a function on dom ready has been abstracted such .so that it s supported cross-browser and is very easy to types eg

1186810
raw-sockets	packets
raw-sockets required bit-level modifications of less than 8bit grouping for writing the packets headers

1186828
droppable	draggable
from what i understand you have a bunch of draggable that shared a common purpose but their droppable need to change depending on which one was dragged

1186828
droppable	draggable
all that s needed is to hook into the start event of the draggable and conditional change the accept options of the droppable you want them to work with

1186828
droppable	draggable
but instead of hooking into the drag methods of the draggable to constantly monitor which elements it is over you can simply use the over and out methodss of your droppable to add and remove a class to the draggable-helper

1186829
compact-framework	.net
personally i really like using the .net in various forms depending on the context of software asp.net compact-framework silverlight wf etc

1186835
latitude-longitude	location
if you know latitude-longitude don t you already know the location

1186836
malloc	free
you need to in program.c to for example use malloc and free

1186836
dlopen	dlsym
similarly you need for dlopen and dlsym . if you don t do that the compiler will complain that it doesn t know what those named are and halt with an error

1186836
dlopen	dlsym
one last thing dlopen and dlsym are not the normals methods of linking

1186839
python	php
i m most comfortable with python php

1186850
python	java	python	ruby
and i m sure that java python and ruby also have a standards framework built on top of the language

classnotfoundexception	classpath
i m trying to start foo and add to java s classpath bar.war but java throw a classnotfoundexception

1186872
selected	textbox
removing isenabled and setting the textbox as readonly would allow you to selected the text but stop user-input

1186873
.war	jar
the structure of a .war file is very different then a jar .so it doesn t work

1186873
.war	jar
the java class files are kept inside classes directory of the .war whereas jar directly have the java class files

1186875
.war	jar
basically extraction out the common functionality make it a libs as a jar file and either include that jar file in both .war files or add it to a common part of the classpath

1186880
put	get
if you do have a secret code or something you need to hide from people usually as part of a drm or drm-like systemd one way to made it harder to get to would be to not directly put the code in your .app

1186918
authentication	login
for implementation of login authentication in windows you may read about gina

1186931
any	set
i have set it up in sql-server and it s given me no problems creating the relationships but i m yet to try insert any data

1186937
json	xml
json is much more faster than xml

1186953
constructor	object
by hooking up an interface and all of the interfaces that it and it s children are dependant upon to structuremap - and putting the various dependant interfaces into the constructor of the various object that need them...when you initializer object 1 which has a dependancy on object 2 which in turn has a dependancy on object 3...structuremap will take care of it all

1187006

the lower sprite normally handles mouse click

1187017
profiling	debugging
though not a full blown profiling with a yummy gui you could use windbg + sos to debugging your silverlight .app it would required a lot of manual work but you can then walk your managed heap

required	checked
note the class checked is required for example

1187158
primitive	int
they are primitive c value which are interchangeable with int

1187158
any	set
another option if the enums are contiguous from 0 up to some numbers you didn t set any value manually is that you can use an nsarray where the index represents the key enum s value

1187172
value	field
i normally named my db specodeigniterfic field in my forms like this objectnamed columnnamed i tseems codeigniter cant access these value using this- input- .post objectnamed columnnamed what do i do

any	set
changing the release building which was set to x86 to any cpu it fails with same error

1187386
jquery	.post
turns out you can t use cross-domain call with jquery using .post which makes sense as it rendering a script-tag to make the call

1187390
innodb	myisam
as each row will take at least 16b you can have up to 250m rows in the table before the table uses 4gb fat32 limit if there is one archive per table which is the case for myisam and innodb

1187419
attributes	properties
is there .some attributes i can give the properties .so it is ignore and not mapped to anything

decrement	increment
increment and decrement the offset of

1187433
environment	building
runtime environment building

1187434
shell	bash
you can do this by execution say bash -c and passing the above as a shell statement albeit inline - you could write a separate scripting file but it seems a bit of an overhead here

1187450
mac-address	packets
at the step of nf_ip_post_routing the packets is still not filled up with mac-address

1187469
fseek	ftell
eg if you are using c language then you can go to the end of the file using fseek fp seek_end and then use ftell fp which will give you the current positioning of the file pointers

1187497
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
or probably this in sql-server 2005+ oracle 8i+ and postgresql 8.4+

1187622
any	set
i don t know any standards way to associate unbounded set of properties to an adjacenty_list

1187631
value	field

i am not sure how to use grouping by properly inorder to make sure the set of results groupinging together to form each aggregate row include the id of the row with the highest datestamp value for that groupinging

1187646
value	field
but it s only the field value that have actually been transfer across the boundary

1187647
attributes	properties
with wcf you will need to either mark the field with data-members attributes or better yet change your get set methods to properties

you can create wrapper using subprocess which will spawn your application as a child-process and tracking it s execution

1187738
python	ruby
i had the exact same problem a year ago with a j2me client talking to a python ruby backend

1187744
filepath	unc
.when i return a filepath a windows unc not going to explain why i do that i initially url-encoded the string before converting to a streaming and returning it using a return-statement the client seems to get a doubly-coded string

logout	login
you can use ajax to points to the logout page which redirects to the login page .when the mouse doesn t move for 15 minutes

1187765
cvs	git
install svn cvs git plugins

1187784
double	int
updates since you specify a need to distinguish int from double with zero-value decimal portions i think you ll have to do something like the following

1187786
double	int
as you are essentially trying to figure out if a double is an int or not you can create a bigdecimal and test its scale methods

1187804
required	checked
.when the numbers of tables is low enough i m using ssmse sql-server management-studio-express by entering design mode on each table and checked allow nulls on the required columns

1187808
child-process	spawn
.when jvm spawn the child and then shuts down the child-process will also shutdown in some cases

1187808
shutdown	exit
if weblogic server was started up by a java process and then that process exit it also send the shutdown signals to the weblogic via shutdown-hook in jvm which causes weblogic to also shutdown

1187811
ruby	php
.so what you of course need is understanding of your server sided language be it php java ruby or whatever and that all of them in the end just generator .some form of string output which usually html

1187825
getter	setter
right click then source equally useful with a special mention to generator getter and setter and implements methods

1187836
callback	methods
the only two ways are to either periodically call the server and checked the status polling or register a callback which the server periodically call your client must expose a methods

1187843
conditional	operators
response time should not exceed 200ms not including any stalls due to unresponsive disks or high systemd load but under ideal conditional updates should appear immediate to a human operators without incurring high systemd load

1187845
python	java
it s worth looking at some of the python videos particularly the 1st birthday and google i o ones to see what features the java versioning will be getting

1187849
factors	primes
if the numbers is not a primes you can use a factors algorithm

1187882
versioning	upgrade
do i have to upgrade my quartz versioning

1187890
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i created a custom roleprovider standards webforms no asp.net-mvc and i would like to test it

1187893
selected	button
selected your button and set instances named e.g mybutton in properties panels

1187915
push	pull
the hg cmd push and pull move changes between repositories and updates and commit move changes between your working copy and your local repository

1187926
any	set
javascript is not like other languages in that there are a given set of features for any particular versioning

1187926
firefox	safari
for example safari has sqlite support and firefox now has web worker

1187937
visual-studio	release-mode
try compiling the game in release-mode and run your application .when visual-studio is not running

1187939
versioning	upgrade
wizardby can also be integrated into your build-process as well as into your application on each startup in can attempt to upgrade database to the most recent versioning

1187942
required	checked
you will definitely want your application performing some sort of versioning checked against the database to ensure it has the proper structure it required before running though

1187949
authentication	login
i realize form-based authentication is a major struggle with jsf but can i perhaps use a phaselistener or something similar together with programmatic login to authentication the user

1187956
debugging	trace
other than that it looks like the urls are not correct as the last line of the urls in the debugging trace would only match admin .app rather than admin .app xxxx

1187956
debugging	trace
is not working for some reason as the urls are not include in the search path in the debugging trace

1187958
32-bit	64bit
mac os x 64bit abi is what is known as lp64 which means that long s and pointers s are 64bit wide and that int s are 32-bit wide

1187958
32-bit	64bit
.so the short answer is you can t put 64bit pointers in to 32-bit sized int

1187959
textbox	button
how does the formview know which updatesparameter to populate with which edittemplate textbox .when the updates button is click

1187963
.net	wcf
unfortunately there s nothing built-in into wcf to do that at least until .net 4.0 with its routingservice .

1187974
firebird	hsqldb
database.but i googled and see hsqldb.i wanna make a decision between firebird and hsqldb

the second jquery solution enables a limit to be set on the numbers of checkbox selected

1188018
value	field
clearing the extra field value once

1188031
firebird	hsqldb
i recomend hsqldb because it s implements in java .so you have the same platform as the application and i guess that you don t need any of the feature for the project of that size that could firebird provide

1188033
put	get
are you sure the html you get back from your ajax is the same as the code that you are using .when you put it in statically

1188044
command-prompt	cmd
it does not have visual-studio integration but it is easy enough to issue cmd from the command-prompt in a separate console

1188064
tuples	sorted
the bisect module will do this but it compares based on the normals python comparison order whereas you seem to be sorted based on the second elements of each tuples

1188064
contains	sorted
the list contains the sorted key only

1188077
toupper	tolower
i prefer the comparator approach to doing some sort of tolower toupper on everything dictionary-related

1188105
javascript	dom
while developing i added the javascript calling code to the client page and found that the content child member of the silverlight component could not be found in the dom in firefox -- but it could be found in ie

1188108
child-process	spawn
if you spawn a child-process in ruby using kernel.system for example can it use a different cpu to the parent process

1188108
child-process	spawn
if .so can you use multiple threads within the same cpu in a parent process and have each thread spawn a child-process that can use a different cpu even in ruby 1.8

1188114
arguments	default
the default only apply to missing argumentss and only the last arguments s can be missing

1188136
assign	add
rather i add the code to assign it in the view s constructor explicit

1188140
put	get
the other thing you get with the dispatcherertimer is that it s tick event is automatically evaluated on the dispatcher queue .so you don t have to explicit put it in the dispatcher queue.

1188155
any	set
they have a special set of characters that are allowed within their syntax but both can be used to manipulate other symbols to use any function infix see the ocaml discussion

1188163
contains	elements
the sprite class contains a setupanimation function which allocates an arrays of floats contains coordinates on the textures each elements of the arrays refers to a frame of animation

1188189
getter	setter
in .net 2.0 methods including properties getter setter would be inline if they had fewer than 32 bytes

1188192
getter	setter
yes in java you need a lot of line but i just write my attributes and tell the ide please create getter and setter for me

1188209
constructor	object
many useful patterns include passing that cli arguments hash to object constructor

1188229
python	php	python	c++
i m currently planning to do the web application user-interface in any of the languages php python and delegation all the image-manipulation work to a dedicated-server with my application logic written in c++

1188242
selected	button
creating a next button and .when it s tapped the next uitableview row will be selected

1188242
selected	button
as you can see below i added a toolbar and if i press the right button it has to selected the next row

1188251
javascript	dom
.so you know changes to the dom with javascript are not reflected .when you view the .source

1188253
value	field
all field display their proper value except testimonialx which returns null

1188256
zend-framework	codeigniter
updates also zend-auth courtesy of the zend-framework is supposed to be very good and can be integrated into codeigniter

1188258
constructor	object
are you using it from the constructor of another statically initializer object

1188266
webforms	asp.net
is there a way to do cross-domain posting in asp.net webforms

1188270
ruby	php
have heard about a few actionscript libs aszip and fzip that might be possible or could do this in ruby or even possibly php

1188285
click	mouse
the user-interface i had in mind is each words would be highlight .when the mouse hovers over it or that the spaces after it is being highlight and .when the user click a textbox to enter the comment popup near the place the comment would appear

1188297
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is not an asp.net-mvc application but standards webforms if that s information needed

1188303
attributes	properties
the entity class has several foreign key attributes in the database that i want to setup as properties in the entity class

1188303
attributes	properties
each properties will be of types attributes with an id description properties

1188311
rdfs	owl
the core principles would include understanding of rdf rdfs owl and

1188320
triggers	insert
add an on insert triggers which sets sort_order to md5 url

1188326
variables	boolean
alternatively break out of these functions and return null if your population alteration code is still running use some kind of boolean sentinel variables perhaps

1188336
selected	button
i want to use the autocompleteextender control but i want to use it with a dropdownlistfor or radio button that let me selected the search types

1188347
spaces	output
this is relying on the output of urlencode always using two characters for the encode form and that you are happy to have spaces convert to +

1188356
strong-typing	types
do you mean static-typing where everything has a types that is known at compile-time and conversions are restrict or strong-typing everything has a types known at runtime and conversions are restrict

1188356
strong-typing	types
it has strong-typing in that every object has a definite types even if it can t be known at compile-time and conversions are restrict

1188367
contains	elements
the types contains one elements messages and one attributes status

1188376
revision	svn
do not store the svn revision in the assemblyversion but instead in the assemblyinformationalversion

1188376
revision	svn
that way your application can still access it for display purposes although you can t use windows-explorer anymore to quickly checked the svn revision

1188376
revision	svn
do not store the svn revision in the assemblyversion but instead in the assemblyproduct or assemblydescription field

1188378
selected	button
perhaps there s some complexity to your question that i m missing but you could simply tracking the selected row in your code and .when you get the event from the toolbar button increment your selected row index and use the

1188379
difference	factors
there are plenty of php and asp.net jobs around and even if there was a massive difference i m not sure that should even be a factors unless you liked both equally

1188390
subclassing	base-class
have some common base-class and then subclassing to represent

1188401
authentication	login
instead of authentication directly with the database from the winforms .app create a simple web service that allows you to pass in a username and passwd and receive an authentication token in response upon successful login

1188413
nsnumber	optional
in my core datamodel i have an entity with an optional nsnumber attributes

1188417
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1188419
callback	methods
see asp.net-ajax callback to web methods in aspx pages

1188432
configuration	environment
the development environmnt defined in configuration environment development.rb is largely different than the production one defined in configuration environment development.rb

1188449
installation	packaging
.when working on a project that has packaging .war what s the best way to deploy it to your maven repository such as a company-wide nexus installation

1188449
configuration	logging	configuration	environment
for example let s say you have a web.app where the environment-specific properties files such as database connection strings logging configuration etc. which differ based on dev qa production environment are include in the final packaged .app based on properties or environment variables

1188449
.war	jar
should it be the .war file with production settings or a jar of all of the classes and none of the resources

1188451
postgresql	firebird
for instances i had the same problem with the jaybird drivers to firebird but the code worked fine with the postgresql drivers

1188455
vbscript	vb.net
how do you declare a default indexed properties in vb.net such that it is callable from vbscript

1188481
contains	elements
i have a fairly complex page which contains an absolutely positioning table as the last elements in body

1188481
attributes	properties
in the ie-developer-tools dock the properties is presented as cellpadding all lowercase whereas the cellspacing attributes is presented as cellspacing and if i change its value under the attributess tab to 0 layout gets fixed and the named is changed to cellpadding

1188494
value	field
i m using the ipostupdateseventlistener interface to do updates audit-logging now grabbing the old and new value then storing each updatess field in an audit table and all that jive

1188494
traversal	parent
ideas to .solve #1 ranged from requiring a parent properties on every object .so i can traversal the graphing looking for the employee types which to me would pollute our domain too much for a simple persistent concern to using a separate sql job to tranverse the foriegn key and fill in the employee id after the fact i d rather not maintain a separate sql job as everthing is codebase thus far - and that sql job will get quite nasty very quick

1188498
jquery-ui-tabs	jquery-tabs
i ve read through the documentation for jquery-ui-tabs 1.7 and i believe i m a bit in over my head with the jquery-tabs in terms of having specific events happen .when a specific tab is click

1188498
selected	textbox
i have the basic tabs working and i would simply like to set the focus on a textbox .when a specific tab is selected

1188498
selected	textbox
i would like to add the ability for .when the 4th tab is selected i set the focus to a textbox something similiar to

1188501
json	xml
why not use something simpler like a properties-file or if you want more structure something with existing parsing like xml or json

1188506
text-align	display
use display inline-block on both span and text-align right on .options instead of floats no compatible with fx2 though and only working in ie6 7 because span is an inline elements by default

1188553
linux	unix
if you are on linux unix use the nohup cmd

1188580
multi-query	mysql
depending on your language and mysql libs you might not be able to issue the multi-query approach .so you re better off with using the first approach

1188594
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
to is the data in the textbox in the correct format to is there an item in the dropdownlistfor selected to is there an item in a listbox mutually exclusive listbox

1188606
multicast	packets
i have a quick and dirty proof of concept .app that i wrote in c# that reads high data rate multicast udp packets from the network

1188624
primitive	int
you have to implements the operators as a non-member function to allow a primitive int on the left hand side

1188651
callback	methods
off the cuff i think you need some more logic in some of your callback methods like surfacecreated

1188661
spring	guice
but you d prefer using a framework like guice or spring that will allow you to glue stuff together in a clean way

1188678
push	pull
people can still push and pull from you because the repository still has all the data about the changeset

1188678
push	pull
you re never going to login to bitbucket s servers edit your code and commit there -- you re only ever going to push pull clone

1188714
arrays	loops
considering that everyone is always worried about user data and rightly .so would it be sufficient to simply loops through each external arrays .when you get it and apply a mysql_real_escape_string

1188735
click	mouse
i don t think idle will do it for you but if you use wing you can mouse over the named of the module and do a ctrl - left click or open the right click context menu on the module named and selected goto definition. simple

1188758
any	set
any ideas what i may of set up wrong

1188770
firefox	opera
.so now with the new firefox opera ie is it finally time to start developing sites with html5 or is it still a little premature and will cause compatibility issues

1188793
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling exception-handling

1188798
large-files	seek
i need to seek because my application deals with large-files in a non-sequential order

1188805
debian	linux
client is running windows based os server that will export him the java web .app is running linux debian

1188817
fflush	gets
supposedly a fflush.php in a maintenace folder will fflush it s caching which is invconveniently separate from the rest of drupal s caching but trying to execute in browser gets me an error

1188832
versioning	upgrade
i recommend keeping a list of all software that your project utilizes along with their versioning and last upgrade date along with other important information such as licensing info support info etc.

1188832
versioning	upgrade
software on this list with an old versioning date and a newer versioning available may be incentive enough to convince management that an upgrade should be done

1188834
any	set
because activerecord autodiscovers your table and column properties this will cause the same default to be set in any model using it in any standards ruby-on-rails .app

1188848
bug-tracking	bugzilla
i have two repositories configure - bugzilla which the project uses for internal bug-tracking and a local repository

1188863
order	add
for part 1 of your question add an order by clause to your query

1188870
exception-handling	try-catch
you would then use the demand methods in a try-catch and return on failure the raising of a security exception-handling

1188907
environment	building
anyway the next step to getting eclipse to integrated properly with our existing environment would be finding a way to drive our current building tool waf from within the ide

1188910
bugzilla	mantis
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla .when it comes to features you could defined separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1188922
sql-server	oracle
this way i can run sql-server tests and oracle tests separately like this

1188922
subclassing	base-class
however it appears that nose will only look for attributes on the subclassing not on the base-class

1188922
base-class	metaclass
if i was just dealing with one base-class i d just use a metaclass and defined the attributes on each class

1188922
sql-server	oracle
but i get an uneasy feeling about having a metaclass for the test class a metaclass for oracle and a metaclass for sql-server

1188927
python	php
i was testing a web service in php and python

1188939
32-bit	64bit
i was thinking of building a class that had 2 64bit or 4 32-bit numbers

1188940
salt	md5
you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url

1188951
raw-sockets	packets
i am sending syn packets using raw-sockets in linux

1188966
triggers	insert
remember it is critical for triggerss to do two things run as fast as humanly possible and account for proccesing all the recording inthe batch-file triggerss should never have row-by-row process or other slow processses or assume only one row will be in insert or deleted tables dynamic-sql in a triggers is porbably also a bad idea as you can t test out all the possibilites beforehand and can bring your whole production server to a screaming halt .when some unexpected thing happens

1188973
xsd	xml	contains	set
i have an xsd generator from a set of existing java classes and currently it successfully unmarshalls xml messagess into the object as expected however what i d like the ability to do is where i have an existing instances of the object have the unmarshaller simply updates the field that are contains within the messages passed to it

1188973
xsd	xml
if i had an annotations class book with numerous field title author published etc and corresponding generator xsd alot of the field set to being not required i d like to be able if i received the following xml

1188975
contains	any
as a rules properties shouldn t contains almost any logic other than possibly some boundary checked and types checked depends on language

1188975
exception-handling	error-handling
thus every item on the list other than error-handling exception-handling should not be factors .when implements properties

1188975
exception-handling	error-handling
w.r.t error-handling it is absolutely ok to throw exception-handling from properties .when a calling block attempts to set a properties to an invalid value

1188995
python	php
it seems that php will auto follow this redirect and thus not throw the error whereas python won t

1189002
put	get
.when i cut out something and put it somewhere else i sometimes get something else like a messed up part of my previous selection or just some whitespaces

1189010
quicktime	qtkit
i believe that kmovieloadstateplayable belongs to a quicktime framework and i have both qtkit and and the quicktime framework in my program but i can t figure out why it is erroring here

1189014
pthreads	fork
this did not make sense to me .so i tested on the simulator pthreads works fork doesn t

1189015
instances	private
your private instances variables is named instances but your trying to assign to a variables called _instances in the getter

1189025
implements	abstract
if that is the case you can use an abstract-class that is implements by those extramanagermodels and you inherited the abstract parent of those classes for the childc class

1189029
value	field	getter	setter
if you have a public getter and setter that strictly copies the value passed to class field i think that s just overcomplicated approach

1189029
getter	setter
the only situation i can think of where you would want to use getter or setter is .when you have to process the value somehow

1189032
directory	folder
right click your project go to properties go to msbuild options tab you will see an output folder by default it should have some path called precompiledweb that s where your output is and you need deploy this to your iis directory

1189045
getter	setter
the right thing to do from a purist oo perspective is create your own setter getter methods ideally by overloading php s that makes the relevant data available

1189057
environment	building
building the .war once and use the same .war for each environment

1189058
getter	setter
just do good oop i suggest you to declare getter and setter against accessing variables directly.. and forget about __get and __set

1189059
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote a function that does this in ie by creating a button object and setting value view but in firefox and google-chrome the button display with no text

1189063
pthreads	fork
and as you said pthreads work and fork doesn t .so its logical it would work on the real one as well

1189073
sqldatasource	gridview
you might also use the sqldatasource and gridview controls they help a lot

1189078
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
i added this new view to a uiwindow after adding the uinavigationcontroller s view

1189097
linux	unix
it should run under linux unix

1189102
getter	setter
that s why we have the terror of getter and setter methods

1189111
spreadsheet	xlrd
i m trying to translation an excel spreadsheet to csv using the python xlrd and csv modules but am getting hung up on encoding issues

1189111
row	col
i ll be the first to admit that i have only a vague sense of how character encoding works .so most of what i ve tried .so far are various fumbling permutation of .encode and .decode on the s.cell_value row col

1189111
row	col
.when i user this_row.append s.cell row col s.cell instead of s.cell_value the entire document writes without errors

1189114
getter	setter
not only in php but in object oriented programming in general if a class has member variables for which it s not necessary to execute code .when they are accessed there s no need to make setter and getter and the variables can be accessed directly

1189126
getter	setter
but note that using getter setter is said to have a cost it costs some cpu .when you speak about performance as you have to call a methods

1189126
getter	setter
.when i don t need to checked anything i don t use getter setter

1189127
contains	set	contains	elements
presentation is best handled by css .so set up a style-rule using a class that contains the information about how you want the elements to look

1189143
32-bit	64bit
4 bytes on a 32-bit platform and 8 bytes on a 64bit platform

1189146
advantage-database-server	dbf
as the title suggest i was wondering if there is a python-module that can access an advantage-database-server sybase files such as adt and dbf

1189147
required	checked
the issue i m having is this i need to checked a response to see if the login attempt is successful and if it is i need to retrieve the cookies from the http-headers .so that i can use that cookies to perform the various actions the application required

1189155
buffering	capture
my solution is to write a subclassing of httpservletresponsewrapper which overrides the getwriter and getoutput methods and capture the data into a buffering

1189162
signals	sigint
the documentation for the thread module states that the keyboardinterrupt exception-handling which is ordinarily triggers by sigint can be delivered to an arbitrary thread unless you have the signals module available to you which all unix systemd should have

1189170
json	xml
i ve used the first and last and between those two i really like httpriot - really easy to use doesn t get in your way and converts both xml and json response into nsarray and nsdictionary

1189174
httpwebrequest	webrequest
use an httpwebrequest and an httpwebresponse or just webrequest webresponse if they give you enough functionality

1189181
environment	building
the problem is i can t make changes and building to the websphere test environment

1189186
32-bit	64bit
c# struct in 32-bit are aligned at 4 byte boundaries and in 64bit they are 8 byte aligned

1189186
32-bit	64bit
instances of this struct will take up 4 bytes in 32-bit process and 8 bytes in 64bit process even though the int bar takes just 4 bytes on both 32-bit and 64bit process

1189186
32-bit	64bit
the simple struct bar seems to take 4 bytes on both 32-bit and 64bit process

1189186
32-bit	64bit
the other struct foo seems to take 8 bytes on 32-bit 4 bytes for the int and 4 bytes for the reference to the uri but 16 bytes on 64bit 4 bytes for the int 8 bytes for the reference to the uri and i think 4 bytes for alignment

1189194
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
internet-explorer will allow you to ajax remote domain .when running from file but firefox and google-chrome won t

1189198
row	col
i m not smart enough to work out what particular line is causing the problem - if you edit your question to tell me what line s causing that error messages i might be able to help a bit more i guess it s either this_row.append s.cell_value row col or bcw.writerow this_row but would appreciate you confirming

1189211

exception-handling	try-catch
are you saying you are wrapping it in a try-catch .so that you can catch .when an exception-handling occurs and log this

1189479
getter	setter
this allowed auxiliary tools to be built which were based on at the time novel ideas like specifying exactly what the named of getter and setter were and an expectations that specific methods would exist without needing to ascribe to an interface

1189482
pointers	stack
the main difference would be that local-variables in the case of classes their pointers are stored on stack and in your first case if your function were for some reason recursive having two local variables instead of one will cause you to run out of stack spaces faster in a deep-recursive function

1189523
sinatra	ramaze
which i believe is a syntax that is used only by ruby-on-rails not by merb sinatra or ramaze

1189634
linux	unix
on other unixes it is a bit trickier if you are using gcc 4.1 or later you can just use its built-in __sync_val_compare_and_swap and many though not all unix compilers support reasonable gcc extensions since a lot of code originating on linux assumes they are present

1189636

1189778
callback	methods
i am not a c# programmer and it has been a while since i did java but i think an approach in java which may also apply in c# would be to have the player object pass an instances of a lock_unlock_credentials inner class as a parameter to the get_locked get_unlocked methods of the doors object or lock object as has been suggested. the lock_unlock_credentials object would have callback methods which by virtue of its being an inner class of player could access relevant field of the player object but those field would otherwise not be exposed outside of player

1189778
callback	methods
the lockable object could then use those callback methods to checked to see if the requirements it cares about are met

1191085
itextsharp	pdfsharp
i need to add a table using itextsharp or even pdfsharp if it can do it into an existing pdf templates at a particular location in the templates

1191105
ubuntu	linux
i run a q6600 2.4ghz 4gb of ram 64bit linux ubuntu 9.04 systemd and this query can take up to 6.7 seconds to run i do have a huge database

1191107
jprofiler	hprof
jprofiler is pretty nifty but you can get the same information using hprof which was introduced in java 5

1191107
32-bit	64bit
keep in mind also that different platform have different maximum heap sizes based on architecture 32-bit vs 64bit os and even the jvm

1191112
hash	md5	salt	md5
clients-side md5 hash with time salt

1191113
value	field
i have a selected form field that i want to mark as readonly as in the user cannot modify the value but the value is still submitted with the form

1191126
jquery	.post
new to the jquery ajax methods and i am just wondering how to capture the elements passed in the jquery.ajax call using .post on a c# asp.net page

1191143
populate	row
you don t actually need a triggers you can just reference the sequences s next value .when you populate the new row into the table

1191145
stderr	stdout
stdin stdout and stderr are global streaming constants default value

1191145
stderr	stdout
stdin stdout and stderr are global-variables initializer to the value of the streaming constants

1191145
stderr	stdout
i believe defout and deferr were deprecated some time ago with the release of ruby 1.8.2 and current best practice is to use only stdin stdout and stderr

1191147
google-docs	spreadsheet
on the other hand i would hate to have to use the google-docs spreadsheet for anything more than sharing small lists on the web

1191147
google-docs	spreadsheet
silverlight overcomes the various limitations which lead to the google-docs spreadsheet not being better than it is

1191157
linux	osx
i don t know that this works with all os s windows but it worked .when i tested it with both osx and linux

1191158
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
expect string-comparison to be case-sensitive is and eq operators are case-insensitive

1191164
firefox	safari
firefox safari will continue working

1191200
triggers	insert
each table would have a triggers on insert where the id would be set from the next numbers in the sequences

1191205
oracle	mysql
i m not 100 sure about mysql but with oracle you can defined a sequences then simply use that same sequences to selected all of your value from which is probably the best option if it is available with mysql

1191207
triggers	insert
inorder to achieve the same effect in mysql you will need to create a before insert and a before updates triggers to make sure that both value are valid

1191221
click	mouse
using the wx.evt_menu_open means that the file menu can be opened then .when the mouse hovers over about the self.onabout function get s called which i only what to happen .when the user click specifically on the about menu

1191226
configuration	installation
.so you want to install a configuration file by modify it dynamically during installation

1191226
vbscript	jscript
finally before you even think about using vbscript go and read why vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

1191233
contains	set
could you have a stack or order set order by how the user applied filtering to their browsing contains your breadcrumbs stored on the session

1191240
any	set
i m using fstream since it s used for reading and writing but i didn t include any of the open modes because i thought i could write and read to from the file without them i m pretty sure you have to use one i m just not sure which one. also i m not sure if the way i set up the equalss operators is legal or not will it read it as if s i is equals to a or e or i or o or u

1191244
entity-framework	nhibernate
i have been working with nhibernate linq-to-sql and entity-framework for quite some time

1191265
formencode	mako
i m working in pylons with mako and i d like to create forms and validation with formencode for several parts of my application

1191269
double	int
taking the int into floats or double only brings in all the quirks of floating-point numbers such as their ability to represent more numbers close to zero than close to one

1191310
order	add
you can set this to the correct order though you need to exercise care to ensure you don t omit items or add extras

1191319
jquery	dojo	dojo	dwr
we are using jersey jsr-311 for rest on server and was wondering that instead of using libs like jquery or dojo if there is a libs that can take a rest class annotations using jsr311 annotations and create javascript stubs like dwr does

1191322
lookup	any
after that the attacker can just lookup any particular hash value against the table and determine the plaintext passwd

1191324
any	set
because of the loss of generality i do not need to implements a delete function for any of the databasing code i do not need to building secondary indic to gate on different types of coordinates just one set effectively count each points only once etc

1191378
jtextfield	jlist
use a jtextfield to enter in the calculations and a jlist to display the old ones and their answers

1191379
selected	checkbox
i may also try including a checkbox with each image and have the checkbox selected if the image is

1191381
directory	folder
.when you are designing an application assumed in english and you ask the user to provide a path to a directory folder do you use the term directory or folder

1191386
firefox	safari
he forwarded it to all his friend and they all use firefox or safari now

1191388
directory	folder
for command-line applications directory rather than folder seems to be the norm everywhere including win32

1191389
scala	java
you can access most popular scripting languages via java 6 s scripting api as well though scala and clojure don t seem to be officially supported

1191402
attributes	properties
parsing error messages the id properties of a control can only be set using the id attributes in the tag and a simple value

1191405
input-field	selected	hide	show
.when you selected usa from the country list it hide the othstate field .when you selected any country other then the usa it hide the usa statelist and show the input-field

1191405
input-field	selected
1 solution i was thinking is to have 2 javascript functions and use php to parsing the correct one depending on there country that deals with the issue if they have other country then the usa saved it would load with example england selected but would show usa states instead of state input-field and vice

1191410
directory	folder
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1191420
python	java
i would like to use this one because it is a python framework i like python more than java but i don t know if they have implements the advanced features of a web-crawler

1191428
keyboard	mouse
keyboard mouse disks they all just stop and the image on my screens are frozen

1191428
compact-framework	.net
i will be using the .net compact-framework and need some pointers in the right directions to do the following

1191431
jtextfield	jlist
if you are open to different interfaces you might want to try something like a jtextfield at the top of your view from which you can receive as input your new inputted equation and then below it with the same width a jlist that would scroll to have all of the previous equation and their results

1191432
python	ruby
in dynamic-languages such as ruby and python the concept of a formal inversion-of-control pattern with a traditional for us static guys interface-driven implementation doesn t exist

1191443
credentials	account
the windows service itself is run using the credentials of a user account on the local machine thought to be needed because the code required access to hkcu

1191446
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
note that if you actually need to simulate a general click regardless of whether it s performed by mouse keyboard touch input or other methods or other high-level integration with the control you should probably use wpf automation api instead

1191447
managed-code	unmanaged
is there any web documentation explaining how unmanaged structures are treated by managed-code

1191452
callback	methods
that is you can t single-step into a callback and have your code windows show you the first line of code in the remote methods

1191473
contains	set	contains	elements
you could make the elements contains the bg text have a lower stack order z-index positioning and possibly even set opacity

1191484
put	get
i put all my shorcuts and cmd in here and i attach it to the win-r key .so i can get to them easily

1191489
python-mode	yasnippet
i find python-mode and yasnippet to be useful for writing python in emacs

1191490
arrays	loops
i found that the words go was a problem .when running scriptinging via ado.net .so the code does a split operation on the overall scripting with go as the delimiter then loops through the arrays of cmd and execute them one at a time

1191497
order	join
i am building a view in sql-server 2000 and 2005 and i ve noticed that the order of the join statements greatly affects the execution plan and speed of the query

1191497
order	join
i always thought that the query optimizer would interpreter the query appropriately without considering join order but it seems that order matters

1191497
order	join
.so since order does seem to matter is there a join strategy i should be following for writing faster queries

1191505
shell	bash
john wants to create a variables called myval with the value hello world in the linux shell bash

1191513
order	join
outer join will cause execution to vary wildly based on order inner-join tend to be optimized to the most efficient route but again order matters

1191525
png	gif	tga	png
i ve tried png gif tga

1191535
user-interface	look-and-feel
as most of the web-parts user-interface has been done at the development level.having xslt will allow you to change the look-and-feel of the web part at any time you want

1191545
cartesian-coordinates	points
with a base map it is easy to display latitude-longitude points using simple cartesian-coordinates

1191548
required	checked
the best way would be an xmlhttprequest to checked login and close them if required - do this periodically

1191549
object-reference	instances
seems fairly straight forwarding and simple i am doing the following and getting an object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error

1191553
linux	unix
note as i am not familiar with threads on windows i hope the discussion will be limited to linux unix threads

1191556
getter	setter
and it s not possible with setter getter function you have to call setlabel bla from the scripting

1191556
getter	setter
2 properties are basically the same functions as setter and getter

1191594
shell	bash
bash does not source .bashrc .when invoked as a login shell

1191594
shell	bash
for interactive shell bash does not source .bash_profile

1191603
haskell	lisp	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	lisp	scheme	lisp	scheme	ocaml
functional-programming haskell scheme ocaml lisp others tend to espouse pure functions

1191616
order	join
at devconnections a few years ago a session on sql-server performance stated that a order of outer join does matter and b .when a query has a lot of join it will not look at all of them before making a determination on a plan

1191618
z-index	overlay
reset the css display .so the modal-dialog div is visible overlay on top of the page by setting the css z-index properties

1191619
order	join
i have to disagree with all previous answers and the reason is simple if you change the order of your left join your queries are logically different and as such they produce different result sets

1191623
value	field
if you are adding a new recording add a statement before you try to set the value of your field

1191623
value	field
if you are editing an existing recording you need to call rs_view.update after you have set the value for your field you wish to change the value of

1191626
decompression	on-the-fly
it turns out that parsing the json code using is a bigger overhead than either pulling the raw-data off disk or decompression it which i do on-the-fly

1191626
python	java	python	php
i use java but work with people using php python and other languages

1191638
python	java	python	php	python	c++
they re cross platform c++ java python with third party binding for php also

1191655
linux	unix
under linux unix threading hasn t been well supported in the past although i believe linux now has pthreads thread support and other unices support threading now via libs or natively

1191655
linux	unix
the most common alternative to threading under linux unix platform is fork

1191655
linux	unix
it s an older way of doing things under linux unix but still well used

1191681
emacs	vim
emacs vim vs express

1191690
progress-bar	progress
i ve written an article about implements the windows 7 taskbar progress api in c# see windows 7 taskbar progress-bar with c# and .net

1191700
debugging	trace
.when the application halts and you look at the call stack debugging windows can you trace the callback to the last call from your code

1191704
error-code	hresult
the error-code you re getting is hresult 0x80040e37 as mangled by some intermediate step that doesn t know about unsigned int32 s -- it s the generics odbc error for can t open that table normally due to a mis-spelling

1191704
temporary	copy
if you can t temporary detach the .dbf file from other uses while you briefly read from it then one approach might be to copy it to another named still .dbf and try to open that copy -- does it work or still fail with the same error

1191707
configuration	environment
the deployment configuration allows a non-technical qa resource to deploy to the test environment whenever they re ready to test something and avoids the confusion of whether a bug fix has hit the test environment yet

1191713
access-control	authentication
i am currently using authlogic for authentication and acl9 for access-control

1191730
selected	checkbox
i need some help on .when pulling up the job recording to edit how to then bind the parts recordinging selected in the many to relationship recordinging into the checkbox list

1191730
selected	checkbox
in the lotus-notes control a user could easily use a key strokes within the checkbox list by typing the first couple letters of a part selected a value and then a pressing comma allows them to begin typing the next part

1191735
entity-framework	ado.net
with this project you get a drivers with full ado.net 2.0 support ado.net entity-framework support and visual-studio database-design time integration

1191749
javascript	dom	arrays	loops
if you re going to be doing javascript i recommend getting a basic understanding of how it works loops conditional such as if else variables object arrays and then moving on to a firm understanding of the document object-model dom

1191749
python	php	web-applications	frontend
the browser is for web-applications where the frontend javascript is meant to interact with the user and the backend php ruby-on-rails python .net etc is meant to interact with the filesystems

1191751
google-chrome	firefox
this works for a new tab in firefox and google-chrome doesn t seem to work in ie 8 but this may depend on the doctype

1191766
actionscript	mxml
on a bit of a different line of thought -- is this an mxml flex project or an actionscript flex project

1191768
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter key do raise the keydown and keyup events

1191771
external	embed
i m trying to embed an external .swf file from an hta application that consists of html content javascript and vbscript

1191775
contains	any
in your code you are referring to the vfp oledb drivers which opens any vfp database contains tables free tables and the older foxpro 2.6 tables

1191792
duplicates	elements
after all if you assume the first duplicates found is repeated n 2 time it s still o n because you may need to look at 500 001 elements to find a duplicates

1191798
instances	destroy
wmd provides options to create and destroy instancess of itself but i have had no luck creating an instances and assign it to a specific textarea by id or class

1191818
.when	ready
features branches merge from trunk and only get merged back into trunk .when the feature is ready

1191820
octal	hex
i see it s stuck in a numbers of website but all the characters have been replace with their hex or octal equivalent

1191822
authentication	login
i am new to php i can do a simple login page e.g create form-submit form process and authentication in a php page and .so on

1191829
http	ssl
.when you purchase a certificate from verizon instant ssl they will give you some encrypted code using which you could configure your open ssl software and then having http urls will work

1191842
configuration	environment	environment	building
this can be useful to have one building for all environment with different configuration value log levels user named etc.

1191867
repository-pattern	poeaa
i ve been reading both ddd and poeaa books and searching a lot on the web but i m still confused and i think there is something i m missing about the repository-pattern

1191867
repository	entity
if i go for the generics repository i have the problem with dealing with an entity that not suports deleting to named some example

1191876
drools	ilog
first of all these have always been commercial rules engines ilog corticon and not open source drools hence deploy locally to each of the .app servers has never really been a viable option due to licensing costs

1191877
duplicates	elements
it has not found the duplicates yet and there still exist n 2 - log n unique elements for me to feed it if need be

1191877
duplicates	elements
in fact i cannot be forced to feed it a duplicates numbers until it has read n 2 elements

1191877
duplicates	elements
.so with an arrays of 4 billion numbers 2 billion of which are unique in no particular order there is a way to find the duplicates elements by only checked 32 elementss

1191881
arrays	loops
note that after n 4 iterator you ve used up all the n 2 unique numbers .so this loops will never iterate through more than 3 4 of the arrays if it is as specified

1191885
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
i cant recall who actually did it but in the early days of .so - jeff encountered similar problems to what your experiencing well not exactly the same but the desire for the non obfuscation .source resulted in .someone s reverse-engineering a readable form

1191889
click	mouse
.when i click the validation captcha submit button using the mouse i am validation whether captcha is-empty and showing a javascript alert

1191889
textbox	button
i am unable to add keypress event to textbox and call validation captcha button event as i am using the 3rd party user-controls which i cannot modify

1191890
protected	public
note you should make your base classes explicit public private or protected rather than relying on the default

1191892
directory	folder
for example i have html folder and xml folder in same directory

1191908
contains	set
.when you write the instances for set rbt a you defined contains for the specific types a only

1191908
boolean	int
rbt int is a set of int s rbt bool is a set of boolean etc

1191908
contains	elements
contains t - elements t - bool

1191925
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
there are different javascript frameworks like jquery dojo mootools google web toolkit gwt yui etc

1191934
uiscrollview	subviews
there s no real way of doing this via a published api however i think that in this case it s ok to guess the uiscrollview subviews .so long as you make sure your application doesn t crash if you can t find the uiscrollview

1191934
uiscrollview	subviews
edit the above will not work because the first subviews of a uiwebview is a uiscroller not a uiscrollview my memory might be playing tricks on me

1191947
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
your current definition of set t doesn t mention the contains types in the class definition .so the member contains has to work for any a

1191953
hashtable	set
for example a typical question might be given an arrays of n items not knowing whether there is a majority item to determine whether there is one and which one it is in o n time and o 1 auxiliary spaces .so you can t just set up a hashtable or .something to count occurrences of different value

1191953
ethernet	lan
another interesting variation what if you have 64bit numbers 8 terabytes worth of data overall say on a bigtable or clone thereof and as many machines as you want each with about 4gb of ram on a pretty fast lan say one that s substantially better than gb ethernet -- how do you shard the problem under those conditional

1191955
perl	tcl
i am working with vmd a molecular dynamic visualization package and i want to open vmd from a perl scripting run a tcl scripting printing the output to a logfile then close vmd and return to the perl scripting

1191955
stdin	eof
-eofexit terminate vmd .when eof on stdin is reached

1191977
subclassing	base-class
you can make a base templates class templatess just on itemtype keep the data there have the full-fledged 2-args templates subclassing that base and put the copy-from in the base-class as it doesn t depend on the functor anyway

1191983
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
in c++ .when a class inherited other class if i create an object for the subclassing then will the subclassing object-create memory for all data-members and member-functions for the superclass too

1191994
contains	set	contains	elements
let set s be a set contains n elements

1191999
order	join
this is why the join order is affecting results because it s a different query declarative speaking

1192000
subclassing	superclass
vtables are another issue and are per-class and not per-instances anyway -- an instances of the subclassing embed if you will one of the superclass

1192000
subclassing	superclass
say all instances-variables are 32-bit int for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instances of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instances-variables plus 12 for the instances-variables of the superclass

1192003
external	embed
i m not sure about hta files but i know you can directly embed external .swf files into your webpage via something like

1192008
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
of course if you just want to end up with a 32-bit argb greyscale colour from that the lower byte isnt going to matter because you re going from a 16-bit luminance to 8bit r g b components

1192008
16-bit	8bit
for example the above code does a linear mapping however you may get better-looking results by using a logarithmic curve to map the 16-bit value to 8bit rgb components

1192026
aggregate	grouping
edit if you want to use a column as both aggregate and non-aggregate or if you need to desegregate your grouping you will need to use a subquery as such

1192043
ubuntu	debian
looks like you re missing some package like python_dev or the like -- debian and derivative including ubuntu have long preferred to isolate everything that could possibly be of developer s use from the parts of a package that are for everybody .

1192052
filtering	sorting
you could look at using ibindinglistview if you want sorting and filtering

1192055
google-chrome	firefox
it is not browser specific and happens on ie firefox google-chrome

1192059
short	zero
in short how to reliably discover a server running somewhere on a presumably multi-segmented local area network with zero client configuration

1192059
udp	tcp
if the server and client are running on networks separated by a hub switching that won t forwarding udp the most likely case then i have a server instances running on each segment and they forwarding client request to each other via tcp - but i need to configure this for the server instancess simple but still a pain for tech support. this is the main problem that i need to address

1192067
json	xml
using json or xml as data-exchange format for instances

1192067
json	xml
the view in one case rendering a full html page in the other case only a part of it or some json xml format

1192069
user-interface	flicker
ajax can increase the performance of your .app and improve the user experience and user-interface by eliminating bloated data transfer and screens flicker refresh

1192070
linux	unix
can some of you suggest a good reading for socket programming in unix linux

1192083
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
it has no virtual methods that you can overrides except equals gethashcode and tostring

1192083
protected	public
be sure to read the documentation - this is a very easy class to derive from but you have to realize the difference between the public non-virtual and protected virtual methods

1192098
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s really just because plain ajax +json works much better with asp.net-mvc than asp.net webforms

1192098
webforms	asp.net
because of the way asp.net webforms muddled together the view and the controllers and not to mention having postback viewstate -- its crutch to allow pre-ajax pages to overcome web statelessness this was initially very difficult

1192105
implements	super
you can verify if they are the culprit by setting a breakpoints on them or implements them to call super and breaking on your own code.

1192114
transactional-memory	message-passing
communication between two threads is always via queue.queue -- a form of message-passing the only sane foundation for multiprocess besides transactional-memory which is promising but for which i know of no production-worthy implementation except in haskell

1192136
switching	router
where you say hub switching you appear mean ip router

1192136
multicast	packets
the clients then send their initial discovery request as a udp packets to the pre-ordained multicast address

1192142
relocation	linker
is there any difference between the address spaces relocation and the relocation task done by the linker

1192142
relocation	linker
as far as i know relocation task done by the linker include process of connecting the symbolic references to symbolic definitions.and address spaces relocation is concerned .when the executable file is to be brought into the memory and all its address references are resolved with reference to the starting address of the place where it is being placed in the memory isnt it

1192146
swing	swt
it feels as though swt is waning just an opinion based on literature i can find and swing is surging

1192153
constructor	object
the static constructor for the class won t be called until you make some access to the class create an object access a public static field or properties or call a static methods

1192154
togglebutton	expander
i think you could achieve this by binding a togglebutton which expander uses too internally to the maxheight properties of your listbox

1192156
jquery	dojo
great integration with dojo and jquery

1192166
configuration	environment
i had the identical question and got the same answer you cannot edit the connection-string used for package configuration hosted in sql-server except if you specify that the sql-server connection-string should be in an environment variables

1192166
configuration	environment
the trick is that you create a view to store your configuration settings on one central server and then use the machine that connect to it to determine which environment is active

1192166
triggers	insert
one other caveat that i found was that i had to add instead of triggers to my view to do the insert updates and deletes for configuration variables

1192179
handler	service
sometimes it s better to contains your asynchronous methods inside a web service or web handler instead of the page

1192193
duplicates	contains
are you able to duplicates the issue in a minimal project say a nav controllers and two view controllerss the second of which pushed onto the navigation stack from the first contains the uialertview and delegation

1192197
implements	extends
extends thread directly is considered bad practice prefer to implements runnable instead

1192200
value	field
.when the page loads i calculate value for all of the field

1192214
logout	login
it is written in java which makes it easy to reuse parts login logout checked for application error messages

1192217
contains	elements
in linq-to-sql if you try to get the first elements on a query with no results you will get sequences contains no elementss error

1192217
object-reference	instances
i can assure you that the mentioned error is not equals to object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1192217

1192685
division	modulo
is modulo remainder after division

1192696
order	join
the join order does make a difference to the resulting query

1192696
order	join
for multiple join use parentheses to change the natural order of the join

1192696
order	join
you can alter the join order using parentheses around the join bol does show this in the syntax at the top of the docs but it is easy to miss

1192696
order	join
you can also use the query hint option force order to force a specific join order but this can result in what are called bushy plans which may not be the most optimal for the query being execute

1192697
cursor	row
however using a dynamic cursor to perform updatess is not a good way to acheive an updates for a row

1192711

1192842
delegation	dealloc
i d like the delegation object to be able to detection .when the nstextfield is dealloc ed but i can t think of any way to do this which leaves me having to store a separate link to the delegation object from some other controllers and manually release it at some points which is very much less than ideal

1193016
pixels	line
this would be a example for a solid line with a margins of 5 pixels to the top and bottom and 10pixels to the left and right

1193065
key-value	key
that will ship with .net 4.0 sometime in the future the ef team has added what they call foreign key associations which in essence will allow you to just specify the foreign key-value categoryid instead of having to create load assign the whole associated entity

1193066
sql-server	oracle
like most isvs that have to support multiple rdbms we only need a solution that allows us to use the small subset of oracle that is the same as sql-server

1193066
sql-server	oracle
my real question is how can i write .net software that talks to oracle that is us pain free to install as .net software that talks to sql-server

1193066
sql-server	oracle
microsoft provides one for sql-server and oracle provides one for oracle

1193073

1193093
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari seem to not care about refreshing to reflect the changes

1193097
json	xml
calling the rest service is just a matter of creating the httpresponse and process the returned xml json value

1193103
linked-list	arrays
.so the choice i did was a .sort of linked-list implementation for all manipulation combined with an arrays both are kept synchronous all insert manipulation deletion is being done through the linked-list structure all rendering with the arrays structure

1193108
fortran	pascal	pascal	basic
dig out a copy of numerical recipes which you ll find in fortran c and c++ flavours or if your libs is very good also in basic and pascal and translation

1193112
sql-server	oracle
see also how to write a .net application that works with both sql-server and oracle

1193121
fatal-error	crash
the problem is that whenever users mishandle the feed link on their hands we have to manually remove the module from existence because zend feed crash and burns the entire page just like any fatal-error

1193138
base-class	inherited
if i have a task common to all derived classes is it ok for virtual base-class to do the task or should the derived inherited from two classed - from virtual interface and plain base that do the task

1193140
persistent	transient
org.hibernate.session.update is not for transient object - it s for updating persistent object

1193144
silverlight	wpf
certainly wpf silverlight is a designers dream as far as desktop user-interface is concerned since it s very flexible .so you ll find few restrictions on what is possible .when compared to other technologies

1193158
getter	setter
a members should be private - .so you may get problems using them in derived classes .so you have to add getter and setter methods which blow up your interface

1193164
data-members	constructor
constructor for d s data-members didn t run yet

1193170
while-loop	loops
what i would recomend is to use a while-loop and only insert links into temp table if the id does not already exist thus removing endless loops

1193185
contains	set
the gettext systemd echo strings from a set of binary files that are created from source text files contains the translation in different languages for the same sequences

1193189
median	min	median	max
min mean + -sd median max

1193203
firefox	safari	margins	padding
40px is the default left padding for ul elements in firefox and safari whereas ie sets a 30pt left margins

1193243
contains	any
if you have any control over the format for your input data your best choice would be to ensure that it contains a byte-order-mark

1193257
private	self
notice that code in define_process block iterator coroutine is execute with self points to something the controllers in your case and you ll have access both to protected and private stuff

1193260
getter	setter
.so i wound up with two classes which is more of a pain to maintain but the updates run through getter setter instead of binding which might scale better since it s not waiting on the change event

1193274
sql-server	oracle
if you re just using the subset of functionality that is common to both sql-server and oracle then you should be fine moving through to asp.net 4.0 and continuing to program how you do currently

1193274
sql-server	mysql
give me mysql sql-server or even access in preferences

1193275
postgresql	oracle
i am changing my database from postgresql to oracle 11g

1193286
entity-framework	ado.net
aren t people supposed to be using the ado.net entity-framework now

1193300
loading	gif
the html page show a loading gif image and then .when the document or error messages is returned it needs to handle these appropriately

uialertview	uiwebview
i m programming a navigation bar button to open a uiwebview in an external application and at first i started programming a uialertview then i thought that an action sheet might be better for this situation

1193387
font-size	height
also because you are setting the height in pixels as you increase the font-size the text becomes clipped at the bottom

1193387
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have tested this in recent versioning of firefox opera and safari and ie6 ie7 and ie8

1193393
swt	rcp
i then were wondering if before to dive head first anyone who would have preferably used it seriously had any advice warning or any constructive comment to do about using this product in an rcp view .so based on swt

1193409
display	width
note the div display with the correct width

1193410
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie6

1193419
javafx	swing
javafx uses swing as default layout engine .so you ll gain nothing using it rather than java-2d

1193419
swing	swt
on the other hand using either your home-grown toolkit or swing is generally a bad idea .when working with eclipse as it already embed the swt toolkit

1193419
swing	swt
the main advantage of swt over swing is that it use the os native widget

1193439
contains	elements
contains elements that may not be

1193454
project-management	project
program management is fairly similar to project-management where individual tasks are replace by entire project

1193456
boost	stl
you could implements the same without stl or boost if it is required

1193477
contains	any
each range is continuously there are no holes within a single range .so a range 8 to 16 will really contains all numbers between 8 and 16 but there can be holes between two ranges range starts at 64 and goes to 128 next range starts at 256 and goes to 384 .so .some numbers may not belong to any range at all numbers 129 to 255 would not belong to any range in this example

1193477
malloc	free
the problem .sounds similar to what a malloc implementation must do every free d memory block belongs to a range of available memory and the malloc implementation must find out to which one .so how do those commonly .solve the issue

1193501
derived-class	inherited
as a practice you should only use virtual inherited to defined interfaces as they are usually used with multiple-inherited to ensure that only one versioning of the class is present in the derived-class

1193501
base-class	inherited
virtual inherited makes no difference if the base-class is a pure interface except for slightly different compiler-errors in vc8 if all the methods are not implements

1193502
instances	private
instead of using setitems methods i m invoking private methods of collectionform private void additems ilist instances like this

1193504
ruby	php
i can use php or ruby ruby-on-rails for server language .so the language isn t important because both of them can send email and call systemd cmd

1193514
ms-access	oracle
mssql ms-access and oracle if you quote identifier correctly using or respectively

1193522
contains	any
since the end of any range is guaranteed to be smaller than start of the next range you don t need to care about the end until you have found a range where the positioning might be contains

1193526
display	width
offsetwidth display the actual width of your div

1193529
exponent	modulo
because rsaparameters have the following members d dp dq exponent inverseq modulo p q

1193550
contains	elements
a tag might contains multiple elements streaming separated by |

1193558
exponent	modulo
the public key is identified by modulo and exponent

1193560
exponent	modulo
exponent and modulo are the public key

1193563
xsd	xml
what is the difference between the xs and xsd prefixes in xml schema files

1193572
value	field
i want to delete many rows with the same set of field value in some 6 tables

1193582
attributes	properties
you can read a properties-file using java.util.properties and inject some request attributes from an action or inject the properties in the actionform

1193607
32-bit	64bit
more aptly put in a 32-bit int representation there is a countable numbers of int to be represented but there is an infinite innumerable numbers of real value that cannot be fully represented in a limited representation of 32 or 64bit

1193615
sql-delete	subquery
from is a t-sql extension to the standards sql-delete that provides an alternative to using a subquery

1193631
png	gif
is there a way to have jmeter actually create jpg gif or png files or whatever format that can be embedded in html

1193641
listbox	textbox
a textbox listbox and listview

1193641
listbox	textbox
the textbox is like a searching textbox where i search for folder s in a particular folder the list of searched folder will be display in listbox

1193641
selected	listbox
now if i selected any of the display folder in the listbox then the files available in the particular folder should be display in the listview

1193656
actionview	partials
the correct way to work around the actionview helpers as i stated in the article you cited is to create partials which access the model directly to fetch the data they need

1193666
data-members	instances
all-abtract base classes that are used to simulate interfaces in c++ should not have data-members - because they are describing an interface and instances state is an implementation detail

1193666
getter	setter
make them as hidden as possible and use getter and setter if you need to preserve class invariants

1193666
derived-class	inherited
design for inherited the contract of your class should defined the responsibilities and possibilities of a derived-class what it needs can overwrite for what purpose

1193684
textchanged	textbox
well there is a textchanged event in the textbox that triggers whenever a character is typed or deleted

1193691
derived-class	base-class
aprogrammer s answer made me realized that the static_cast could be easily avoided by passing the this-pointer from the derived-class to the base-class

1193691
constructor	object
note because the mem-initializer are evaluated in the scoping of the constructor the this-pointer can be used in the expression-list of a mem-initializer to refer to the object being initializer

1193710
nhibernate	ado.net
i think i ve seen ado.net data service as advertised to work with nhibernate

1193722
conditional	operators
if a and b are joined by multiple join conditional then you must use the + operators in all of these conditional

1193722
conditional	operators
a where conditional contains the + operators cannot be combined with another conditional using the or logical operators

1193722
conditional	operators
a where conditional cannot use the in comparison conditional to compare a column marked with the + operators with an expression

1193722
conditional	operators
if the where-clause contains a conditional that compares a column from table b with a constants then the + operators must be applied to the column .so that oracle returns the rows from table a for which it has generator nulls for this column

1193722
conditional	operators
for this reason you cannot apply the + operators to columns of b in the join conditional for a and b and the join conditional for b and c

1193769
bmp	png
java on windows knows how to export jpg png and bmp as far as i know

1193782

1193859
worksheet	excel
the column heading are returned in your query data but not automatically written to the excel worksheet

1193866
macros	vba
the only way i can think of to have ms-word scroll to a specific range .when a document is opened would be to include an autoopen vba macros that selected the range

1193866
macros	vba
for example to make the 9th paragraph be selected you would have to include the following vba code it goes without saying that this only works if macros are enabled

1193887
constructor	object
you might find that you have problems doing this -- from what i remember of objective-c++ you may find that the constructor and the destructor for your enclosed c++ object won t get called

1193892
put	get
do not get confused by the literals english-meaning of the words as they both can be used interchange-ably in the context you try to put them in

1193897
prism	mef
i am currently working on a wpf project using prism cal and am wondering if it is a good idea to use both prism and mef in one project

1193897
prism	mef
i would use prism for modularity and mef for extensibility

1193897
prism	mef
my project is a paint-like application .so prism would provide the module-separation toolbox canvas as modules etc. and mef would be used to provide an extensibility points for new shapes to paint ie

1193905

hide the content you don t want to show with the css properties

1193912
scripting-language	dsl
what are reasons to choose a non dsl scripting-language over statically compiled language such as c#

callback	methods
if i have a methods that performs some asynchronous operation and i want to notify call some sort of callback once it s done would i use delegation

1193931
calayer	uiview
and then applying that transform using the appropriate properties on your calayer or uiview s backing layer will tilt the layer in 3-d

1193940
configuration	environment
merge different environment specific configurationuration value with a base configuration this leaves us with staging.configuration test.configuration etc

1193946
aggregate	grouping
next you should never write a grouping query with field in the output that are neither grouping nor aggregate

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
though an interface .so you can call any types of database who s connection object implements the idbconnection interface sql-server mysql oracle etc. and it just works

1193976
hide	show
this code will show and hide an animated-gif progress-bar while an ajax request is running

1193980
vmware	esx
citrix s offering now makes vmware esx server seem overpriced

1193981
contains	set
the toxmlstring will return an xml string contains either just the public key data or both the public and private-key data depending on how you set its parameter

1194001
derived-class	base-class
in the derived-class i know that mydependency is of types concretedependency1 therefore i can hide the properties getter from the base-class using the new keyword

1194010
dictionary	arrays
i am creating an arrays of dictionary in a class

1194016
variables	boolean
to ensure the correct initialization of dynamically initializer static function variables one way is to add an additional boolean one indicating that dynamic initialization is needed

1194033
triggers	insert
text ntext and image column types are not allowed with triggers insert delete updates

1194038
data-structures	tree
if you have multiple tree data-structures and you only want one tree control then you re going to have to live with destroying and re-creating the tree nodes whenever you switching to a different structure

1194038
children	nodes
it asks you how many children each nodes has and then it asks you what the text of each nodes is each time it has to draw that nodes

1194064
proxy-server	squid
install a proxy-server on my mac i used squid

1194065
triggers	insert
sql-server 2008 dml insert delete updates triggers does not allow column references to text ntext and image in the insert deleted tables if the compatibility level is 70

1194066
contains	elements
for example where the elements contains a date between insert date insert date

1194066
contains	elements
the problem is that if you look at the xml file the elements contains the time as well as the date

1194105
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1194107
selected	cell
what i need to know is how to selected the range of cell corresponding to the ones above

1194113
signals	sigint
if i tell perl to explicit ignore a signals sigint has no effect

1194128
componentone	janus
we evaluated libs from syncfusion infragistics componentone xceed janus and devexpress

1194128
grouping	sorting
the sorting and grouping is easy to use and understand for both the developer and end-user

1194130
any	set
i see no properties to set this nor any setting in the firefox about configuration

1194160
button	popup
i have a windows that popup .when a link is click a simple-form is submitted then a button is show that .when click closes the windows using the aforementioned methods

1194160
firefox	safari
the problem doesn t occur in firefox or safari only ie

1194174
data-members	instances	data-members	constructor
even though you declare buffersize as const at class scoping this does not declare a compile-time constants which is needed for declaring arrays sizes in c++ but a constants data-members which once set in the constructor cannot be changed anymore for the lifetime of the instances but can still be different for each instances

1194175
contains	set
one option would be to use a repeater control and to set its datasource to an arrays contains the information about the questions

1194180
margins	padding
this is because ie and other browsers have different ways they indentation lists most browsers use padding and ie uses margins

1194196
development-environment	platform
portability to other platform and simpler development-environment usually just a text-editor not visual-studio

1194199
required	checked
all that types declaration stuff is not required for the program to work - and this is liberating to experience - it is merely .so the compiler can checked for certain typess of errors

1194205
order	join
you should make sure your index matches your join order

1194205
value	field
also if you have an index on the field active which is a boolean value it doesn t add much value to your search unless there are typically less active exhibitions then inactive exhibitions

1194210
attributes	properties
building yourself a preprocessor that turns an attributes like syntax into actual properties and methods

1194226
checkboxlist	databound	radiobuttonlist	databound	radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
you should then use a repeater or other databound control and then use list controls like the checkboxlist and radiobuttonlist

1194226
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
accessing the chosen answers should then be possible by iterator over the repeater items and finding your radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist controls probably using the findcontrol ... methods

1194228
configuration	installation
oracle required a home installation for anything more than the default configuration for instances we use ldap named resolution requiring an ldap.ora file in a special home path

1194228
data-access	nhibernate
my suggestion for making this data-access work is to use follow the guidance in the entlib or use nhibernate

1194255
keyboard	mouse
i can use the context menu key on the keyboard to activate the menu but not the mouse

1194271
linux	unix
my experience is with windows but the same or similar can be done on unix linux

1194280
keyboard	mouse
i am looking for a methods that doesn t involve send key because it locks the keyboard and mouse until the macros completes

1194313
manual	rcs
from the rcs manual

1194340
32-bit	64bit
use the microsoft dependency walker in either the 32-bit or 64bit versioning depending on the firebird server versioning to checked which dll isn t found

1194369
selected	checkbox
.when user selected one row - with checkbox - multiple rows won t be supported and click on a icons i want that javascript finds out which icons was selected .so i can product a custom url example index.php

1194384
authentication	login
i m implements a class for all my controllers to inherited that will redirect to login page if user is not authentication

1194387
installation	building
this sounds a bit weird but i m thinking about building an automatic recovery installation for our users at 100+ different sites of 2 to 10 machines each with their own server

1194403
python	java	python	c++
this question is aimed at the .net world but can extends to java c++ python and .so on

1194428
revision	svn
i am looking for the best tool that will make a report based on the log of the svn repository for each revision numbers tag branch etc

1194437
selected	checkbox
if you only want to support one row being selected at a time i suggest using a radio box instead of a checkbox since that control enforces only one can be selected at a time

1194441
sql-server	oracle
i believe that odbc can still use both sql-server and oracle with .some transparency .so i would take a look at using ado.net with the odbc provider

1194441
sql-server	oracle
it won t give you all of the performance or features that sqlclient or oracleclient would but it should be pretty close to the same code for oracle or sql-server

1194446
listboxitem	selected
i also implements a custom listboxitem that call bringintoview and focus on a newly selected item

1194446
selected	listbox
what i want to be able to do is to selected something in the tree and have it selecteded as well in the listbox

1194453
value	field
basically i wanted to get a value from a field in the database-table and store it to a variables

1194465
file-not-found	access-denied
al.so if loadlibrary fails be sure to call getlasterror .so we can figure out what error is causing it to fail access-denied file-not-found etc.

1194477
authentication	login
to make this work you either need to login to your machine with a domain account that has access to the server and change your connection-string to use trusted authentication or set up an account on the server you can use with sql authentication

1194478
google-chrome	safari
some browsers have a bug google-chrome safari where they do not expand the html body background correctly until a reload occurs

1194484
scriptmanager	updatepanel
there is a scriptmanager control i put to root.master in case i can use updatepanel in any page

1194484
logout	login
my question is why data.aspx or any page does not redirect to login page .when user click on logout link in loginview which is in master page

1194486
reflection	runtime
what can be done is the generator of classes at runtime using tools like javassist to make a more powerful reflection mechanism

1194500
c-preprocessor	macros
i have seen some samples use a c-preprocessor macros for malloc

1194524
malloc	free
you can implements most of it in terms of malloc and free - in fact a lot of c++ memory managers are implementss even if they don t have to be

1194524
malloc	free
you could start with a simple implementation that maintains a log of all allocation and deallocation but forwarding the regular allocation deallocation to malloc and free

1194524
malloc	free
implements global new and delete as wrapper that first log the access in the above data structure and then forwarding the call to malloc or free

1194527
click	mouse
using this i can log all of the mouse click a user makes in the application s user-interface

1194532
versioning	upgrade
data flow task dts.pipeline the component metadata for component trimcolumnscomponent 1909 could not be upgrade to the newer versioning of the component

1194533
web-services	api
we ve written a .net wrapper api for a set of web-services

1194545
any	set
is there any other way than access from the client to test that the proxy is correctly set up on the server

1194548
malloc	free
.so .when the last unicode object is free it isn t returned to malloc right away making all the other pages stuck

1194552
silverlight	wpf
i don t think i had before silverlight wpf but i now also use

1194563
erlang	lisp
you re wondering why a project doesn t write say one component in java another in lisp and a third in erlang and then link them all together as some unified deliverable

1194563
erlang	lisp
if you really believe that you have three components that are best expressed in say java lisp and erlang then it is to your advantage to write those components in those languages

1194568
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox 3 it didn t work returing the following exception-handling

1194568
contains	any
after some googling this turn ed out related to some security model - cross-domain blocking which is weird as it works on ie and i don t think i am doing any cross-domain here as mentioned above the default.js which contains the call to service is located on the service project-server

1194579
logout	login
but you also have to remember to create it on login and destroy it on logout from the account controllers

1194579
put	get
in fact even if you choose not to put the class in the session and to create it on each page load it seems like overkill to get order history

1194586
value	field
looks like you may have two field named addinfo and youre getting a comma-delimited list of the value

1194594
png	gif
b ends-with jpeg jpg gif or png

1194602
getter	setter
if you use attr_accessor to create an attributes ruby just declare an instances variables and creates getter and setter methods for you

1194609
expression-blend	silverlight
there are a lot of other videos that should help to find your way around expression-blend and silverlight

1194612
graphviz	doxygen
first install doxygen and graphviz which provides dot for drawing directed graphing

1194627
python	perl
not optimized using python or perl

1194627
solaris	freebsd
i ve been looking into solaris servers freebsd servers just using 64bit windows.

1194627
python	perl
it s hard to figure out what each systemd will be capable of once 64bit versioning of python perl are install and the scripting are actually running

1194628
profiling	debugging
rather than adding extra code for debugging you could use a debugging tool or profiling

1194634
callback	methods
i have a change event on a particular valuebox instances which fires whenever the changes but the change callback is unable to use the val methods in my class

1194636
literals	hardcode
or is it more accurate to say that in a situation like this it would not be .so significant or at least not significant enough to warrant the hours it would take to rewrite the dynamic table generator into hardcode table + literals

1194643
attributes	properties
attributes are specific properties of an object

1194660
attributes	properties
an attributes is a properties of the object

1194660
getter	setter
in this case i use the attr_accessor class methods to defined the points properties along with an implicit getter and setter methodss for points

1194667
versioning	upgrade
generally this means that the component was upgrade after the package was saved and .so it s at the wrong versioning numbers

1194684
32-bit	64bit
.so to do the same work that you do in 2gb on a 32-bit systemd you need 4gb on a 64bit systemd

1194685
memcheck	valgrind
also since you mention that you want to make a memory manager that is useful for debugging you may want to consider reading this paper by the developers of memcheck valgrind a wonderful memory debugger for linux

1194700
contains	any	contains	elements
in both cases the variables a and b will contains elementss of the original arrays this is why you can directly access an elements in any positioning and you don t need something like which is incorrect ruby syntax

1194708
any	set
what you could also do is first see if the file is there and then if it is delete it of course this destroy any special file-permissions you had set on it

1194763
worksheet	excel
i import data from an excel worksheet using excel-interop and i place its contents to the database

1194785
base-class	inherited
along with this all of our controllerss inherited from a controllers base-class that s decorated with the handleerror attributes that wolfwyrd linked to .so that we get the best of both worlds

1194797
ninject	prism
all the resources seem to be points to using unity with prism and not ninject

1194812
hide	show
i noticed this occurs only .when i use slideup down.if i use show hide everythings ok

1194812
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1194818
selected	listbox
here s a quick example of how to the collapse text the header to the selected item in the listbox contains within the expander

1194822
contains	elements
for reference i ve made sure that my web-config elements include a reference to the namespace of the referenced project that contains the ef model

1194824
windows-server	windows
it has been include in windows since then including windows-server 2008 r2 release this year

1194836
3dsmax	maya
the more i work with level editor though the more unrealistic this whole idea of level building in maya or 3dsmax really seems

1194836
3dsmax	maya
.so the question is does anyone use maya or 3dsmax or milkshape for level design at all ever

1194864
linux	unix	linux	osx
if you re running a flavor of linux unix including mac osx create a crontab

1194866
ubuntu	debian
simply install ubuntu or debian for amd64 on a suitable machine

1194866
python	perl	opensolaris	freebsd
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64bit out of the box and part of default installation

1194873
include	ssi
i would like to use a path contains in a variables to include a file in an shtml ssi page

1194873
contains	set
basically i would like to set a variablesiables with mod_rewrite first and then process the filename contains in the variables

1194878
selected	button	assign	add
since it is often necessary to assign multiple items to a user i need to display a button next to the drop down that says add another item which automatically insert another an identical drop down box below the first one and preserve the selected option in the original drop down box

1194878
checkbox	button
you might be thinking - why not just display a series of radio button or checkbox

1194884
linux	unix
if you re not using linux unix ask your hosts whether they would be able to set up a windows scheduling job for you

1194900
contains	elements
the first elements is not encode as it contains the the current store path

1194925
firefox	opera
after an hour the session timeout and redirects me to the error.jsp in ie and opera but in firefox it redirects me immediately

1194926
ubuntu	debian
and as wazoox mentioned installation of debian or ubuntu is a breeze especially with the smaller more focused server flavors

1194937
maya	3ds
a lot of games do use maya or 3ds max as level designers

1194937
maya	3ds
i m less familiar with maya but take a look at the 3ds max sdk id 7481355 to see what you can do

1194952
contains	any
it s almost guaranteed that any custom code you write will probably contains bugs

1194955
selected	cell	selected	button
in my previous question i was asking for a next button and it had to act as if the cell was selected

1194958
value	field
you d have to analyze all the instructions and observe what effects they have and whether those effects are going to survive outside of some significant scoping do they modify the field of object that can leak out through return value or out parameters or do they just modify transient object that are guaranteed to be unreachable outside the methods

1194966
linux	bsd
on most linux distros this is gnu make but on other unixes it could refer to some other implementation of make such as bsd make or the make implementation of various commercial unixes

1194966
utility	gnu
the language accepted by gnu make is a superset of the one supported by the traditional make utility

1194977
webforms	asp.net
an easy way to do this in asp.net webforms is to use on a server-side control eg

1194985
thickbox	jqmodal	jquery-dialog	jqmodal	jquery-dialog	thickbox
the jquery-dialog will then simply load the controllers action in that windows i was doing this with thickbox but now use jqmodal

1194985
thickbox	jquery
install thickbox and jquery

1195002
any	set
from that you can access any .profile information you ve set up and also get the primary key to access anything else you ve set up

1195024
exception-handling	try-catch
try wrapping the handleslistpacket methods in a try-catch block and use a custom dialog to display the exception-handling

1195038
apache-config	.htaccess
then you rewrite from article 1 to nodes 1 like .so in a .htaccess or apache-config file

1195061
protected	public
basically you can t start an identifier with an underscore.js - this violates cls-compliant on a visible public protected field

1195067
protected	public
protected public members should be properly cased and named

1195090
duplicates	contains
if you don t want people adding duplicates to the list why even have a contains methods

1195093
selected	button
to explain i have an account systemd and i d like .when you selected an asp.net button for instances it re-directs you - via a silent login - to a specified google-analytics account

1195096
directory	folder
directory and folder behave differently

1195096
directory	folder
a great percentage of questions on unix mailinglists but also here on serverfault and on superuser about what to the asker seems to be confusing filesystems behavior can be traced directly back to thinking about folder .when unix does in fact have directory

1195096
directory	folder
.so in other words use folder .when dealing with folder and directory .when dealing with directory

1195119
nested	assign
one must instead use databinder.eval in an itemtemplate to access the nested properties instead of assign it to a boundfield

1195126
any	set
.sorry for the delayed response i didn t set the question up right .so i would get notifications of any response then i ended up forgetting about the .post all together

1195127
dictionary	arrays
however there is a deeper question hidden in your explanation of the problem it seems you want both the arrays and its elements dictionary to be mutable but there are a few fine points that should be cleared up especially in lighting of your stipulation that the copy that is passed to other object needs to be modified without modifying the original. depending on exactly what you mean this can be quite complex to guarantee and implements

1195127
dictionary	arrays
for example suppose that the original arrays contains a numbers of mutable dictionary

1195127
dictionary	arrays
creating mutable copies of these first two levels means that someone who obtains a copy can modify their own arrays and dictionary in the arrays without changing the original arrays or dictionary directly

1195157
command-line	cmd
what i don t understand is that .when i ctrl+f the compiler output which display the cmd that qmake is using at the command-line i don t find any reference to the libs

1195163
selected	button
in this case i d like to have a toolbar button that move an item or items selected in the grid either up or down

1195169
double	int
however the use is a little verbose obj.isoneof typeof int typeof bool typeof double and i am wondering about alternative approaches to defining one methods taking an arbitrary amount of generics arguments

1195177
attributes	properties
also unless you mark a public properties field with the attributes it will be serialization

1195179
attributes	properties
put nonserialized attributes in case of binary and xmlignore attributes in case of xmlserializer to reference properties or field

1195203
http	ssl
i know that data retrieved over ssl http is encrypted over the wire but once it arrives at the browser is it stored in the client s browser-cache

1195226
double	int
there is no typedef in java as of 1.6 what you can do is make a wrapper class for what you want since you can t subclassing final classes int double etc

1195230
mbunit	nunit
if we decide to go the other route in using something like xunit.net mbunit or nunit then we are most likely going to have some maybe significant cost

1195230
mocking	tdd
the question is can all the mocking frameworks plug into visual-studio s versioning of tdd mstest

1195234
appdata	temp
not sure if this is the data you re looking for but on windows flash player stores some information in appdata adobe flash player appdata macromedia flash player and temp the last being where .flv files are stored although they re named with a .tmp extension and at least on my systemd look like they start with a fla prefix

1195261
malloc	free
essentially it has custom implementation of malloc and free that provide the debugging

1195262
data-structures	map	data-structures	binary-tree
in other cases you would be better of using smarter data-structures such as a binary-tree or a map

1195288
contains	elements
filesystemss which often base on b-trees use much higher order order 200 and even a lot more - this is because they usually choose the order high enough .so that a note .when contains maximum numbers of allowed elements equals either the size of a sector on hard-drive or of a cluster of the filesystems

1195297
ruby	php
summary many people thinks that cake is for php the same as ruby-on-rails are for ruby

1195307
user-controls	ascx
i wondered how i can stop those annoying compiler-warnings the class or cssclass value is not defined coming from my asp.net-mvc partial-views ascx user-controls

1195324
put	get
on the messages panels and the temp table doesn t actually get anything put into it

1195326
logout	login
i don t know how i would implements any of these except for login - how could the service possibly know what user is currently logged in inorder for logout to work

1195327
perl	ruby
intro i m coming to ruby from perl and i m a bit lost among the test framework choices

1195330
mocking	tdd
this is especially important if you don t have anyone on the team that is familiar with tdd unit-testing mocking frameworks etc

1195330
mocking	tdd
it might not be a tdd book but it is great book to learn about unit-testing mocking frameworks and it even has a chapter on legacy code

1195341
templating	jinja2
i currently use jinja2 python for most templating work - i ve found it to be very configurable in every way

1195349
fogbugz	trac
the reason we don t use trac is because we use fogbugz as our issue tracker and since websvn was purely a repository browser it fit well with fogbugz

1195387
pseudo-class	anchor
can be applied to any selector with the hover pseudo-class or in any selector that can be wrapped with an anchor not just img s

1195391
firefox	gecko
rv 1.8.0.7 gecko 20060909 firefox 1.5.0.7 mg novarra-vision 7.3 the lower-bound for url length was 2048 but upper bound was less than 3072

1195392
revision	svn
however svn does not allow changing revision properties by default

1195414
selected	checkbox
what i want to do is selected all the checkbox where they are the first occurrence of their respective value for myatr

1195417
haskell	lisp
linux users grouping lisp society haskell hackathon ndash

1195420
keyboard	mouse
edit in relation to the preprocessmessage i believe that is only for keyboard input not mouse

1195433
variables	boolean	value	field
.so i have a set of value with a boolean for each to know if the variables has been initializer by the user or not cause not all the search field needs to be filled in

1195436
fogbugz	trac
i ve avoided fogbugz for the price and it seems like overkill and trac as i m trying to avoid hosting something myself

1195438
put	get
correct me if i m wrong but this will required me to get the definition of the orderstatus class manually via email or whatever and put it in my solution

1195440
javascript	dom
if javascript modifies dom in page a user navigates to page b and then hits back button to get back to the page a

1195448
protected	public
the properties is not cls-compliant because it starts with an underscore.js and is public note protected properties in a public class can be accessed from outside the assembly

1195448
attributes	properties
add an attributes just to your properties

1195463
exception-handling	try-catch
over try-catch it has the advantage of keeping the code together which makes sense if the exception-handling is an expected result

1195519
modifiers	final
as for your subpredicatess be aware that you can only have one of either the all or any modifierss in your final predicates although you can use that modifiers multiple time throughout the predicates

1195521
contains	set
as other answers have pointed out the code you contains in your buffering will be severely limited no access to external static-variables no external function-calls etc will break easily in the case of no-execute protection on memory pages not being able to return due to the link register not being set up etc and may be really non-portable as well it will probably be reliability hell--nobody is going to be able to understand what you re trying to do without a lot of banging-head-against-the-desk

1195521
function-pointers	member-functions
function-pointers are perfect for the behavior you want here and member-functions are even better

1195532
registration	login
i don t want to spend hours or days trying to get this to work only to find out that this is either not very practical not very customizable doesn t work well with jquery and perhaps is design only for short form registration login pages

1195533
value	field
also this should not rely on hidden form field because a determined bots writer could just change the value they are posting to your server code

1195537
show	next
now imagine you have two boxes to show next to each other

1195541
margins	padding
internet-explorer doesn t collapse margins correctly all the time .so while we wait for ie7 usage to shrink the safer methods is to use padding instead .when possible

1195541
margins	padding
if you set margins or padding on only some sides of the elementss you can use padding in the parent elements to get the right distance to the last elementss

1195546
webforms	asp.net
the polymorphism podcast has a good article on controlling html in asp.net webforms

1195550
hashmap	arrays
zed s solution using object behaving like hashmap giving o 1 lookup as opposed to o n lookup of arrays

1195581
.when	ready
the function passed to document .ready is invoked .when ...well as the named states .when the document dom is ready

1195688
spaces	output
to confirm that your output does not actually contains those extra spaces try this

1195688
spaces	output
if the characters are separated from your output then that indicates that it s not spaces but some other whitespace character that got in there tabs for example

1195696
nested	assign
the assignment to the indexing is not to a barename and therefore doesn t affect locality and since python 2.2 it s perfectly acceptable for nested inner functions to refer to variables that are locals in outer contains functions which is all this versioning does assign to barenames is a different issue than referring to variables

1195701
environment	execution
in cmd .when a batch-file scripting modifies the environment the default behavior is that it modifies the environment of the cmd process that is execution it

1195713
triggers	insert
then you could create an insert and updates triggers on that table that combines the two columns and insert them into the right row

1195720
triggers	insert
since you asked for the easiest way i would suggest you to use a triggers on insert

1195752
attributes	properties
defined your validation rules using attributes on model properties

1195765
protected	public
however javadoc is only generator for public and protected types

1195795

i m trying to make an action that returns a file from disk to the user via little downloading dialog pop-up box. i ve got it working great except somehow a newline is being insert as the first character

1195804
mouseleave	mousedown
i am no expert in this but i think you have to look at mouse button up down events wm_lbuttondown wm_rbuttondown al.so you may want to tracking mouse move events .so that a mousedown on the button mouseleave the button acts as a release

1195809
any	set
i didnâ t see any place to set a timeout value in the telnetwrapper

1195818
png	gif
if you re dealing with only a limited numbers of different image-formats only jpeg png and gif it shouldn t be too hard to read the size from the image header yourself

1195830
put	get
inorder to get the width and height of an image essentially as you put it the metadata you will have to open the file parsing some kind of header information and obtain what you want that way

1195841
duplicates	elements
each time you selected gap elements and see if there are duplicates value

1195841
duplicates	elements
the algorithm pick the random indexes of log2 n elements and checked for duplicates

using the maven-javadoc-plugin you cannot specify specific java classess though you can with the javadoc utility see below

1195900
maven-plugin	javadoc
it should be noted that this maven-plugin is simply a wrapper around sun s javadoc utility

1195900
maven-javadoc-plugin	javadoc
in an area where the maven-javadoc-plugin differs in functionality sun s documentation for the sourcepath parameter mentions that it is possible with the javadoc utility to generator javadoc for specific classes

1195906
arrays	loops
if you don t want to loops through the entire arrays and your arrays is sorted you can start in the middle compare the value you are looking for and based on the result selected the first half or the second half of the arrays to continue with

1195907
children	nodes
the downside to this approach is that you ll have to keep nodes level updates during nodes move but that should be reasonably straightforward and fast as you would only do it for the nodes itself and its children - not for the majority of the table as you would do with nested sets

1195934
javascript	dom
this allows them to rendering the page very quickly .when navigating via the back and forwarding button and preserve the state of the dom and all javascript variables

1195949
json	xml
this include xml json text etc

i have a system-tray user-interface in java that requser-interfacered a scheduling database poll

1196041
low-level	hardware
unfortunately i don t think what you are wanting is possible without some low-level hardware access

1196042
stdin	pipe
the program is running within a scripting and something haas been pipe to stdin

1196042
stdin	pipe
the program is running from within another program and nothing has been pipe to stdin

1196052
firefox	safari
firefox safari and most browser use the opacity properties whilst ie uses filtering alpha opacity

1196176
export	csv
data export from openoffice.org 3.1 as csv utf8-decode

1196179
value	field
will it have a default field value

1196179
subclassing	superclass
the class hierarchy is straightforward an abstract superclass that encapsulates common behavior attributes and about half a dozen concrete subclassing that deal with field specific stuff

1196179
value	field
i created the following code to map value between the field domain object and their corresponding user-interface control

1196182
spacing	layout
on the layout object to set the spacing between widget and higher level layout like qgridlayout allow you to do more complex things

1196207
value	field
edit as has been commented by aperkins both accessing the field setting it as accessible and retrieving the value will all throw exception-handling s although the only checked-exception-handlings you need to be mindful of are commented above

1196207
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
the runtimeexception s which may be throw are either securityexception s if the jvm s securitymanager will not allow you to change a field s accessibility or illegalargumentexception s if you try and access the field on an object not of the field s class s types

1196209
internationalization	localization
the other .approach i am thinking of is actually performing the whole internationalization process nslocale localization files etc and somewhat at the .app startup skip the user s locale and set either language programmatically here i would only need to know is how to skip such default i18n process to set a specific language

1196226
subclassing	base-class
second getapple will always be dynamically bound and the extended apple should always be called - given that the subclassing is truly extends the base-class and the methods is truly overrides

1196232
contains	any	contains	elements
you gotta first checked to see if w contains any elements

1196234
webserver	security
i think one big drawback might be that they re going to be inheriting whatever security holes or default settings for apache iis which are being brought in with the embeddable webserver

1196234
put	get
along with that you might also get stuck with upgrade issues like if apache or iis or some subcomponent your application required like openssl for example has some updates come along to plug a security hole will you then opt not to disrupt your customer s production-environment because they re most likely not going to be a victim of that hole or will you mandate that they upgrade or else you won t take responsibility for the consequences even though you whisper to yourself you put them in that situation in the first place

1196275
postgresql	mysql	mysql-spatial	postgis
if you need to do more complex geographical calculations you can investigate postgis for postgresql or mysql-spatial extensions for mysql

1196278
arrays	loops
as you can see it s an object not an arrays since you passed it an associativity arrays and not an numerically indexed arrays. if you want to loops through an object in javascript you do it like this

1196295
any	set
and any scripting that would set up a local apt repository would still need to be run from the command-line

1196310
versioning	migrate
the problem with db migrate down is that i don t want to encode the versioning of the beginning

1196327
textbox	button
you can create custom form contains all your labels and textbox and button

1196334

1196415
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i m aware that oracle mysql and sql-server have added some special datatypes specifically for handling geo data but i m interested in how you would store the information in a plain vanilla sql database

1196424
selected	button
in design-view go to the properties of your table and selected rows and click the button

1196441
key-value	key
from my understanding to use on duplicates key i need to know what in this case is the meta_id often this isn t the case i m trying to simply push a key-value pair to the table using the booking_id .so if the particular key exists then its replace otherwise its insert

1196446
build-process	scons
we are thinking about wrapping each step in the build-process in an scons process but we re not sure that this would work

1196458
sql-server	oracle
for oracle this would be the merge into statement i think sql-server has an if found statement or something like that i dont use sql-server often sorry

1196477
versioning	migrate
it s moderately hackish but you could do a query to find the first versioning in schema_migrations and then call rake db migrate down to get that versioning i m assuming you want to package up a reset scripting for your .app

1196489
value	field
.when you reference a field instead it uses the class of the pointers instead of walking up the class hierarchy to resolve the value

1196529

any	set
i also have an annotation-based controllers which takes in any url-pattern and then goes to the corresponding jsp i ve set that up in the -servlet.xml

1196578
any	set
is there any way i can set the background for that header area .so that it spans the entire width of the gridview

1196590
alt	src
a regular expression could be devised to achieve the same goal but would be limited in such way that it would force the alt attributes to be after the src or the opposite and to overcome this limitation would add more complexity to the regular expression

1196592
dictionary	arrays
do note though that this will only work if your arrays of dictionary only contains object that are valid plist arrays numbers date data string and dictionary .so this may or may not be applicable in your particular situation

1196595
httpwebrequest	webclient
instead using webclient like kenney you can use httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse and process the result with a streamreader and xmldocument

1196596
sql-server	mysql
i m a sql-server guy and .so i m not sure of the syntax needed in mysql to hint an index or even if mysql is able to take advantage of a covering index in this manner

1196618
sqltransaction	sqlcommand
in the client you need to either start a sqltransaction and attach it to each sqlcommand

1196642
for-loop	loops
if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collections and call removeall on the list after loops

1196645
webforms	asp.net
note i am also using jquery validation with asp.net webforms

1196662
acrobat	pdftk

python and ruby have similar modules

1196679
selected	cell
i am trying to set the background-color of the cell and the text color differently depending on the selected state of the item

1196684
margins	padding
your html tags for the textinput and for the paragraph of text below it all have default margins and padding

1196688

i m trying to animate a rotation using catransform3dmakerotation but the problem is once the animation is finished the image goes back to its initial positioning i.e back to zero

1196783
callback	methods
the ajax object has a methods especifically for this complete which is fired .when the request finishes after success and error callback are execute

1196803
if-statement	loops
most of what i did was proving the correctness of simple programs consisting of while loops if-statement and sequences of instructions but nothing more

1196808
any	set
for a static win32 libs how can i detection that any of the use mfc options is set

1196826
required	checked
you may also do multiple if else to checked for overflow or on x86 you may checked overflow flag which also required you to use assembly

1196834
.net	wcf	asp.net-web-api	wcf
wcf or asp.net-web-api are the only technologies that should be used for .net web-services going forwarding

1196847
spaces	output
the extra spaces were getting rendering into the output because they weren t in the section of the controllers

1196876
positioning	sidebar
problem is most css layout for this format use float to positioning the sidebar

1196878
permission-denied	root
well i m not sure what the root cause was for the selected permission-denied for your db user but if you run this and then it does indeed work again then somewhere along the line your selected permission was indeed wiped out

1196885
directory	folder
i m trying to get only the directory of an folder

1196886
python	java
i realize you are using python but i found this java article to be useful

1196933
version-control	git
git is snapshot based at conceptual level at least version-control systemd not changeset based one

1196937
compiler-options	intel-fortran
considering they did not publishing the exact compiler-options they used for the intel-fortran compiler i have little faith in their benchmarking

1196977
g++	gcc
i suppose the gfortran uses the same back end of gcc and g++ but what of the intel compiler

1196987
json	xml
i have tried returning both xml and json

1196990
function-pointers	virtual-functions
virtual-functions are function-pointers under the hood

1196996
postgresql	oracle
i will use postgresql or oracle

1197021
json	xml
if you re storing the points in just an external javascript file then i would recommend using json format over xml as the xml parsing that google-maps uses is much slower than json

1197021
json	xml
if you re using only an external xml file then you can use google s function to call and downloading the xml file seen in the link above otherwise i would create a file that can be updates and parsing with json

1197052
google-chrome	gecko
if you still need to embed a browser you could use gecko mozilla s engine or webkit google-chrome s engine - i don t have any hands-on experience with them but probably they have more consistency between embedded and stand-alone versioning

1197067
arrays	map
if it s static you just need to manage a lot points on map 300 then you could serve all points together with the page where the map is located in as javascript arrays for example

1197081
solaris	linux
well if this is a linux issue see my comment on your question - it works fine on solaris you may have to try something along the line of

1197092
vmware	esx
i want to run this code .so that the task is execute in another virtual image vmware esx

1197106
data-members	private
i want to have a class with a private static data-members a vector that contains all the characters a-z

1197106
data-members	instances	data-members	constructor
in java or c# i can just make a static constructor that will run before i make any instances of the class and sets up the static data-members of the class

1197106
constructor	private	data-members	instances	data-members	constructor	data-members	private	instances	private
is it possible to have private static data-members in a class if i don t want to initializer them in the instances constructor

1197140
debugging	trace
.when a binding fails wpf dump explanatory text via debugging trace which you can see in the visual-studio output windows

1197141
webserver	security
but if you trust the confines of your own network security and webserver then signing your web assemblies seems like a redundant step

1197145
keyvaluepair	key
wouldn t using keyvaluepair tkey tvalue as the types of the key have the same affect

1197159
viewwillappear	viewdidload
what you can do instead is create your own placeholder view controllers that in its viewdidload or viewwillappear methods replace itself in the tab bar controllers with its actual view controllers

1197166
installation	building
back .when bell labs was the .sole supplier of unix they distribute the .source code .so each installation could building and customize their own os

1197168
any	set
for example i would like to set this header on any file being requested from iis7 that is

1197176
arguments	undefined
it means use the second arguments if the first is undefined or empty else use the first

1197184
scheme	let
however by accident i tried after having played in scheme for a bit the following expression where i bind a lambda to a variables using let and it also works if i pass the function to mapcar

1197185
basic	vb6
you can even create basic custom oledb providers for unusual requirements by writing vb6 data aware classes in conjunction with the oledb simple provider osp toolkit

1197198
administration	account
if the client and server are in different forests they clearly can t agree on the sid of an account for an impersonation token except for the case of well-known sids like administration which serve mainly to confuse this kind of thing and that seems necessary to checked against dacls etc

1197201
multiple-languages	french
.so i really can t agree with the proposition by kelly french that we are not using multiple-languages

1197214
solaris	linux
while it is solaris specific it is also applicable to linux

1197233
shopping-cart	paypal
i haven t done any shopping-cart stuff but there are gem out there for integration with paypal and activemerchant

1197239
contains	set
if i set up a templates on powerpoint slider that contains all the textbox i need the what visual basic do i use to enter text that i want into those textbox

1197239
selected	textbox
is there a way for determining the named of a textbox shape textbox 52 other than recording macros after macros and selected the textbox just to get the object named from selection

1197239
macros	vba
if i use a macros to determine the vba why will it not work to use that as vba

1197239
macros	vba
the vb i get from a macros seems to have active.selectedion which just doesn t seem to work as a vba procedure because it doesn t know what to selected

1197263
streamreader	streamwriter
using that you can capture the console.in and console.out streaming to redirect console i o to a streamreader streamwriter for tight integration with the configurator function

1197265
python	c++	python	tcl
python from tcl c++ from python and c from tcl

1197265
python	java
java from python and java from scheme

1197265
python	ruby
the web also provides a natural way for integration completely different programs in the same systemd a python program and a ruby program with the right css javascript theming could look identical and link to each other such that the user never even knew these were 2 separate programs

1197270
common-lisp	lisp
i did a quick search of the emacs lisp manual and couldn t find any reference to flet which isn t terribly surprising since that is a part of cl - the common-lisp package

1197299
margins	padding
if that does not work you can put the table in a div and give the div the appropriate margins instead of a padding

1197308
photoshop	layer
the problem was caused by using a .png that was generator from a .psd photoshop that had a numbers of layer including text pictures and gradient

1197317
filtering	sorting
that would at least isolate you from the sorting filtering issues

1197321
average	minimum
for example if i have a range from a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 10 and an average of 7

1197324
perl	tcl
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197352
export	csv
the file returned from the export has the csv results at the bottom but also contains the html of my page which call the function

1197352
export	csv
.when calling ob_end_clean before i call my export function it gets rid of any html before the csv

1197352
export	csv
this issue has been solved by calling exit after calling the csv export scripting

1197360
constructor	object
it is declaring a customer object called cust and assign it a new instances of the class with no parameters being passed to the object s constructor

1197369
deployment	install
ease of deployment is desirable .so make the install simple

1197381
c++	lua
i ve used a mix of c and lua or c++ and lua in recent project

1197381
c++	lua
lua and c++ allows me to switching the mindset by source file

1197398
latitude-longitude	location
.so my question is this the correct way to determine if a location s latitude-longitude would appear in the current view and should be added to the the mapview

1197401
javascript	dom
my knowledge of javascript and dom is sorely lacking

1197405
put	get
another positive points on rest is that you use the 4 http verbs get .post put delete to manage url representative entities which makes - in my opinion - the code and operations clearer

1197418
create-table	insert-into
if that won t work you can generator a create-table scripting for the old table change the named to create the new table and then use identity_insert to allow copying the primary key data from the first table using an insert-into newtable selected from oldtable

1197434
export	csv
i searched the web and found that many people have succeeded using by export data from excel into a csv file

1197443
binary-search-tree	nodes	binary-search-tree	tree
find nodes 42 ... splay tree are statically optimal if you create a fixed binary-search-tree and run the queries against it it will run no more than a constants factors faster than running the queries against a splay tree

1197478
json	xml
however unless you re absolutely certain that your choice serialization format is going to be a major bottleneck consider using a more readily available serialization format like json xml protocol-buffers or wddx

1197480
constructor	object
instead of storing a reference to an object in a variables you can directly pass it to a function as arguments or you can pass some other object as a parameter to the constructor that ll allow the object to register it self elsewhere .

1197484
click	mouse
.when you click in the windows it uses implicit animation to smoothly move the image to the mouse points

1197486

the only difference between these two directory i see is that the named of my application in vs and folder is addfiletosql but named i gave this folder under c inetpub wwwroot was afs

1197487
any	set
you can set up an arrays of seven probabilities to approximate any distribution you like

1197495
children	tree	children	nodes
in a program written in a lanuage such as c the root nodes of this tree is the main methods where execution begins the children of this root are the arguments that are passed to the main methods etc

1197548
perl	ruby
yes i m hedging on the fact that i know perl way better than ruby but the approach would be the same

1197556
viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewdidload
in general you should put loading code that only needs to run once but may run multiple time into viewdidload code that needs to run every time a view is show in viewwillappear or viewdidappear and code that can run even before the view loads or absolutely needs to only run once into initwithnibname bundle

1197571
build-system	cmake
if you re going to be using qt with your application i d strongly recommend changing your build-system to use cmake

1197575
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the scripting loads into the dom but it is never execute at least in firefox and google-chrome

1197580
jeditorpane	jtextpane
i need to take text from a source as plain text and display it in a jtextpane or jeditorpane

1197583
worksheet	excel
i m populating an excel worksheet with the results of a query

1197607
sql-server	oracle
for example you might have an oracle or sql-server order process systemd

1197610
scheme	lisp
unlike scheme emacs lisp is a 2-lisp which means that each symbols has two separate binding the value binding and the function binding

1197614
difference	count
then we add the difference to the row s date column and grouping and count and voila

1197615
installation	environment	any	set
this is the best practice way to specify any custom environment properties you need to set for your tomcat install - putting the properties in this file is better than editing startup.sh or catalina.sh directly because this file can be portable between tomcat installation versioning

1197627
folder	dir
personally i d likely create a folder structure that uses a userid as its base dir

1197632
put	get
i d like to put timers and set time .so i for instances get a pop-up at 2pm saying don t forget... i know i could make my own notification bubble but i d prefer the wlm one

1197634
subclassing	base-class
i will have quite a few subclassing of base-class each implements the getname methods in its own way template-methods-pattern

1197634
subclassing	base-class
if i were to change the method-signature of the base-class constructor i would have to change all the subclassing

1197657
subclassing	base-class
if i were to change the method-signature of the base-class constructor i would have to change all the subclassing

1197659
credentials	integrated
typically the username passwd prompt will be display .when you have integrated windows-authentication enabled and anonymous disabled i believe that if your windows user is part of a domain your nt credentials should flow through the browser typically it does in ie if you are hitting the site using a mozilla based browser such as firefox you may have to enter your credentials

1197659
account	userid
also if you are not using sql authentication userid passwd in web-config then you would need to grant access to the account under whose identity your website is running under by default on xp web apps run under network service

1197661
extends	super
however since your base-class declare a constructor and therefore doesn t have the default no-arg constructor that the compiler would otherwise provide this is illegal - a class that extends base-class can t call super

1197661
subclassing	base-class
this is probably a little counter-intuitive because you might think that a subclassing automatically has any constructor that the base-class has

1197670
filehandle	pipe
pipe are file handles and anything that show open filehandle lsof for instances will show them

1197689
updatepanel	gridview
maybe you need the gridview in an ajax updatepanel

1197690
contains	any
how can i take any given path in bash and convert it to it s canonical form dereference any symbolic links that may be contains within the path

1197711
value	field
occasionally a query depends on whether a certain field has a value

1197711
value	field
having the field be not null means you only have to checked against a single empty value in this case the empty string

1197717
order	add
what i m thinking of is to have a base report with all the columns that i can have also with a basic view of the report formatting order of columns etc. and then let the user to change that format and order take out or add from the available columns data to it etc

1197724
short	base
i ve inherited a large project that already has a large markup base coupled with a short deadline .so a complete rewrite is out of the question

1197725
worksheet	excel
how many double-quotes do i put around this line .so that i end up with 08075 being paste into my excel worksheet

1197729
perl	php
ie php has the _.post superglobal and perl s cgi.pm will only retrieve .post parameters if the http-method is .post by default

1197733
sql-server	mysql
does sql-server offer anything comparable to mysql s on duplicates key updates

1197750
constructor	object
reason that the swap idiom gained widespread favor - it s an easy way to ensure that copy constructor don t leak or corrupt object in the face of exception-handling

1197753
error-handling	try-catch
background if you have targeted the weak points or have some boilerplate error-handling code you need to universally apply to a particular class of problem and you don t want to write the same try-catch for every invocation location such as updating a specific control on every page etc

1197788
if-statement	loops
i m only posting it because it s an interesting methods that doesn t use an if-statement or a loops to give you a result

1197794
decrement	increment
meanwhile the read thread will increment wants_read under the mutex .when it begins and .when done decrement it and broadcasting on the condvar

1197801
getter	setter
overall classes are used to keep things together that belong together keep things apart that should be apart namespacing enable easier consistency checked getter setter validation variables before changing them and more.

1197814
rollback	commit
commit all changes related to the same task at once that will help review the changes and future rollback or merges if needed

1197837
websphere	ibm
also for client-server .applications you have an abundance of choices for production-quality .app servers that have the same j2ee interface ibm websphere bea weblogic jboss

1197863
latitude-longitude	location
i m wondering if there is an algorithm for calculating the nearest location represented by latitude-longitude in better than o n time

1197869
lwjgl	jogl
you are mixing libs and levels of libs jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrapper around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrapper for openal audio

1197869
python	java	python	c++	panda3d	ogre
if you are not too set on using java consider some of the alternatives torque private scripting-language panda3d python or the aforementioned ogre using c++

1197875
boolean	int
in c# this would refer to bool boolean int int32 float single long int64

1197875
boolean	int
and in my opinion int16 int32 int64 boolean etc makes a heck of a lot more sense then short long int

1197889
sql-server	mysql
you mention mysql but there are some pretty sophisticated spatial features in sql-server 2008 including a geography data types

1197902
google-chrome	safari
i tested it and can confirm that it works in ie5.5 6 7 8 ff3 google-chrome and safari

1197912
windows-xp	windows
this appears reproducible under windows-xp windows 2003 server and windows 7

1197937
constructor	object
the points is your object s field will always have their destructor invoked if an exception-handling is throw from the constructor body

1197937
value	field
this implies that the best practice is not to allow any field to reach the constructor body with an undestructable value an undefined pointer. that being the case it s best to actually give your field their real value through the initializer rather than say first setting the pointers to null and then giving them their real value in the constructor body

1197949
alt	src
for example developing a regex to get the src and alt tag would force the alt attributes to be after the src or the opposite and to overcome this limitation would add more complexity to the regular expression

1197951
javascript	dom
for example you suggested that ie doesn t allow you to add a table to the dom via javascript

1197951
javascript	dom
but here s some javascript that i just hacked together that does add a table to the dom

1197982
php-ini	fopen
if allow_url_fopen is set to true on php-ini you can use a function like fopen

1197986
directory	folder
i will have a folder on my live server contains each release of the application and i ll have a symlink in the web directory points to the current release

1197991
any	set
just do remember to set your response s content-types header to text xml or some media types that s even more specific and appropriate if any of course

1198026
decrement	increment
while checkeded the return-value of releasecomobject is not strictly necessary i like to checked it to make sure things are being increment decrement as expected

1198026
contains	any
any line using com object that contains 2 dots needs close attention

1198070
lighttpd	apache
you could also use something like lighttpd instead of apache

1198079
triggers	insert
i have a database systemd developed in vb6 and we have a scenario where more than one user may register at the same time triggers an insert in the database

1198094
ip-address	proxy
how to identify remote machine uniquely in proxy-server environment i have used _server remote_addr but all machines in proxy network has same ip-address is there any way

1198117
dictionary	map
keep the cmd and associated object that can perform action in an associativity containers std map in c++ and dictionary in .net

1198125
google-chrome	firefox
.so .when loaded in firefox or google-chrome automatically redirects to as well it should but not in ie8

1198132
duplicates	contains
you would more likely end up with a view that contains duplicates data from both tables

1198150
capture	player
while more complicated than a minimal shared-memory ipc scheme it gives an incredible advantage in that your video pipe can connect to most media player programs capture and editing tools etc

1198162
buffering	streaming
-- output the buffering as raw-data into the file streaming

1198168
webforms	asp.net
i am using asp.net webforms and jquery validation

1198168
contains	elements
note that frame is a div contains input elements

1198168
contains	any
if any of invalidelements are contains in the given div return false otherwise return true

1198172
16-bit	8bit
read char by char 16-bit and converted them to 8bit byte arrays

1198193
deployment	install
while this is a mild annoyance in development it raises the question as i .approach deployment release - if i use the .app-config to store my user settings will the user s personalized settings be hosed every time they install a patch that changes the versioning numbers of my .app

1198195
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
some two-factor solutions work with openid providers some have php perl python sdks

1198202
observer-pattern	messaging
i would suggest looking into messaging frameworks instead of using observer-pattern

1198214
selected	textbox
my jquery code below switches a state dropdownlistfor out with a state input textbox depending on the country that is selected

1198215
hide	show
i would like to have the dialog box describe by miscsettings to be initializer .when the program starts up destructed .when the program exit and show hide according to whether the user selected a particular menu option vs

1198215
dialog	pop-up
at this points i m not sure what would be the cleanest way of transferring the settings on the child pop-up dialog to the rest of the application

1198223
directory	folder
you can look at checked out the top level directory strcuture of any given folder but make sure that you retain the named consistently to avoid confusion

1198277
profiling	trace
before making any changes it might be useful to run a profiling trace to figure out where most of the time is spent to make sure you actually optimize the real problem

1198297
contains	elements
if a table cell contains a text elements which has styles x then make that table cell have a background colour a kind of reverse inherited

1198309
hide	show
and show hide according to whether the

1198315
user-controls	ascx
presentation layer here s where the web-config resides your aspx pages and user-controls ascx

1198315
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
.so for instances you could exchange your business-logic-layer or more probably and realistically your data-access-layer dll without changing anything above since everything is separated by the according interface layer from each other

1198341
mstest	moq
for start - use built-in mstest and grab a mocking framework moq should do the trick

1198345
transformation	dimension
for example you can use the existing slowly changing dimension transformation component or you can use a numbers of low-level components to implements your own custom solution but subsequently incorporate logging

1198377
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework supports all you want

1198381
selected	button
i want the button to remove the selected row in the outline view

1198408
email-validation	validation
.so in asp.net-mvc the valid email-validation from above wouldn t go into a controllers or view because input into that piece of business-logic is likely to happen in more than one controllers view and this would required the duplication of the validation logic

1198413
http	ssl
ssl stands for secure socket layer and it s a methods of encrypted http communication among other things

1198431
loading	gif
for a site with a lot of small thumbnail images i wanted to use a placeholder gif while each image was loading

1198433
metaphone	soundex
if you implements it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this types of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1198453
bison	yacc
if you don t want to include an external libs you can parsing your xml with flex bison lex yacc

1198464
push	pull
it will mount your ftp account as a device directory from which you can do all normals git operations push pull

1198466
synchronous	.when
my issue is that .when i initializer both controls the selecteddatechanged event doesn t get fired synchronous

1198468
python	perl
there are third party product available and plenty of perl and python scripting but i wanted .something simple and a language i was familiar with .so ended up just writing hooks in a c# con.sole .app

1198480
temporary	copy
you will need to create a temporary file to set as the file you would like to copy

1198484
atom-feed	feed
i m trying to use the ruby-on-rails atom-feed helpers to generator a feed for a nested resource

1198492
contains	elements
if you you float an elements the elements it s contains in must have a width

1198523
constructor	private	constructor	object	initializer	getter
allo a class to initializer only 1 object by designing the constructor as private and design a static getter that return either a new object or the existing object

1198526
difference	count
am i overlooking a semantic difference between length and count or did perhaps some implementation detail in the .net required different named for these similar concepts

1198535
metaphone	soundex
if this is for single words searching you could try using soundex or metaphone functions

1198620
treeview	listview
you could make the treeview look like a listview if you wanted

1198631
bonjour	avahi
better option would be to use a service-discovery protocols like bonjour or avahi than rolling your own as they have solved a lot of problems already

1198636
winmerge	utility
i ve .so far looked at winmerge examdiff pro compare it and smartsvn s utility and all of them allow the printing of diff results but they put both sides on one sheet

1198646
keyboard	mouse
the tool will capture screenshot with random interval count the keyboard event numbers and mouse event numbers for every minute

1198647
internet-explorer	firefox
this seems to do the trick for me for now in internet-explorer 8 and firefox 3.5

1198671
versioning	upgrade
everytime i release a new versioning for bug fixed or minor upgrade

1198671
versioning	upgrade
in the setup-project properties i increment the versioning numbers and change the product code i always leave the same upgrade code

1198671
versioning	upgrade
i am wondering is it possible to get back the original upgrade that was used to install those versioning

1198687
output	cat
but the following is what puzzle me the most if i do a unix very basic cat systemd call on the output file at then end see code below it works just fine

1198718
tstringlist	tlist
only use tlist or tstringlist if you need lots of size changing flexibility

1198766
unsigned	bigint
| itemstatusid | bigint 20 unsigned | no | pri | null | auto_increment |

1198771
command-line	cmd
is there a way to send cmd to another command-line program

1198771
command-line	cmd
cause i have a special command-line program but i can t send cmd to it using syntax like program.exe something_to_do

1198829
constructor	object
later we pass ownership to the construct exception-handling object - it call addref in its constructor and release in destructor

1198829
constructor	object
am i correct that the addref in the constructor will cause a memory leak or is there some internal mechanism that doesn t allow ierrorinfo object to leak at all

1198838
rhino-mocks	nunit
i am refactoring a class .so that the code is testable using nunit and rhino-mocks as testing and i.solations frameworks and have found that i have found myself with a methods is dependent on another it depends on .something which is created by that other methods

1198842
profiling	trace
you can either get this by running an sql profiling trace with the showplan xml event or if this isn t possible you probably shouldn t do this on loaded production servers you can extraction the caching execution plan that s being used from the dmvs

1198872
swing	swt
the problem is that jfx scripting can t be embedded into swing nor eclipse swt

1198881
value	field
.when execution stops on the breakpoints i can see from the watch that recordset att returns a value of types variant object field2 and the field contains pretty much what i expect it to

1198886
base-class	inherited
the problem i am coming into is that the particular object is inherited from a base-class and those base-class properties value are not updates

1198906
put	get
if i leave out the above line at least i get the welcome page but then the directory where i put the php-java-bridge application only show the resource not found error

1198910
attributes	properties
is it possible to add this new properties with .some kind of attributes .so that .when i call serialization or deserialization methods this properties will go unnoticed

1198919
checkout	payment
.so you might implements your site and shop as usual but decide to put everything from the cart to the checkout payment and .so on under http

1198919
http	ssl
on a side note http is not using ssl exclusivley anymore tls the successor to ssl see rfc2818 is more modern

1198920
put	get
best bet is to get hold on an iphone and put your application on it and test it

1198922
random-seed	generator
.so given a random-seed generator planets populations land masses .solar systemd etc

1198934
protected	public
if you need or want to use inheriteded for whatever rea.son at the very least make it private or protected inheriteded .so you don t inherited publicly from a class with a public non-virtual destructor

1198937
macros	vba
this means that if i distribute the vba program other people need to enable macros to run

1198947
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
major ones - firefox safari ie opera google-chrome

1198955
relocation	linker
it ll also create a relocation entry to points to the part of the code image that needs to be updates by the linker with the correct address

1198955
relocation	linker
the linker s job is then to walk through the relocation table fixing up the code image with the final symbols addresses

1198969
derived-class	base-class
3 abstract component base-class has virtual-method getdata which is overrides by each derived-class

1198970
ip-address	proxy
is there something that could change ip-address during surfing proxy anonimazers speed-boosters

1198976
directory	folder
are you setting the xml data to be copy-paste at compile-time .so it s not in the actual project directory but the bin folder

1198984
constructor	object
would it be better to pass the base object in a constructor to rtdsensor like

1198991
switching	router
others include switching to a vpn restart of router reset of connection by the isp

1199009
constructor	object
i don t think this really has anything to do with the constructor call - the problem is you re trying to cast an object of one types to another

1199016
cvs	git
i have previous experience using sourcesafe cvs svn mercurial and git less of the last two

1199021
google-chrome	safari	web-inspector	webkit
webkit browsers google-chrome safari have web-inspector

1199032
arrays	loops
the arrays gets passed to the view somehow either directly or indirectly and extractionion via extraction or using a loops of variable-variables same thing really

1199056
ip-address	proxy
with the aol software at the time browser request would go through aol s proxy farm and could come from a different ip-address on every request

1199058
3des	des
then i found some samples of encrypting large-data or files by using cryptostream and only use symmetric algorithms like des or 3des which have the function createencryptor to return icryptotransform as one of the input to the constructor of cryptostream

1199061
contains	set
in the log4net.config file i have a follingfileappender set up and it contains the following

1199069
sharp-architecture	s#arp-architecture
regarding the layering - you could take a look at something like s#arp-architecture code.google.com p sharp-architecture for an example of how they do it they have taken a pretty maximal approach to layering

1199085
constructor	object
first i agree with the idea of each component object in it s constructor being responsible for asking for its configuration

1199094
base-class	inherited
inherited from a base-class and those

1199105
environment	building
the error-handling is only needed to avoid scripting errors .when someone building the project on a environment without the correct folder structure

1199123
private-key	rsa
the .net implementation of rsa and all public private-key algorithms do not support large blocks of data - because that s not the aim of public private-key

1199127
spaces	output
this process is not show in our ps output but it was probably one of the lwps you have omitted to save spaces

1199136
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it s like firebug itself but as an external javascript libs and tested in firefox opera safari and even the good ol ie as the webpage states

1199148
json	xml
looks like google supports many formatting options for example json and xml

1199152
aes	rsa
decrypt the aes key using your rsa key

1199162
selected	button
is it possible to change the behavior of the yui text-editor .so that .when you make markup changes via the toolbar bar button for example changing from a paragraph to say a heading or to a list and you dont have any text selected it assumes you mean the current block that the cur.sor is in

1199179
any	set
this means unspecified numbers of classes is called .so i can t just intercept any given set of classes methods

1199184
fieldset	margins
only in internet-explorer does this occur i m getting an additional margins of 19 pixels below a fieldset and i can t seem to see why whatever i try

1199184
firefox	safari	fieldset	margins
the fieldset should have a 1.125em bottom margins and it does in safari firefox etc

1199192
temporary	rvalue
it may create a new temporary by copying the rvalue and bind the reference to that or it may bind the reference directly to the rvalue itself

1199192
copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	rvalue	temporary	rvalue
if the compiler is not able to make the obvious optimization to remove the temporary and elide the copy-constructor for the return-value of getfoo then how likely is it to be able to do the more efficient form of binding an rvalue to a const reference without making a new temporary

1199192
temporary	rvalue
if the return-types were actually a types derived from foo then assign to a base-class const reference would be guaranteed not to splice even if the compiler did make a temporary object from the rvalue returned by the function

1199192
derived-class	base-class
the compiler will also generator the correct call to the derived-class destructor whether or not the destructor in the base-class is virtual or not

1199192
expression	evaluation
these optimizations refer to eliminating the copy of either the rvalue result-of evaluation a return expression or of a named local variables into the return-value of a function in the body of the function itself

1199195
constructor	object
even the wuc constructor doesn t fire before that points and in the constructor the page object is null .so you can t add it there

1199195
placeholder	required
1 the way i think i would do this is to not put any content in the designer that required the scriptmanager and to put placeholder where such content needs to go

1199225
attributes	properties
the source attributes must be specified .when the properties attributes is specified.

1199242
attributes	properties
the correct namedd for the field should be visible in luke prefixed with the properties named you applied the indexedembedded attributes to

1199242
arguments	default
edit if the default prefixing is not to your liking you can change it with the prefix arguments of the indexedembedded attributes

1199243
python	c++
that python was an impractical annoying language i can still read some comments on my early code complaining about it and c++ what the only true object-oriented language

1199253
hidden-field	checkbox
u can get the checkbox by using document.findelementbyid id then store the checkboxe s value into a hidden-field that has a runat server properties

1199254
versioning	upgrade
in reality clickonce upgrade only leave the previous versioning behind and versioninging before that are cleaned up

1199267
any	set
any vim guru whi can suggest what named i must hi inorder to set color for items mentioned

1199272
managed-code	unmanaged
make sure your attaching to the process using the correct code types - if your process has both unmanaged and managed-code then dont rely on auto to work for you explicit state what sort of code your trying to debugging

1199272
.when	ready
in these cases all you can do is try and make sure everything is prepare ready for .when the module is loaded

1199300
value	field
it s best to use a string properties that converts the value for you within your code to the required int properties field

1199301
organization	naming
depending on the named of a person the naming scheme used by their organization and their domain named an address can easily exceed 20 characters

1199350
row	col
now after a few iterator i want to put some other piece of data under col again in a different row

1199355
value	field
and in put the email value back in the form field

1199363
.when	ready
program your php .so that .when it finds itself ready to issue a query that ends-with limit 3000 20 or higher it would just stop and don t issue the query

1199363
order	add
if you add an order by to your query and don t have an index then mysql will of course need to browse all the recording to find out the first 20

1199367
php-extension	xdebug
i m using the ide eclipse-pdt which can use the php-extension xdebug to provide debugging functionnalities kind of the same way as visual-studio a bit less powerful maybe which gives you the ability to do things like

1199378
stderr	stdout
output to stderr or stdout don t count as tool
