version-control	git
pattern4	
from my own experience with it i wouldn t recommend git as an introduction to version-control

120140
checkstyle	ant	eclipse-plugin	ant
pattern10	
on the other hand i think .so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have .some things standardised at design-time instead of building time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse-plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins

121731
python	ruby	erlang	python
pattern10	
i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby

122033
python	ruby
pattern0	pattern0	
i wasn t trying to imply that linq is better than ruby python

122571
jndi	jdbc
pattern5	
edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations

123030
abstract-class	subclassing
pattern5	
i m more likely to building an abstract-class if i think there should be a creational contract specifically that a specific types of constructor should always be supported by subclassing

123076
metaphone	soundex
pattern0	
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

123307
elementtree	lxml
pattern5	
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml

124248
aes	rsa
pattern0	
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
aes	rsa
pattern10	
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more .so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
aes	rsa
pattern7	pattern0	
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

124612
python	perl
pattern7	pattern0	
perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expression

124822
sequences	unique
pattern10	
create sequences which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generator unique numberss .when selected from as opposed to serial which generator the unique numbers .when the row is insert

125172
exception-handling	try-catch
pattern5	
the real kicker is that often this manifestation of ie6 s invalid arguments exception-handling cannot be protected by try-catch

126199
sql-server	oracle
pattern7	pattern10	
oracle people will tell you oracle is better sql-server peopele will tell you sql-server is better

126267
sql-server	oracle
pattern7	
imho oracle has better vldb support than sql-server for the following reasons

126267
sql-server	oracle
pattern7	
oracle has better table partition facilities than sql-server

126267
sql-server	oracle
pattern0	
oracle can be run on somewhat larger hardware than sql-server although one can run sql-server on some quite respectably large systemd

127922
mbunit	nunit
pattern7	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

128055
quicksort	shellsort
pattern0	
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128221
g++	gcc
pattern0	
unfortunately g++ packed the struct significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing object between c and c++ code

128259
tuples	set
pattern7	
second if the set types is the better answer how do i key it to look at just the first elements of the tuples instead of the whole thing

128488
getter	setter
pattern5	
validation can be placed in setter and getter for that matter

128958
ghostscript	magick.net
pattern5	
if that works your imagick and ghostscript installation are basically ok and something needs to be done in magick.net or your .app

130230
telnet	ssh
pattern10	
ssh encrypts all communication does everything telnet does and more

131278
remote-debugging	debugging
pattern5	
you can throw it away once you re done debugging and you never need to upload it to the server unless you re planning to do remote-debugging

131931
constructor	private
pattern5	
you need to mark methods you want to mock virtual and the class needs a constructor with no arguments this can be protected private won t work

131954
32-bit	16-bit
pattern0	
16-bit arithmetic was faster than 32-bit arithmetic though the cpu could handle a logical memory spaces of up to 4 gib

132295
glassfish	weblogic
pattern5	
my question is how this can be done in weblogic webspehre glassfish etc.

132757
python	perl
pattern4	pattern2	
what are your own reasons to prefer python over perl

132829
exception-handling	try-catch
pattern5	
i m from the school of thought where try-catch blocks should be used and exception-handling not rethrown

132841
solaris	bsd
pattern4	
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

133247
python	perl
pattern7	pattern0	
how to convince people python is better than perl

133271
inlining	inline
pattern0	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointers to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

133461
python	perl
pattern7	
show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl

134276
json	xml
pattern4	
c# business layer - deals with taking user request submitted via http recived by an aspx page gathering the correct response based on the state of the database and returning it to the client via xml although i would recommend json

134346
hash	md5
pattern10	
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

134934
digits	zero
pattern0	
i want to display a leading zero for all numbers with less than 2 digits

135198
python	perl
pattern7	
perl has constants multi-line anonymous functions and autovivification but python has better default object orientation

135543
versioning	upgrade
pattern0	
the subversioning versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook .so i guess my newer versioning .somehow upgrade the working directory .so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

135656
python	php
pattern3	
the everything-is-an-object model in python is what made me oo programming really click for me - and as a former php programmer and doubly-certified zend engineer i strongly recommend exploring python oo if you want to understand what oo is all about

138034
opensolaris	linux
pattern0	
you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important

138306
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
pattern7	pattern0	
even in scalar code loading 8bit or 16-bit value is no slower than loading 32-bit since .movzx .movsx is no different in speed from .mov

138949
updating	updates
pattern6	
normalize makes updatess much faster because each updates is the smallest it can be you are updating the smallest - in terms of columns and rows - possible table

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0	
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behavior components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139478
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
pattern3	
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

139546
vb.net	vb6
pattern1	
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6

139633
rollback	commit
pattern5	
truncated can therefore not be rollback and a failure in the truncated process will have issued a commit anyway

139884
postgresql	mysql
pattern5	
mysql and mssql both provide this functionality iirc .so i would be surprised if postgresql didn t

140359
bugzilla	mantis
pattern0	
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140502
dialog	pop-up
pattern7	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

140541
derived-class	base-class
pattern5	pattern5	
base-class constructor get called before derived-class constructor but derived-class initializer get called before base-class initializer

142100
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
that being said i greatly prefer asp.net both asp.net-mvc and webforms myself - but i left asp development about 7 years ago

142156
any	set
pattern4	
just remember that if you have a warehousing strategy of dropping indexes before updating a table then recreating them you will have to set the index up for monitor again and you ll lose any monitor history for that index

142240
processor	cpu
pattern7	
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer windows than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor

142427
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
using compatibility as the central points in the versioning numbers makes it easier for users especially if te product is a libs to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

142565
contains	any
pattern4	
the grouping contains w which means non-word character and - .so the regex should match any non-word character or any hyphen

145153
python	ruby
pattern7	
i d say the python community is larger and more mature than the ruby community and that s really important for me

145300
python	ruby
pattern8	
e.g. common-lisp is a language that is even more dynamic than ruby or python and yet there are common-lisp compilers out there that can even give c a run for its money

145348
arrays	loops
pattern7	
but the most efficient general way i could find is to use a foreach loops on the arrays short-circuiting whenever a hit is found at least the implicit loops is better than the straight for

145433
buildr	maven
pattern0	
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

145481
python	ruby
pattern4	
unfortunately i cannot compare python to ruby since i never used that language

145513
perl	ruby
pattern2	
compare that with perl ruby or whatever where you have an extreme freedom which isn t that good in this case

145907
linked-list	tree
pattern7	
i doubt that means that binary tree are not useful but that in kernel and embedded world the linked-list probably fits better

146463
python	java
pattern5	
i d have to checked up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.

146627
python	ruby
pattern4	pattern2	
i d recommend python over ruby as a windows scripting-language

146627
python	ruby
pattern10	pattern8	
python windows-support is much more mature than ruby s

146871
common-lisp	scheme
pattern4	pattern2	
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common-lisp .so that narrows it down a bit

147392
emacs	vim
pattern0	
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

147392
emacs	vim
pattern5	pattern5	
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standards

148154
instances	private
pattern5	
remember you can always have the static synchronous methods to be protected or private leaving it visible only to the instances of the class

149028
http	ssl
pattern7	
you should use tls ssl http .so that eavesdropping on the http traffic is harder to perform

149122
oracle	mysql
pattern1	
i m not familiar with oracle but in mysql you can use use|ignore|force_index see here for more details

149164
worksheet	excel
pattern0	
your webserver should use compression for this extension and your code should checked if the numbers of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet

149409
3des	aes
pattern10	pattern8	
3des is more expensive than aes for example

149913
cryptography	openssl
pattern1	
for cryptography purposes you should use one of the standards cryptography libs out there instead such as openssl which will indeed use dev urandom .when available

150078
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
pattern4	
it matches any character which is not contains in the ascii character set 0-127 0x0 to 0x7f

150464
ruby-on-rails	rspec
pattern7	
i ve just started reading the art of ruby-on-rails which covers some more advanced topics such as meta-programming api-design and rspec

151079
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
pattern5	
this seems to be broken in firefox and ie but work in opera safari and google-chrome

151399
irrlicht	ogre	system-requirements	platform
pattern7	pattern10	
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system-requirements and works better across platform than ogre in my opinion

151587
restart	exit
pattern4	
.when i right click the icons in the task panels by the clock and choose exit program it just restart moments later

152126
unicode-string	utf8-decode
pattern5	
the first paragraph is garbled since the â will not be sent using utf8-decode the second is fine because the unicode-string supplied is encode to utf-8

153419
cairngorm	flexunit
pattern5	
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint

154057
subclassing	inherited
pattern10	
inherited is more useful .when a new subclassing wants to change the way a methods works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

155662
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
pattern5	
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky .so you must have halved your radians or .something

155711
freeglut	glut
pattern7	
glut hasn t been updates for awhile but you can also try freeglut which is a newer open source replacement of glut and is include by several linux distributions out of the box

156304
value	field
pattern5	
how do i set an attributes on a field anywhere in my assembly then reflect on those field attributess in my entire assembly and get set the field value that the attributes is attached too

156684
webserver	security
pattern5	
can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criterion - maybe a lookup list

157151
png	ico
pattern5	
furthermore setting the icons of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place

157238
lwjgl	jogl
pattern10	pattern7	
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

158997
actionscript	mxml
pattern5	
that is rather than dealing with time and frame in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript

159002
actionscript	mxml
pattern5	pattern5	
.so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around

161193
keyboard	mouse
pattern0	
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161559
cvs	git
pattern4	
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

161572
version-control	git
pattern7	
for that reason git gives individuals better local version-control

162793
firefox	gecko
pattern5	
the last versioning is based on gecko 1.7.12 and i believe gecko is currently up to 1.9.x used in firefox 3

162991
swing	swt
pattern5	
once created those widget will be integrated with swt swing or qt-jambi framework

162991
swing	swt
pattern4	
i will probably choose swt swing or qt-jambi for the user-interface controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

163765
llvm	gcc
pattern4	
if i wanted to publishing the results as a doctoral thesis i would make a bigger deal about this and i would probably compare gcc tendra ten15 llvm watcom borland visual-c++ digital mars icc and other compilers

164073
innodb	myisam
pattern1	
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def updates time but thats not .so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of .when the definition might have been modified..

164652
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern7	
i m guessing your consultant is suggesting use a status variables instead of exception-handling for error-handling is a better practice

165747
handler	service
pattern0	
would this be better implements as web service handler

166196
aes	des
pattern10	
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption methods

166754
gentoo	linux
pattern5	
i install mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompile asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net

166865
basic	vb6
pattern6	
despite the title hardcore visual basic is the best and the fastest way to learn vb6 if you are coming from another programming language

166949
static-class	inherited
pattern5	
in your question you are using static-class methods b.foo d.foo this cannot be accomplished using inherited because the static-methods do not have a dynamic nature they do not take part in the lookup systemd

167871
carbon	cocoa
pattern5	
the next release of eclipse should be based on cocoa rather than carbon which is the current but that won t be until next june

167905
scriptaculous	sortable
pattern0	
mootools sortable are actually better than scriptaculous because they are dynamic

167922
keyboard	mouse
pattern4	
the .net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switching and the switching would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

169094
prototyping	waterfall
pattern6	
i ve always held onto the belief that a classic waterfall or hybrid waterfall imperative prototyping is the best approach for medium to large project

169234
solaris	linux	solaris	bsd	solaris	unix	linux	bsd	linux	unix	unix	bsd
pattern5	
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systemd

169677
javascript	dom
pattern6	
that said one of the most important problems programmers not-so-competent with javascript make is that most pieces of code accessing dom elements tend to create memory-leaks which is the highway case for most web developers

170479
value	field
pattern7	
the problem is you can t really tell the user how many characters are allowed in the field because the escaped value obviously has more characters than the unescaped one

170669
linux	unix	apache	squid
pattern7	pattern7	
apache itself can be configure to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job

170948
common-lisp	scheme
pattern0	
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common-lisp and have an interpreter for checked my work

171213
linux	unix
pattern5	
if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me

171436
response	timeout
pattern7	
as for the read timeout that is trickier you need it to be low .so you don t exhaust your pool of worker who are waiting for the remote service to return but you al.so don t want it .so low that it closes the connection before reading a response

171876
rollback	commit
pattern5	
it is my understanding that .when the crash nodes comes back its transactional will have been rollback since it never got the commit messages

172107
common-lisp	lisp
pattern6	
this is a video of a talk given by peter seibel the author of practical common-lisp which is the best lisp textbook there is

172177
lighttpd	apache
pattern10	pattern10	
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static-content

172363
any	set
pattern4	
you can match any numbers of nested parens through brute force but you can t ever match an arbitrarily long set of nested brackets

172432
scala	java	kotlin	scala
pattern5	
edit thereâ s a free community edition which is a superb way to get started with java scala or kotlin

172718
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	mysql
pattern4	
i still use mysql for web sites but for in-house project i rather choose firebird or postgresql

172727
sql-server	mysql
pattern4	pattern4	
the microsoft stack does favor sql-server .when no other specifications is given and lamp favors mysql but i don t see it as being that strong of a bond

173548
accurev	svn	clearcase-ucm	accurev
pattern4	
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different grouping and to purchase accurev

174577
code-coverage	ncover	code-coverage	gallio	gallio	ncover
pattern4	
i would highly recommend gallio formally mbunit for unit-testing and unfortunately not free ncover for code-coverage

174920
frame	width
pattern7	
are you sure the frame fits completely within the screens and contentsize s width is not greater than the scroll view s width

176144
safari	opera
pattern6	
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
firefox	safari
pattern7	
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176644
google-chrome	firefox
pattern5	
my understanding is that this was an ie-only properties that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards .so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped

177532
verilog	vhdl
pattern4	
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

177565
verilog	vhdl
pattern10	
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

178555
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl	vhdl	hdl
pattern4	
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
pattern8	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revision of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-pick most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here .when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

179520
google-chrome	safari
pattern7	
google-chrome al.so uses an earlier versioning of webkit than the current safari .so pages should be checked in both browsers

179699
google-chrome	safari
pattern1	
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome rendering the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderinging versioning may be different the javascript engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror

180099
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
json is smaller and simpler than xml

180112
json	xml
pattern8	
xml has a bit more overhead than json because of the angle brackets and extra information and what not

180112
json	xml
pattern0	
any good parsing should be able to parsing json faster than xml for this reason

180358
delphi	vb6
pattern10	
i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api call than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide

180497
delphi	c++
pattern4	pattern2	
even if you don t use that garbage collecting memory manager i would still recommend delphi over c++

180497
delphi	c++
pattern4	pattern2	
for excel add-ins as you mentioned in your comment i would recommend delphi over c++ builder because it has better com support which i believe you need for excel add-ins

180528
python	c++
pattern5	
python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures

181450
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contains nulls

181920
moss	wss
pattern8	
moss considerably more expensive than wss which ships as part of microsoft server licensing

183657
sql-server	oracle
pattern10	pattern8	
i ll state my bias upfront - oracle is far more complex than sql-server

186788
oracle-xe	oracle
pattern4	
if you are an honest types grab oracle-xe read the appropriate guide at the documentation libs and spend a day or 5 throw together a blog address book flickr clone etc in your favorite language against oracle

186788
sql-server	oracle
pattern5	
as others have suggested there is some significant difference in things you would do compared to sql-server if you just apply what you know from sql-server to oracle you ll likely kill performance

186990
configparser	configobj
pattern7	
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

187601
cygwin	gnu
pattern4	
if you want to use win32 ports of some unix utilities rather than installing cygwin i recommend gnu utilities for win32

187939
default-arguments	arguments
pattern7	
if creating constructor with arguments is bad as many would argue then making them with default-arguments is even worse

188242
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
pattern5	
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql and .so forth

188415
shell	bash
pattern8	
the situation where the two line have different behavior is .when your scripting is not running in bash but some simpler shell in the sh family dash which i believe is used as bin sh in some linux distros because it is more lightweight than bash

188871
contains	any
pattern5	
it generator random words sequences using determinated rules you choose the site contains very funny things but in italian only the ruless can be written in any language.

189058
sql-server	ms-access
pattern10	
an in-process db like sql-server compact or ms-access is much more appropriate

189987
sql-server	mysql
pattern4	
sure you might have some customers that might prefer mysql to sql-server

190913
abstract-class	subclassing
pattern0	
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclassing in mind for them

191318
.when	ready
pattern10	
in some cases that s exactly what you want in others you might find that listening for .when the dom is ready is more appropriate - this event is similar to onload but fires without waiting for images etc

191744
python	java
pattern7	
forget all that python just allocates more memory as needed there is not a myriad of comandline arguments for the viewmodel as in java just let it run

191824
windows-vista	windows	versioning	upgrade
pattern2	pattern0	
a lot of companies are ignoring windows-vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows versioning .when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows-vista

192156
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

192254
any	set
pattern5	
assign the properties to an initial value which can be distinguished from any other value that it might be set to null for reference-type

192409
