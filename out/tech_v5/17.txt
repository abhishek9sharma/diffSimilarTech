using parameters with value are fine but .when i try to set a field in the database to null i m unsuccessful

170192
put	get
what do i need to put in a building.xml file to get ant to building it and make a .war file

170209

170392
swt	awt
you could look at capturing the jeditorpane the jdic webbrowser-control or the swt browser via the awt embedding support

170398
json	xml
something that might be helpful especially if you want to reuse your service for new applications that don t required the form field is to create a channel that deconstructs your streaming and repackages it to xml json soap whatever and have your form clients communication with the service through that while clients that don t use forms can use another channel stack

170411

170478
safari	opera
i tested this in opera 9.5 ie7 ff3 and safari and it works in all of them

170479

g++	gcc
what is the difference between g++ and gcc

172592
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are compiler-drivers of the gnu compiler collections which was once upon a time just the gnu c compiler

172592
g++	gcc
according to 1 and 2 g++ is equivalent to gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc the 1st is a compiler option the 2nd two are linker options

172597
g++	gcc
gcc or g++ just choose a different front-end with different default options

172598
private	self
you have to put interface declaring your private category in the begin of myclass.m file otherwise xcode complains with a messages like self may not respond to messages privatefoo

172613
g++	gcc
the only notable difference is that i you pass a .c to gcc it will compile as c whereas g++ will always treat it as c++

172615
contains	elements
taking rob walker s advice i looped over all the elements in the arrays and it actually contains all the results

172621
llvm	gcc
objective-c is compiled to native-code by either gcc or llvm

172639
double	int
that said as per my comment on collin s .post the ability to perform things like basic arithmetic increment int32 division etc on for example a matrix t for t in decimal float int double etc is often highly valuable

172647
arrays	loops
i think the answer to the intent of your question is yes the arrays.length properties gets recalculated each iterator through loops if you modify the arrays in loops

172651
static-typing	let
static-typing of c# will not let you do .so but you can fool it with casting to object

172706
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
if you re coding in the microsoft stack you ll go with sql-server in the linux world the default is mysql and for corporate in-house project most shops have decided on some default like oracle or ibm db2

172717
sql-server	oracle
i work on a gov contract and while we code in the microsoft stack we can t use sql-server because the government gets oracle for free and wants us to use that instead

172718
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	mysql
i still use mysql for web sites but for in-house project i rather choose firebird or postgresql

172721
attributes	properties
attributes are designed for expressing simple properties of the information represented in an elements

172727
sql-server	mysql
the microsoft stack does favor sql-server .when no other specifications is given and lamp favors mysql but i don t see it as being that strong of a bond

172728
sql-server-express	sql-server
ms sql-server-express edition comes attached with visual-studio .so it s easier to set up an application to work with sql-server

172728
postgresql	mysql
people using linux are used to install mysql sqlite or postgresql in a second and maybe that s beacuse they don t need windows to run a dbms

172761
design-time	designer
the form designer for windows forms applications allows you to configure the tab control at design-time but the resource editor for native c++ applications doesn t allow this

172762
webforms	asp.net
if you must use webforms for asp.net the event model will be the source of much pain and suffering for you since you are coming from an web developer mindset thinking request response simplicity which is a good thing

172787
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql go toe to toe all the time and the choice is not as clear as you made it seem

172793
ironpython	ironruby
1- the homepage pointss to another page at codeplex the homepage should be clean and just points the advantages of ironpython take the ironruby page as an example its that hide language-developent stuff from the user even though the user has to access ironruby s svn prior using it

172794
python	c++
i m surprised no one mentioned shedskin it automagically converts your python program to c++ and in some benchmarking yield better improvements than psyco in speed

172795
enterprise	platform
it will depend on what types of project you pursue and what platform are acceptable to the enterprise using the technology

172795
sql-server	oracle
mid-sized businesses will more than likely use sql-server but if they are consumers of demographic data from sources such as claritas you ll get oracle bundled with the application

172798
scheme	lisp
i have experimented with lisp actually scheme and found it to be a very beautiful language that i am interested in learning more about

172807
identifier	temporary
in other words you would have to ensure that there was no overlap by either merging document temporary or creating another scheme that concatenation additional identifier to the dynamically generator key

172824
expression	evaluation
rick strahl also has some post on embedding javascript as runtime engine for expression evaluation

172839
contains	any
the . operators happens to be shorthand for an append operation in a numbers of languages but there s nothing stopping you from defining a prepend operation â or even changing append to prepend â in any language that allows overloading an operators on whatever data types you want to work with or on any object you might use to contains that data otherwise

172841
value	field
a focus listener does not work as expected because the formatter gets called which eventually causes the value to be reset which ultimately de-selects the field contents

172841
value	field
i think what is happening is that after the value changes the caret move to the rightmost positioning and this deselects the field

172843
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc

172843
variables	boolean
or if a boolean variables s default-value is true store it s inverse value in the structure

172853
value	field
.when a tag field is added or changed that kicks off a background-thread that selected all bugids and their tags parsing the text building a map where the key is the tag and the value is a list of all the ids that have that tag

172871
directory	folder
i ve tried various folder organization a top level project directory then broken down by department or person or application but no matter what i try it s still too time consuming to find what i m looking for

172871
project-management	project
the closest to what i m looking for is like lotus had in their agenda program back in the dos days where you could organize and view data multiple ways i d like to be able to do the same thing with a nice fast windows .app that would fully integrated with explorer .so it would know what project i m actively working on .when asking me where to save .something and maybe even do .some minimal project-management .so as i mark things complete their directory would no longer .appear or if .something is marked as high priority it would show at the top or be color coded

172899
joomla	drupal
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise

172905
switching	router
i need to be able to switching from one interface to the other or maybe even transmit on both in software static router rules won t work for this application

172921
header-files	makefile	mpfr	gmp
note you will need mpfr tested with 2.3.2 install with the correct paths change the makefile for libs and header-files along with those from gmp to successfully compile this

172928
allegro	sdl
i m toying with sdl or allegro but i have no experience in either .so i m open to the best and ideally easiest toolkit out there

172929
g++	gcc
although the gcc and g++ cmd do very similar things g++ is designed to be the cmd you d invoke to compile a c++ program

172933
binary-tree	tree
join operations can be translation to binary-tree operations by merging tree

172943
memmove	strcpy
go ahead and figure out how to write the assembly to replace a few simple stdlib routines like strcpy memmove etc

172945
command-line	cmd
right now i just have some scripting execution cmd to the command-line and parsing the feedback i d love to find something less dependent on the command-line and more tightly integrated

172982
common-lisp	lisp
you may never know that your latest piece of consumer electronics was built with or even programmed in common-lisp or that some service you use is powered by a lisp server

172987
internet-explorer	firefox
without actually being able to look into a html repro that would be my first guess for a html interpretation difference between firefox and internet-explorer

173007
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object-files it automatically links in the std c++ libs gcc does not do this

173007
g++	gcc
gcc compiling .cpp and g++ compiling .c .cpp files has a few extra macros

173009
positioning	slider
that is i want a slider that goes from x to y but only allows the user to move it in discrete int positioning

173055
json	xml
note that many crucial data-processing libs have c-versions be it xml json or whatnot

173070
google-chrome	firefox
after some fiddling i found out that the highest possible value of two which .when right-shifted by .5 would yield 2 is 2.9999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359374999999â with the 9 repeat in google-chrome and firefox

173080
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight libs

173096
required	checked
the subquery inside the not in statement can be evaluated at the beginning of the execution and the temporary table can be checked against each value in the outer selected rather than re-running the subselected every time as would be required with the not exists statement

173104
oracle	mysql
oracle or mysql have their flaws but odds are if you have a problem 100 other people have had the same problem and can tell you how to solve it

173133
double	int
how can i reinterpret-cast a float to an int or a double to a long

173139
primitive	int
the bitconverter class can retrieve the bytes for any primitive types which you can then use to create an int

173147
python	ruby
syntax wise it is closer to c# with a lot of sugar syntax .so it kind of look like c# blend in with ruby python

173162
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button	value	field
.when i did this for a project i found that setting the value of selected field radio button and checkbox necessitated more complex code something along the line of

173162
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
as noted in the comment the jquery .val val methods handles setting radio button checkbox and selected

173163
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
also if you aren t using firefox you can use firebug lite in ie safari or opera

173165
reflection	runtime
you can do some things with reflection to selected the overload at runtime but that will be very slow and has severe issues if anything satisfies both overloads

173168
mediawiki	mantis	bug-tracking	mantis
on top of that we use things like mantis bug-tracking built-in php mediawiki and phpmyadmin

173168
zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
with mature frameworks like zend-framework codeigniter and cakephp creating just about anything in php is possible

173181
mpfr	gmp
apparently c data in the heap is left alone by ghc in basically all cases except code that uses the ffi to access gmp or any c libs that relies on gmp like mpfr that i wanted to use

173228
python	java
you never hear them argue about python over .net over java over c because they just don t care

173229
launchd	daemons
you might also want to take a look at any startup scripting that might launchd the fastcgi daemons

173230
value	field
i use it to mean the value in this field is unknown at this time

173241
bitblt	gdi
other gdi functions such as bitblt link as expected and the compilers compiles with out error or warning

173246
perl	php	python	perl	python	php
the server runs centos 5.2 and has php perl python install

173249
mpfr	gmp
gmp which the ghc runtime uses and mpfr having some weird integration

173276
.when	ready
for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default-value of false and null not be allowed but this implicit assert that we know that the whatever is not ready .when in fact we may have no such knowledge

173290
dictionary	arrays
i am trying to initializer a dictionary with the key as the tag string and value as the arrays index

173299
updating	updates
the updates methods is used for updating a dictionary using another dictionary not for changing a single key-value pair

173305
click	mouse
however .when the context menu is being display the qtreeview will no longer respond to mouse click

173352
shell	bash	gprof	gcov
3. cygwin shell installable complete with perl gcc gprof gcov gdb and related tools bash vim development debugging tools

173354
binaries	install
if you want to install binaries add reg key and even run custom actions have your own code execure during install you should have a look at it

173365
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
doesnt mysql postgresql oracle and .so on and .so on allow you to do that

173390
any	set
the winforms-app is running on the client the running instances should display the new set of meta data as quickly as possible without any click-once updates checked or whatever

173432
google-apps	gmail
google-gears is used to offer a few of the google-apps offline google-reader gmail docs and more

173445
aspect-ratio	scale
apparently i did scale the mesh and to match the aspect-ratio and i apply the matrix.scaling after matrix.rotationyawpitchroll

173449
compact-framework	.net
i would advice the .net compact-framework for easy and fast development

173449
compact-framework	.net
the downside of using the .net compact-framework is that you ll get limited on your target hardware because it will only run on windows-ce versioning and i thought on symbianos

173462
event-log	logfile
you d need to write to the event-log or to a logfile

173471
windows-applications	wpf
.so i ve been thinking of going for micro.soft certification and i have to make a choice for now between windows forms and wpf for developing windows-applications

173477
updating	updates
updating is a nightmare as well as you need to updates the model for each user

173481
value	field
i can t yet vote .so i ll just say i agree with the suggestion of a hash of the filepath and timestamp or the table named + primary field value + timestamp if being represented by db content

173485
.net	wcf	silverlight	wpf
wpf leverages xaml for the design visual experience this is the same technology that silverlight uses and in the future will be leveraged heavily by other aspects of .net 4.0 specifically wcf web-services and wf workflow

173510
httpserver	webserver
glassfish is an application-server which can also be used as a webserver httpserver

173523
turbogears	django
it s python web framework similar to django or turbogears but it doesn t have the overhead of those frameworks

173543
default-value	arguments
in myeclipse server configuration you find the field optional shutdown arguments which is filled with the default-value

173548
accurev	svn	clearcase-ucm	accurev
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different grouping and to purchase accurev

173548
clearquest	alm	bug-tracking	clearquest
accurev integrated with .so many tools to give you alm bundle - bug-tracking tools like jira clearquest ides testing tools quality centering and if you can t find one you can write your own they provide java perl xml cli sdks

173586
double	int
that works note the addition of case double in the switching but there may be a better way to do the int float checked as they would only work with standards uk us numbers

173602
keyboard	mouse
maybe you just need an keyboard mouse hook

173616
configuration	environment
second what strategy do you use for managing those tests that are long-running or required special environment configuration

173629
sql-server	oracle
i have an oracle server versioning 9 i believe and a ms sql-server versioning 2000

173629
sql-server	oracle
i would like to use dts to extraction some data from the oracle server and pour it into the ms sql-server

173629
sql-server	oracle
i m having problems finding out what drivers i should install on my ms sql-server for it to be able to communication with the oracle server

173632
silverlight	wpf
learning wpf will mean you ll also learn silverlight at the same time

173637
subscript	digits
now for generics fractionss which work in html but also work in plain text use the super- and subscript digits see unicode codepoint charts search for superscripts separated by the fractions slash character

173643
version-control	git
should i investigate version-control systemd that i would use as a software developer subversion git etc. or is there a class of version-control systemd intended for non-sw data that would suit these needs better

173654
keydown	keyup
intercepting the ctrl+v in keydown or keyup of your form

173662
environment	building
the codeigniter environment uses msbuilding to building the solution

173693
debugging	trace
here s the output for the example from my question using trace instead of debugging

173701
cvs	git	svn	rcs	revision	svn	revision	rcs
the other thing you need is some kind of revision control - cvs rcs svn git clearcase.

173718
instrumentation	profiling
however even with rdtsc you will be including the time your code was switched out of execution while a better solution than using time clock if you need an exact measurement you will have to turn to a profiling that will instrumentation your code and take into account .when your code is not actually execution due to context switches or whatever

173739
installshield	uninstaller
my problem is that installshield does not remove these changes on uninstaller

173739
installshield	uninstaller
i have set the remove elements on uninstaller checkbox within the added elements but installshield seems to consequently ignore this

173744
order	join
for some databases it does not matter for example ms sql does know the proper join order most of the time

173745
contains	set
i m looking for a query which will return me an extra column at the end of my current query which is the count of all columns within the return set which contains a null column

173765
managed-code	native-code
i would have thought that it would be clear cut whether memory allocation is faster in managed-code than in native-code - but there seems to be some controversy

173770
lwjgl	jogl
i know how to draw basic object using jogl or lwjgl to connect to opengl

173796
implements	extends
i also tried an oo approach defining object for trunk branches leaves all extends an abstract-class and implements a genotype interface to vary the kind of tree

173810
value	field
a textbox is set to autopostback as changing the value should cause a numbers of display-only field to be recalculated and display

173819
textchanged	textbox
if you are using asp.net 2.0+ you can try calling the focus methods of your textbox once the postback occurs preferably in the textchanged event of the textbox

173822
any	set
once you have set this properties you can then use full xpath to access any elements you want

173886
subclassing	inherited
also i would like this behavior to be inherited by subclassing and not code a custom serialization for every one

173887
litespeed	apache
although not exhaustive the possible return value include aolserver apache apache2filter apache2handler caudium cgi until php 5.3 cgi-fcgi cli cli-server continuity embed isapi litespeed milter nsapi phttpd pi3web roxen thttpd tux and webjames

173932
digits	base
to represent the numbers accurately in base 10 you would need an infinite numbers of decimal digits

173946
unique	words
.so although you could create such a lexicon where each words had it s own unique meaning it would be very difficult and nigh on impossible for machines using current techniques to translation from any human language into your special standardised lexicon

173959
delphi	c++
support for vb c++ delphi other languages

174008
any	set
.so with that said and with attempting to adhere to the kiss principles .when a set of functions are providing a suitable .solution to a problem are there any other rea.sons worth considering to convert my code into an object-oriented design

174046
decimal-point	digits
the parameter 3 in this case is the numbers of digits to show after the decimal-point

174049
margins	padding
using an iframe works and don t cause rendering problems as long as you take care that there s no margins or padding inside the iframe

174069
gnome	kde
how can i in java or using some other programming language add a new program grouping in the applications menu in both kde and gnome

174098
implements	abstract
then you implements your database and userid in terms of the abstract definition

174106
perl	php	perl	c++
it has quite a few independent components applications written in different languages mainly c++ and php some perl

174107
for-loop	loops
as a preparation create a serial for-loop templates and change your code to use functor to implements loops bodies

174107
interlocked	atomicity
what worked great for me was a combinations of manual reset event + atomicity interlocked counter as a much faster alternative

174119
autotools	automake
i see this often in the building scripting of project that use autotools autoconf automake

174150
sql-server-express	sql-server
switching to sql-server-express edition at the server and use sql-server compact at the client

174153
decrement	increment
compiler error the operands of an increment or decrement operators must be a variables properties or indexer.

174170
py2exe	exe
i am trying to use py2exe for converting a scripting into an exe

174175
decrement	increment
you are running one of the operands on the result-of the other the result-of a increment decrement is a value - and you can not use increment decrement on a value it has to be a variables that can be set

174190
project-management	project
i have a ruby-on-rails application for project-management where there are project and task model

174196
procedural-programming	procedural
experience has show me that it s pretty easy to write and maintain procedural code while complexity is low but after a certain threshold it starts getting exponentially more difficult to increase complexity while using procedural-programming whereas oop although harder to begin keeps complexity much more manageable

174212
any	set
make sure that you re not inadvertantly resetting this count before checked it though bol this variables is set to 0 by any statement that does not return rows such as an if-statement

174240
vbscript	jscript
has anyone had any experience targetting wsh in the way that vbscript jscript perlscript xbscript and forthscript among other do such that the language can be used from the command-line and embedded in server-side webpage

174249
unique	words
perhaps the easiest way to come up with code points for the english language would be to base your systemd on say a particular edition of the oxford english dictionary and assign a unique code to each words sequentially

174294
decrement	increment
you can increment a global variables everytime a user session is created and decrement it .when it is destroy

174295
external	embed
link to external images don t embed them in the document

174306
contains	any
cookies work but they should never ever ever contains any information which needs to be secure

174314
plugins	add-on
1 - is replication built-in or an add-on plugins

174331
shell	bash
second in other shell than bash especially older ones the test conditional like -z to test for an empty variables did not exist .so while this

174331
shell	bash
will work fine in bash if you re aiming for portability across various unix environment where you can t be sure that the default shell will be bash and whether it supports the -z test conditional it s safer to use the form if x some_var x since that will always have the intended effect

174341
authentication	login
obviously if you have a login authentication requirement you can capture .when a person sign on and as part of your data-access code you can log .when a person hits the database

174351
any	set
for any non-trivial set of cuts it would take forever to calculate them all

174363
traffic	packets
if you see traffic going out to the remote-server but you never see even one packets coming back from it before the failure then you probably have a firewall issue either on the remote box or on the route from here to there

174363
traffic	packets
if you see traffic going back and forth to the remote-server but then it stops you ll need to dig into those packets and see what low-level error codes might be present in the traffic

174365
vsts	tfs
my visual-studio team systemd vsts integration with team foundation server tfs doesn t seem to pick it up

174365
vsts	tfs
is this a feature that isn t part of vsts tfs

174392
decimal-point	digits
it either starts with a digits in which case the decimal-point and digitss after it are optional or it starts with a decimal-point in which case at least one digits is mandatory after it

174394
display	height
i ve got a question concerning field in databases wich are measures that might be display in different units but are stored only in one such as height for example

174396
rdfs	owl
there s no definitive collections afaik but these links all have useful collectionss of owl and rdfs ontology

174396
rdfs	owl
in addition there are some general-purpose rdf rdfs owl search engines you may find helpful

174430
put	get
and put everything dealing with log4net in that file but i still get the same messages

174451
16-bit	8bit
it s very hard to do fast maths on 16-bit pixels but faster in 8bit if you re clever about how you lay out your palette

174454
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
aptana is the best in my opinion it s based on eclipse and subsequently java .so it will run on pretty much anything and has design views supporting firefox opera and safari on os x and windows i assume it does other browsers as well if they are install

174459
silverlight	wpf
has anyone had any experience with 3rd party controls that can make a windows-mobile .app look like a wpf silverlight iphone - like interface

174467
boost	stl
however i think that in this case i would almost always buy and use stl - or a better solution something from boost perhaps before rolling my own

174498
code-coverage	emma	code-coverage	eclemma	eclemma	emma
also is there an equivalent to emma eclemma free yet powerful code-coverage tool for visual-studio and c# code

174510
google-chrome	firefox
source google-chrome ie firefox

174534
xsd	xml
you should be able to fix this by copying the log4net xsd into c program files microsoft visual-studio 8 xml schema or wherever your visual-studio is install

174535
png	gif
ideally this server side scripting would take the kml the map s latitude-longitude centering and the map zoom level and appropriately merge all of the visible place markers into a single gif or png overlay

174541
perl	awk
are you using sed awk perl or something else to solve this problem

174546
directory	folder
either way since deploy seems to be the last step previous step probably clear the directory and deploy is failing to run leaving your folder empty at the end of the step

174552
fseek	ftell
you may also want to checked the error-codes for fseek ftell and fread

174559
virtualbox	vmware
if you are completely new to kernel development i would suggest not starting with hardware development and going to some software-only kernel modules like proc file sysfs or for more complex examples filesystems network development developing on a uml vmware virtualbox .

174577
code-coverage	ncover	code-coverage	gallio	gallio	ncover
i would highly recommend gallio formally mbunit for unit-testing and unfortunately not free ncover for code-coverage

174602
any	set
in another test i m trying to locate any spfolder that has a custom metadata properties set to a specific value

174612
linux	osx
on a cross platform c++ project win32 linux osx i need to use the printingf functions to printing some variables of types size_t

174632
postgresql	rdbms
on postgresql and many other rdbms you can do it with regular alter-table statement

174659
arrays	map
the situation is like this there is a tile-based map held as a 2d arrays contains a single lighting source and several items standing around

174682
python	ruby
for dynamic-languages like python ruby and many interpreted-language an eval function is a natural elements

174704
lighting	ogre3d
ogre3d is an open source game engine that fully supports lighting as well as sound and game controls

174718
any	set
an easy optimisation to this is to set the state of any cell you encounter along the line to whatever the final outcome is

174725
vbscript	basic
although visual basic for .applications supports the screens printer .app debugging err and clipboard object vbscript supports only the err object

174728
boost	stl
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standards such as boost arrays or boost unordered_map

174746
pixels	line
for every pixels on the edges of the map as arachnid suggested use bresenham to trace a line from the pixels to the lighting

174746
pixels	line
if that line strikes an obstruction then mark all pixels from the edges to just beyond the obstruction as being in shadow

174748
value	field
i have a table with one field that can points to a foreign key in one of 3 other tables based on what the descriminator value is project timekeep or costcenter

174761
png	gif
not sure why you want to go to a gif png overlay you can do this directly in kml

174782
triggers	insert
if your triggers is causing performance problems in your application then the best approach is to remove all manual updatess to the table and required all updatess to go through the insert updates stored-procedures that contains the correct updates logic

174788
solaris	linux
in addition i have a .bash_hostconfig in the linux and solaris directory with host-specific path configuration and such because i have a very different setup at work than i do at home fc5-8 and rhel3-5 depending on where i am

174792
jquery	.post
i found scott hanselman s blog .post with a sample .app that has asp.net-ajax + jquery

174828
libjpeg	libpng
my common libs has grown to include code by others mostly things like libjpeg libpng ffmpeg mysql and a few others and i would rather keep the amount of external code in it to a minimum

174839
ubuntu	debian
is there an easy way of cloning entire install debian ubuntu systemd

174841
put	get
even .when i put a breakpoints in the converter code the debugger just doesn t get there .when an updates is done to the underlying data -

174862
event-viewer	log4net
other .app teams at my work use log4net dashboard which .apparently parsing log4net logs event-viewer and other stuff in one web based interface

174867
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
not sure if this is your answer but this may get you in the right directions it s scott hanselman msft showing how to get asp.net webforms asp.net-mvc and asp.net-dynamic-data -- oh and ajax to work together in harmony

174869
mdiparent	mdichild
it is possible to prevent scrollbar from appearing .when you drag a mdichild outside the bounds of the mdiparent in vb.net

174873
jasper-reports	apache-poi
fyi jasper-reports uses apache-poi for excel-conversion

174882
daemons	systemd
also depending on how often changes are made to either systemd from bookmarks to downloading isos you may need to run rsync in daemons mode and have it updates nearly constantly

174905
triggers	insert
i have typically seen triggers used to insert some relational data which should be done from the business-logic for insert data into report table ie denormalization the data which can be done with a process outside the transactional or for transforming the data in some way

174914
contains	any
the quartz 1.6 migration notes only contains information specific to quartz and i could not find any additional information during my search

174915
any	set
.so is anyone aware of any other database abstraction libs or database access drivers that i could easily extends with our current set of functionality that takes named parameters like pdo does

174920
frame	width
are you sure the frame fits completely within the screens and contentsize s width is not greater than the scroll view s width

174922
implements	extends
i find that it varies a lot depending on the code you are working with - .when writing something from scratch test driven it probably takes about the same amount of time to implements the feature as without tests but you save longer term on the quantity of bugs that will be found and how easily you can maintain and extends that codebase

174948
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
every time i see ruby or python discussed in the context of web development it s always with a framework ruby-on-rails for ruby django for python

174948
perl	php
if not is there a reason why these languages are often used within a framework while perl and php are not

174958
.war	jar
however only the application components within that .war or ear will use the new jar which may be a problem or an advantage depending on how you ve set up your deployment

174959
eruby	erb
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb

174965
python	php
python wasn t designed like php was for example as a direct web scripting-language .so common web-ish things like connecting to databases isn t native and frameworks are handy

174970
environment	building
but as with most development environment your productivity will increase exponentially if you have a supported framework to reference and building your applications on

174979
perl	php
the most plausible thing i can think of is that perl and php were developed before the notion of using frameworks for web apps became popular

174979
python	ruby
ruby and python became popular after frameworks became popular hence they developed together

174990
perl	php
in php there are definitely frameworks that get used like cakephp and in perl there are many as well like mason and catalyst

174995
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop and visual-studio will both work

175008
perl	php	ruby-on-rails	codeigniter	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	symfony	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
i don t know too much about ruby-on-rails or perl frameworks but php frameworks such as zend symfony codeigniter cakephp etc are used widely

175013
ruby	php
in ruby you have .erb templates that can be used in a similar way as you use php pages

175013
python	ruby
you can write a site in ruby or python using several technologies rails-like frameworks templates or even talking directly with the http libs and building the page cgi-style

175013
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	ruby-on-rails	django
web-frameworks like python django or ruby s ruby-on-rails there are many just raise the level of abstraction from the php s or asp s and automate several process like login database integration rest api s which is always a good thing

175068
attributes	properties
the only situation where listener can be identified is .when it was added through setting a properties or an attributes on the elements - checked on onxxx properties or attributes

175081
.when	ready
only commit to the trunk .when ready for deployment to the development-environment

175101
celementtree	elementtree
the implementation seems to work with both elementtree and celementtree

175109
any	set
i found that this can be set up in the xml-configuration file by reading the manual but it didn t give me any hints about programmatically adding these

175115
hide	show
i got the tips to show .when you stop and hide if you move

175129
put	get
i want to put that sql cmd dump text into this email .when i get a sqlexception which will save me the time of digging through trace logs .when a page blows up because of a query

175137
hostname	router
hence the first gig-e ports on a router will quite often have a hostname that include ge0 or similar

175138
triggers	insert
you could also apply a triggers to one table to get the effect of a single insert

175138
triggers	insert
however it s ultimately still two statements and you probably don t want to run the triggers for every insert

175147
aggregate	grouping
i typically find that .when doing calculations that reduce the size of the return from the db grouping and aggregate that it is much more effective to do it in the db

175160
triggers	insert
you might create a view selected the column named required by your insert statement add an instead of insert triggers and insert-into this view

175164
javascript	dom
if you want the div to become a real pop-up open a pop-up windows then remove your div content from the main document and append it to the pop-up windows document you way have to clone it because javascript may not like passing around dom nodes between different document

175186
contains	set
.so checked if it is in there is easy enough contains and adding to the set is easy too

175205
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in ie and firefox this will make anchor unclickable but in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari this does nothing

175206
value	field	getter	setter
if i have 7-10 parameters in one routine i look at bundling them into a new class but not if that class would be nothing but a bunch of field with getter and setter - the new class has to do something other than shuffle value in and out

175211
contains	set
since a set can only contains one instances of an object as defined by its equals and hashcode methods just remove it and then add it

175228
getter	setter
is it ever appropriate to abandon the getmyvalue and setmyvalue pattern of getter and setter if alternative function named make the api more obvious

175228
hide	show
in brief is it better to have a single setvisible bool methods or a pair of show and hide methodss

175233
hide	show
in the example you gave show and hide make a lot of sense at least to me

175239
hide	show
implicit the show and hide functions you list are both setter

175266
getter	setter
in general i think setter getter should only set the value of properties

175266
updating	updates	getter	setter
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and updates the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the properties

175267
hide	show
i prefer the show and hide methods because they explicit tell what you are going

175267
hide	show
plus show and hide are better-named methods for an interface imho

175272
disassembly	native-code
but if you don t have the original compiled code depending upon how you compiled the code you if you used p-code rather than native-code you may be able to disassembly but the disassembly will look nothing like your source code

175280
hide	show
if switching misvisible really turns visibility of the object on and off immediately than use the show hide scenario

175290
triggers	insert
before being able to do a multitable insert in oracle you could use a trick involving an insert-into a view that had an instead of triggers defined on it to perform the insert

175296
revision	updates
updates i have noticed that the tortoisesvn dialog says to merge all revision leave the box empty. .

175307
cvs	git
svn cvs git mecruial anything that doesn t lock files and doesn t leave your source in a proprietary file systemd

175317
contains	elements	contains	set
contains will very probably go wrong .when you have a hashset implementation of set as the hashset uses the hashcode of object to locate the bucket a numbers which has nothing to do with business-logic and only equals the elements within that bucket

175325
solaris	vxworks	solaris	minix	solaris	unix	solaris	aix	vxworks	minix	vxworks	qnx	minix	aix	unix	aix
probably the one that will get you farthest is pthreads after all every unix like systemd tries to support at least some pthreads the more the better very little can call themselves really being 100 pthreads-compliant platform a ux aix hp-ux irix mac os x 10.5 minix qnx solaris unixware vxworks .

175325
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	netbsd	linux
however there are quite a couple of platform that offer at least some pthreads support some more some less and some are almost pthreads-compliant freebsd linux netbsd beos openbsd .

175337
hide	show
i would go with the isvisible show hide set

175337
hide	show
show and hide make the side-effects clear

175346
webserver	upload
i d like to set up a webserver where i can upload my xml file or just the data and add it to the server ignoring duplicates entries already on the server

175364
required	checked
we started out with the building numbers being simply increment but that required that the versioning file be checked in for every building and caused conflicts .when merging

175372
kate	kde
i use kate kde advanced text-editor for most of my development including django

175393
hide	show
otoh operations like show and hide can be easily overrides with different implementation without revealing anything about the internal state

175394
google-chrome	firefox
css seems to be easier to standardize across browsers than javascript though that may be changing with the advent of google-chrome s v8 and firefox s upcoming new rendering tool

175422
contains	elements
here s a quick-and-dirty example this example assumes you have an elements 20px high and a background-image contains both the hovered and non-hovered states - one on top of the other .so the image is 40px high

175453
moss	wss
you can in fact points tfs to a different wss or moss server if you want but bear in mind that in tfs2008 the project sites all have to live as

175488
contains	any
could you think of any other rules that a phone-number should not contains

175511
put	get
that said sometimes it s difficult to get around--i have had to go back and edit in the null .when it made sense as a default but i never put it in on the first pass any more

175528
png	gif	.doc	xls
the site will support several file formarts from plain text to office .document .doc xls powerpoint ... videos mpeg avi ... images jpg gif png ... pdf s openoffice.org etc

175528
.doc	xls
each .document need to have a preview of it the good part is that the client wants the following formats to have previews .doc xls powerpoint and pdf

175564
defined	declare
except if you declare them private most likely and omit to defined them

175612
put	get
or is it run in a more batch-file manner - you put in request then get told later if you can have your slot

175654
command-line	cmd
on the command-line represented by a | between two cmd

175676
svnadmin	dump
.so the .solution i came up with is the use the svnadmin dump load functions

175676
.when	ready
the idea is that .when a new versioning of the site is ready to be deployed the code that is checked into my local repository will be dumped to a file that file will then be copy-paste to the server via ssh

175676
revision	svn
the thought is that by using this methods i can ensure that the code that is currently in production is reflective of the most recent revision in the servers svn repo

175686
any	set
i don t think you can make it any easier than using remove add if you are using a set

175787
numeric	nan
only works if the string only contains numeric characters else it returns nan

175802
private-members	private	private-members	data-members	private-members	instances	data-members	private	data-members	instances	instances	private
for instances if any of your private data-members implements dispose you should probably implements dispose as well and call dispose on those private-members in your dispose

175840
triggers	insert
guids are not as used in oracle as in mssql we tend to have a numbers field not null primary key a sequences and a triggers on insert to populate it for every table

175859
contains	any
i would like vba code for outlook 2007 to right-click a messages in any mail view choose a rules to add it to and have the sender email be added to the messages header contains value for that rules

175878
google-chrome	opera
google-chrome looks like a major contender but it s still less than 5 as is opera

175879
swt	rcp
good luck i m no swt rcp guru

175887
version-control	git
i use this second option and then i store each scripting in version-control software - earlier i used subversion now i use git

175887
firebird	mysql
i assume you can find some mysql tool that has the same logging feature like flamerobin does for firebird

175887
versioning	upgrade
in one of database tables i store the versioning numbers of the database structure .so i can upgrade any database easily

175893
google-chrome	safari
well since google-chrome is based off of webkit if you test for safari chances are google-chrome will work as well

175905
safari	opera
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

175924
google-chrome	safari
testing google-chrome and the windows versioning of safari will give you a very good handle on your site s user experience on the mac platform at least if you don t have a mac available for testing

175925
any	set
or better yet -- disable magic-quotes in php-ini and any .htaccess files it may be set in

175955
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
i am currently trying to import a semi-colon delimited text file into a database in c# using oledb where i don t know the types sql-server access oracle mysql postgresql etc. currently i m reading in the file as a database using the jet text reader then creating a prepare insert statement populating the field then commiting at the end

175956
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
therefore for 10_000 sieve-of-eratosthenes can be faster then sieve of atkin

175998
archive	backup
most shops will set up archive logging to tsm .so you only have to take the big backup every week or .so

176009
32-bit	16-bit
however .when powerbuilder was upgrade from 16-bit to 32-bit the menu code stopped working

176043
unsigned	short
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types

176064
google-chrome	firefox
i know with my website targeting technology people i see about a 30 firefox 55 ie 12 google-chrome and the rest are others for my visitor

176069
configuration	environment
you can refer this .post for some good practices managing multiple configuration file environment with pre-build events

176071
safari	opera
highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary

176071
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versioning of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these

176093
subtract	time
i basically draw the line and .when i reach the end i redraw it but this time subtract the line width from y-coordinate

176103
environment	building
as well as a vp for our building environment

176106
enumerator	any
is there any regex or an enumerator object out there that i could use to quickly do this the most efficient way possible

176115
richfaces	icefaces
i ll second richfaces but also points out icefaces which isn t free but is also very nice

176116
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
others firefox opera safari google-chrome if you strive to write standards-compliant html css and javascript what works in either of these browsers will most probably work with the rest

176130
office-interop	excel-interop
downloading the office-interop assemblies from which you will access all of the object properties and methods in excel-interop and the appropriate references to your project

176134
logout	login
another potenial way is to logout and look at the domain listed below username passwd in the login windows

176137
wgs84	utm
does anyone know of a way in java to convert an earth surface positioning from latitude-longitude to utm say in wgs84

176140
filesystems	file-io
unix named pipe appear as a special file in the filesystems and can be accessed with normals file-io cmd including the shell

176143
short	base
long story short is that it is not a completely managed-code base but simply a .net wrapper around their com versioning

176144
safari	opera
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
firefox	safari
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176144
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome comes last because it s .so likely to just work if safari is good to go

176155
gnome	kde	gnome	xfce	xfce	kde
freedesktop.org standards are followed by gnome kde and xfce .so it should work on any distribution

176192
selected	button
there is a next and previous button to navigate through the results gotten for the selected date

176192
getter	setter
my thought was that i could use setter and getter for each common variables

176220
put	get
these users most likely will not be trying to put in text that would get sanitized but by protecting against it you are protecting their users

176225
output	mode
the reason for this mode is that while everything is ok you don t want to be bothered by extra output and certainly if there is a failure you don t want to miss it because of the noise of other output

176258
hide	show
if all you want to do is conditional show or hide a div then you could declare it as an asp panels rendering to html as a div tag and set it s .visible properties

176301
keyboard	mouse
i think it s funny .when you hear people typing away on the keyboard in crime dramas doing photoshop-type stuff that really required a mouse

176308
maven-plugin	cargo
have a look at cargo and its maven-plugin

176309
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
if the webpage are merely hooking up an underlying business-logic-layer or data-access-layer then unit tests working independently of the asp.net state model are faster to developer and run than similar waitin tests

176342
directory	folder
the registry change would cause the search order to start with the current working directory which you could set to the desired folder in a shortcut

176345
maven-plugin	cargo
the cargo maven-plugin is a good way to go if you re doing servlet development and want to deploy the resulting .war for integration-testing

176352
any	set
unit-testing does not generally prove that any given set of functionality works--at least it s not supposed to

176374
sorted	lookup
to lookup a words go to the possibly sorted index and return all the recording numbers for that words

176375
sftp	scp
codeigniter uses scp sftp to upload building into viewmodel over the network

176375
installation	environment	environment	execution
codeigniter uses the ssh if available on target os running in viewmodel or other remote cmd execution facodeigniterlity to triggers installation in the viewmodel environment

176376
put	get
i want to put 3 into a function and get the first value greater than or equals to 3 in this case i would want to get 6

176399
pixels	line
it involves drawing my background to an intermediate graphics2d object using setcomposite to specify how i want to mask the pixels then drawing my line using drawline on top

176399
drawimage	draw
once i have this line i draw it back on top of my original graphics object via drawimage

176402
environment	building
ant building the .war file replace the file paths updates the .war file then deploys to the target environment

176434
contains	any
i typically use methods #1 .so i can put that html any where in a templates file that contains static html

176454
quirks-mode	firefox
i think works fine in firefox is in the quirks-mode rendering only

176459
double	int
the int and double work fine and get stored in the table...but i can t figure out how to get the strings to store.

176465
spaces	output
that being said output buffering might be just a tiny bit faster as the spaces allocated for the input is fairly large by default 40k according to this

176467
installation	upgrade
i was able to upgrade the tfs installation at my company by using these resources

176479
png	gif
i have a image upload form that should take image types png jpeg gif resize it and then save it to a path

176479
png	gif
for .some rea.son i can t get the png file types to work it works fine with jpeg gif and the file is copy-paste .so it looks like it s .something to do with how i m creating the png

176481
teradata	vertica	greenplum	vertica	greenplum	teradata
you may want to look at what companies like teradata netezza greenplum vertica asterdata etc are doing

176481
consistency	rdbms
if you don t need the strict transactionality and consistency guarantees you can get from rdbms it is often far easier to denormalization and not do join

176512
fclose	eof
one particular example i m working on which could be a case all by itself is whether it s necessary to call fclose again .when it returns eof with errno eintr

176516
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
do the standards-compliant engines first webkit safari google-chrome and gecko firefox

176532
svn	rcs
the de-facto open source rcs is subversion svn

176542
activerecord	datamapper
these basic patterns will give you an idea of how to structure your object and the more advanced patterns like activerecord datamapper you ll see how those relate to problem domains beyond where your needs are at the moment

176548
declarative-programming	imperative-programming
in general mixing workflows imperative-programming with rest declarative-programming is very problematic

176555
bazaar	git
examples darcs git mercurial bazaar

176644
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it in google-chrome and firefox as those are the browsers in which i have a javascript con.sole .so i can t guarantee it works in internet-explorer as i ve never per.sonally used it

176644
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding is that this was an ie-only properties that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards .so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped

176669
http-get	put
resource-orientation is about explicit model state data limiting function to predefined verbs with universal semantics in the case of http-get put .post delete and leaving the rest of the process to the client

176677
display	height
if you know the absolute top of value that tool top can have you can create a div that is the height of the content + the highest distance the tooltip will display in

176682
datepart	dateadd
well you could use a lot of dateadd datepart etc but it will be slow if you have a lot of data as it can t really use an index here

176691
constructor	object	deep-copy	object
what s the best way to perform a deep-copy in the constructor of an object that is part of multithreading c++ code

176697
png	gif	png	ico	bmp	gif	bmp	png	bmp	ico	ico	gif
icons in other image-formats ico bmp png gif photoshop psd jpg and more

176700
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the contenteditable properties is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by google-chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2

176700
firefox	safari
edit olliej .so yes the contenteditable attributes in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari

176721
defined	declare
it simply defined a token that classes can use to declare that they are a member of that package

176764
macros	vba
i have an opendocument spreadsheet with macros in starbasic ooobasic that i want to convert into an excel spreadsheet with the starbasic macros translation to vba

176764
macros	vba
while openoffice.org claims to have the ability to translation vba macros to starbasic and back my attempts to have ooo convert these original starbasic macros to vba have all failed

176764
macros	vba
is there any guaranteed way to get these macros move to vba and excel without completely rewriting them

176764
macros	vba
it seems that ooo will only turn starbasic macros to vba if they originated in that form

176770
jsonp	ajax
ajax returns jsonp data

176780
selected	cell
in your spreadsheet selected the range of cell

176814
curly-braces	parentheses
the quick remedy is to make sure your json string has parentheses enclosing the curly-braces

176824
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
solution selected the project.vbp and from the tool sourcesafe menu choose checkout you get a dialog which lets you choose all files you get a checkbox for each and a button for selected all

176830
where-clause	sql
if you have control of the underlying sql you may want to try several union queries instead of one query with several or like line in its where-clause

the documentation for mysql 5.0 numeric types states that the maximum size of a numeric is 64 or 65 digits

177103
ruby	php
as a side note i don t know about ruby but in php you can use phpdoc tags to hint the ide eclipse-pdt about the data types returned by a certain methods

177118
duplicates	contains
the duplicates problem boils down to testing to see if the arrays contains duplicatess in o n time o 1 spaces

177122
python	perl
i asked this about python earlier and i figured it might be good to do it for other languages i m especially curious if there are corollaries to psycho and pyrex for perl

177123
click	mouse
the whole points of asp.net-mvc is to decouple changes to the model from the actual mouse click of the user

177125
.when	ready
of course .when you are ready to export the finished product you ll want to return the settings to a compressed format for the final export. alternately you can put the audio in a separate file swf mp3 etc and load it at runtime

177125
export	report
then export and checked the size report for any large pieces of content that you didn t mean to be export

177126
radix-sort	in-place
this solution works under the assumption you can modify the arrays then uses in-place radix-sort which achieves o n speed

177126

177216
udp	tcp
difference between udp and tcp

177230
contains	lookup
this isn t an area i m an expert in but if you don t have a libs handy that does it for you easily then you might be better of just creating a lookup table map which contains the utf-8 - ascii value

177234
malloc	free
the routines were used as wrapper around malloc and free

177234
malloc	free
.when a buffering of a specific types was allocated we d malloc the memory in blocks if a list of free bufferinging was empty

177234
malloc	free
we al.so maintained a list of the blocks of buffering .so that we could do a simple cleanup by calling free on each of the actual malloc d buffering

177234
put	get	malloc	free
we had replacement routines for malloc and free that did pointer-arithmetic to get the buffering size and then to put the buffering into the free list

177236
stderr	stdout
linux variant .when writing a daemons what are the basic building blocks fork a child and killing the parent closing stdin stdout stderr etc.

177251
environment	building
i m trying to add a standards unit test framework into our building environment

177264
bitarray	bitset
after that they swept through the bitarray once spitting out the phone numbers for entries that had the bitset high

177273
contains	elements
it can get ugly if you also have to find the right versioning of a directory that contains that file elements

177273
command-line	cmd
we have a perl scripting at work that uses this approach to analyze historical changes made to files and we quickly ran out of command-line spaces on windows to actually run the cmd

177280
contains	any
also arrays class does not contains the actually arrays data in any instance-variables but it provides just static utility functions which can be utilized to do sorting and searching in the declare fixed size arrayss

177337
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free
i don t know what your whole environment is but you might consider wrapping the call to malloc realloc free on just the viewmodel .so that you can pass it off to a handler designed for small pool

177342
extjs	flex
i ve been toying with extjs and flex and the development experience is a lot like building a desktop .app only without the fancy drag-and-drop ide s

177346

forms-authentication	security
use in combinations with standards web-config security integrated windows with active-directory or forms-authentication the asp 2 sql-server schema or your own

177363
hash	md5
i ve chosen to go with an md5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose

177369
hash	md5
you could use an elf hash - c code include or some other simple hash-function like that instead of md5 or sha-x

177376
hash	md5
personally i d use md5 if you need to store in text or a 256b 32b hash such as sha256 if you can store in binary in this situation

177386
hash	md5
now whether you d be better off truncation the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

177386
hash	md5
i think i d be more generally confident .when keeping the whole of a hash but md5 has known vulnerabilities which may or may not be a problem for your particular application

177393
versioning	upgrade
this used to work great and then we upgrade versioning of gcc and suddenly started seeing stack overflows

177393
unsigned	zero
- if it has arithmetic types it is initializer to positive or unsigned zero

177450
linked-list	queue	queue	fifo
it is easiest to implements a queue fifo rather than a deque or linked-list

177451
instances	private
if it was strictly private then each instances of the class would get its own versioning optimizer notwithstanding

177468
qpushbutton	qobject
i have other classes that subclassing qpushbutton and qobject respectively but they compile ok

177469
version-control	git
is there a distribute version-control systemd like git or mercurial that can be used as an embedded libs in java applications to implements versioned and synchronizable storage for application data ideally written in pure java and under a permissive license

177534
hoverintent	unbind
hoverintent only bind mousemove .when the cursor enters the active elements and unbind it afterwards

177536
windows-mobile	symbian
i could try building document dom then get all elements and replace their src with some placeholder even but will that work on most mobile browsers opera-mini i suppose the windows-mobile thingy the basic symbian browser from nokia

177557
base-class	inherited
for qmake to work correctly the qobject derived base-class needs to be the first class that is inherited from

177565

177605
arrays	loops
not count the spaces required by the input arrays and its loops

177605
arrays	loops
third loops through the remaining value in the input arrays and do the following for each iterator

177613
associations	model
my account model has the following two associations

177636
any	set
in this case it is easy to set up some sort of readonly state on datamodel which will notify model to ignore any event coming from observed object

177649
keyboard	mouse
take regular break from using the mouse and learn keyboard shortcuts

177680
python	ruby
if she doesn t like ruby then python would probably be my next choice but the documentation can be a little dry in places

177682
python	perl
perl seems like one natrual fit python sounds like a good option

177702
notepad++	scite
for starters give her a text-editor with regex search and replace like notepad++ or scite

177725
value	field
i use a javascript to updates that value and .when posting back the page i want to read the value of that htmlinputhidden field

177725
value	field
the value properties of that htmlinputhidden field is on postback the default-value the value it had .when the page got created not the value reflected through the javascript

177725
value	field
i also tried to register the htmlinputhidden field with scriptmanager.registerhiddenfield page myhtmlimputhiddenfield initialvalue but it still only lets me read the initialvalue even though i through javascript can inspect that the value has changed

177737
radio-button	optgroup	radio-button	checkbox	optgroup	checkbox
they can handle going one level deep if the top level is not selectable see the optgroup elements 1 but beyond that i suggest taking a regular list order or unorder with as much nesting as you need remember sublists go inside list items in their parent list and including a checkbox or radio-button with each selectable list item

177744
automake	gnu
his monitor is show briefly while he is working on the code which in fact is not code at all but a makefile.in produced by gnu automake

177798
mousedown	keydown
otherwise you could also add event listener for appropriate user-interface events keydown mousedown and prevent their default behavior return false or event.returnvalue false

177804
antivirus	mcafee
i am specifically interested in software like mcafee entercept or certain antivirus scanners that patch the kernel

177844
verilog	vhdl
also checkout opencores.org - there are some articles and a lot of open source code in both verilog and vhdl you can learn from

177844
python	ruby	python	java	verilog	vhdl
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#

177863
google-chrome	firefox
that it is to say file with spaces.pdf gets downloading in firefox as file while in google-chrome ie7 ie6 is downloading as file with spaces.pdf

177874
websphere	ibm
i have an ibm websphere mq queue running on windows contains many items of varying priority

177887
private-inheritance	base-class
you could declare the pod types in a base-class then extends that class perhaps with private-inheritance to add your additional functionality

177887
data-members	instances
updates to your updates because an instances of derived_non_pod can also be treated as a base_pod therefore the offset to data-members must be the same

177887
protected	public
it s unlikely to do .so however and making the inherited protected or public would avoid this possible trap

177899
updates	mage
mage updates 1.application -pu 2

177905
domain-object	repository
how to avoid the domain-object needing to call out to a repository or data-access-layer

177908
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php
ruby fapper perl php fapp

177911
any	set
is there any way to set the focus on entering a page the second time

177922
ironpython	ironruby
i don t know why anyone would want to call it wisc as these people are essentially saying we will never ever use vb.net ironpython ironruby f# or any other .net language

177927
put	get
i am currently thinking of doing some base methods with genericss and reflection to get some generics query methods to reduce the duplication issue 2 i will put a prototype up for review later

177930
value	field
if you use logic directly on a bit field it will behave like any other value variables - the logic will be true if it has a value any value and false otherwise

177932
seam	jsf
you don t have to use jsf for seam to be useful

177956
boolean	int
what is the best way to convert an int or null to boolean value in an sql query such that

177960
windows-xp	windows
i have tested it both in windows-xp with mingw with the mysql libs properly transformed in .a libs and in linux the output is from linux pretty much the same than in windows with mingw32

177981
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
i d per.sonally go with either python perl or ruby since all of them have good support for regular expression different encoding and xml although i m not .so sure about ruby in the unicode department

177986
base-class	inherited
edit i ve just tested this on gcc 3.4.4 and actually the warning is upgrade to an error .when getting the offset of a member inherited from a virtual base-class

177987
expression	evaluation
you can have expression evaluation to boolean value but you cannot output them

178003
http	ssl
use ssl http

178023
cappuccino	sproutcore
you could also try sproutcore or cappuccino javascript frameworks

178032
xmldom	xpath
the problems you would need to solve would be serialization of html into valid xml syncing result-of xmldom xpath query with original htmldom

178038
directory	folder
then just have the www working-copy auto-updated or exported if you don t want the .svn directory in the www folder for the www-user by some scripting perhaps as a post-commit hook which then setups permissions accordingly

178055
pointers	stack
reference-type on the other hand have a pointers on stack points to the actual value on the heap string x ello means that the memory block on stack only contains an address points to the actual value on the heap

178083
variables	boolean
to really be thread-safe every access to the boolean needs to be locked by a nslock object from either thread using such a lock also makes volatile obsolete as variables protected by a lock are implicit volatile according to pthreads standards

178095
javascript	dom
be careful about the dom named of the control control.clientid on the client side ie .when you are accessing from javascript as it may change depending where on the page you have declare the control

178107
object-reference	instances
if you create an object with an instances variables being a reference to some object what value would you suggest has this variables before you assign any object-reference to it

178111
revision	svn
but by the looks of things this particular issue has already been corrected in the subtext svn revision 3290

178111
.when	ready
i guess that will be release .when it s ready

178182
blackberry	nokia
this code redirects all request made to files in image folder by nokia symbian iphone and blackberry to a blank image file

178197
boolean	int
it uses boolean value to represent the bits in terms of the api but under the hood i believe it uses an int

178213
python	php	dictionary	arrays
this sounds like the php arrays using named indic is very similar to a python dictionary

178224
python	php	dictionary	arrays
php arrays are actually maps which is equivalent to dictionary in python

178227
data-structures	dictionary
the section about data-structures which also covers dictionary

178239
python	php	dictionary	arrays
to assist future googling these are usually called associativity arrays in php and dictionary in python

178341
bazaar	git
and the base functionality between svn git mercurial bazaar all use essentially identical cmd to commit view diff and .so on

178341
bazaar	git
the small difference in the way git required changes to be explicit added before they re committed as opposed to svn s commit everything policy is conceptually simple and unless i m mistaken not even an issue .when using mercurial or bazaar

178391
execute	declare
you can apply this to me after it s declare but before it s execute

178395
push	pull
edit note mercurials biggest difference i ve noted vs git that makes mercurial harder to use for newbies is mercurials default behavior for push pull is like doing git push --all git-pull --all which can propagate private branches and add lots of confusion especially as .when a new branch turns up mercurial freezes in fear and asks you how to handle it instead of just keeping on trucking as well as the default merge-conflict-resolution tool on mac just clobbering one set of changes blindly

178396
contains	elements
does anyone know if how i can get the master and content pages to contains form elements that work independantly

178414
put	get
and those will get put into powerpoint s for presentation internally and external

178419
base-class	inherited
an example is an archive format with multiple file-list types the list may have an arrays of structures recording or struct within it that changes between the types of list but inherited from a base-class and the complexity of knowing which underlying structure to use goes away

178424
parallels	bootcamp	parallels	vmware
if cross-platform testing is central to your company s business a full size intel-based mac running both os x and windows with parallels bootcamp or vmware for testing may be a better option

178432
directory	folder
make sure your virtual directory or sub folder are set up correctly in iis and didn t change in the deployment

178434
dlopen	dlsym
in c you can work around these by not linking directly to the libs instead you load the libs at runtime using dlopen then find the symbols you are looking for using dlsym and assign it to a global symbols that you can named any way you like and then access it through this global symbols

178439
authentication	login
.so in your example you can have the login controls on the upper right of the master page and then have the authentication logic in the codepages for the master page not your content page

178473
selected	textbox
the meaning of this code is to automatically selected textbox with next tabindex after page postback see little jb s problem

178474
32-bit	64bit
the x86-64 processor implicit zero-extend the 32-bit registers to 64bit .when doing 32-bit operations on eax ebx etc

178474
compatibility	legacy
this is to maintain compatibility with legacy code that expects 32-bit semantics for these registers as i understand it

178474
32-bit	64bit
.so i m afraid that there is no way to do ruby-on-rails on just the lower 32-bit of a 64bit register

178494
wamp	php
i use wamp server which is an excellent way of getting apache mysql and php install and configure without any hassle on windows

178494
wamp	php
one great thing you can do with wamp is add and remove php extensions via a gui pretty much on-the-fly and postgresql is one of them

178503
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
other than that start your worker thread and make it wait on some manualresetevent or autoresetevent

178508
hash	md5
for a more robust checked you could calculate md5 or sha-1 hash with hashbytes on the row contents to give you a difference with a very low probability of collision see this wikipedia article on birthday attacks for a discussion of this problem

178521
widget	button
fhe is generally correct but doesn t account for the widget like spin boxes and button comboboxes that use a different background role in the palette

178525
contains	elements
everyone else has already mentioned that you can only have a single form elements in a given asp.net page and that it would be contains in the master page

178532
typedef	struct
for legacy code reasons the msdn suggestion of replacing typedef with struct is not practical

178535
versioning	upgrade
to building business-objects there is a lot of leg work that needs to be done and this should be tackled by a code generator. i m not using one though as i still want to get a grip of the framework the latest versioning of csla 3.5 cuts down the amount of code in properties and we have upgrade because of this

178546
javascript	dom
it also helps connect the dots between javascript and the dom

178551
floor	ceil
what about ceil and floor

178551
floor	ceil
ceil floor and a numbers of other mathematical and trigonometric

178555
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl	vhdl	hdl
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revision of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-pick most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here .when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

178576
floor	ceil
implements ceil floor and a numbers of other mathematical

178580
debian	linux
we are trying to bind a linux machine debian 4.0 to w2k3 ad

178581
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
however i only have that experience with mysql and postgresql - not with sql-server

178618
licensing	gpl
the other option is to launchd ghostscript which should be free for your needs checked the licensing as they have a few different versioning some gnu some gpl etc. and either use it s built-in printing function or simply convert to postscript and send to the device

178620
digits	zero
note that zero-padding is unnecessary imposes an implicit digits limit to the numberss and required the customer to distinguish between six zero and seven zero .when speaking the numbers

178655
textbox	button
i would bind the background of the textbox instead .so that whatever background brush the user set on the user-controls would flow properties value inherited to the button

178663
silverlight	wpf
microsoft s wpf and silverlight

178730
credentials	account
now i tried to lock the account by providing incorrect credentials see below but this doesn t work either

178762
32-bit	64bit
since i m running 32-bit on a 64bit machine i first load the memory-dump and then

178765
any	set
to preserve any previously set onload functions try this

178778
vb.net	vb6
indeed chr 0 is used to terminate a string if you want a newline character you can use environment.newline in vb.net or vbnewline in vb6

178815
compact-framework	.net
note that the assemblyfileversion attributes is not available under .net compact-framework

178841
markup	mathml
there is no short answer to this but wikipedia has very good coverage of your options including coverage on mathml math markup

178860
codeigniter	cakephp
i m trying to use a microsoft access database for a demo project that i m thinking of doing in either codeigniter or cakephp

178875
callback	methods
this managed class contains an instances of the native class and not only marshalling data like strings in methods call but also converted native callback implements with boost signals to .net events

178907
xsd	xml
if i have a complex xml file is there a cheap or free way to get a rough approximation of an xsd from it

178913
put	get
note the stickeyness - the set 6 12 13 doesn t have a shared elements with 1 2 3 but they get put in the same grouping because of 5 2 6

178921
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but whenever i do the search in ie i get redirected back to index.php

178926
xsd	xml
there are tools that can analyse your xml and provide an xsd

178926
xsd	xml
however note that it can only deduce the xsd from your provided xml .so the xsd may only validation that one file correctly

178926
xsd	xml
once you ve created your xsd you should consider refactoring it against other xml files to ensure it properly fits the format you want to validation

178937
python	php
i choose it because i wanted to move from php to python to have a more object-oriented approch because of the language featrues of python

178948
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net 2.0 webforms unfortunately and i can use jquery if it would be useful for this i have very little experience with it

178952
decimal-point	digits
btw .when i first wrote this i wasn t sure how to insert a decimal-point thus the plus minus digits stuff at the end

178966
arrays	loops
loops in the above example will also pick up any methods properties and prototype which have been added to the arrays and not just your data

178966
arrays	loops
a lot of problems people have with the prototype libs is that their associativity arrayss break because prototype adds a few useful prototype functions to the arrays object and for i in x loops pick up those additional methods

178981
firefox	opera
this test scripting ran fine for me in ie firefox and opera

179002
configuration	logging
logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file without touching the application binary

179010
data-structures	map
i especially want to know how the data-structures map to the problem being solved

179016
contains	any
the above will work as long as the zip filename doesn t contains any spaces

179021
onkeydown	onchange
you can do this in onkeydown and onchange

179023
cryptography	security
there are many many different ways to break the security of a cryptography systemd beyond actually cracking the key which is usually very hard

179024
buildpath	libs
that is if you look at the java buildpath for a java project and click on the libs tab you will see the list of libs used by the project

179099
binary-compatibility	compatibility
but .when you change the interface of a basic component which is used by a lot of other components you have to manually change all referencing project to project compatibility recompile them and change back to binary-compatibility

179107
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it s the absolute worst of the mainstream browsers i try to use firefox with firebug or google-chrome safari to handle most issues

179116
.when	ready
commit your changes to svn svn shared and modify the svn-externals properties in the individual project .when you re ready

179116
.when	ready
advance each tag to later versioning .when ready

179119
windows-xp	windows
it doesn t happen on my windows 2000 desktop at office but it happens on my work windows-xp laptop

179291
file-descriptor	pipe
i m looking to call a subprocess with a file-descriptor opened to a given pipe such that the open call does not hang waiting for the other side of the pipe to receive a connection

179291
python	perl
mechanisms to do this by execute ing through an alternate scripting-language python perl etc or a c wrapper which open tmp foobar.pipe with the o_nonblock flag are obvious

179298
gridview	listview
i just learned this today the bind methods as used with gridview and listview doesn t exist

179299

validation after works great in scenarios where the custom object is contains in bindinglist and set as datasource to a grid

179512
google-chrome	safari
given that google-chrome and safari use webkit has anyone yet found anything that rendering differently on google-chrome than safari

179515
put	get
for example i remember reading that apple put a lot of work in safari to get apple-style fonts rendering there and i doubt google duplicates that effort

179520
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome al.so uses an earlier versioning of webkit than the current safari .so pages should be checked in both browsers

179527
google-chrome	safari
this is probably a good place to note that google-chrome has been added to browsershots .so you don t even need to have it install to test on it and safari

179536
data-structures	tree
of course use appropriate data-structures most probably a b tree or similar

179553
openoffice-calc	spreadsheet
other options include export your grid to a spreadsheet program like excel spreadsheet gear or openoffice-calc which will offer additional functionality

179582
postgresql	rdbms
i m primarily interested in postgresql for this but i was wondering if there is a way in any rdbms to do an insert operation without disabling and re-enabling any foreign key or not null constraints on two tables that refer to each other

en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 0.2.149.30 safari 525.1

179604
python	java	python	c++
many language tools have separate java c# python versioninging - but they have a single c++ versioning that works for c and c++ due to the strong similarities

179611
any	set
let me set the sceen i have never done any substantial systemd software design before due to the fact that all the project i have worked on haven t been at that stage

179614
boost	stl
if an idiomatic answer is important they can always specify c++ c++ with stl c++ with boost etc

179616
buffering	streaming
unwritten buffering data for the streaming

179626
vb.net	vb6
visual-studio offers or at least offered a wizard to do a conversion from vb6 to vb.net which could then be converted to c# with a bit of work possibly helped by #develop s vb.net - c# converter but .when last i used it for anything non-trivial there was a lot of manual work needing to be done .so i suspect you re probably better rewriting or porting by hand if this is a large and or important application

179634
virtual-machine	vmware
unsavvy users might get caught by behavior like vmware s player that changes mac and other ids of the virtual-machine .when you move it presumably in a nod to this kind of issue

179644
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is currently using a slightly older versioning of webkit than safari

179652
value	field

179655
binary-compatibility	compatibility
where i work we tend to ab use no compatibility on most of our project even though it s not really the correct way to do things you should use binary-compatibility

179657
value	field
if you re using annotations i d suggest marking the status if that s the field s named as transient .so that hibernate knows it has to get this value from the database every time

179662
quadtree	octree
then you create a quadtree or octree to hierarchically divide the mesh data

179676
put	get
what is the best way to get a file in this case a .pdf but any file will do from a webresponse and put it into a memorystream

179681
output	mode
the engine also supported multiple output types for the audio and had a client-server mode available

179698
decrement	increment
it doesn t increment or decrement the smart pointers and as such - and more importantly - call to interlockedincrement decrement are avoided which in turns avoids a memory fence and all the things that go with that bus locking cache-invalidation .

179699
google-chrome	safari
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome rendering the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderinging versioning may be different the javascript engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror

179707
any	set
without any coding you can set up intellij to run all tests just the quick ones or just the slow ones

179708

179731
callback	methods
the compiler will figure out from the of object statement how to handle passing the methods off the callback proc

179739

179745
python	perl
i asked this about python and perl earlier

179748
meta-inf	uberjar
per the specifications hibernate or any other jpa provider looks for the persistence.xml file in any meta-inf folder that s on the classpath but i haven t been able to make this work with an uberjar

179749
ironpython	ironruby
i admit i haven t learned ironruby ironpython f# or any other .net language yet but i m seriously considering it just to increase my programming arsenal

179750
constructor	object
you can think of the function keyword as a constructor creating a new object a closure each time

179768
rollback	commit
also does ms-access support db transactional commit and rollback

179771
selected	textbox
the only easy way i know of would be to selected all appliciable textbox and simply set the eventhandler for the click event at the same time but that isn t automatic

179775
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli delivers very effectively on the promise of uniting managed and unmanaged code

179782
swing	awt
if it s a gui .app switching from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick

179789
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
for large ones ie ones beyond just something you and a couple-few people are using you should be looking at a real rdbms like sql-server oracle db2 mysql etc

179805
sql-server-express	sql-server
my recommendation would be to look at sql-server compact which is a no-cost file-based database or better yet sql-server-express which is a no-cost lite versioning of sql-server that will support multiple users and interoperability with sql-server

179813
altera	xilinx
altera and xilinx have simulator building into their free tool sets

179813
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl	verilog	ada	vhdl	ada	vhdl	hdl

sites don t contains a site named site.xml has no named elements .so these

179831
contains	elements
p2 repositories contains a named elements .so they have

179838
filesystems	xfs
extended attributes are supported some filesystems particularly xfs and i think jfs

179843

the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris

179868
debugging	trace
the only answer to this i ve dug up .so far is just that you use the debugging class to generator output that you only see in debugging configuration and trace will remain in a release configuration but that doesn t really answer the question in my head

179868
debugging	trace	instrumentation	trace	instrumentation	debugging
if you re going to instrumentation your code why would you ever use debugging since trace can be turned off without a recompile

179871
configuration	installation
provide installation and configuration service

179879
fieldset	labels
uses fieldset legend labels

179884
debugging	trace
the main difference is the one you indicate debugging is not include in release while trace is

179884
debugging	trace
the intended difference as i understand it is that development teams might use debugging to emit rich descriptive messages that might prove too detailed or revealing for the consumer s of a product while trace is intended to emit the kinds of messages that are more specifically geared toward instrumenting an application

179884
instrumentation	debugging
to answer your last question i can t think of a reason to use debugging to instrumentation a piece of code i intended to release

179925
any	set
index intersection operators resolve the predicates by calculating the set of rows hit by each of the predicatess before any i o is done on the fact table

179946

however if i m not mistake the wizard only migrates vb6 to vb.net

179969
jasper-reports	pentaho
i have looked into jasper-reports and pentaho but i m struggling with implementation of pentaho at the moment

179970

if you re going the pure microsoft route look at .net 3.5 sp1 and linq-to-entities which uses the new ado.net entity-framework

179976
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
difference between source code and executable versioning even vanish if you write your application in a language like perl ruby python etc

179997
perl	ruby
i wrote an order process expert-system see dsl answer as well converted 100k line of customer specific perl into about 10k line of ruby handling dozens of customers

179999
font-size	width
since you know your view size call nsstring s sizewithfont forwidth linebreakmode starting with your minimum font-size the width of your view and uilinebreakmodewordwrap
