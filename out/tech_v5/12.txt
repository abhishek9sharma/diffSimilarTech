120140
checkstyle	ant	eclipse-plugin	ant
on the other hand i think .so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have .some things standardised at design-time instead of building time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse-plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins

120140
installation	building
on balance i think that if there are not too many chances of a religious .war you should standardise on the basic set of develop tools and plugins and ensure versioning compliance in your building scripting for example by explicit specifying the java versioning .i don t think that there is much benefit to storing the jdk and the eclipse installation in source control

120194
execution	jobs

the actual test cases are created with junit dbunit and easymock

120530
parallels	vmware
from my experience of parallels and vmware on the pc and more extensively on the mac the difference between any 2 competing versioning of the software is usually quite small and often reversed in the next release

120530
parallels	vmware
if vmware brought out a new release which did something faster you could be sure that parallels would improve their performance in that area in the next release too

120530
parallels	vmware
i have trouble taking parallels vms from the mac to the pc and back again and this worked fine on vmware

120540
compact-framework	.net

instead of changing the versioning manually i would recommend you use an md5 hash of the actual css file

120988
python	c++
there are some libs most often implements in c++ with python binding

121024
data-members	constructor
in c++ there is a concept of constructor s initialization list which is where you can and should call the base-class constructor and where you should also initializer the data-members

121024
data-members	constructor
initializing the data-members in the initialization list by the way is preferable to assign the value for b_ and c_ inside the body of the constructor because you are saving the extra cost of assignment

121054
constructor	object
it can only be called on an arrays object and not on the constructor arrays itself

121094

i don t see any obvious reason for this - either of aforementioned construct should get you something semantics equivalent to this with a very cheap index lookup

121099
any	set
edit it s a bug in the component draw always uses the highscoresmoduletext properties on page which is only set .when the page is a highscorestextpage and not any of the other pages eg highscorestablepage which showhighssores sets it to

121130
children	nodes
as the user expands nodes load children just in time

121130
children	nodes
helpful hint from keith with the winforms treeview you need to have at least one child nodes or it won t show the expand + but then you handle the treenodesexpanded event to remove that dummy nodes and populate the children

121145
webserver	security
use iis s directory security ip-address restrictions and limit access to just that internal webserver ip-address

121154
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
i don t know of any keyboards like that but what might help is a keyboard with a built-in touchpad like for a laptop that you can use instead of your other mouse for some of your mousing small adjustments quick taps to click etc to avoid having to go out to the mouse

121178
keyboard	mouse
i m left handed .so my mouse is quite close to the keyboard

121178
keyboard	mouse
if you re having trouble with your mouse being too far out to the right you could try a small footprint keyboard such as a happy hacking keyboard and a separate numeric pad on the left or somewhere else to get a more clement key layout

121191
keyboard	mouse
my mouse usage is minimal though because i focus on using the keyboard for everything

121205

example a mono server application is running and i want to send cmd to it using the command-line in the lightest fastest way possible causing the server to send back a response to stdout

121482
python	ruby	python	java
by definition statically typed languages like java and c# are strongly typed but .so are many popular dynamic-languages like ruby and python

121485

i heard someone say in an interview i think it was anders hejlsberg of c# and turbo-pascal fame that strong-typing is not something that s on or off some languages have a stronger types systemd than others

121507
children	tree
i load the initial tree root + children + grandchildren deep

121545

my environment jsf 1.2 myfaces tomcat tomahawk richfaces

121611
pecl	pear
if you re just trying to make something that works go with pear pecl

121611
pecl	pear
once you understand the innards of whatever you re trying to replace you may want to switching to the pear pecl versioning .so that you re not wasting time reimplementing what has already been implemented.

121619
directory	folder
unc shared folder and no replication has many downsides especially if iis is going to use unc paths as home directory for sites

121722
selected	cell
on a related note does anyone know if there is a better way of selected the cell in the row

121731
python	ruby	erlang	python
i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby

121736
paint.net	photoshop	photoshop	layer

121765
configuration	installation
installation configuration monitor

121765
administration	account
but it would be great to have a resource with administration capability that does more than setup configure sites but the ftp account email account disk quota management etc

121790
linux	unix
you can use iostat on linux unix to get some feedback on the i o and there s iotop too though it s not packaged in many distros yet

121873
aggregate-functions	analytic-functions
as you process it you partition the dataset according to certain criterion and then for each row looks at some windows default to the first value in the partition to the current row - that default is also the most efficient and can compute value using a numbers of analytic-functions the list of which is very similar to the aggregate-functions

121882
cassini	iis
the first one works because cassini is handling all request the second one doesn t work because iis is looking for that directory and it doesn t exist instead of the .net running the code you have

121886
aggregate-functions	sum
sql-server does not have a product aggregate-functions .so this was accomplished using a sum of the logarithm using the log10 function of each value

121886
negative-number	zero
the main drawback was that all numbers in the column had to be positive and non-zero you cannot calculate a logarithm on a negative-number or zero

121892
shell	tcsh
according to the manpage of tcsh non-login shell inherited the terminate behavior from their parent

in css identifier including elements named classes and ids in selectors can contains only the characters a-z0-9 and iso 10646 characters u+00a1 and higher plus the hyphen - and the underscore.js _

122268
contains	any
identifier can also contains escaped characters and any iso 10646 character as a numeric code see next item

122268
digits	zero
in this case the backslash is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits 0..9a..f which stand for the iso 10646 iso10646 character with that numbers which must not be zero

122276
dev-null	stdin
my first non-working attempt was to fork off sudo -s true with stdin closed or reading from dev-null

122276
stdin	pipe
one thing i know doesn t work is to close stdin or attach it to a pipe before running sudo -s true

122277
python	perl
i switched from perl to python about a year ago and haven t looked back

depending on how your database is setup you could have each checkboxlist databound

122377
virtualenv	distutils
setuptools distutils will work for installation and your program may be running in a virtualenv where your pythonpath is completely user-local .so it shouldn t assume use of the systemd site-packages directly either

122391
sql-server	oracle
i don t know about oracle but i know that the old syntax is being deprecated in sql-server and will disappear eventually

122391
sql-server	oracle
and again i don t know oracle specifically but i know the sql-server versioning of the old styles left join is flawed even in sql-server 2000 and gives inconsistent results .sometimes a left join .sometimes a cross-join .so it should never be used

122401
user-interface	look-and-feel
krypton gives me the power to create shrink wrapped software with office 2007 user-interface look-and-feel with consistency far beyond any other toolkit i tried

for a while it was using mysql but after porting the entire project over from perl to erlang i decided to go for the gold and migrate all of the data into couchdb and use that instead

122447
strategy-pattern	command-pattern
this is a combinations of command-pattern and strategy-pattern

122468
versioning	upgrade
the database was created by or upgrade by versioning 10.4

122571
jndi	jdbc
edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations

122573
versioning	upgrade
decide upon a versioning and don t touch it until you re ready to upgrade to a newer versioning

122583
32-bit	64bit
compile in 32-bit and use wow64 there is another dependency that required us to compile in 64bit even though we don t use any 64bit functionality

122614
www-mechanize	lwp
perl s lwp and www-mechanize modules do this very well but i m working with a .net project

122630
gentoo	linux
i can t say anything about 4.3.2 but my laptop is a gentoo linux systemd built with gcc 4.3. 0 1 depending on .when each package was built and i haven t seen any problems

122681

122728
where-clause	sql
now i m thinking i m leaving query in pl sql and sending where-clause with function-parameter

122736
bind-variables	procedure
can i generator the plan used for this query by referencing the procedure somehow or do i have to copy and paste the query and create bind-variables for the input parameters

122739
error-handling	try-catch
we are using sql 2005 and the try-catch functionality to handle all of our error-handling within the db

122739
.net	wcf
we are currently working on deploying a .net clr function to make some wcf call in the db

122741
constructor	object
basically i knew the random bit was the problem .so i ripped that out to a delegation which would then be passed to the object constructor

122752
linux	unix
assume i m primarily interested in unix linux including macos x but i wouldn t automatically ignore windows-only solutions

122811
virtualbox	vmware
an alternative though more effort would be to use something like virtualbox or the free versioning of vmware and run a light-weight linux-distro where you could use the loopback mounting feature and expose it via samba as a windows-share

122840
haskell	ocaml
makes certain things harder than it has to be but that s not something you re going to miss unless you re coming from nemerle ocaml haskell or something along those line

122841
global-assembly-cache	gac
the application required that assembly stdole versioning 7.0.3300.0 be install in the global-assembly-cache gac first

122858
httphandler	httpmodule
i was looking at httpmodule and httphandler .when i had used webclient.downloadfile in the past

122894
linked-list	nodes
the time-complexity for the insert at the end depends if you have the location of the last nodes if you do it would be o 1 other wise you will have to search through the linked-list and the time-complexity would jump to o n

122911
strncpy	strcpy
also use strncpy instead of strcpy to avoid buffering overruns

122947
subclassing	superclass
there s the superclass product with two subclassing productx and producty

122947
subclassing	superclass
join superclass instances to subclassing instances

122947
python	java
java programmers use ibatis or hibernate or toplink or cocoon python programmers use sqlalchemy or sqlobject

122954
value	field
if it is change the value and remove the end time field if it isn t do nothing

122954
perl	php
any suggestions for improvements or better methods would be greatly appreciated preferably in php or perl

122981
fopen	fread
i think you ll need on the provider to send the data be sure to fflush and then on the requester use fopen fread to read an expected amount of data .so you can drop the connection to the provider and continue

123002
constructor	object
now before i started using an inversion-of-control containers i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectettings object for each of the object that required more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size

123010
contains	any
the string used for named must not contains any punctuation and cannot begin with a numbers

123011
malloc	free
overrides malloc free and new delete with wrapper that keep tracking of how big the allocation are and by recording the callstack and later resolving it against the symbols table where they are made from

123019
sequences	subset
assume that the sequences is not related to the positioning in the arrays but instead that the object are a subset of a larger set of object and the sequences positioning is related to the database sql filtering

123029
protected	public
one drawback of an interfce in .net 2.0 at least is that you cannot have private-members or protected it must be public

123030
abstract-class	subclassing
i m more likely to building an abstract-class if i think there should be a creational contract specifically that a specific types of constructor should always be supported by subclassing

123030
abstract-class	subclassing
then the abstract-class is a base implementation of a behavior which all concrete subclassing can take advantage of without having to reimplement

123034
cryptography	security
first rules of cryptography and passwd storage is don t invent it yourself but if you must here is the absolute minimum you must do to have any semblance of security

123037
hide	show
i ve had to work with divs and iframes .when creating a javascript menu that should show overtop dropdown boxes and listbox -- other menu implementation just hide these items whose default behavior in ie6 is to show on top of any div no matter the z-index

123041
contains	any
interfaces required any class that implements them to contains the methods defined in the interface

123044
click	mouse
if you prefer closing a tab windows over hitting the back button then by all means click links with your middle mouse button

123053
abstract-base-class	abstract-methods
quite often they themselves already provide some basic functionality and the subclassing have to provide their own implementation of the abstract-methods those are the methods which aren t implements in the abstract-base-class

123053
abstract-class	base-class	abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	base-class
using an abstract-class as an interface is possible because every base-class by definition defined an interface that all of its subclassinging should honor it should be possible to use a subclassing instead of a base-class

123076
metaphone	soundex
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

123077
pyinstaller	py2app
there s bbfreeze and pyinstaller and py2app also

123125
environment	building
i d look into some sort of automated building styles environment for lamp where you have scripting that package and prepare your release for each environment

123125
any	set
i recognize there is no actual building for php but you could set up automation to change any configuration or setup issues and save everything off to a folder ready to be implements

123144
any	set
in the callback the properties on my server control which were previously set inorder to display the data are not set yet any of the other standards controls on the page still have their properties settings

123176
lightbox	thickbox
i believe some javascript calendar and some lightbox thickbox code does this if you are looking for examples

123180

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
ideally something that will work with oracle ms sql-server mysql and posgress

123240
visual-foxpro	vb6
in comparison i ve used vb6 ms vc++ from a long time ago foxpro windows and visual-foxpro and a very small smattering of vs2005 c#

123244
abstract-class	subclassing	implements	extends
an abstract-class in java is that a subclassing cannot extends multiple base classes but it can implements multiple interfaces

123267
callback	methods
callback are generally run in the order they are defined with the exception-handling of callback defined as methods on the model which are called last

123277
web-services	api	geocoding	geocode

123298
nested	order
this will generator a nested xml document with the order inside the customers

123301
identity-column	sql-server
we have a systemd which generator int32 value using an identity-column from sql-server and are limited by an in-production client api that overflows our int32 ids to ushorts

123301
value	field
what we have available to solve this problem is a single signed byte field that is echoed to us and gives us 127 value to play with really 117 because we re using 0-9 for something else

123301
value	field
clarification its not that the ushort ceiling is the greatest problem its that the client api uses a ushort .so i cannot combine the byte field on the client to get bigger value the client api is non-upgradeable but will eventually phase out of existence

123307
elementtree	lxml
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml

123311
postgresql	oracle
cl-rdbms which supports oracle postgresql through postmodern and sqlite3

the lightbox display of the original larger sized images in a modal box is handled in javascript with a libs such as thickbox

123387
response	timeout
if not after a timeout the connection is closed with a no-data response

123387
response	timeout
second about half the time the client timeout without any response from the server the client timeout is five minutes longer than the server s

123401
hide	show
using jquery how do you bind a click event to a table cell below class expand that will change the image src which is in the click cell - original will be plus.gif alternating with minus.gif and hide show the row immediately below it based on whether that row has a class of hide

123401
hide	show
show it if it has a class of hide and hide if it does not have a class of hide

123410
common-lisp	lisp
if you mean common-lisp by lisp then there s cl-rdbms

123410
postgresql	oracle
it is heavily tested on postgresql uses postmodern as the backend .lib it has a toy sqlite backend and it also has an oci based oracle backend

123421
oracle	mysql
ordinarily i would look to see this entirely within an open-source license-free environment like a php mysql apache server environment however strict it approvals process have limited the areas of exploration to oracle as the db component with java then making the likely programming environment

123421
checkout	payment
e-commerce styles checkout systemd no payment methods or infrastructure required

123482
project-management	project
a whiteboard cork board for each project plus a whole lot of index cards stickies can go a long-long way towards meeting the project-management needs of one or two small project

123485
value	field
in the edit view include another hidden-field for the field you want to monitor but suffix the field named with something like _prev and set the value to the current value of the field you want to monitor

123488
oracle	mysql
seems your question is really a struggle between oracle java and php mysql

123489
value	field
in anything else we get the hex value of the characters in the field

123508
implements	final
and we can easily set a field for the time report which we are thinking of implements .soon .so that the final data will be .so useful for the organization to asses the people for appraisal

123518
hide	show
you don t need the show and hide tags

123549
click	mouse
if this code is called in response to an awt event mouse click button press ... then that s not the problem but if it s still the same thread that started your .app or this code is running off a timer could very well be

123618
hardware	monitor
if it is washed out on their screens then they need better hardware or they need to adjust the brightness contract on their monitor correctly

123623
transactional-memory	message-passing
model threads + shared state actors + message-passing transactional-memory map reduce

123623
erlang	scala

123645
udp	tcp
every tcp udp client on the local network has up to 65535 portss in use except ports 0 and a private ip

123645
32-bit	16-bit
if it was .so easy to just apply a magic translation function upon 32-bit to make 16-bit from it + one extra byte and then just transform it back guess every compression methods in this world would use it as it could no matter what the 32-bit numbers was always compress it down to 24 bit 16-bit + one byte

123647
snmp	mib
you might look into using snmp and the host-resource mib

123648
value	field
do i create another field in the vehicle table that is veh color that holds the text value of what is selected in the drop down in addition to fk atr vehiclecolor

123670
getter	setter
first of all setter and getter are an indication of bad oo

123670
getter	setter
secondly each object you have should be a world in itself--generally if you are going to use setter and getter they should return fairly safe independent object

123670
getter	setter
.so saying should setter and getter return .something immutable doesn t make too much sense

123672
parsing	comma
in this msdn article ms explains how to specify other delimiters besides comma for csv-type export from ssrs 2005 however literals tab characters are stripped by the configuration file parsing and it doesn t appear that ms has provided a workaround

123677
triggers	insert
and remember the triggers is disabled for everyone insert updating or deleting from the table while it is turned off not just for your process .so if it must be done then do it during the hours .when the database is least active and preferably in single user mode

123677
triggers	insert
if you need to do this to import a large amount of data then consider that bulk insert does not fire the triggers

123677
triggers	insert
but then your process after the bulk insert will have to fix up any data-integrity problems you introduce by nor firing the triggers

123701
value	field
you can modify the value of the byte field by manipulating the int32 field and vice-versa

123743
look-and-feel	substance	look-and-feel	nimbus	substance	nimbus
another option is to use substance or nimbus if you want something different from the metal look-and-feel

123743
look-and-feel	substance	look-and-feel	nimbus	substance	nimbus
substance is a separate look-and-feel collections and nimbus is available as of the 6u10 release

123747
postgresql	oracle
however for me the lack of convenience makes oracle s temp-tables virtually useless for me while i use them very intensively in postgresql

123770
contains	elements
if you re going to use a regex to remove xml elements you d better be sure that your input xml doesn t use elements from different namespaces or contains cdata sections whose content you don t want to modify

123770
contains	any
and it won t contains any hidden defects

123773
implements	final
now assume for a second that there are only interfaces in java only interfaces may inherited from each other a class may implements interfaces but all classes are always final .so no class can inherited from any other class

123773
implements	abstract
now other cars implements the car interface as well internally they create an instances of abstractcar and they implements their own move methods by calling move on their internal abstract car

123786
messenger	skype
skype and im clients such as live messenger are also good tools

123792
windows-server	windows-vista
run on windows-vista and windows-server 2003

123822
histogram	plot
supposing you are testing a range for randomness within int one way to verify this is to create a gajillion well maybe 10 000 or .so random numbers and plot their occurrence on a histogram

123822
gzip	zip
if you were to write a binary file of say 10 000 random numberss from your generator using say a random numbers from 1 to 1024 and try to compress that file using some compression zip gzip etc. then you could compare the two file sizes

123837
project-management	project
i believe in documentation to varying degrees depending on the specific project and the end user .source control and project-management including bug-tracking time management and .so on

123848
wordpress	blogs
if you want to develop against wordpress have a local instances running on your machine .so you can develop themes get blogs and sites laid out etc. and you re running windows on your development machine with iis and sql-server already install what s the best way to do it

123848
windows-server	windows
obviously one could install apache and mysql and do it that way but given what windows affords you methods of running php in iis - i think windows-server 2008 is even optimized for this is that the best way

123855
redmine	trac
i started with trac but i found the mercurial support and the administration interface for everything to be much better in redmine

123874
execution	exit
will cause myclass.dispose to be execute automatically .when execution exit the inner block

123909
keyboard	mouse
try the keyboard shortcut to get to the windows s main menu then hit m for move and hit an arrow key to attach the windows to the mouse - then at the next move of the mouse it should jump to it

123912
getter	setter
typically the member-functions for which you need const and non-const versioning are getter and setter

123972
contains	lookup
they al.so don t contains the date but contains the bug numbers which you d have to go lookup in an archaic systemd to find the date .so nobody does

124065
double	int
3 could be an int a double or a string

124072
variables	boolean
you can set a boolean variables for whether or not the server connection has succeeded and checked it in your exception-handling handler like .so

124077
javascript	dom
on the client side in the iframe you could use some javascript code to access the outer page s dom and set the visibility of it there

124108
web-services	api
i am trying to mockups an api and am using separate apps within django to represent different web-services

124109
buffering	capture
if you need to capture this output in a variables you can do that with the output buffering functions

124156
javascript	dom
you basically add an elements that appears somehow on the page for example the popup on stack overflow .when you earn a badge with an appropriate messages then remove this with some javascript that runs as soon as the page is loaded and i mean the dom not the whole page

124171
python	perl
i d be very grateful if you could compare the winning o√¢ rourke s perl solution to lundh s python solution as i don t know perl good enough to understand what s going on there

124177
http	ssl
the only way to do this is to use ssl tls http

124181
settimeout	fadeout
or use jquery and wrap a fadeout call in settimeout

124187
http	ssl
for example if you want to protect the parameters sent by your java .app to your server from an attacker who has access to the communication channel you should consider communication with the server via tls ssl http in your case and the likes

124190
boolean	int
create a boolean that indicates whether or not your int is valid or create a new types that wrap the boolean and int together

124197
synonym	term
thesaurus based approaches index into a thesaurus for each term that the user has used and then use some heuristics to filtering the synonym to show the user as possible search terms

124203
linux	unix
java will also offer the whole write once run everywhere thing and open up a path to doing unix linux server based integration project

124209
instances	private
the private methods has the undesirable properties that it returns a non-const z for a const instances which is why it s private

124226
udp	tcp	modbus	udp
modbus rtu over tcp udp and com-port

124242
unpivot	pivot
the pivot unpivot operators have been a big win for me

124248
aes	rsa
.so for instances you d use a secure random numbers generator to generator a 128bit random key for aes and encrypt those 16 bytes with rsa

124248
aes	rsa
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
aes	rsa
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more .so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
aes	rsa
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

124255
difference	factors
there are .so many factors that it s hard to say what s the exact difference

124255
python	perl
python regular expressionengine is a custom one and not as much used as the perl one

124262
arrays	loops
fetching an arrays with mysql_fetch_arrays lets you loops through the result set via either a foreach loops or a for-loops

124277
delphi	c++
the project s been abandoned for a while in my opinion using delphi to develop a c++ ide is a very stupid thing to do to draw developers attention however there s nothing that stops you from using it and updating the versioning of mingw s gcc it uses to the latest one - besides it s gpl-licensed

124285
assign	add
i prefer to use object for collections of data instead of arrayss since it organizes the data a little better and i know i m a lot less likely to try to add arbitrary properties to an object than i am to try to add an index to an arrays for the first few years i used php i thought you couldn t just assign arbitrary properties to an object .so it s ingrained to not do that

lan	vpn
i connect to my corporate lan using vpn from the main os the hosts but my viewmodel s aren t seeing the servers in the corporate lan

124384
derived-class	base-class
downcasting makes sense if you have an object of derived-class but it s referenced by a reference of base-class types and for some reason you want it back to be referenced by a derived-class types reference

124384
downcasting	upcasting
in other words you can downcasting to reverse the effect of previous upcasting

124384
derived-class	base-class
but you can t have an object of base-class referenced by a reference of a derived-class types

124426
credentials	security

simple directmedia layer is a cross-platform multimedia libs designed to provide low-level access to audio keyboard mouse joystick 3d hardware via opengl and 2d video framebuffer

124429
derived-class	base-class
in general it shouldn t be possible to convert a base-class instances into a derived-class instances

124429
derived-class	base-class
if the derived-class functionality applies to all instances of the base-class then it should either be rolled up into the base-class or pulled into a new class that is not part of the base-class hierarchy

124452
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have done this previously not with asp.net-mvc but with pure asp.net webforms

any	set
namespaces can have any numbers of dots in them but sql identifier can t unless the parts are explicit set apart by square brackets

124533
constructor	object
you d need to declare a new object of types function with the function constructor assign a variables an anonymous-function etc. and copy over any properties of methods from your old object

124536
perl	awk
i don t think you can - it s not an arrays it s an associativity arrays like a perl hash or an awk arrays

124550
linux	unix
they are similar to .so files in linux unix

124550
updating	updates
a dll can be updates individually without updating the exe itself

124591
subclassing	inherited
the way to prevent implementation inherited is in the programming language since the beginning you should use the final keyword on the class declaration and this way you are prohibiting subclassing

124604
python	perl
coming from a perl 5 background what are the advantages of moving to perl 6 or python

124612
python	perl
perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expression

124661
execution	restart
note you may have to restart visual-studio after execution these step inorder to make them effective

124662
value	field
if your prepare-like function simply replace 1 with the equivalent arguments you might try having your query contains .something like 1 .so that if 1 is-empty it re.solves to which will not cause a parsing error however it may cause undesirable behavior if that field can have blank value -- although if it s an int this isn t a problem

124679
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
do you know a dynamic-languages like perl python ruby groovy

124679
low-level	hardware
what c is best at in my opinion is low-level programming that involves hardware access hefty math and highly efficient algorithms

124683
.when	ready
if you look at ms ado.net you will see a similar focus on keeping connections open for a short time -- they have a whole offline model for updating data disconnect and then applying to a database .when you are ready

124689
wxwidgets	mfc
on c++ your only other alternatives are mfc and wxwidgets

124694
any	set
.when i set up my own repository i used visualsvn which took 2 secs to run and didn t involve any apache or lamp stuff

124722
any	set
modify the controllers to set a flag .when the model is updates and not react to any events from the model if this flag is set

124722
gtk	swt
just for the recording i ve had this problem with several gui toolkits including gtk qt and swt .so i think it s pretty toolkit-agnostic

124727
firebird	mysql
i ve only used it with mysql but it claims firebird support

124768
sniffing	packets	sniffing	traffic	traffic	packets
.so if you plug a machine with a packets sniffer into the switching it will only be able to see traffic to and from the sniffing machine

there is no advantage to be gained by switching from perl to python

124797
python	perl
there is also no advantage to be gained by switching from python to perl

124798
python	ruby	erlang	python
a language like python ruby or erlang will really expand your horizons as a programmer

124804
python	perl
i like perl a lot but as soon as i learned enough python to get it i never turned back

124804
python	perl
in my experience random snippets of python tend to be more readable than random snippets of perl

124804
python	perl
the difference really comes down to the culture around each language where perl users often appreciate cleverness while python users more often prefer clarity

124804
python	perl
that s not to say you can t have clear perl or devious python but those are much less common

124804
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
i personally lean toward python if for no other reason in that it seems to be gaining momentum while perl seems to be losing users to python and ruby

124817
http-headers	content-type
for this to work from a webserver you will need to set the http-headers content-type application ms-word and

124818
bazaar	git
it is also do able in git but it s more intuitive in bazaar imho

124822
sequences	unique
create sequences which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generator unique numberss .when selected from as opposed to serial which generator the unique numbers .when the row is insert

124830
traffic	packets
for watching local network traffic your best bet with a decent switching is to set your switching to route all packets out a specific interface as well as whatever interface it would normally send

124830
traffic	packets
on a 100 megabit network however you ll want a gigabit ports on your switching to plug it into or to filtering on protocols trim out http ftp printing traffic from the fileserver etc. or your switching s buffering are going to fill up pretty much instantly and it ll start dropping whatever packets it needs to and your network performance will die

124835
cvs	git
you can do this with most systemd cvs svn git and .so on

124842
python	ruby
maybe f# for example or give ruby or python a try

124844

edit the rea.son i want to selected the image is actually not .so that it appears highlight but .so that i can then copy the selecteded image to the clipboard using xpcom

124857
instances	private
making operators new private effectively prevents code outside the class from using new to create an instances of x

124861
value	field
if you honestly have more than 64 value in a single field your field might be getting more complicated

124861
binary	hex	decimal	hex	value	field
using this you can create an arbitrary numbers of bit field that mysql is happy to treat as binary hex or decimal value however you need

124896
put	get
rest required you to defined resources named via uri s and transactional based on the canonical crud rules get .post put and delete

124903
constructor	private	constructor	object
you could make the constructor private then provide a public static factory-method to create the object

124904
constructor	private
one way you could do this would be to make the constructor private and only allow construction through a static methods that returns a pointers

124912
ole-automation	com
if you want the easy way out to work with the files though make sure your software runs on a windows machine with words install then use com ole-automation to open and manipulate the document

124930
put	get
can t you just get the image data and put it on the clipboard directly

124944
lighttpd	apache
if iis doesn t fit your requirements you should choose another webserver such as apache with mod_mono or lighttpd

the deploy phase would checked versioning on each server and determine which servers needed upgrade

124956
ubuntu	debian
if i had a choice i d go with a systemd like debian or ubuntu and set up a repository that the systemdd could all pull from

124981
network-programming	raw-sockets
also consult chapter 25 raw-sockets of steven s unix network-programming

125001
row	col
the worksheet data is a dictionary where the key are row col pairs starting with 0 and the value are the cell contents -- generally int float or string

125011
constructor	object
c in your constructor for this object have a synchronized run-once call to this function similar to a singleton pattern

125030
subtraction	addition	exponential	inverse
a logarithmic function is simply the inverse of an exponential function in the same sense that subtraction is the inverse of addition

125030
digits	base
a quick-and-dirty emphasis on dirty interpretation of the common base 10 logarithm of some numbers x is that it is one less than the numbers of decimal digits required to express numberss the size of x

125065
arrays	loops
also implements the seekableiterator interface would let you loops through your object just like an arrays

125111
scala	java
if you were using scala there is scala checked - but i am not sure how well it works with java source even though its all byte code

125128
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the properties are gecko-only firefox mozilla camino the properties are webkit-only google-chrome safari epiphany

125130
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the -moz ones are firefox specific the -webkit ones are for safari google-chrome and a few other browsers that use that rendering engine

125131
firefox	safari
those are for firefox the ones labeled -moz-border and for safari -webkit-border

125133
google-chrome	safari
the -webkit ones will only work in webkit-based browsers like safari google-chrome or webkit

125136
attributes	properties
you could use a metaclass that auto-wraps methods or class attributes that follow a naming conventions into properties shamelessly taken from unifying types and classes in python 2.2

125162
base-class	inherited
single-dispatch also allows for a more limited kind of polymorphism same methods named for object that implements the same interface or inherited the same base-class

125172
exception-handling	try-catch
the real kicker is that often this manifestation of ie6 s invalid arguments exception-handling cannot be protected by try-catch

125179
webrick	thin
you might look at the internals of webrick to see a simple server daemons coded in ruby -- or if you want something more performant look at mongrel or thin

125182
stdin	pipe
if you need more thorough two-way communication open the process with pipe and send stuff to stdin listen on stdout

125187
javascript	dom
keep in mind that and javascript fanciness is messing with the brower s internal dom model of the page and does nothing to the raw html

125188
contains	elements	contains	any
what i m trying to achieve is to determine if the postscript that i m parsing contains any elements that resides in a table box

125209
cos	sin
now draw a triangle with this distance and the wheelbase pencilled in plus some sin and cos equation approximation and you might get an approximate equation like

125224
selected	cell
the easiest way is just to selected a cell

125229
for-loop	arrays
the arrays would be especially useful inside a for-loop which rendering the contents and draw border line

125230
value	field
search for foo and replace with bar .so a recording with a field with the value hello foo becomes hello bar

125256
selenium-ide	selenium
personally i m most familiar with selenium which has support for writing automation scripting in a good numbers of languagues and has more mature tooling such as the excellent selenium-ide extension for firefox which can be used to write and run testcases and can export test scripting to many languages

125268
instances	self
updates it doesn t work you can t return self - it s not an instances

125279
internet-explorer	firefox
lastly if you are interested in looking into a completely different notification paradigms checkout the information bar or notification bar that is implements in firefox and internet-explorer

125292
perl	awk
non bash ways abound awk perl sed and .so on

125303
primitive	boolean	contains	elements	contains	any
al.so perl 6 has both a primitive boolean types and by having true and false roles that any value can mix in .so you can have a 0 but true value or a 1 but false one for example or a false list contains elements or a true list that s empty

125313
python	java
edit i realized that each particular launchd java python etc has its own configuration methods .so i will restrict this question to the java domain which is what i need most

125314
firefox	safari
afaik this methods works in all cases in firefox and safari

125344
modal-dialog	lightbox
the lightbox modal-dialog seems an effective technique in some cases web 2.0 derivation but can be implimented in other contexts

125361
markup	tidy
possible workarounds would be running the source through html tidy or some other cleaner if you re after valid markup

125379
interpreter	runtime
the ability of the interpreter to deduce types and types conversions makes development time faster but it also can provoke runtime failures which you just cannot get in a statically typesd language where you catch them at compile-time

125379
boolean	int
adding an int to a boolean

125379
reflection	runtime
mobile code runtime reflection etc

125380
strong-typing	types
strong-typing prevents mixing operations between mismatched types

125397
web-config	app-config
for sharepoint the app-config is actually named web-config and exists at the root of the sharepoint website

125398
dialog	pop-up
don t pop-up a dialog box announcing an error - do whatever recovery you re going to do anyway or whatever is possible

125417
exception-handling	try-catch
an exception-handling is simply an error conditional in your program detected by a try-catch block

125453
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
i am looking for a repository-pattern implementation example resource that follows domain-driven-design principles for my asp.net-mvc application

125463
abstract	extends
the concreted class that extends the abstract one are responsible for defining control and deciding what do to with the data .when a line is added or deleted from the jtable

125463
abstract	extends
i told myself i could use the same concrete custom jpanel attributespanel which extends the abstract jpanel class i created to store the methods for a class or and interface

125491
put	get
it doesn t get around the one-use typedef unless you put that in a header which is always an option but it makes the resulting code shorter by one iterator

125502
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
domain-driven-design by eric evans is a great place to learn all about the repository-pattern and more

125505
any	set
i don t think you can set any part of the sheet to be editable only by vba but you can do something that has basically the same effect -- you can unprotect the worksheet in vba before you need to make changes

125535
processor	cpu
the interrupt is a physical signals in the processor that tells the cpu to store its current state and jump to interrupt or exception-handling handler code

125535
32-bit	64bit
the clock might be 64bit on a 32-bit machine

125537
associations	model
if author is the actual table named then you ll need a has_one author associations in you .post model and an author model

125548
youtube	flickr
i believe it can also help embed images hosted on flickr and videos from youtube

125566
web-config	app-config
with visual-studio 2005 and newer adding a web reference creates an app-config or web-config for web apps section that has this url

125569
updating	updates
making any change to a row probably takes just as much i o as writing the entire row except of course updating indexed columns al.so required index writes .so you lose out by making several updates which hit lots of rows

125577
connection-pooling	pool
if connection-pooling is enabled the connection is not physically closed but release to the pool and will get reused

125586
cairo	sdl
for example using sdl or cairo if portability is needed

125586
python	ruby
somehow it has become a model of simple graphics language there are several applications trying to mimic process in other languages like ruby scala or python

125586
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
one of the most impressive is a javascript implementation using the canvas component implements in firefox safari opera etc

125605
standard-library	boost
in fact many parts of boost is considered to be include in the next c++ standard-library

125609
versioning	upgrade
we then use home-grown tools to generator the schema upgrade and reference data upgrade scripting that are required to go from versioning x of the database to versioning x + 1

125615
debian-based	ubuntu
both mandriva red hat based and ubuntu debian-based have package for the boost libriaries

125639
updating	updates
it s very hard to make the updates atomicity especially if you have any database updating to do

125640
versioning	upgrade
however at time systemd upgrade often break other programs .when there is a versioning mismatch between the shared dll files and the program that required them

125666
python	php	python	c++
examples in php python c++ preferred but in other languages is fine if the methodology is explained properly

125684
any	set
unfortunately until the release of a security updates on october 12 2004 windows would not enforce this rules allowing an application to set any other application s gwl_userdata

125697
.net	wcf
i just wondering how the .net wcf application caching is implements

125710
any	set
my ultimate goal here is to write a utility that lets me quickly set the folder on any dialog box choosing from a preset list of favorites

125763
boolean	int
now if this is a comparegenerator it really should either return a boolean true or false or a int 0 or 1 lets use the former

125767
click	mouse
and as noted several time already interrupts are usually triggers by outside entities such as hardware or users such as a mouse click or keystroke like ctrl-c while exception-handling are generator throw synchronous by software detection a problem or exceptional conditional

125799
order	add
cons would have to be order not making it easy to add new things in very error prone

125801
python	java
the university of oslo has recently starting teaching python as the default language for all science students outside the department of informatics who still learn java

125804
python	ruby	python	java	haskell	lisp	haskell	fortran	haskell	scheme	haskell	python	scheme	lisp
every programmer should have some experience with a modern jit d oo language c# java a low-level simpler language c fortran etc a very high level interpreted-language python ruby etc and a functional language scheme lisp haskell etc

125806
joystick	keyboard	joystick	mouse	keyboard	mouse
i have actually a fairly similar problem in that i need to be able to capture input for mouse keyboard joystick and i d also like to avoid sdl if at all possible

125806
joystick	keyboard	joystick	mouse	keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
the points is to capture mouse motion keyboard press release mouse click and potentially joystick handling for a game

125816
haskell	lisp
and from the other end i think everyone should know a bit of something like haskell or lisp to get an idea of higher-level stuff and see some of the ideas being introduced in c# 3 in a cleaner form

125833
haskell	python
however i feel that learning lessons from languages like haskell python and even arguably regex not exactly a language but you catch my drift

125843
installation	building
simply said the platform buildinger installation contains all of the public drivers source code and the private libs required to building the os

125852
unification	inference
it s inference which is undecidable as it required higher order unification

125862
put	get
restful basically uses the 5 standards http methods get put .post delete head for controlling accessing content

125863
readline	ncurses
if you re writing a text-mode client then maybe readline or even ncurses could be good alternatives

125872
tic-tac-toe	chess
what you need for tic-tac-toe or a far more difficult game like chess is the minmax or its slightly more complicated variant alpha-beta pruning

125891
solaris	linux
plastic scm is supported on windows linux solaris and mac os x

125952
bin-packing	np-hard
i created an algorithm for this ones it s actually a variant of the np-hard bin-packing problem but with a infinite bin size

125952
arrays	loops
you could write a loops which would look trough the resultmap arrays and look for a false value and than start to see if it remains false in both directions for the size of the image to place

125954
delphi	c++
according to chris pattinson qa manager at codegear they made over 4000 fixed in both delphi and c++ builder 2009 see this blog

126027
arrays	loops
in a real case i wouldnt use timer i would have an arrays or xml object to iterate through with a for-loops regardless it works great and basically once you hit the end of your loops if i length - 1 have it call the functionality that starts the actual preload now that we have our total

126027
for-loop	arrays
now we iterate through the arrays or xml object again but this time we do it only once each assets has loaded not in a for-loop

126056
protected	public
some methods will be left private and tested implicit as part of unit tests for the public protected methods

126062
udp	tcp
gives you the active tcp udp ports

126062
udp	tcp
then you can use the ports with fuser -n tcp or fuser -n udp as root and supposing that fuser is gnu fuser or has similar options

126067
google-chrome	opera
if you want to updates the page in the already opened browser or use a browser of your choice always ie6 instead of opera or google-chrome then you ll have to do some homework but it s still quite easy

126086
contains	any
that isn t guaranteed with the first scheme the url images happy.gif relative to is styles images happy.gif which doesn t contains any versioning information

126087
mime	rfc
this module implements rfc 2047 mime

126088
any	set
because we set the capacity of itemstokeep we don t waste any time copying value during a resize

126116
ftp	ssh
i am trying to create a web servlet to allow ftp users to change their passwd without ssh login access

126125
printf	strcat	printf	strlen	strcat	strlen
use only printf printf and str functions strcat strlen and of course their widechar corespondents wcslen...

126131
javascript	dom
is there any python-module for rendering a html page with javascript and get back a dom object

126149
puts	gets
.so you send it autorelease instead which puts it in the autorelease pool which is emptied once control gets back to the program s event-loop

126151
decrement	increment
if you are actually running into a performance problem i would suggest wrapping the call that add remove properties to from the object with a function that also increment decrement an appropriately named size

126154
textbox	button	display	height
in users view the individual columns of the tablerow have labels to display a recording value and .when users click on edit button the labels are hidden and textbox are display for users to edit value - the problem is - as soon as the textbox are visible the table size increases - the row height and cell size becomes large

126163
any	set
technically the environment.userinteractive checked if the wsf_visible flag is set for the current windows station but is there any other reason where it would return false apart from being run as a non-interactive service

126188
sql-server	oracle
ms sql-server and oracle which one is better in terms of scalability

126196
compact-framework	.net
is it possible to show multiple line of text in grid cell using the .net compact-framework

126199
sql-server	oracle
oracle people will tell you oracle is better sql-server peopele will tell you sql-server is better

126199
sql-server	oracle
you have databases out there that are that size on oracle as well as sql-server

126221
value	field
assuming that you are essentially embedding the contents of a remote form in a frame iframe the you should be able to use some javascript to set value for the field - field.value xxxx

126254
margins	padding
in your css make sure the input has no padding margins border and set width 100 line-height 1em and height 1em

126259
.when	ready
this is not a direct answer but .when i checked last time and i find the language very interesting i didn t find anything ready for real-world

126267
sql-server	oracle
both oracle and sql-server are shared-disk databases .so they are constrained by disk bandwidth for queries that table scan over large volumes of data

126267
sql-server	oracle
shared disk systemd such as oracle real application clusters or clustered sql-server installation still required a shared san which has constrained bandwidth for streaming

126267
sql-server	oracle
imho oracle has better vldb support than sql-server for the following reasons

126267
sql-server	oracle
oracle has better table partition facilities than sql-server

126267
sql-server	oracle
oracle can be run on somewhat larger hardware than sql-server although one can run sql-server on some quite respectably large systemd

126267
sql-server	oracle	sql-server	teradata	teradata	oracle
unless you have truly biblical data volumes and are choosing between oracle and a shared nothing architecture such as teradata you will probably see little practical difference between oracle and sql-server

126300
credentials	account
if the iis server has a secondary token the ntauthority anonymous account credentials are used

126300
authentication	login
the ad cannot verify the passwd and instead authentication by using the ntauthority anonymous login

126311
display	height	display	width
assign the class to both your labels and textbox and you should not get width height changes .when switching control thanks to the display block properties

126315
menuitem	button
this way click both the menuitem and the button will execute the same code and provide the same functionality

126341
glib	gtk
required a running glib and gtk but that s probably less problematic than wrapping the parts of webkit without glib

126345
webserver	nginx
the webserver nginx is configure to look for a file some path image √¢√ø uuid√¢√ø thumbnail_42x42.png and if it does not exist it send the url to the backend django via mod_wsgi which then generator the thumbnail

126350
contains	set
since we potentially have too many combinations of rights to create individual ssas roles for we have implements dynamic dimension security that uses a cube users dimension in conjunction with the customdata item from the connection-string and limits the allowed set of various other dimension members accordingly via other many-to-many dinemsion relationships with measure grouping that contains the rights mapping

126366
stderr	stdout
as you said the solution outlined in this answer is the traditional way of reading both stdout and stderr from a process

126374
any	set
using encapsulation you can defined any set of policies to access the inner private member

126388
hash	md5
one technique is to use a well-known hash algorithm say md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32-bit of the result

126392
put	get
in addition this is the most general solution it scale best in the future as you add more key it is easy to code the sql to get the data out and the database will be able to optimise the query better than you would imagine i wouldn t put effort into prematurely optimising this case unless it was proven to be a bottleneck in testing later on in which case you could consider the next two options below

126417
dictionary	map
using a dictionary you can map almost any input to some other value object function

126423
stderr	stdout
if your use case allows for combining both stdout and stderr of the process in question you need only one thread otherwise two are needed

126445
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
this looks just right in firefox safari and opera

126457
substitution	replace
in the expression s foo bar you actually have a regular expression foo and a substitution bar that should replace what is matched by the expression

126457
expression	evaluation
in the approaches you ve tried thus far you ran into problems trying to use eval mainly because of the likelihood of special characters in the expression that either interfere with eval or get interpolation gobbled up in the process of evaluation

126470
oracle	mysql
some of them support paging like mysql with the limit clause rowid with oracle

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
open to debate unless it is built into the database systemd itself or unless there is a company say abc that uses oracle mysql sql-server and they decide to have all the various database systemdd provide their own implementation of paging by their database developers providing a universal interface for the code that uses it

126473
multiplication	addition
just as addition of the float types is inaccurate multiplication of the decimal typess can be inaccurate or cause inaccuracy if you exceed the precision

126473
numeric	digits
since you multiplied numeric 24 8 and numeric 24 8 and sql-server will only checked the types not the content it probably will try to save the potential 16 non-decimal digits 24 - 8 .when it can t save all 48 digits of precision max is 38

126473
numeric	digits
again between numeric 24 8 and numeric 38 6 sql-server will try to save the potential 32 digits of non-decimals .so a + d reduces to

126481
postgresql	mysql
although trac can be configure to use mysql or postgresql too

126484
perl	php
edited to add in perl systemd vi just works because perl doesn t do the kind of fancy pipelining buffering php does

126486
jquery	dojo
i haven t don t really know about jquery but i do know that the dojo does make highly unobtrusive-javascript possible

126503
contains	any
given that any bug-tracking tool will contains lists of bugs which can be queried in a variety of ways - it s highly unlikely that you can find a tool which does not use some kind of database

126505
toolchain	platform
assuming you re on an embedded platform you might find that your toolchain has a go at this

126507
reflection	runtime
this is similar to what ted elliot suggested but the usage of runtime types handles instead of full types object avoids the overhead of loading the types object through reflection

126526
mstest	nunit
i m using nunit but i had the same issues with mstest

126557
font-size	display
.when i toggle the show computed styles option the font-size is display as 16px firefox s default

126560
rhino-mocks	nmock
consider the various mocking frameworks nmock rhino-mocks etc

126573

is anyone familiar with a service or open-source scripting that can import contact from gmail yahoo mail aol hotmail and other prominent webmail service

126607
prototyping	waterfall
to manage this a numbers of systemd development lifecycle sdlc model have been created waterfall fountain spiral building and fix rapid prototyping incremental and synchronized and stabilize

126632
revision	svn
versioning your css javascript files whenever you deploy something like screen.1233.css the numbers can be your svn revision if you use a versioninging systemd

126710
systemtime	ntpd
i have an application that depends on gpsd and ntpd to accurately set the systemtime on a linux machine

126711
debugging	trace
for more information here is the full debugging trace of the transactional from the invocation show above

126722
superclass	inherited	abstract	super	implements	super	implements	abstract
behavior at these switching points is then either inherited from the superclass overrides to provide new behavior or implements to avoid a compiler error .when the super methods is abstract

126735
key-value	key
in the rare case that you really must implements a key-value table the first .solution is fine although i d generally want to have the key in a separate table .so you aren t storing varchars as the key in your key-value table

126740
return-value	arguments
try to design your functions .so they don t change arguments passed in - this is what you have a return-value for.

126746
credentials	account	credentials	security
the solution is certainly one that include having proper network security at the server and network level to really reduce the numbers of people who can get access to the systemd and having the database credentials only give access to a database account with the bare minimum of permissions required for the application to run

126759
qabstractlistmodel	qtableview
i ve created an implementation of the qabstractlistmodel class in qt-jambi 4.4 and am finding that using the model with a qlistview results in nothing being display however using the model with a qtableview display the data correctly

126771
scheme	lisp
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter

126772
firefox	safari
if the administration hits the reload button in firefox explorer safari everything gets refreshed fine and the new image just appears

126773
common-lisp	scheme
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common-lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

126773
common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common-lisp but what i do know is that common-lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming

126799
quicksort	mergesort
another couple of usual-suspects are quicksort and mergesort

126830
deployment	install
.net comes with deployment project templates that can create install for you fairly easily

126841
mapping	unique
if you are looking for visually similar colors this does quickly distill down to a palette mapping problem where you are looking for say the 256 best unique colors to use to most closely represent the original full dynamic color range image

126870
contains	lookup
i want to lookup a value if the class contains the value then use it and modify a properties of the class

126884
credentials	security	administration	credentials
your database administration will need to actively manage user credentials which may run counter to your company√¢ s security governance policies

126884
credentials	account
in the second approach use seperate credentials for each major business-process order process account hr etc

126917
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
i ve since ditched windows for linux and therefore php python and ruby for webdev

126917
json	xml
writing the data to file as json xml plaintext etc even slower for read ops

126921
data-cleansing	fuzzy
ssis in sql 2005+ enterprise has fuzzy lookup which is designed for just such data-cleansing issues

126924
put	get
you may be able to get fancy and put together a macros that would allow you to selected multiple field and then encapsulate each one but vs macross are not my ball of wax

126926
compact-framework	.net
edit i should have mentioned that this is specifically for .net compact-framework 2.0 which doesn t support assemblyfileversion

126939
constructor	object
and i have the logger object initializer in the constructor of winform

126961
attributes	properties
edit as noted above by pb and nigel hawkins you can get the properties to propogate by using the assemblyfileversion attributes like

126962
spaces	output
if you were to remove those blank spaces it would output correctly

126971
memcached	apc
checkout memcached and apc they re both free and highly performant

126978
python	ruby
should i use a hand-written schema for my projected developed in a high-level language such as python ruby or should i let my orm solution auto-generate it

127017
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work fine in ie okay in firefox and goes nowhere in google-chrome

127017
document	editing
looks like i may just be stuck with downloading editing and re-uploading the document

127024
midp	cldc
blackberry applications can be standards midp apps or cldc apps that make use of the blackberry specific apis

127037
visual-studio	release-mode
do you still see the messages in visual-studio if the application is compiled in release-mode

127040
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
how can i do that in firefox safari and or google-chrome

127165
memcached	apc
if you find one that does chances are they ll have apc enabled and may even be able to provide a mechanism for memcached

127188
mta	sta
can you explain sta and mta in your own words

127197
vbscript	jscript
there s also www.mygenerationsoftware.com but they only advertise support for templates based code generator supporting four templates languages - jscript vbscript c# and vb.net.

127199
lookup	any
i guess it would be possible to hook up some .net code and do a active-directory lookup but are there any alternatives

127213
python	java
that throw out java .net python and many others

127220
constructor	object
in the constructor of an object you can call methods defined in that object or base classes but you cannot expect to call something that will be provided by a derived-class because parts of the derived-class are not construct yet

127233
ienumerator	ienumerable
it does not implements ienumerable but has 2 methods that pass back a ienumerator

127242
git-clone	git-svn
the good news is that git-svn clone does read in svn-mergeinfo properties to construct a better merge history .so if you use svn-merge correctly it required merging full branches then the git-clone will look correct to git users

127258
contains	elements
the query works but if for example the groupname variables contains groupb only one result the first item elements is returned instead of three

127306
reflection	runtime
if you re implying runtime reflection then no

127306
idisposable	ienumerator
it does it all compile-time another lesser known fact is that it also checked to see if the returned object that might implements ienumerator is idisposable

127340
mta	sta
this means mta threads that create apartment object will be marshalling all call to a different thread. the class factory can be called concurrently by multiple sta threads .so it must protect its internal data against this

127340
mta	sta
it will always load in the mta even if created by an sta thread which again means the sta thread s call will be marshalling

127340
mta	sta
they must be written to fit both sets of requirements however they must protect their internal state against concurrent call in case they reload in the mta but must not block in case they reload in an sta

127340
mta	sta
worker threads should use the mta unless they re going to use apartment -marked com components in which case use the sta to avoid marshalling overhead and scalability problems if the same component is called from multiple threads as each thread will have to wait for the component in turn

127340
mta	sta
it s much easier all around if you use a separate com object per thread whether the component is in the sta or mta

127342
lan	wan
according to dave mills article ntp v3 is accurate to 1-2ms in a lan and 10s of ms in wan nets

127363
mime	rfc
i need to create s mime messagess using c# as specified in rfc 2633 s mime versioning 3 messages specifications and rfc 3335

127377
python	java	python	c++
i have seen the books and lists about design-patterns in static object oriented languages java c++ but also the videos about design-patterns in python

127377
forth	lisp
i m interested in to see some common design-patterns in other languages like forth icons lisp etc

127380
revision	svn
conventionally the commit messages of such a commit will contains the svn revision numbers of the second parent commit which you simply translation to the corresponding commit id

127393
contains	elements
in the end removedelements will contains the elements belonging to list1 but not to list2 and addedelements will contains the elements belonging to list2

127393
dictionary	map
the cost of the whole operation is o 4 n since the lookup in the map dictionary may be considered constants

127412
python	java
these are nice but i would like one that allows for many configurable extensions html css javascript vb c# java python ...

127424
credentials	account
set up several phpmyids on different hosting service with the same credentials hash key etc but different domains ideally i d have a round-robin dns and the same named but i also want to account for the case where they have different domains

127450
difference	count
your code can t even tell the difference between count 1 and 1 1

127457
textbox	button
for example i use a hungarian-style prefix for control named such as txt for textbox button for button pic for picturebox lbl for labels etc

127468
derived-class	base-class
g. deleting a pointers to the derived-class by a pointers to its base-class subobject

127477
any	set
in wpf how do you find out if any of your databound controls have validation errors set

127516
protected	public
guideline #4 a base-class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

127520
frame	width	height	frame
.when your frame receives an onsize messages it will give you the new width and height - you can simply call the cedit setwindowpos methods passing it these value

127520
splitter	panels
assume cmypanels is your splitter panels and it contains a cedit you created in oncreate called m_wndedit

127522
variables	boolean
.when you evaluate a variables in boolean context its .true methods gets called

127530
order	add
how do i add the field to a particular column or rearrange the field order

127552
constructor	object
if the class is sufficiently high level that it required more than 4 of these object in the constructor consider breaking it up or at the very least using a factory-pattern

127556
checkbox	listbox
i have a listbox where the items contains checkbox

127556
selected	checkbox	listboxitem	selected
the problem i m having is that .when i click on the checkbox or its content the parent listboxitem does not get selected

127556
selected	checkbox	listboxitem	selected
if i click on the white spaces next to the checkbox the listboxitem does get selected

127556
selected	checkbox
the behavior that i m trying to get is to be able to selected one or many items in the list and use the spacebars to toggle the checkbox on and off

127578
sqrt	sin
in short the formula is 171 - 5.2 ln avev - 0.23 avev g - 16.2 ln aveloc + 50 sin sqrt 2.4 percm

127582
protected	public
in fact i find that it s more common for my interfaces to have protected destructor than it is for them to have public ones

127610
variables	boolean
i have an ssis package which depending on a boolean variables should either go to a scripting task or an email task. note the paths are coming from a scripting task

127617
frame	width	height	frame
you should add onsize handler in your frame class and inside this handler as rob pointed out you ll get width and height of the client area of you frame then you should add the code which adjust size and positioning of your control

127625
constructor	object
takes the object to diff in the constructor and calculates the diff for that

127648
installation	building
depending upon what you re using to building your install you should be able to embed the soap install and run it during installation or else just give both files to your users and tell them to install both - that never killed anybody

127653
perl	php
a unix shell and the handy notepad++ is what i used to use .when i did maintenance work in coldfusion php perl etc

127659
hide	show
you can now call the various object functions such as hide and show

127659
input-field	textbox
you can get hold of the underlying textbox input-field for the calendarextender as follows

127660
ole-automation	com
there are multiple ways you can implements data exchange between excel and .net code in add-in ole-automation call to com functions from vba rtd not sure if anyone still uses dde

127687
mbunit	nunit
i ve tried mbunit for a short while as well as zenebug and xunit.net but i keep coming back to nunit

127692
revision	svn
my project is currently using a svn repository which gains several hundred new revision per day

127692
revision	svn
does that mean that inorder to checkout the revision 10 of the file foo.baz svn will take revision 1 and then apply the delta 2-10

127706
mime	rfc
in particular for an email to be considered as valid mime the headers must in the rfc sense of the words contains both of these headers

127752
revision	svn
the only operations which are likely to slow down are things which read information from multiple revision svn blame

127761
any	set
i tried following this but i don t see in my menu i have php plugins install and any attempt to set up the servers menu gives me socket error .when i try to debugging

127763
administration	account
ianana i am not a network administration but your service account probably just needs read access to one of the odbc files or directory

127842
put	get
.when we put breakpoints in vs everything behaves as normals but without them we get the original search criterion and results

127863
reflection	runtime
scriplets linking done at compile-time but taglib class field access has to use such java-api as reflection at runtime

127873
button	popup
popup a messages with one button to dismiss it

127877
keyboard	mouse
this can be done via the keyboard mouse panels of systemd preferences

127892
swing	swt
you are really asking two different questions swt vs swing and eclipse gui editor vs netbeans gui editor matisse

127892
swing	swt
first the difference between swt and swing is that they are two fundamentally different gui libs

127892
swing	swt
this akin to asking the difference between tk and win32 or swing vs .net forms not to say that swt is .net

127892
initializer	getter
gui components are added and initializer through getter and is scattered throughout the file

127903
attributes	properties
you need to set the enablesession properties of the webmethods attributes for the function you are calling

127915
windows-media-player	embed
your only real option is to follow ctacke s advice and embed windows-media-player or other media player that offers a activex control you can use i m not aware of any - sorry

127922
mbunit	nunit
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

127929
resource-files	resx
the resx resource-files are successfully passed through lingobit resgen and al

127968
postback	ajax
as an aside i know from doing some heavy atlas ajax things that there is definitely not two sessions one for normals postback one for async is there any chance you re using a webfarm

127971
contains	set
the big advantage of a closed set of possible contains types is that you have an upper bound on sizeof which means you can avoid the heap and the indirection it brings

127984
emacs	vim
i ve done it for quite a while now and it s natural to me even though i m not an emacs user either i m in the vim camp of that particular .war

128012
uitableview	uilabel
i want to create a uitableview with varying row height and i m trying to accomplish this by creating uilabel inside the uitableviewcells

128015
click	mouse
normals osx applications eat the first mouse click .when not focused to first focus the application

128024
emacs	vim
for emacs ctrl should be at caps lock - for vim the escape key should be on the caps lock

128031
javascript	dom
while dom is a pretty lousy api it has the advantage of having been designed for multiple-languages and environment .so it s easy to implements in java c# javascript c et al

128055
quicksort	shellsort
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128068
any	set
new project in visual-studio 2003 and later have the compile as c++ code tp option set by default .so any .c files will be compiled as c++

128076
click	mouse
responding to the first mouse click .when not focused is called click through

128083
checkbox	textbox
my client is now requesting that the textbox s which are being repeater can be either a textbox or a checkbox

128093
filtering	sorting
click - this is useful if you want to add sorting and filtering functionality

128093
gridview	listview
c in your listview code bind the templates with your gridview

128101
checkbox	textbox
what about something similar to this in your markup in each the textbox and checkbox controls

128110
actionscript	mxml
flex also has the power of actionscript 3 behind it which allows you to do much of what flash does in cooperation with the mxml frontend components without ever touching the timeline or keyframes

128110
profiling	debugging
as to the debugging points flex has a true debugger and profiling within the flex builder ide

128127
checkbox	textbox
in your repeater drop a panels then create an event handler for the repeater s data binding event and programmatically create the textbox or checkbox and add it as a child control of the panels

128127
attributes	properties
you should be able to get the dataitem from the eventargs to get information like your types attributes or value to feed your text properties or css information etc

128128
for-loop	arrays
ie instead of creating a for-loop with an iterator variables and marching through an arrays doing something to each cell you d say the equivalent of this labels refers to a versioning of this arrays where this function has been done on all the elements.

128206
blacklist	whitelist
explicit blacklist certain characters even though this is usually bypassable if your whitelist cannot be extremely tight

128221
g++	gcc
i have had this happen with gcc and g++

128221
g++	gcc
unfortunately g++ packed the struct significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing object between c and c++ code

128240
firefox	safari
.so proxy definitions have to be defined for both macos safari and firefox

128259
tuples	set
second if the set types is the better answer how do i key it to look at just the first elements of the tuples instead of the whole thing

128260
instances	private
that as far as i can tell is the intent of the design - npobject object are instances of the npclass they points to they implements methods and properties through the npclass function-pointsers that deal with these entities and any private data is expected to be allocated and deallocated by the implementsation and its format is unspecified

128281
mbunit	nunit
it s not just a test framework but a test automation platform .so it will work with many existing test frameworks mbunit nunit xunit.net yet be fully extensible with a numbers of built-in additional features such as report generator in many formats and code-analysis tools

128297
ocaml	lisp
i m not 100 familiar with lisp but i assume it has some of the same problems as ocaml in that there isn t stellar libs support

128310
32-bit	64bit
a pure .net 2.0+ application will -- in the absence of specific compiler-flags to the contrary -- run as a 64bit application under a 64bit os and as a 32-bit application under a 32-bit os

128315
margins	insets
you can make a single child block elements within a parent block elements insets by giving the elements margins

128315
margins	padding
if you use the latter approach you may need to set a border or slight padding on the parent elements to prevent margins collapsing

128317
32-bit	64bit
.so if you run your application on 64bit platform it will generator native 64bit code but if you run it on a 32-bit platform it ll generator 32-bit code

128323
build-process	ant
according to the ant docs there are two properties that control whether the build-process is stopped or not if the testng task fails

128327
keyboard	mouse
this is my main loops for getting input via keyboard and mouse using x windows on linux

128369
combinations	permutation
if what you want is all permutation rather than combinations you want acb and abc to count as different rather than appear just once just delete the last line the and one and it s done

128373
callback	methods
it accepts any callback types .so al.so methods in classes

128382
testng	junit
although you are showing a fake task called testng in your example i presume you are using the junit target

128399
perl	php	perl	ruby	perl	lua	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	perl	python	lua	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	pascal	lua	c++	lua	lisp	lua
during my professional career as a .net and before that vb 2-6 developer i ve written small project in pascal lisp c++ php javascript ruby and python and am currently dabbling in lua and perl

128400
click	mouse
if i click my mouse wheel on a link

128413
contains	elements	contains	any
for example look at any bit of xslt code and then think what would happen if you didn t use namespaces and were trying to write an xslt where the output has to contains templates for-each etc elements

128428
any	set
if you haven t tried this already i d suggest firing up a set of vms with foreign language versioning of windows install rather than just changing the language settings on your machine and seeing if that makes any difference

128445
32-bit	64bit
i have an application that we re trying to migrate to 64bit from 32-bit

128445
32-bit	64bit
can i somehow call the 32-bit dlls from 64bit code

128445
32-bit	64bit
the only possible .solution i ve found .so far is to create com+ wrapper for all of the 32-bit dll functions and invoke com from the 64bit process

128445
32-bit	64bit
is there any other way to call the 32-bit dlls from a 64bit clr process

128459
communication	messages
your storage application and my supply application are completely unrelated but .when they communication through xml messages the messages should be understandable and easily parsing by both sides

128477
32-bit	64bit
you ll need to have the 32-bit dll loaded into a separate 32-bit process and have your 64bit process communication with it via interprocess communication

128477
32-bit	64bit
i don t think there is any way a 32-bit dll can be loaded into a 64bit process otherwise

128477
32-bit	64bit
accessing 32-bit dlls from 64bit code

128488
magic-methods	getter	magic-methods	setter	getter	setter
php offers a myriad of ways to handle this including magic-methods __get and __set but i prefer explicit getter and setter

128488
getter	setter
validation can be placed in setter and getter for that matter

128489
constructor	object
the rules of java state that you should never pass this to another methods from its constructor for the simple reason that the object has not been fully construct

128489
constructor	object	any	set
usually you can get away with passing this from constructor as long as you don t actually access any members or call methods for example if you want to set a reference to this in another object

128493
communication	messages
.so assuming that your wcf communication is configure to use .soap messages not the binary .net-remoting datapower shouldn t have any trouble deciphering what s in your messages xpath and router appropriately

128499
contains	any
my problem is that .when i load a pdf in the magicnet.image object it doesn t throw an error but .when i look at the properties it is obvious it didn t load the pdf it doesn t contains any data

128510
datagrid	textbox
if you don t want to use a datagrid to display data i sugest using a textbox with a monospace fonts at least like courier new

128512
subclassing	base-class
if i have a subclassing that has yet to implements a function provided by the base-class i can overrides that function and have it throw a notsupportedexception

128513
.net	wcf
this is for c# and .net 3.5 and include both old web references as well as the newer wcf web-services references

128514
versioning	upgrade
has anyone upgrade the versioning of php on the server since apc.so was created

128519
implements	abstract
make it abstract with no implementsation and fail to implements it in the derived-class

128581
png	gif
the supplied utilities including a java applet allow you to tag gif s jpeg s and png s without changing them visually

128632
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ ultraedit and textpad are good ones

128636
dictionary	arrays	sortedlist	hashtable	sorteddictionary	sortedlist	sorteddictionary	hashtable
what s the difference between arrays arrayslist list hashtable dictionary sortedlist and sorteddictionary

128683
implements	sealed
there is a problem with tostring it s expecting a numberformatinfo types that implements iformatprovider but the numberformatinfo class is sealed

128718
getter	setter
