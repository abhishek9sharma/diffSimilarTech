i am thinking of developing this feature as an addin that will lookup the sender s mail address and get an image of the sender and put it into the mail body

1401875
samba	jcifs
if you are using samba you might want to take a look at jcifs then you can use

1401912
difference	factors
i wouldn t use performance as the deciding factors here - and quite honestly i don t think there s any measurable performance difference between those two cases really

1401917
click	mouse
user selected date with mouse click

1401937
getter	setter
you may want to read why getter and setter methods are evil

1401937
getter	setter
getter and setter

1401989
delphi	c++
you can t pass a delphi object to c++ at least not without a very good understanding of how the object-model works at the binary level

1401989
callback	methods
if you need callback do them using c types only and plain functions and procedure no methods and you should be fine

1402029
callback	methods
.when you say the callback is implements through an interface do you mean a com-style interface where the c++ class has nothing but pure-virtual methods including addref release and queryinterface and they all use the stdcall calling-convention

1402029
delphi	c++
if you mean you have a non-com interface where the c++ class has only pure-virtual methods but not the three com functions then you can write a delphi class with the same layout

1402029
delphi	c++
the delphi vmt has the same layout as most c++ vtables on windows implementation at least as far as the function-pointer order is concerned

1402029
data-members	constructor
if you mean that you have an arbitrary c++ class that could include data-members constructor or non-pure methods then your task is considerably more difficult

1402034
variables	boolean
i m using a static boolean variables to lock the properties object .when my class updates it but this is not keeping the exception-handling from occurring

1402038
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
userprofile is typically on windows 2000 or windows-xp systemd and typically on windows-vista and windows 7 systemd.

1402044
msbuild-task	msbuild
visual-studio project use msbuild .so you can integrated an msbuild-task that uses whatever javascript minifier you d like

1402053
put	get
why does ruby-on-rails put this in the document and how do i get rid of it

1402067
selected	checkbox
what i want is to change the row s styles .whenever the gvchkdelete checkbox is selected and remove it .when it s not

1402067
selected	checkbox	highlight	selected
all of this just to ensure that whenever a postback is made the rows with a selected checkbox conserved the highlight styles witch doesn t happen by just enabling viewstate of course

1402074
double	int
i have an html form where the user can types in any numbers 5 8 4.2 5.8 anything in terms of numberss int or double

1402077
void	main
public static void main string arguments throw exception-handling

1402108
duplicates	contains
could it be a classloader problem where the jar that contains your class is duplicates in each web-inf .lib of your different applications

1402111
variables	boolean
i m using a static boolean variables to lock the properties object .when my class updates it but this is not keeping the exception-handling from occurring

1402112
numeric	digits
i m using the onkeyup event on a form field in javascript and i m wanting to checked if the key the key pressed is a numeric digits - ie

1402118
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so i am an old webforms guy and new to the asp.net-mvc in general not only asp.net framework

1402122
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i bet your site will work with ie 6 but will it work with safari and firefox and opera equally well

1402144
xsd	xml
let s say i want to be able to validation that a 50gb+ xml file conforms to a given xsd

1402160
revision	svn
the easiest way i have been able to restore files and not lose revision history is using svn copy the merge example above to me seems like a more complex way to achieve the same thing

1402164
activeresource	net-http
i use an old patchlevel of 1.9.1 on a server running 2.3.3 and other than a patch in net-http to work with activeresource it runs blazingly fast

1402166
contains	elements
you want a complex elements that can contains text only - in other words text and attributes

1402173
value	field
unfortunately this doesn t actually provide any results because the jobdate field is stored as a datetime value

1402184
linux	unix
however unix linux based systemd can compute using multiple-processes with the multicore package

1402204
perl	ruby
.so you should use .some kind of loops implements either in .some sql dialects or for example in perl or ruby

1402212
contains	any
i usually create a viewmodel class specific for each view that contains any logic associated with the specific view

1402220
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc isn t an improvement over classic webforms in every respect

1402227
google-chrome	firefox
the click event doesn t seem to fire in google-chrome but works in firefox

1402230
fiddler	charles
to compare the different get request you can use a debugging http-proxy like fiddler or charles

1402251
duplicates	sorted
uniq depends on the items being sorted to remove duplicates since it compares the previous and current item hence why sort is always run before uniq

1402266
getter	setter
and looking at the msdn documentation the file properties is both a getter and a setter .so there should be no problem

1402270
web-config	app-config
i personally would never use web-config or app-config

1402284
tapply	rep
if you want to apply a function such as variables across a factors such as run or rep you can use tapply

1402299
nsmutablearray	nsarray
why don t you just use nsarray or nsmutablearray with nsinteger s

1402317
google-chrome	safari
this is handled correctly by safari and google-chrome then too

1402318
web-config	app-config
i don t like the proposed solution of using web-config or app-config

1402325
lookup	any
if the vector were a then lookup for bar would be done at global scoping too because arguments-dependent-lookup will not only use the arguments types directly but also the types of the templates argumentss in them if there are any

1402327
assign	add
i know i could just assign it to a variables but that would add another line to my code oh nooes

1402332
implements	sealed
a propertiesdescriptor is either a custom concrete child of the propertiesdescriptor class implements by the types defining the custom descriptor or is an instances of the sealed internal class reflectpropertiesdescriptor that uses the propertiesinfo class to provide dynamic invocation of the properties

1402339
administration	account
i haven t run into this problem personally since i m still in vista hell but apparently in windows 7 the protected administration account which you normally run under doesn t have write access to all application folder - it only has write access to application folder that were install by that user

1402339
windows-xp	windows	versioning	upgrade
.so if your application was install by a windows-xp or vista user and then that user upgrade to windows 7 your default protected admin user will be denied write permission on the application folder since it has a different sid under the new versioning of windows

1402339
versioning	upgrade
this problem would only affect you if you try to upgrade the dependent assemblies and it would only affect users who install your application under an earlier versioning of windows and then upgrade to windows 7 .so i don t know how big a deal this would be for you

1402341
linked-list	nodes
im trying to remove a single nodes from a doubly threaded linked-list

1402359
contains	any
the value can be of any length including zero and can contains any valid xml characters depending on the encoding

1402362
for-loop	arrays
you could then initializer the arrays linearly or with a nested for-loop

1402362
subclassing	nsobject
though you might want to also carry along the width and the height or better yet create a intmatrix subclassing of nsobject that wrap all of the pointer-arithmetic and storage beyond a nice clean api

1402379
logging	trace
i m using both the el logging block and the el exception-handling blog along with the database trace listener

1402380
aes	rsa
i m looking for a free and up to-date encryption libs for delphi 2010 that implements rsa and aes rijndael

1402386
type-safety	generics
this maps more closely to your current implementation assuming plain tlist but you lose the compile-time type-safety you can get from using generics

1402387
contains	elements
some xmltext elements can contains things like nbsp

1402416
derived-class	base-class
oh and unless things have changed since last i looked you cannot downcasting a virtual base-class to any derived-class without help from the base-class

1402432
groovy	java
by default the current versioning of ireport 3.6.0 uses groovy a sort of java scripting-language which has full access to any java libs in your classpath

1402432
groovy	java
for simpler java coding needs you can write simple groovy code right in the xml of the report

1402491
python	java
your problem is simply that unlike in languages like python java does not treat lists and arrays interchangeably

1402495
web-config	app-config
why do people recommend app-config or web-config

1402517
sql-server	oracle
i prefer sql-server over oracle but i have one legacy oracle systemd to manage and i am finding myself climbing an uphill battle against the numerous errors oracle throw at you on a minute by minute basis

1402525
.when	ready
that way the data will be ready for us .when we need it and this further helps mask the cost of accessing data in ram

1402533
compact-framework	.net
now i wrote an application c# .net compact-framework 2.0 using vs2008 inorder to receive this data and later on work with it

1402552
double-quotes	single-quotes
because you re using single-quotes - change to double-quotes and it will behave as you expect

1402554
decrement	increment
i think you should prefer to pass smart pointers as references .when possible to avoid extraneous increment and decrement and copies and whatnot

1402558
double-quotes	single-quotes
the answer is simple if you want to printing for example html code in which naturally there are a lot of double-quotes wrapping the string in single-quotes is much more readable

1402558
double-quotes	single-quotes
personally i always use single-quotes and attach newline characters from double-quotes

1402560
javascript	dom
also setting it to a tag and pulling that from the dom once the javascript execute

1402598
contains	elements
i have a piece of xml that contains optional non-enumerated elements .so schema validation does not catch invalid value

1402617
highlight	cell
in an application i write that uses a large html table of numbers the design required that the row and column of the hovered cell will be highlight

1402617
traversal	parent
the main problem here is that there is no common parent to a table column .so inorder to styles a column one needs to traversal the entire table selected each row and then find the right nth-child td

1402639
google-chrome	firefox
well your mileage may vary with different browsers and how well they handle float and clear but this worked fairly well with ie 7 google-chrome and firefox 3.5

1402640
dictionary	map
if you need more conversions you could just plug them into the map dictionary

1402640
dictionary	map
if you can find a matching database online contains the same ids as well as the abbreviations it would be possible to quickly extraction and import the pairs with regular expression for example and drop those into the map dictionary

1402645
access-token	login
also twitter s response to an oauth access-token request the last part of the oauth login procedure responds with the user s screens named and twitter userid alongside the usual oauth token and secret

1402647
onfocus	onkeyup
i tried with onfocus onserverchange onkeyup but it is not exactly how i want it

1402652
attributes	properties
i can t recall off the top of my head if it will write any unknown server properties to the client i think it does but if it doesn t you ll need to add it as an attributes in code

1402652
textbox	onblur
confirmed that it does indeed happily write out unknown properties onblur is not a properties of textbox control but it will rendering in the html .so it works

1402654
textarea	textbox
a multiline textbox should rendering to a textarea elements

1402657
multiplying	modulo
there is a lot of multiplying and modulo going on in the above algorithm .so it is quite expensive

1402671
any	set
that means that any properties of uiscrollview can also be set on uitextview

1402681
margins	padding
additionally by not setting the width the browser will account for any padding margins and borders you may apply to second_one without breaking the layout

1402688
selected	cell
why don t you include a elements at the top of your table either explicit or if necessary by adding it dynamically with jquery and then assign a background-color value to the column matching your selected cell s index

1402724
cryptography	security
guids are useful as ids but i d only rely on a dedicated cryptography technique for security

1402729
aggregate	grouping
anyway include all columns that you re selected that aren t aggregate in your grouping by

1402730
contains	any
assemblies are loaded on demand .so it could be that you did not used any types contains in these assemblies yet

1402735
any	set
i actually started from colgroup i even use it for column widths on the same table but the colgroup and col elementss are set visually behind the table elementss .so if tbody tr td or any other elements in the table has a background which in my case many of them has colgroup will not show over these elementss and it did not respond to positioning or any other advanced css manipulation i tried to apply on it

1402744
google-chrome	firefox
i ve messed around with their demo before and observed left right up and down working .when i tested it in ie7 firefox 3.5.2 and google-chrome 2.0.172.

1402760
authentication	login
i m using forms-authentication to authentication an user passing he s login

1402777
concave	vertex
if negative this is a concave vertex that excludes much of the exterior

1402778
put	get
i ve created an instances of the object put data into adict and now want to get rid of the object cleaning up its memory in the process

1402781
subclassing	base-class
maybe bar is defined in a base-class and you are calling specific implementation of it in subclassing

1402782
javascript	dom
although this behavior is not part of the dom standards it has been the case going back to the very first versioning of javascript and is totally reliable

1402783
push	pull
you will then be able to push to and pull from the remote repo with

1402801
row	col
for example encode the row numbers and col numberss in the tds class or named attributes

1402801
highlight	cell
if the user move from one cell to another checked if its in a row you have already highlight

1402813
icollection	ienumerable
object as either icollection or ienumerable

1402816
getter	setter
each properties makes available getter and setter that are accessible via field-like syntax

1402822
show	next	hidden	reset
click the reset button next to the labels that says if dialog were hidden using don t show this again click reset to view them again.

1402827
ref	out
only a variable-reference can be passed as a ref or out parameter in an arguments list

1402842
decimal-point	digits
insignificant digits are neither display nor used .so the fact that your numbers x.xxx000 has six digits to the right of the decimal-point means that all six of those digits are significant

1402842
numeric	digits
the native numeric types of most languages including c++ do not handle this notion of significant digits

1402845
32-bit	64bit
much more memory is addressable with 64bit pointers and for some problem domains a theoretical 4gb limit at 32-bit often less is less than satisfactory

1402845
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure how 64bit osx handles 32-bit binaries but in windows the emulation is near perfect and for many apps there s simply no need to upgrade

1402852
integrated-security	connection-string
if i have an asp.net web .app using impersonation and a sql-server connection-string with integrated-security true does the identity of the iis .application-pool of the .app play any role

1402864
.when	ready
another way to do this is to tightly control the building versioninging in that .when you are ready to perform your release to qa regression you set your major versioning to 3.4 and you leave your minor versioning numbers to 0

1402874
key-value	key
nsmutabledictionary copies key and send retain to value for each key-value pair that you added

1402898
preventdefault	dom-events
addeventlistener is fine if you use preventdefault as suggested by fphilipe but you d need an attachevent backup for ie where dom-events aren t supported

1402918
value	field
i have an items table that contains all the possible information about an item including an item_types field that contains an int value determining what the item types is and resulting which information about the item to use

1402919
aes	rsa
chillkat does support rsa and aes for delphi but it s not free

1402924
interpreter	runtime
attributes are a metadata annotations .so they don t add weight to a class at runtime unless they are interpreter by the runtime in a certain way that makes it treat the class differently

1402938
radiobuttonlist	updatepanel
x-------------- radiobuttonlist rblactionlevel on updatepanel

1402943
constructor	object
you might instead create instances of uniqueid only .when needed say in the object s constructor or as a methods with a static variables

1402944
selected	cell
specifically if a user has selected a single cell how can you get that row numbers

1402944
selected	cell
it needs to access a particular cell based on what the user has selected

1402961
synchronous	.when
you are using synchronous call you are relying on the threadpool to throttle your call rate you have no retry policy for failed call and your application will behave extremly bad under error conditional .when the web call are failing

1402961
updating	updates
.some general advice would be use asynchronous methods in the database call al.so size yoru conneciton pool to allow for your throtling cap make sure your updates use the player id as a key .so you don t deadlock on updating the same recording from different threads

1402977
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i can reproduce this after moving the mouse around in ie firefox opera and google-chrome

1402985
account	api
i suppose the best solution would be to have user-accounts that authentication with the api and then ban each account if they abuse it

1402988
nstextview	nscell
.when the mouseenter an nscell i will immediately add a custom nstextview subviews to the nstableview at the same positioning as the nscell that was hovered over

1402988
nstextview	nscell
.when you hover out of the nscell its mirror nstextview is destroy

1403074
double	int
where anintvariables is an int variables for the numbers of elements of the double arrays

1403074
32-bit	64bit	long-integer	unsigned
anyhow on 32-bit systemd i never had any problems but on 64bit systemd i get a compiler warning about using u for a unsigned long-integer

1403074
32-bit	64bit
using lu as the format code fixed the problem on 64bit but causes the compiler to complain on 32-bit because the types is back to unsigned int

1403074
32-bit	64bit
i ve found some webpage guides to convert code from 32-bit to 64bit but i d rather have code that works on both instead of just converting back and forth

1403082
linked-list	nodes
.when you insert an elements you go down the linked-list if its there you increment the nodess count otherwise create a new nodes with count of 1

1403089
scp	ssh
i don t have ssh access .so i can t use scp - and rsync isn t an option either unfortunately

1403096
put	get
this will be faster because you can login then do all the transfer at once it seems from a cursory glance that you execute ncftpput once for each file get put

1403107
json	xml
maybe this just does not work in json but i do something similar with xml in my resources

1403108
primitive	int
it should be much faster to increment a value in an arrays of primitive than create a new int each time you want to increment a value

1403110
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i know this works with excel and i believe i ve done it with the openoffice.org spreadsheet

1403110
perl	ruby
but you probably would prefer a perl or ruby script.

1403131
linux	unix
cython is implements by c for corresponding platform such as windows linux or unix

1403134
excel-vba	vba
3 accessing excel-vba is going to be easier using ironpython if you re doing it from vba

1403185
directory	folder
then inside the class directory i would make assignment folder if assignments consisted of multiple-files or just place the files directly for single-file assingments like papers

1403202
textbox	button
on the default tab i have a go button tied to a function that retrieves the value from textbox on the second tab default value

1403213
arrays	loops
hope that makes sense if not you can checked an earlier .post about this issue that explains why i need this after finding out that css alone cannot solve my problem css php how to solve this div float problem odd even loops in arrays

1403242
dictionary	map
but the issue comes .when i need to turn the individual data field associate with map layer in to a datatable or even just a dictionary structure

1403242
value	field
how do i cycle through the collections of attributes in the features to get the actual field value

1403247
gnome	kde
if you have a good connection i would recommend mounting the ftp-server via the gnome or kde file managers or else using curlftpfs

1403251
capture	player
.when player types how do i capture input

1403257
installation	building
i have a requirement to building branded e-commerce sites that have their own urls but are on the same installation

1403259
protected	public
always use public protected private etc

1403263
value	field
then run scripting with insert statements for each row but in value must be only those field that are in new structure

1403266
linux	osx
the application i m working on required the ability to edit certain protected files across linux osx and windows-vista

1403266
linux	osx
i believe in general windows-vista utilizes manifest files osx has the authentication libs and linux has a variety of sudo frontends

1403290
versioning	upgrade
first which versioning of ubuntu are you using it might be easiest to just upgrade to one that has it

1403300
versioning	upgrade
.so if you were running gutsy you would either have to upgrade to the new jaunty jackalope versioning which has ruby 1.9 or add the respoistories for jaunty to your etc apt .sources.list file

1403312
msdeploy	msbuild
what i would do is to create an msbuild file which will call into msdeploy

1403333
emacs	vim
text editing i open multiple-files in one vim no offense to emacs .

1403344
exception-handling	try-catch
in both ironpython 2.0 and 2.6 the finalize for generator which is what s running here - see the finalize methods has a try-catch exception-handling which swallows all exception-handling-handling

1403346
jython	pypy
one way or another or even on the jvm via jython or in peculiar environment via pypy python is surely an awesome language whatever implementation s you pick for a given application

1403351
margins	padding
i have played around with margins and padding in the parent td elements as well as within the div or span

1403353
perl	ruby
the perl scripting 256colors2.pl works great in my terminal and i d like to use some of these colors in my ruby scriptinging without manually insert the ansi codes

1403373
octal	hex	decimal	octal	decimal	hex
you can express an int in decimal hex octal or binary--the result in the object code will be the same

1403383
.net	wcf
i would like to get some information on list of points that needs to be taken care of while developing web-services on .net platform using wcf to make sure it is compatible with majority of the clients out there java .net etc...

1403397
children	nodes
i have a nodes object which has a parent properties which is another nodes and a _children field backing a readonly children properties which is a collections of nodess as well

1403397
children	nodes
.when i retrieve them from the repository an in-memory sqlite db in my tests though any nodes s children include itself for some reason

1403420
xsd	xml
if you know the schema xsd of your xml you can use xsd.exe to generator classes to parsing these xml files

1403421
instances	private
should button event handler ever be private and if .so why did it not work in my instances

1403422
.when	ready
this will allow you to only execute the query .when you are ready to load the data from the database

1403431
configuration	environment
configuration environment production.rb

1403437
hide	show
now i just use a class called hide and use that class if something needs to be hidden and remove it if something needs to be show

1403438
csv	zip
i have a view that takes data from my site and then makes it into a zip compressed csv file

1403446
copy-constructor	constructor
the big four constructor copy-constructor assignment-operator destructor

1403450
selected	button
.when they want to wire a click handler to a button server control they typically either double click the button or selected it in visual-studio press f4 to go to its properties and set its events within that windows

1403475
value	field
you just join the contact table to the addresses table by defining the clause and then you set the addr1 addr2 field on the contact table to the corresponding value of address1 address2 on the addresses table - pretty simple huh

1403480
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested the following in firefox safari and internet-explorer

1403503
compatibility	legacy
basichttpbinding is okay - but it s old legacy only for backward compatibility doesn t offer much in terms of security etc

1403503
xsd	xml
the datacontract is an entirely different matter though - it s really a .net wrapper over xml schema xsd files and this is one of the industry standards that has very broad and very complete support across the board

1403504
dictionary	map
.so a dictionary will always at most map to a single value

1403520
attributes	properties
i was suggested to use the location.hash function to selected that particular anchor elements of the tab and add the hash properties in the href attributes of the first webpage

1403530
input-field	selected
indiscriminate javascript approach to selected the first valid input-field on a page

1403550
callback	methods
jquery-append then call the dommanip methods with a callback that insert the dom nodes

1403553
csv	tsv
looks like xlwt may serve your needs -- you can read each tsv file with python standard-library csv module which does do tab-separated as well as comma-separated etc don t worry

1403553
xlsx	xls
not sure about xlsx vs plain xls support but maybe the xls might be enough..

1403559
capture	player
.when player types how do i capture

1403561
csv	tsv
i m not sure if excel reads tsv but it will certainly read csv files directly

1403576
defined	declare
if you didn t want to use the singleton pattern the correct way is to defined both clases in one compilation unit and then declare them as extern in the header file the result is your intended one global instances of the class but that won t prevent it from being copy-paste or copy construct

1403580
shell	bash
if i run the scripting in a cygwin bash shell i get the same output i would as .when i types in the cmd manually

1403581
any	set
and is there any way to fix this problem because now i need to start working on new set of functionalities for asp.net 2.0 website

1403598
delphi	vb.net
it used to be available for delphi but is now visual-studio only and works for the c# and vb.net personalities

1403624
checkbox	button	button	popup
it has a button that .when pressed popup a scrolling list display the labels with checkbox for selection

1403624
selected	checkbox
al.so i d like to be able to observe the checkbox selected deselected events and take action .so advice on that part would al.so be appreciated.

1403630
click	mouse
.when i click the clear button the image is cleared and at the mouse move on the picturebox the last drawned image will show

1403643
hide	show
i have done a hide and show of a div elements on click a elements with class toggleit by using the toggle function

1403652
parsing	comma
it only gives a syntax-error because you perl thinks you need to omit the comma after because it is parsing that map as being a block not an expression

1403666
hide	show
you need to know if the #common_fields elements is visible or not inorder to get the right show or hide text value

1403671
authentication	login
if you mean the httpauth login it is also the easiest way to send the username back to your client using the server-side scripting as the authentication has been required initializer by the server side and javascript has no direct access to there

1403678
multiple-languages	locale
this methods will allow you to give a hint as to the locale and provide a way of checked multiple-languages within the one build-process

1403688
triggers	insert
i ve got an after insert triggers that works well

1403688
triggers	insert
however i want it to delete the row after it s been insert and after the main body of the triggers completes

1403712
appdata	temp
userprofile appdata local temp

1403712
appdata	temp
probably userprofile appdata local temp microsoft visual-studio 2008 sp1

1403723
32-bit	64bit
the assembly is compiled as anycpu .so that i can use it in both 32-bit and 64bit

1403723
32-bit	64bit
.when i tried to compare the performance of an application that uses this assembly in 32-bit and 64bit i see interesting results

1403723
32-bit	64bit
based on the results it seems that the 1st part is faster in 32-bit and while the 2nd part is faster in 64bit architecture

1403723
32-bit	64bit
the data computation and copying part is slower in 64bit is it because that the floating-point arithmetic is slower in 64bit compared to 32-bit

1403723
32-bit	64bit
ps i benchmarking the application on 64bit amd machine with 8gb ram with 32-bit and 64bit vista install on it

1403752
duplicates	elements
array_unique removes duplicates by comparing the string value of the elements

1403752
duplicates	elements
this means that all the elements of your arrays have the string value arrays and are therefore considered duplicates and are removed except for the first one

1403761
json	xml
use button_to_function to retrieve some xml or json at your option from an action with the necessary labels and value for checkbox then rendering the pop-up

1403767
execute	declare
execute declare inxmlrequest xml set inxmlrequest ------above 8000 characters---

1403767
put	get
finally we will execute that nvarchar string and get out put

1403787
oracle	mysql
what is the best free sql gui for linux mssql mysql oracle etcâ

1403796
directory	folder
the first cmd changes directory to the iis adminscripts folder

1403839
mousehover	mousemove
checked the mousemove or mousehover event and make sure it is not assign an image to the picturebox

1403842
filtering	grouping
if either performance isn t a major issue or the grouping change sufficiently slowly to enable query caching to be useful you could write filtering functions and pass those in

1403842
arrays	loops	filtering	grouping
if you re loopsing through grouping and have an optional arrays of filtering methods your loops would become

1403882
contains	set
result now contains a nested set of arrays

1403890
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
assuming i have to use c no c++ or object oriented compilers and i don t have dynamic-memory-allocation what are some techniques i can use to implements a class or a good approximation of a class

1403891
postgresql	mysql
in considering what tools to use for application development especially one that will required a database component what should be looked for .when considering open-source tools like mysql and postgresql vs proprietary solutions like 4d or pervasive sql

1403896
directory	folder
however .when i try to delete a file from a specified folder i am getting error invalid syntax directory

1403902
any	set
such firewalls have limited resources and .when they need more connection tracking they tend to drop the oldest connection tracked without any activity regardless of the hard timeout set

1403910
webforms	asp.net
otoh in my opinion the vs designer experience for wpf and webforms asp.net is not nearly as good as with winforms

1403928
typedef	struct
you can use typedef struct _whatever whatever before declaring struct _whatever to hide the implementation from client code

1403936
logout	login
my webapp has clear entry login and exit logout points

1403941
vb.net	vba
after this code a 3 3 is 20 in vba and 5 in vb.net

1403944
javascript	dom
then your site is in quirks-mode in ie and almost-standards mode in modern browsers and because the xhtml 1.0 transitional dtd forces the page to be in standards mode there will be layout issues and potential issues in the javascript especially in ie as there are some significant difference between how the dom is rendering in quirks vs standards

1403950
arrays	loops
if useful the class can contains public functions that will loops through the arrays and call the functions of all the initializer object runall call each run ohandle

1403961
put	get
your operators istream object should get data from the inputstream using its formatted and or unformatted extraction functions and put it into your object

1403971
contains	elements
can anyone please suggest an xpath expression format that returns a string value contains the concatenation value of certain qualifying child nodes of an elements but ignoring others

1403975
put	get
the next time .when you get the caching item checked if the timestamp is too old and delete the entry at that time get a fresh copy and put it back in the db caching with a current timestamp

1403976
symfony	phpunit
i m working with symfony + doctrine + phpunit with netbeans ide

1403991
exception-handling	error-handling
however even with raii exception-handling constraints and transactional these code-paths are rarely tested correctly and rarely tested together in multiple-failure scenerios and its usually in the error-handling code that the bugs hide

1404028
web-services	api
i am going to use restful web-services and httpclient to access facebook api rest server

1404032
order	add
jdl s answer is correct - you need to add to both relationships - in your user class add it to has_many order and in your order class add it to has_many order_items

1404038
assign	add
just add your items and make sure you assign a named

1404039
entity-framework	ado.net
for example if i had a linq-to-sql data context or if i had ado.net entity-framework entities that mapped to a database-table and i want to test for a single customer.

1404047
buffering	streaming
before starting with system.net.sockets.socket are you sure that you can t use system.net.sockets.tcpclient or udpclient that does all the messy buffering work for you and transforms it to an easily managed streaming

1404053
value	field
i m assuming your building this object-literal from the value of some form field

1404054
motorola	sony
j2me is much more popular than android - many phones of many vendors nokia sony ericson motorola lg samsung and more have it and you can deploy application to them

1404057
textbox	button
i d like to make a textbox with a button inside something like a datepicker but not exactly

1404067
dictionary	map
there is a nearly global map dictionary - i call it the environment - that translation type-names into type-objects

1404077
enumerator	any
the problem is that any enumerator specified using the enum keyword does in fact inherited from system.enum .so the above code would be the ideal way to limit an extension methods to enumerators only

1404084
midp	cldc
midp midp2.0 cldc cdc .

1404103
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mongodb	oracle	mysql	mongodb	mysql
adminer is also a universal tool it can connect to mysql postgresql sqlite ms sql oracle simpledb elasticsearch and mongodb

1404140
textbox	button
you can use richtextbox instead of textbox and it support flowdocument in which you can place the button in it

1404142
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
however a problem with this approach is that arrays can contains duplicates elements and still match

1404163
value	field
this can really throw your scripting off if it is relying on the initial value of a field matching what s in the html

1404170
document	editing
for the editing i d suggest to use an html parsing to handle the document

1404175
contains	elements
i have a couple of div elements contains in one containers div and i would like to slider through them showing only one at a time and after a certain timeout slider the currently visible div to the left using an animation and slider in the next div from the right

1404184
click	mouse
checked the the java java.awt.robot class which can be used to control the mouse pointers and generator button click

1404194
spring	grails
another spring sollution is grails

1404194
groovy	java
it is really fun to use and even if you have to learn another scripting-language called groovy you can still use all your java legacy classe in the framework because groovy classes are compatible with java classes and vice versa

1404196
ms-access	oracle
if you have ms-access on your pc and if you can set up table links from ms-access to oracle you can use ms-access to generator relationship diagram which you can then printing

1404205
authentication	login
besides that if your django source is too old you can always modify the authentication or login code yourself

1404207
mapping	unique
if i understood your question correctly there is no way to find out the time zone from time+offset because the mapping is not unique

1404217
canvas	scale
i have an issue with regards to using a scaletransform on a canvas in silverlight the canvas scale correctly however the height and width value always remain the same

1404217
canvas	scale
a 100x100 canvas scale .so it appears 200x200 is still 100x100 with regards to the height and width value how can these be updates to reflect the new size

1404217
canvas	scale
another related issue is how to alter the height and width of an elements and have this scale the canvas or xaml elements appropriately ie

1404217
canvas	scale
height and width need updates .so that .when this canvas is in a scrollviewer the scrollbar correctly updates for the new size - this happens if the height and width is assign manually to the new scale size but this needs to work for all sizes

1404217
canvas	scale
conversly i need to have another canvas that .when its height and width is changed the elements inside are scale appropriately as this will be a resizable icons for use on the same or another canvas

1404217
silverlight	wpf	canvas	scale
if this is not possible in silverlight directly is there anyway of achieving this effect in code if not in xaml as this is possible in wpf if an imagebrush is used however silverlight does not support this and need a scalability canvas and a canvas that .when scale updates it s own height and width

1404224
32-bit	64bit
basically i created a quick and dirty vbscript which simply opens my project files and replace paths to the 32-bit dll reference with paths to the 64bit dlls

1404224
build-process	msbuild
i then updates the cruisecontrol.net configuration file to tell the build-process to execute the batch-file just before msbuild does it s work

1404228
textbox	button
if you types something into that textbox and hit the submit button there s a submit button on the page

1404232
git-repo	repo
i have created a bare git-repo lets call it repo #1 and cloned it

1404232
git-repo	repo
in the clone repo #2 i have created several folder one of which i have decided to make a git-repo repo #3

1404264
logging	trace
.when display is the main purpose tostring should provide a user-friendly text but for logging or rather as you describe it for tracing i would say that you shouldn t be tracing a ui-specific elements in any case but rather an object whose purpose is to write detailed trace data

1404267
callback	methods
this methods now looks up the callback to the client from the dictionary of callback and obtains a reference to it

1404267
callback	methods
the appropriate methods in this case sendtextmessages messages is called on the callback

1404268
entity-framework	ado.net
i am accessing it by ado.net entity-framework

1404271
put	get
if you haven t put any data in the tables yet you won t get much indication of the tables being present

1404287
highlight	selected
unsure which properties of a windowss themes affects this behavior though as all that is mentioned in that tutorial is the selected item highlight .when a windows has focus

1404306
value	field
some of the updates methods are do lock a row like selecte f1 f2 f3 from t1 for updates sets the value for field f1 f2 f3 and issue commit

1404313
websphere	ibm
it s a stand-alone application-server running websphere-portal on top of websphere 6.0 and all stack is install by another ibm product wcl - workplace collaborative learning an e-learning plataform

1404332
contains	elements	traversal	parent
now the elements i would like to find belongs in the same containers .so i can traversal up the dom to the parent and then i want to get at elements s which have the id which contains the text maininputcontrol

1404332
children	nodes
this is what is in the children of the parent nodes input#unanswered input#ctl00_contentplaceholder1_renderingengine_ctl01_0_ctl00_0_ctl00_maininputcontrol.hasdatepicker i would like to get at second of these controls

1404355
linux	osx
also i don t want to invest into a windows license as i run osx and linux only

1404365
zero	nan
here the lower confidence interval for between run cv is less than zero .so reported as nan

1404379
lookup	any
to insert tag associations to your schema you need to fist lookup your tag identifier and create any that don t exist

1404399
contains	elements
if anything represents the viewport it is the concept of the â initial contains blockâ however this is â a level upâ from the root elements and can t be addresses by css or the dom

1404399
background-image	background-color	background-image	transparency	background-color	transparency
for document whose root elements is an html html elements or an xhtml html elements that has computed value of transparency for background-color and none for background-image user agents must instead use the computed value of the background properties from that elements s first html body elements or xhtml body elements child .when painting backgrounds for the canvas and must not paint a background for that child elements

1404399
contains	elements
the â height 100 â rules takes care of the case where a browser follows the standards and doesn t map the root elements s scrollbar onto the viewport this sets the height to match the viewport via the â initial contains blockâ .so there will be no need for the parent viewport to show a scrollbar

1404403
python	java
you would pick mono and perhaps c# for cross platform development for the same reason that someone would pick java or python

1404403
wxpython	pyqt
both qt and wxwidgets have python binding pyqt and wxpython .so you could write cross platform gui code using these libs

1404404
unit-testing	expectations
i am having a problem unit-testing more specifically setting up expectations that an expression will match

1404414
append	input
to take this a little further here s a versioning that provides a dialog box which prompt for the input of the string that will be append to each line in the selection

1404434
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox or google-chrome you can use forwarding and back without refresh between those urls

1404439
double-quotes	single-quotes
replace the double-quotes around with single-quotes

1404442
entity-framework	ado.net
what you have is a valid ado.net connection-string - but it s not a valid entity-framework connection-string

1404442
web-config	app-config
using the edmx-designer should create a valid ef connection-string for you in your web-config or app-config

1404444
data-access	ado.net
it s been a long time since i rolled my own data-access using ado.net and i don t really recommend it now there are .so many great data-access tools available

1404469
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	jsf	wicket	jsf
i have personally evaluated the contenders gwt tapestry and jsf - but wicket makes it really easy to

1404469
jquery	.post
you can see this blog .post on how to integrated yui with wicket the same concepts can easily be extended to jquery

1404475
defined	declare
or you could declare defined it as a const string in a common header of course

1404483
oracle9i	oracle
oracle xml db repository is a feature that has been introduced by oracle9i database release 2 for xml storage and that can be accessed through ftp or http webdav

1404510
xlutils	xlwt
you may wish to approach xlwt via which contains an up-to-date tutorial for xlrd xlwt and xlutils

1404511
python	php
modern webserver support scripting langauges like php python etc

1404515
erlang	python
at home i play around with python and erlang

1404520
python	perl
you then need to register python scriptinging for cgi like is done for perl in the install scripting

1404520
lookup	any
under the corresponding .pl line which would make python another cgi option for the web-console path lookup the lighttpd docs if you want to register .py as cgi in any path

1404520
python	perl
in perl lincoln stein s cgi module is capable of both env and command-line arguments but i m not sure about python

1404525
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
except that i d probably prefer to throw an nullpointerexception if and illegalargumentexception if s contains no legal characters but that s a matter of preferences of course

1404539
value	field
there are two field where i want to pass an arrays value from code-behind using jquery

1404541
order	add
do you just need to add to this order

1404547
firefox	safari
i float them left and right and in firefox and safari they look perfect

1404547
margins	padding
i also tried setting image margins and padding to 0px with no luck

1404557
implements	extends
i m extends exception-handling to implements a setter on the messages properties

1404559
extends	super	constructor-chaining	overrides
and that solves requirements 1 2 and 6 but id does not allow super call new functions overrides parent functions constructor-chaining and dynamically extends a parent does not provide the new methods to a child class

1404575
any	set
to do this first do createchildcontrols identically to the prior page then checked in onprerender if any eventhandler call have been made set any flags you need to and then call this.createchildcontrols manually with the new setup information .so the new table is created and everything is wired up correctly

1404577
parentheses	macros
use parentheses within macros around parameter named

1404577
decrement	increment
never invoke an unsafe macros with arguments contains assignment increment decrement volatile access or function-call

1404579
show	next
for a recent gig we named the release after the consecutive runners up of the dutch versioning of the tv talent show america s next top model

1404606
specifications	w3c
the xml with the attr_value and no is invalid w3c xml specifications and .so all xml tools should complain

1404640
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
ansi syntax supported by sql-server oracle mysql and postgresql

1404654
variables	boolean
.so what i m thinking about is using a servletcontextlistener with a static boolean variables which recording whether a polling cycle is running or not

1404667
value	field
otherwise you may have string value with quotes or comma missing field value or multiple recording formats that sort of thing you should probably look at the csv libs which is already part of the ruby 1.8.6 install or better yet look at the fastercsv gem which replace csv in 1.9 onwards

1404695
defined	declare
procedure and functions may be defined within declare blocks

1404730
textbox	button
if you want .something like a combobox or a date time picker you should create a new control inside this new control place a textbox and a button side by side inside a frame that looks like the frame of a textbox - then restyle the textbox .so it doesn t have a frame

1404750
textbox	button
if you are using strongly typed datasource linke bindingsource to bind to bindingnavigator the add button should work out of the box along with the other button like move first next last previous poistionitem the textbox showing current recording

1404750
selected	button
right click on add button and selected properties from context menu

1404750
selected	button
if the add button is disabled you can enable it by selected enable from context menu on add button

1404755
webforms	asp.net
place the controls on to the webforms for two different purposes and handle the click events of two asp.net server control separately

1404784
shell	tcsh
this might be caused by your shell tcsh

1404807
duplicates	elements
improved code to return the duplicates elements

1404823
derived-class	base-class
a methods which is declare as virtual in the base-class becomes automatically virtual in the derived-class also

1404859
duplicates	elements
to allow duplicates elements as in your example

1404859
duplicates	elements
if you want to remove duplicates elements those items that appear in both lists

1404867
dictionary	map
if you want to add object of simple types like string or double to a resource dictionary today you need to map the needed clr-namespaces to an xml namespaces

1404915
input-field	textbox
the two form approach is fine as long as the forms don t need to shared input-field textbox etc.

1404949
web-services	security
but for some more information regarding security and web-services refer to

1404957
numeric	digits
i have an input file which has rows of numerical digitss close to 2000 rows i want to extraction out the second to the eight digits from the right of every row of the numeric string into a separate file with the result separated by a comma as show

1404965
vba	vb6
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface

1404973
contains	elements
all you need to keep in mind is that elements named are correct and the stuff that formset loads with form.management_form contains up to-date and correct information with how many forms there is

1405007
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu try installing mpgtx

1405025
nested	order
but at this time order is ok but its product and nested stuff is broken since they re lazy-loaded in different session

1405041
show	next
if someone can show me how to accomplish the following - it will go a long way to helping me develop my next project and several similar project down the road

1405057
selected	button
i want that my api how to integrated rim .app with blackberry address book.for example - send an sms messages by selected a contact from bb native address pressing the menu button and choosing option compose sms via xyz .app like we have compose sms

1405073
contains	any
any viruses coming from developers machines are almost certainly due to the combinations of administration rights and developers who downloading additional tools that actually contains the virus

1405079
constructor	object
this is the minimal systemd i use before adding frills passing a special one-off value into the constructor to have it construct an object without initialising it

1405083
contains	elements
you ll want to create model that contains public bindable properties that you can bind to instances of these elements to control their shape and location

1405094
extends	super
category extends the original class but they don t subclassing it therefore a call to super doesn t find the methods

1405094
subclassing	superclass
alternatively you could subclassing the class and then either use the subclassing or use + void poseasclass class aclass to replace the superclass

1405098
png	gif
an alternative to regular images png gif jpg would be to use the w3c recommended svg scalability vector-graphics format

1405098
firefox	opera
as far as i know its currently only natively supported by firefox 3+ and opera 9+ although you can get an adobe svg viewer plugins for ie6-8

1405109
put	get
i have put a breakpoints on updatemodel and looked into the model and the value is in the model as directed i get no error and modelstate is valid too but .when i look into the database the totalcost has not actually been changed for that recording

1405110
g++	gcc
at compiling you should add -l parameters to gcc g++ to specify in which directory the .so files are

1405130
hide	show
in my flex .app i have custom tooltip on button that hide and show based on user context

1405155
getter	setter
you can al.so implements the getter or the setter only .so your variables will be read or write only

1405191
environment	building
also many standards building environment that use configure will allow you to specify an exact libs for each required piece

1405201
.doc	xls
edit the idea is i want to open an xls csv .doc in a c# .app

1405227
append	input
note that input reads a line at a time .so each line append to sfinal needs to have a cr and linefeed append at the end to be written out correctly on a ms windows systemd

1405265
contains	set
you could create a wcf service that creates the output to a given file then returns an object instances that contains information numbers of pages in the file the page size will depend on what you set your buffering size to in the wcf service

1405269
notification-area	tray
what i try to do is to disable enable notification-area tray without restart

1405272
.when	ready
worded more simply this is dependencies multiple call to monitor the function that checked dependencies to completion the action to take .when all is ready

1405300
primitive	boolean
there are of course also literals for all the primitive numeric types and the boolean true and false and chars

1405300
numeric	digits
the numbers of things that can be expressed purely by the nature of the value all digits make a numeric literals or with punctuation is pretty limited by the numbers of punctuation marks that can be reaonably fit on a keyboard

1405336
python	c++
google s commandline-parsing libs for c++ and python

1405343
grouping	sorting
this might be sorting projection applying a predicates grouping etc

1405355
vbscript	vb.net
how do i call a vb.net procedure that is in the code-behind from vbscript

1405373
ruby	php
curious as to how to approach this same problem using ruby ruby-on-rails - fastest way to retrieve a title in php

1405395
value	field
an approach i ve used in a similar situation is if you make use of like rather than column value then you can make use of any value in any combinations of field

1405395
value	field
the main catches to this approach is all the field would need to be string value as like doesn t work with numeric types columns

1405403
google-chrome	opera
oh and opera 9+10 and google-chrome choked on the encoding as well

1405411
restart	reload
is there a way you can tell castle containers to reload a component if its configuration is changed in the xml file without having to restart the web application

1405417
testng	junit
the following java testng junit example would checked that all checkedbox on a page are checkeded

1405432

the equation that you will get is actually quite ugly you will have a whole bunch of sine s and cosine s equals to something

1407395
cosine	sine
write the cosine s and sine s in terms of exponentials using the equality

1407395
cos	sin
e it cos t + i sin t

1407398
environment	execution
the speed of the client computer directly affects the speed of the browser - the scripting execution environment

1407398
environment	execution
a fast browser viewmodel can make a huge difference current execution environment for javascript have vastly different performance characteristics

1407399
gethashcode	equals
since your addresscachekey types overrides the equals and gethashcode methods they would be a good candidate for a key in the dictionary and you would be able to determine whether or not you needed to take a trip to the database to retrieve a recording based on more than one piece of data

1407408
gethashcode	equals
you should overrides equals and gethashcode whenever the default equals tests for reference equality will not suffice

1407408
gethashcode	equals
and you want two points s two be considered equals if their x s are equals and their y s are equals then you will need to overrides equalss and gethashcode

1407410
gethashcode	equals
if you are writing a class that might possibly be used by someone else you will want to defined gethashcode and equals .when reference equals is not enough

1407430
key-value	key
i am trying to add a key-value pair and having trouble adding the key to exception.data

1407464
compression	streaming
in case your client is flexible with what it receives gzip will work better for streaming compression

1407474
configuration	logging
can i specify that new log files should be group-writable in the logging configuration or during logging initialization

1407482
webforms	asp.net
it not only provides things like the automatic process of asp.net webforms mail merges etc

1407510
gethashcode	equals
just to make it clear there is one important thing about and gethashcode dictionary uses gethashcode to determine if two key are equals if is of custom types you should care about implements gethashcode carefully

1407510
gethashcode	equals
based on ergwun s comment i checked the behavior of with special respect to tkey s implementation of equals object and gethashcode

1407530
versioning	upgrade
i wonder how many users still have not upgrade their phones from versioning 2.2.1

.when	ready
the server then call await on it and the thread hits countdown .when it s ready to release its parent

1407556
mp3	wma
it isn t a delphi libs specifically but if mp3 and wma are your key targets then you might also want to checkout the windows media format sdk

1407561
primitive	int	contains	set	getter	setter
if class1 and class2 may in fact contains a null id you want to modify your getter setter to get set int instead of primitive int

1407561
primitive	int
if both class1 and class2 should never contains a null id and you consider this to be a class invariant you may keep the primitive int types in the getter-setter and either

1407561
primitive	int	getter	setter
if class1 may have a null id but class2 may not you should have class1 s getter and setter use an int types instead of an int primitive and you should create a dozer customconverter that returns a default-value .when the source field is null

1407564
directory	folder
the log directory will probably be one or two folder up from the root http folder .so it may not be accessible using the iis user

1407568
gnome	kde
i ve found that gtk apps come closer to looking right in kde than qt apps do in gnome but not by enough to matter

1407579
spaces	output
by default cut uses a tab as a delimiter and subversion may output spaces there

1407579
xargs	cut
.so run everything up to the cut cmd to ensure that you have the list of file named you expect before running it again with | xargs svn rm on the end

1407582
version-control	git
if you re using a modern version-control systemd like git or mercurial i m partials to mercurial branching cloning and merging are trivial operations .so that s what i d recommend

1407587
any	set
checked to see if you have any apps that are 1.1 but the compiler tab is set to 2.0 for them in iis

1407611
selected	cell
if you want to make certain that no rows are selected .when you edit the value of a cell you can handle the cellbeginedit event of the datagridview

1407620
difference	factors
as a sidenote i would not recommend choosing a technology because there is a couple of percent difference of speed on some benchmarking there are far more important factors like how well your team know each technology -- or even the algorithms you are going to use

1407624
python	c++
i am guessing i will have to either find a program which can do the sleeping with threads or write my own in python or c++ which i am not very familiar with

1407644
selected	checkbox
is there a way to add a selected all checkbox to a normals selected list cck in drupal

any	set
the first one can be set to any size you want at runtime and be resize later - you can also free the memory .when you are done

1407732
sweave	latex
for the table aspects the xtable package comes to mind as it can produce latex output which you can use via sweave for professional report as well as html

1407736
uipagecontrol	uiview
the first view could ignore the search bar and above be a uiview with a uipagecontrol below it

1407742
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
lets say i have an asp.net-mvc .app and this .app user-interface references a business-logic-layer bll and the bll references my data-access-layer dal

1407742
authentication	login
if i do this the asp.net-mvc still needs a reference to the membership-provider for authentication and such anyway to take advantage of the login and other asp controls right

1407748
google-chrome	firefox
i m using django with apache and firefox and google-chrome noth die out if i don t limit my search to few enough results

1407767
tcl	lua
i know for a fact that it s extremely simple to add new cmd to interact with the application in tcl and i m told lua is very good at this types of thing too

1407767
tcl	lua
my recommendation would be to play around with lua for a while to see how you like it since you already know tcl .

1407767
tcl	lua
my personal preferences is tcl both because i don t like lua i ve done a reasonable amount of programming in it for warcraft addsons and because i love tcl i ve done a lot of programming in it for both professional and private work

1407779
char-pointer	pointers
finally would be an arrays of 4 pointers - it wouldn t be a char-pointer

1407779
typedef	struct
those use typedef to introduce an ordinary identifier that will refer to the struct too

1407806
.when	ready
just remember that .when you get ready to deploy if your service is going to be hosted on a different machine than your .app you need to deploy the service first

1407807
operators	keyword
you can declare conversion operators on your class using either the explicit or implicit keyword

1407814

is it possible to show hide the scrollbar in a textbox only .when the line count in the textbox is more than the numbers of line display

1407815
administration	account
use an administration account

1407828
attributes	properties
the id properties of a control can only be set using the id attributes in the tag and a simple value

1407835
configuration	logging
i also discovered that to reference the custom handler from a logging configuration file i had to bind my module to the logging namespace

1407842
any	set
this module relies on the built-in jquery features of drupal and does not required any additional modules other than the cck module set drupal 7 versioning has no dependencies

1407851
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms apps is there not any kind of maintenance user-interface page to edit and maintain the .profile properties of a user i m using vs2008 and the web application templates like in the wsat website administratration tool where you already can edit the basic membership and role properties for a user

1407863
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
return results in varying formats json xml csv raw text

1407897
scons	cmake	autotools	cmake	autotools	scons
it derives from the concepts of other build-tools such as scons autotools cmake or ant

1407908
value	field
on top of that the default .profile provider stores all the .profile information in one concatenation field .so you d end up with a list of comma-separated value if they went for a really basic form

1407909
put	get
i am sure i am probably doing something silly here involving scoping but i can t quite put my finger on it the error i get is this

1407924
firefox	safari
this works very well in firefox and safari but they do not work at all for ie

1407925
realloc	malloc	realloc	strlen	strcpy	puts
if you want to accumulate an arrays of strings instead of just process them one by one puts b above then you ll need to get your hands dirty with realloc malloc strcpy and strlen

1407937
getter	setter
the actions are separate classes but i m creating a new instances of them in the view passing the view into the action s constructor and providing getter and setter on the view which the action call directly

upgrade project we will be upgrading to the newest versioning

1407976
jquery	.post
i use jquery s ajax .post methods to send the data to a controllers

1407979
key-value	key
to find a key-value pair you would have to search the list from the beginning until a matching key was found

1407979
key-value	key
to insert a key-value pair in the hashtable you will first have to compute the hashcode of the key

1407979
key-value	key
to locate the index in this arrays where the key-value pair will be stored you have to compute the hashcode of the key modulo the size of the arrays

1407989
jquery	.post
as an alternative have you considered a jquery .post .so that you don t have to fill the model again

1408005
cursor	row
how do you find the location of the little blink cursor where the user can types column and row

1408008
stderr	stdout
alternatively you can also pass subprocess.pipe to the stderr and stdout to suppress the messages

1408017
signals	sigpipe
if you re blocked in a write or try to write on a socket closed by the other end your process will recieve a sigpipe signals and write will return -1 with errno set to epipe

1408023
value	field
for example a valid productid value exists in a customerid field due to the software insert the wrong key in the wrong column

1408027
cassini	iis
this will work well with cassini the visual-studio development webserver but you will need to make an additional change to your iis website virtual directory

1408033
python	perl	shell	bash
you can al.so use shell scripting perl python bash whatever in the user scripting menu but these process only the selection or the whole file .so might be a bit heavyweight for moving a single line up or down

1408037
checkbox	button
i need to create a checkbox programmatically in cocoa and .when i try and make a button with buttontype set to nsswitchbutton it display the title i gave it but not checkbox

1408038
cucumber	webrat
i am on ruby-on-rails 2.2.2 cucumber 0.3.98 webrat 0.4.4

1408051
json	xml
however if you have a lot of data which you are generator a browser will timeout if you wait to massage all of the data into a suitable form whether json xml or html before sending it all out

1408054
vb.net	vba
last instruction works in vba or vb.net i think why doesn t it work on c#

1408061
securitymanager	classloader
top it off with a custom securitymanager .so you can base access checked on which classloader in use

1408063
openoffice.org	uno
there are also some pretty technical docs of how the openoffice.org uno stuff gets mapped onto .net concepts in the cli binding here

1408065
mousedown	mouseup
i have assign the mouseup and mousedown events of a button btnright below

1408071
dictionary	arrays
i m assuming you mean a dictionary as in a list of words and not the associativity arrays meaning

1408078
selected	cell
the problem is that on some of these cell the content does not appear at all or does not appear correctly until after the cell was selected for the first time

1408078
selected	cell
this view does not appear at all before i selected the cell and its views were redraw

1408079
put	get
you can even get emacs to tell xcode where to put a breakpoints i don t remember how but i asked a question here a while back and it works great

1408084
sql-server	ms-access	ready	live
i have an application that is ready to go live once we take data from a ms-access db and import it into sql-server 2005

1408084
put	get
i have used the migration - access tool to get the access db into sql-server but now i need to take the data from that table and put it into the tables that our .app is going to use

1408126
background-color	border-color
i ve read and used the code here which illustrates how to change the background-color and border-color of a uitableviewcell in grouping mode on the iphone

1408156
xsd	xml
but an xsd is no requirement to create xml and apparently it doesn t use one

1408163
primitive	int
in fact since most jvms run on 32-bit machines the int primitive is the most efficient types to deal with

1408163
primitive	int
however in the case of single primitive value such as int or byte the ultimate spaces occupied at runtime doesn t really matter as long as the behavior is consistent with the specifications

1408181
decimal	hex
the last byte is 7b in hex which is 123 in decimal

1408183
dfa	nfa
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

1408226
32-bit	64bit
the error indicates that iis is in 64bit mode while this application is a 32-bit application and thus not compatible

1408234
stderr	stdout
remember you can redirect stdout and or stderr to pipe and thus it won t be printed to the screens but the output is still available for reading by your python program

1408234
stderr	stdout
by default stdout and stderr are both none which means no redirection which means they will use the same stdout stderr as your python program

1408238
has-many-through	model
sure in a jointable you want to delete recording but what about the join model of a has-many-through maybe not

1408260
64bit	x86
for that you ll want to do three cmd to create 2 files in tmp the first contains a list of powerpc files and the second a list of 32 or 64bit x86 files

1408269
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove	onmousemove	onmouseup
this is impossible unfortunately - you can remove the whole border though and then draw your own on the form and use onmousedown onmouseup and onmousemove to do your own dragging.

1408281
chown	chmod
chmod chown and chgrp

1408287
linux	unix
on some unix systemd such as linux

1408290
callback	methods
what you need to do is apply the css properties after the load completes using the callback of the load methods

1408291
value	field
this should wrap the field to as many line as are needed to fit the value in

1408324
button	popup
.so i have a popupbutton and .when i click on the button i want the menu that popup to have rounded corners

1408326
parsing	comma
am i doomed to having to do str strpoints and then have myprog.exe parsing this for comma apostrophes etc

1408328
constructor	object
you then get the bytes and pass them to the constructor of a string object to convert them preferably specifying the encoding

1408342
selected	checkbox
i d like it to clear all the checkbox inside the div .company_1 .company_2 etc if someone selected a different option

1408353
constructor	object
if you need instances object to know named of its constructor it should be trivial to implements similar piggybacking with some kind of abstraction

1408372
udp	tcp
and you need to poke holes in the firewall to allow incomming packets to the sql broswer udp 1433 and the express listenning ports tcp ports-number it depends as is usually dynamic for named instances

1408385
contains	set
for the basic ascii character set normals characters like t the binary representation is the same in most common encoding including utf-8 .so if a file contains only basic ascii characters file has no way to tell which of the many ascii-compatible encoding was intended

1408419
children	nodes
is it possible that you re using none to indicate this nodes has no children and you aren t handling that case correctly

1408428
contains	any
this is specially true if any arguments contains a spaces character which is quite common for filenames

1408439
contains	any
also utf-8 is very well-designed and gives you several properties for instances some characters are encode with 1 byte some with 2 3 or 4 - but a 4-byte character will never contains the bytes of any shorter character and nor will a 3 or 2 byte character

1408441
environment	execution
you can argue the theoretical aspects of the fact that any language can technically be interpreter or compiled but as it stands the current implementation are such that php code required an interpreter to run and the interpreter manages the execution environment

1408442
floor	ceil
it will also fit in ceil n 3 floor n+2 3 decimal digits since 2 3 8 is less than 10

1408450
cvs	git	version-control	git	version-control	cvs
any version-control svn git even cvs master it and use it.

1408479
push	pull
i push and pull between them to keep the current .so no matter which one i m at i ve got the newest versioning

1408482
selected	cell
click on a particular cell of the table would selected that date and time for creating a new reservation

1408492
put	get
but if i put in a form that points to the scheduling page with methods as get hitting a submit button with no other input or value just takes them straight to the page like it was a link

1408493
temporary	copy
use a different scratchpad managedobjectcontext for temporary object and .when you decide to really save then push a copy in the main managedobjectcontext

1408508
32-bit	64bit
my guess is you re compiling 32 64bit universal but the libs itself is only 32-bit

1408514
moss	wss
all the tutorials vs.net add-on and sdk s i ve discovered .so far required vs.net 2005 2008 to be running on the same physical box as the wss 3.0 or moss 2007 server install hence windows-server 2003 or 2008

1408519
ftp	ssh
i rarely use ftp to deploy now because i just checkout my code through ssh

1408566
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms i created a httphandler to do this and added verbs in the web-config for all image extensions to pass-through the handler

1408592
abstract-class	superclass	abstract-class	pure-virtual
in some oo languages the interface is a superclass and is called an abstract-class or a pure-virtual class

1408602
ruby-on-rails	django
i m looking for something similar to ruby-on-rails migrations and django s south

1408641
scrollbar	marquee
i ve seen giva labs marquee scrollbar and serialscroll but can t figure out how to get it to scroll text in a div from side to side

1408642
json	xml
also would you be able to .post the xml or json your asp.net .app is returning it would helps

1408703
entity-framework	ado.net
it is well supported by microsoft and is used on several project including asp.net-mvc and soon the ado.net entity-framework

1408710
python	tcl	python	c++
the shelloid thing in question might be written in python or in c or tcl or... using the pty module of the standard-library or higher-level abstraction based on it such as pexpect and the fact that the two programs to be connect via a pty-based pipeline are written in c++ and python is pretty irrelevant

1408710
subprocess	pexpect
of course it would be easier to provide a points solution by writing python_program in the knowledge that it must spawn cpp_program as a subprocess and trick it into believing its stdout is a terminal python_program would then directly use pexpect for example

1408711
ubuntu-server	opensuse
edit or do i have to change my server environment to ubuntu-server or opensuse

1408712
json	xml
i would like to copy xml using xslt into json

1408717
fflush	stdout
you may want to try fflush ing the stdout streaming in the cpp program

1408730
fflush	stdout
what you need is for your c program to call fflush stdout after every line

1408752
implements	extends
you can have them implements a common interface or extends the same base possibly abstract-class

1408763
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
for example it supports all of the variations in named-capture syntax found in perl python php and .net

1408780
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework windows-mobile compatible

1408782
transparency	frame
theoretically you could place each image on a separate frame of the animation leaving most of that frame transparency and set the pause time between frame to 1ms

1408786
fflush	gets
even .when i put it into tempdata it gets lost since tempdata is fflush on each separate request

1408802
children	nodes
or you could allocate a block of them and just have each pointsers in children points to sequential elements inside this block -- but it s still one extra dynamic-memory-allocation per nodes creation and a corresponding extra deallocation step on destructor

1408813
.net	wcf
the batch-file starts and stops a locally running .net windows wcf service

1408818
arguments	default
in my case i happen to be able to compare each arguments against its default to find the ones that are different but this is kind of inelegant and gets tedious .when you have nine argumentss

1408818
default-value	arguments
for bonus points provide an incantation that can tell me even .when the caller passes in a keyword arguments assign its default-value

1408829
any	set
just set stdout to be line buffering at the beginning of your c program before performing any output like this

1408829
fflush	stdout
if it is block bufferinging then the buffering will be fflush .when it is full or .when you call fflush stdout

1408837
pixels	line
for this image i just went with an alternating checkerboard pattern with the line two pixels wide

1408837
pixels	line
angled line are a bit tricky but basically you imagine the edges of the line sort of cutting through pixels and thus you draw them at the appropriate shade of grade instead of full black in the case of the 45 degree line here the pixels are draw with rgb 170 170 170 but any angle could be rendering with appropriate shades

1408860
contains	any
the rea.son arguments should be a copy of the locals dictionary is that dictionary are mutable .so if you created any local-variables in this function arguments would contains all of the local-variables and their value not just the arguments

1408863
protected	public
a child class inherited any protected or public properties and methods of its parent

1408872
prism	mef
for functionality two very popular choices are the managed extensibility framework mef and the composite application guidance prism

1408878
arrays	loops
if you want a potentially jagged multi-dimensional arrays which is a 1d arrays of 1d arrayss then you have to loops

1408892
multiplication	division
are there small code optimization that the compiler thinks unsafe but is okay here converting division to multiplication by the reciprocal

1408897
postgresql	rdbms
versioning 2.8.1 and postgresql 8.4.1 but i cannot connect gnu r to my rdbms

1408916
graphviz	doxygen
it s almost certainly overkill but you can do this for c++ php java c# and more with doxygen if you have graphviz dot install

1408953
fogbugz	trac
if you ve got people who aren t programmers using it you ll probably have better luck with it than even something like trac or fogbugz

1408963
uitableview	uiview
you could then add your uitableview and your uiview the the uiviewcontroller s view instances

1408963
uitableview	uiview
i d then make your uiviewcontroller subclassing implements the uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource protocols - you ll end up with something that looks similar code-wise to your old uitableviewcontroller subclassing but it s view properties will be the underlying uiview instead of uitableview instances if you poke around in the debugger you can see the uitableviewcontroller view and uitableviewcontroller tableview return the same object

1409006
children	tree
currently the hsm is implements as a tree where each state can have a variables numbers of states as children

1409009
windows-server	windows
it appears you need to install the windows sdk windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

1409012
calloc	malloc
you might ask like calloc does for a pair of arguments size of items in bytes and numbers of items rather than just one size in bytes like malloc does

1409014
exception-handling	error-handling
the highest level of code might just catch serious fatal exception-handling and lower levels might catch exception-handling that can be dealt with with some error-handling logic

1409026
datagrid	textbox
how i can add the multiple value from a datagrid to textbox in c#

1409026
textbox	button	datagrid	textbox
in my project it include a datagrid a textbox and a button

1409026
textbox	button	selected	button	selected	textbox
after that .when i click the one entry followed by hitting the add button the selected value will be populate in textbox by seperating a comma

1409030
contains	any
problem is i am getting value in lbltablevalue in js.but in code behid it does not contains any value its value is .can anybody help to get the value containss in hdntablevalue in click event in code-behind

1409038
attributes	properties
as far as dom peculiarities in real xhtml document i ve heard that some things like document.write don t work and that accessing nodes attributes should always be performed via getattribute setattribute rather than via simpler properties accessor

1409047
value	field
and you can access the field value in c# code-behind

1409059
selected	checkbox
i have an admin form builder that dynamically creates the static form input eg selected radio checkbox and a couple of more complex input as well i need to create corresponding javascript event handler using jquery

1409063
dependency-injection	singleton
it might be overkill if you re just doing a small application but a dependency-injection framework like spring can give you singleton behavior without the need to manually construct and initializer the static object by hand

1409063
dependency-injection	singleton
the dependency-injection containers will construct and wire you singleton and its dependency classes together and can be configure to make your object a singleton instances within the containers

1409068
contains	any
are there any performance issues if an sql query contains lot of join

1409086
credentials	security
the pros of this approach was that we never collected anyone s credentials .so any concern of security would have been alleviated

1409089
put	get
make sure you get all those dll s from the same odp.net odac distribution to avoid versioning numbers conflicts and put them all in the same folder as your exe

1409101
keyboard	mouse
here assume xml as a registry computer is a registry key and it have keyboard mouse harddisk these are subkeys to computer

1409104
any	set
start by printing out paths documentsdirectory myplistpath and arr the addresses not the contents immediately after you set them to see if any of them have been set to null

1409112
contains	elements
data.slice 0 10 will generator a new arrays contains the first 10 elements of the original one

1409117
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
it s a javascript libs which provides svg support on many browsers including internet-explorer firefox and safari

1409120
show	next
i am creating a time picker user-controls that first show a button for the current day then the next few days

1409126
any	set
.so far i have install the program install it and tried to set it up following many tutorials and reading the help file i still get this error no matter what i try to do i even searched .so and google for this same error and i found many results i was unsuccessful in finding a .solution though does anyone have any ideas this is very frustraing maybe i was meant to never use svn

1409127
pagespeed	yslow
there s also pagespeed which does similar things to yslow

1409130
contains	set
also if you want it to be contains within 1 line set the maxlines setting to 1 too

1409143
finite-state-machine	state-machines
however it seems that you are describing an fsm finite-state-machine implementation where you have multiple state-machines

1409144
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have rewritten all my web-applications from webforms to asp.net-mvc

1409144
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think if i built my project from scratch in asp.net-mvc it would take a little longer then in webforms

1409152
google-chrome	firefox
this is going well on ie8 and google-chrome but not in firefox

1409154
hide	show
the application works fine but i want to hide the browser menu option .so that user cannot save or printing the test .when the quiz page is show

1409166
defined	declare
we don t need to declare variables and don t need to defined data types of variabless and function return

1409169
switching	screens
.net website i would like to add button by which user can view the page in full screens mode and switching back to normals mode

1409179
uilabel	uiview
i created a uiview and a uilabel outlet for the xib

1409195
solaris	linux	signals	sigint
the chapter integration signals and exception-handling of the troubleshooting guide for hotspot viewmodel mentions the signalss sigterm sigint sighup only for solaris os and linux

1409207
where-clause	sql
if the sql engine you re using has no such handy function then you have to building an query-specific where-clause based on the sort order

1409207
selected	button
in your next button you pass this user_name back to the server and the query for the next call is selected .

1409212
jquery	dojo
they have polluted the global named spaces a lot with modules that don t start with dojo yahoo or jquery

1409216
keydown	keyup
i would like to write a simple c program that will perform different actions based on both keydown and keyup events

1409218
for-loop	arrays
.so if you must create for example inside a for-loop 4 arrayss from the same arrays and you want to use the same function you can only test against a properties of the class you must previously set to the value you want to test

1409221
ruby	php
server scripting php asp ruby etc

1409241
duplicates	elements
.so the idea is you don t duplicates insurance_item -- you have another table to store the elements that would be changed and slap a timestamp with it represent that change as a relationship

1409250
google-chrome	firefox
i managed to get it to work with firefox and ie - i couldn t in google-chrome though it appears that it supports the dom methods

1409283
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that everything is going well in google-chrome and mozilla firefox but in ie8 .some time it works ans .sometime its not and .when it worked in i8 .sometime then it takes long time rather than i set the interval and need that the response will be correct .so now i am confusing that is ie8 caching the xmlhttp and the same result is show from its caching .so .something else

1409295
arguments	default
set the keyword arguments of f2 to the key in d and the default value to the value of d

1409297
contains	elements
depending on what you re trying to achieve a better solution might be to change add a class to a contains elements body would do

1409313
retaincount	dealloc
if the retaincount of the uiview hit zero then it is dealloc ed and it release the children of the uiview

1409313
uilabel	uiview
if uilabel is on uiview it too is release

1409321
any	set
is there any way to set empty string as default-value in core data

1409329
order	join
do i need to follow any order in writing the sql join

1409338
background-color	transparency
you should create tophoverview with alpha 1.0 and a transparency background-color

1409343
implements	sealed
given sealed class a which implements interfacea

1409382
arguments	default
because you are relying on a dynamic default you never need to send a real arguments to the view

1409396
highlight	selected
user enters a string and i highlight all occurrences using a combinations of find and selected which is great but now i want the ability for a user to press next and the next higlighted instances should be visible say 2at 3rd of the bounding rectangle i would even settle for at the top of the bound

1409416
python	php
unfortunately i don t know of any methods in python that tries to guess the image types by reading some magic bytes the way fileinfo does in php

1409416
dictionary	map
what i d do in this case is to building that python dictionary to map file extensions to image mime-types and than try to load the image while expecting for a notimageerror exception-handling

1409419
revision	updates
you go back and get the file at the state it was in at revision 50 using updates to revision then re-merge it with the current versioning if there have been any subsequent changes you want to keep

1409419
revision	updates
otherwise you can just do your updates to revision then recommit the file

1409451
global-asax	web-config
a create a global connection object using global-asax retrieving the connection-string from web-config

1409454
data-structures	map
i was wondering if there is a better way than this because as far as i can tell in this case-when i want to insert a key that is not present yet i perform 2 lookup in the map data-structures one for find one in the insert which corresponds to the operators

1409455
boost-test	cppunit
after a while i ported all my cppunit tests to boost-test this took about a day and i haven t looked back

1409465
default-value	default	default-value	arguments	arguments	default
if the mapped types isn t default constructible then make f provide a default-value or add another arguments to get_else_compute

1409479
continuous-integration	build-server
i ve set up a 64bit tfs 2008 build-server with sharepoint continuous-integration and out-of-the-box mstest

1409479
32-bit	64bit
the next culprit could be that the unit tests were being run with a 32-bit process which couldn t access the 64bit sharepoint-api properly

1409486
linux	bsd
run it from a different machine preferably a bsd or linux machine with no firewall rules that will limit the performance of the tool

1409500
simulator	platform
i can add the frameworks by adding the sdk-specific ones going into developer platform iphoneos.platform ...yadayadayada.. frameworkd but then of course i can only compile for the iphone platform and not for the simulator any more

1409505
for-loop	loops
however if you don t like that the upper bound variables used only in loops is accessible outside loops you can take advantage of the initialization phase of the for-loop like this

1409523
contains	set
i have a collections in my model that contains a set of previous versioning of my root domain-object

1409523
associations	model
in performance critical code refactor your model to use only many-to-one associations

1409523
associations	model
i am new to all of this and am not 100 sure on how to refactor your model to use only many-to-one associations

1409539
click	mouse
in a quest for handling events like mouse move and click not by subclassing one has to use installeventfilter and provide an event handler

1409547
implements	extends
if it does then the generator proxy will also implements those interfaces but it will not extends the target bean s class

1409562
sequences	unique
i m thinking i want to use boost-mpl s extensible associativity sequences since each elements gets it s own unique identifier but i think i need to be able to alter the sequences in-place which insert doesn t do

1409570
value	field
oracle sql developer allows you to updates field value directly to the table without needing to write a sql scripting

1409570
value	field
however it doesnt allow you to set a null value for a field

1409570
any	set	value	field
any idea how to set a null value to a field in the table without writing an updates statement

1409580
contains	any
they have some limitations - they tend not to work if the exe doesn t already contains any resource-files at all but most install tool generator exe files contains at least a versioning info resource

1409582
primitive-types	generics
and i believe that just introducing collections wrapper for primitive-types and generics will not improve maintainability and clarity

1409587
environment	building
for less rich environment which i classify as anything without a full os you should just building and run on the hosts

1409635
observers	listener
you have a pull-oriented observable listenable which notifies observers listener .when some state changes

1409635
observers	listener
the state consists of more than one nugget of data and some of your observers listener don t care about the whole state

1409635
observers	listener
do you generally prefer to notify all the observers listener anyway and allow them to ignore notifications .when nothing they care about changed

1409635
observers	listener
or do you generally prefer a seperate observable for each nugget of data .so that your observers listener are guaranteed to only get notifications they need to respond to

1409639
fflush	gets
this could be useful in that .when your reads catch up to your writes the thread performing the reads may pause while the write buffering gets fflush

1409649
display	height
i ve tried setting s line-height and height with display block i also googled and stack overflow-ed briefly but did not find any solution

1409651
any	set
are there any project dependencies set between your project and the wcf project

1409665
lookup	any
with byte_t as with any other aptly named types there rarely ever is a need to lookup what it is defined to and if .so a good editor will take 3secs to look it up for you

1409667
revision	svn	revision	updates
svn updates gives me the right-updatesd revision

1409707
carbon	cocoa
as setfanb says why use carbon now any new .app should start with cocoa

1409712
32-bit	64bit
if the gem was built before you upgrade you will probably have to rebuild it 32-bit then 64bit now

1409720
value	field
the second one should only return one recording with the maximum index value provided your index field is unique within this table

1409720
value	field
the first query will return all table rows for each two field the id and the same maximum value of index

1409721
32-bit	64bit
edit after comment i don t have direct experience with this but can t think of any reason there would be a problem between 32-bit and 64bit

1409721
configuration	environment
please look closely at any difference in environment and configuration

1409727
variables	boolean
if your views have a member variables storing the url and a boolean to say whether it is loaded it d be easy to know whether to call fetchdrawableonthread or not for example

1409729
linux	osx
i m working on porting a windows-only application to linux and eventually to mac osx

1409739
json	xml
else json or xml

1409740
silverlight	wpf
originally this was intended only for wpf but people such as laurent bugnion and myself have added functionality project that mean this will be a silverlight compatible framework as well

1409740
silverlight	wpf
if you think that you might want to support silverlight from the same codebase then the wpf only frameworks should be discounted

1409768
windows-server	windows
if you want free you could set up your own ca windows-server has one and add its self signed certificate to you trusted roots in your windows user .profile which ie uses

1409774
google-chrome	firefox
but that didn t work on google-chrome or firefox

1409791
versioning	staging
we have a staging versioning of our web application it is basically a subversioning working copy that no-one works on that lives in apps software

1409792
windows-hosting	hosting
you ll need to find a hosting provider that offers windows-hosting plans with asp and sql-server options

1409796
data-members	instances	data-members	constructor
in particular local and global-variables must be initializer where they are defined and references which are data-members of class instances must be initializer in the initializer-list of the class s constructor

1409814
primitive	int
now an int must always have a value since it is a primitive .so struts will put 0 in it and fail silently

1409814
value	field
.when you will use that field with the value 0 you wonâ t know if you had an error or the user insert 0 on his own

1409829
any	set
during retriving files from the ftp site under same connection we havent set any timeout

1409845
default	reset
there is a setting in that allows you to reset the default display of null columns

1409846
contains	elements	contains	any
if you want to cause a block to expand to contains all it s floating content then adding an extra elements of any types is the dirtiest option

1409861
contains	any
.so by definition any file contains that character is not a valid xml file

1409866
runas	cmd
i believe you can use the runas dos cmd in a pinch if you can t find something else

1409876
execute	declare	defined	declare
tags or the newer jsp declaration tags to defined methodss the variables are created and initializer .when the declare methods is execute

1409882
webforms	asp.net
my team started working on the .app few months ago and the decision was to building it with asp.net webforms

1409882
webforms	asp.net
now we ve quite a lot of the code developed and we re wondering if asp.net webforms was a good choice

1409882
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is it possible to add somehow asp.net-mvc application to current webforms one

1409884
contains	any
most of the work is done with the system.net..sockets..socket class the documentation contains a sample the api is very similar to the bsd .socket api overall largely there is a 1 1 mapping from bsd api to .socket or help types methods .so any background should be easily translatable

1409891
temporary	copy
the reference extends the lifetime of the temporary it s bound to but the first line makes its a copy

1409897
shell	bash
you clearly have the alias cmd stick it in your .bashrc and it will be set up .when your bash shell starts

1409901
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc can live happily together

1409907
asp.net-mvc	webforms
mixing asp.net-mvc with webforms is not that all hard

1409928
contains	elements
the file contains an xml document with a compressed b64-encoded content elements in it

1409930
decimal-point	digits
the rules are input should start with either digits s or decimal-point and then either decimal-point or digits s

1409989
tcl	lua
i ve used both lua and tcl embedded in games online games incidentally and i wouldn t touch tcl again with a 10 bargepole if i had the choice

1409989
tcl	lua
my very subjective opinion is that lua is a sane language and tcl isn t

1409989
tcl	lua
if this scripting interface is purely for you then you may as well go with tcl because lua won t offer you anything new unless object orientation is your thing

1410017
textarea	textbox
note multiline textbox is rendering using html tag .so we will specify the css styles for the textarea elements types

1410028
attributes	properties	getter	setter
but in f# as i try to set attributes on properties getter and setter i cannot get around a syntax-error

1410028

my goal is to set distinct attributes on the getter and setter

1410051
show	next
other branches of next pu is also not show here

1410071

1410122
dictionary	arrays
after formatting you can put the resulting string and the arrays of object into a dictionary with the string as key

1410129
revision	updates
the answer by gabriel hurley that you have currently had accepted doesn t make sense it is not possible to commit after doing an updates to revision

1410129
revision	updates
you want the revert to revision or revert changes from revision features not updates to revision

1410143
environment	building
for less rich environment which i classify as anything without a full os you should just building and run on the hosts

1410154
value	field
if i change the value in the field again and click save the value is saved correctly however the saved. messages as above does not show

1410190
push	pull
the gang of four book has a section for this very problem and they advise against both the push and the pull model

1410190
push	pull
the pull model may be inefficient the push model may not be reusable enough

1410191
subtract	add
worse case scenario you could checked to see if the string is 16 characters that begins with an 8-f and if .so change that to the equivalent character w o the most significant bitset subtract 8 from that digits parsing the result and add the parsing value to the lower-bound of a signed long

1410204
python	java
python though not as overtly typed as c or java is still typed and will throw exception-handling if you re doing things with types that simply do not play nice together

1410212
repository	entity
this model binder finds the appropriate repository and looks up the entity with the passed id

1410220
hotmail	gmail
it is a widely used tool maybe not by gmail or hotmail but i ve seen it used in several big companies and or universities which is both powerful and works very well

1410224
value	field
a form s recordset field value

1410224
value	field
you cannot read these value through form s controls but you can access them throught the corresponding field in the recordset

1410225
macros	vba
it would be nice to have the alternative of building macros in .net rather than being stuck to vba

1410227
radio-button	selected
while doing manually we can selected the radio-button - copy this application onto every target for me in the source accessibility section of install application assistant

1410238
keyword	term
out-of-memory is a very misleading search term even .when coupled with oledb and other possible keyword tho i might be missing something

1410250
versioning	upgrade
this has happened to me many time particularly after an upgrade to a new versioning of the sdk and iphone os

1410257
triggers	insert
in an updates or insert triggers new will represent the recording of the new database row

1410257
triggers	insert
therefore it seems like you need to create an insert or updates triggers that looks at the value of old.is_active and new.is_active

1410272
python	c++
i m currently writing python binding for a c++ libs i m working on

1410313
attributes	properties
there s al.so a excel sheeet with all attributes that the winnt provider exposes - it s a lot less than what the ldap provider has .so i m not sure if you ll be able to set all the properties you re looking for

1410321
hide	show
and all use the gotab function to show or hide a specific div

1410321
hide	show

pyro	rpyc
i am looking for a remote procedure call engine for python and i ve found that pyro python remote object and rpyc remote python call are both the kind of thing i am searching for

1410342

if you reference an external configuration file that contains .appsettings leaving everything else in the normals .app-configuration then i believe editing it only reload those settings it doesn t force the whole .app to restart

1410342
web-config	app-config
nested app-config web-config files

1410343
carbon	cocoa
besides i tell you from experience that cocoa is much easier than carbon

you need to prepare the value before you stick them into the value clause or change it to an insert-into .

1410363
double-quotes	single-quotes
edit and use single-quotes not double-quotes

1410369
configuration	logging
it looks like you just need to call the overloaded versioning of this passing in details of a configuration file - you basically just want to configurationure the logging from within the com dll

1410376
integrated-security	connection-string
also application-pool identity must be running with these credentials and connection-string must be set to integrated-security

1410396
put	get
also if you get an error saying headers have already been sent just put ob_start

1410410
selected	listbox
i thought about using a listbox which will contains only the selected item but this seems to be very bad.

1410414
http	ssl
this makes sense otherwise a man-in-the-middle attacker could simply respond to a user s http request with a redirect to http or a different http site and take over the browsing session defeating the purpose of ssl

1410422
worksheet	excel
i have an excel addin written in c# that import a text file into excel worksheet

1410424
arrays	loops
you need to loops over the and variables arrays to get all the variables

1410453
font-size	height
what sets the height of the textbox line height or font-size

1410473
font-size	height
if it s then it s a combinations of font-size line-height and any explicit declare height attributes

1410477
bison	yacc
i know and use bison yacc

1410486
attributes	properties
it.named means get properties named from the object that can be found as a namedd attributes it

1410511
configuration	installation
looking at the eclipse configuration via help - about eclipse - installation details - configuration it seems like eclipse is picking up the jvm configuration details from somewhere else

1410573
digits	base
edit this works for any base if you replace 10 with the correct base and adjust the obtaining of the digits from the corresponding character should work as is for base lower than 10 but would need a little adjusting for higher base - like hexadecimal - since letters are separated from numbers by 7 characters

1410573
digits	base
for higher numbers base the letters are used as digits a-f in hexa but letters start from 65 0x41 hexa which means there s a gap that we have to account for

1410582
comet	chat
additionally google chat uses a comet styles implementation instead of a polling implementation

1410588
screen-orientation	portrait
screen-orientation selected either portrait or landscape - whichever is desired

1410671
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
once your file is a real csv you can open it in openoffice.org calc spreadsheet or really any other spreadsheet program for ubuntu gnome

1410680
deep-copy	object
to copy relationships a deep-copy not a shallow one you need a recursive procedure in which you always take care that you are not copying again the same object over and over again if ever met again during the recursion step

1410688
directory	folder
i then create the registry directory entries and assign this newly created user full access to the appropriate sub key folder

1410701
iprincipal	iidentity
forms auth also creates an iidentity iprincipal object on the execution thread which means you can use cas principalpermission demands to protect methods classes and even assemblies which can be separated from your asp.net application making authentication the cross cutting concern it should be

postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
rodbc which is very mature and feature-complete but doesn t correspond to the dbi framework as the postgresql mysql sqlite oracle .

1410756

as a historical note the original netscape navigator on linux unix was a statically linked big fat executable

1410781
double	int
edit okay my initial tests used an int data types instead of double

1410804
meta-inf	jar
if you want to change your existing jars without re-building them the easiest way is probably to just do as mad-j suggested and open them with a zip tool and edit the existing meta-inf manifest.mf file and save it back into the jar

1410812
any	set
what sdl does .when you set fullscreen mode and your target re.solution is not the desktop re.solution is to make sure you are using the proper monitor frequency for fullscreen mode by simply telling the drivers to apply the frequency that the desktop has been using which runs in fullscreen .so its refresh rate will work with any re.solution in fullscreen mode

1410819
type-safety	generics
it became clear in my project that i d have to remove compile-time type-safety for a large portion of the codebase go from generics to system.object

if you do something sufficiently complex on the client say you manage priorities between and and or you can nest conditional using parentheses ... then you re probably already building a data structure that handles this on the client

1411013
credentials	account
on .some servers they will have windows-authentication account for the sql-server database server .so using imper.sonate their credentials should be used

1411033

1411128
spaces	output
if it s off a spaces is output

1411128
parentheses	operators
while i d prefer to use for even odd checked and that is what i use everywhere else the operators has too low precedence to use here without adding parentheses

i ve also come across a .post by ayende which uses the formula attributes for the properties i ve never used it but looks like it might fit the bill

1411260
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
.so you could have a case-sensitive column in a case-insensitive database

1411263
dialog	pop-up
the rea.son for this is that the flash player is single-threaded and .so you are blocking the user-interface from reacting to the dialog pop-up until the maths chunks is finished

1411270
triggers	insert
an after insert triggers should do the trick

1411296
key-events	keydown
i d suggest attaching listener to key-events fired by the editable elements though you need to be aware that keydown and keypress events are fired before the content itself is changed

1411296
webkit	blink
at the time of writing it is supported for contenteditable elements in current mozilla from firefox 14 and webkit blink browsers but not ie

constructor	object
especially this means that you can t successfully call shared_from_this in the constructor since the object is just being construct and is not yet owned by any shared_ptr instances

1411468
constructor	object
to work around it you best move the code that attaches the alarm from the constructor to a separate methods that gets called after the object is completely construct

1411469

1411830
while-loop	cursor
is there any way except cursor and while-loop to accomplish this

1411838

1411889
sharpziplib	dotnetzip
edit dotnetzip and sharpziplib support encryption

1411891
derived-class	base-class
the principal rea.son that you can t is that typically derived object are a different size to their base-classes .so attempting to access the arrays as an arrays of base-class object will not use the correct offset to get a pointers to the next base-class subobject of the next member of the derived-class arrays

1411893
constructor	object
in practice it tends to mess with virtual function-calls and it means the destructor will be run twice and more often than the constructor member object are shallow copy-paste .so if for example if you try this stunt with a std vector it blows up as multiple object end up points to the same internal array.

1411934
keydown	keyup
for example i ve seen people regularly using keyup keydown keypress events to disallow various characters and then forgetting that people regularly use copy-and-paste which negates the intended validation

1411951
json	xml
2 examine the state of your form with javascript and wrap the information into json or xml and instead of .posting the form-data .post just the data structure

1411961
linked-list	nodes
other examples would be linked-list nodes

1411961
constructor	object
in general i would avoid attempting to use this properties as it can lead to some very hard to debugging errors and prefer the object oriented calling copy constructor

1411973
directory	folder
we have .some folder that contains thousands of files .so i don t want to just zip the whole directory into one large file - it would be preferrable to have a numbers of smaller files .so that it would be easier for a user to find the data bucket they are looking for

1411978
webforms	asp.net
i have worked with jsf which is similar to asp.net webforms

1411988
webforms	asp.net
no dotnetnuke is built on asp.net webforms and relies heavily on viewstate

1411992

1412065
sharepoint-list	project-server
in the other side the web part retrieves information about the current team named from the project-server it follows the same procedure but it just feed a sharepoint-list

1412075
launchd	daemons
the downside to this is of course if somebody leaves the .app running for a week or two and since a portion of the .app is a launchd daemons this is a definite possibility for those who rarely restart there could be a logfile of non-trivial size built up during this period depending on what logging level is enabled

1412084
carbon	cocoa
is there a way to globally hide the mouse cursor for all apps in cocoa or carbon

edit using my own suggestion i found that local-storage seems to be at userprofile local settings application data microsoft internet-explorer domstore in windows-xp vista and windows 7 will be slightly different

1412147
exception-handling	error-handling
yes gotos can be bad and exception-handling or explicit error-handling after each call may be better but gotos are much better than co-opting another construct to try and simulate them poorly

1412161
attributes	properties
personally i would go for attributes but would assign the value to a backing readonly properties in the constructor

1412177
implements	abstract
with an abstract properties they would be forced to implements it or face compile errors

1412184
contains	any
doing it with xmlserializer is fine too but it gets a bit tricky if the class contains any collections or lists or other weirdities

linux	unix
on a modern unix or linux systemd how can you tell which code set the etc passwd file stores user named in

1412211
exception-handling	error-handling

1412214
manpage	bsd
from the bsd manpage

1412216
attributes	properties
also to prevent the missing-data problem you could use a single pluginattributes that took all the metadata in as parameters on the properties and required that attributes for your hosts to load the class

1412222
margins	padding
take the absolute positioning off of div1 then use margins or padding to move it down to the desired location

1412307
hash	md5
the tool can automatically pend edits based on file attributes or md5 hash

1412364
aspect-ratio	scale
unless i am mistaken the expected behavior for stretch uniform is that it should scale the image maintaining aspect-ratio letterboxing as needed

1412364
aspect-ratio	scale
this works fine for images with landscape orientation in that they scale up to fill the spaces maintaining aspect-ratio without cutting off any of the image

1412382
dialog	pop-up
then i had others try the .app on jaunty and instead of a bubble pop-up with the new notify-osd systemd as i expected the notification turned into a dialog box

1412382
dialog	pop-up
it is unacceptable to have the dialog for me as it doesn t stay over all windows .so the user won t see the pop-up right away necessarily which is the whole points of using the bubble pop-up

1412385
base-class	inherited
the inherited means that your class gets inherited whatever properties and methods that the base-class specifies

1412387

note that this required that you url encode the characters but i prefer that over url-encoding the + and characters from the standards base64 alphabet

1412446
getter	setter
you could make your life easier by encapsulating your getter and setter logic in a base-class and then simply calling those methods from any new properties you create simply acting as thin wrapper around those methods

1412504
viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload
your problem is most likely in the methods that initializer and presents the methods that viewdidappear is in or in the init viewdidload viewwillappear methods of loadviewcontroller

may take a little tweak to get all the borders to display correctly but you can set the padding margins on the containers elements if that s important to you

1412586
spaces	output
for example if it was being used to generator output where white spaces was significant the behavior you describe would be desirable

1412616
put	get
my only concern with a notsupportedexception is that generally those are the exception-handling that get throw .when dark matter has been introduced to the systemd or to put it another way this methods must go into the systemd on this interface but we won t turn it on until versioning 2.4

1412620
nested-loops	loops
i came up with a pseudocode solution that would work but the problem was that it required power loops that is n nested-loops where n is only known at runtime

1414856
abstract	super
i m not quite sure whether the tools let you write constraints against the metamodel - ie assert that a strategy must provide a function which rather than just asserting the pre and .post conditional but then such assert are also checked by the types systemd of most languages if you make the methods abstract in the super types of the strategy anyway

google-chrome	firefox
to get geolocation from firefox google-chrome you just call a few javascript methods

1415951
common-lisp	scheme
common-lisp of course scheme might be an easier introduction though and easier to get a stable simple common environment

1415976

1416060
authentication	login
.when i provide a random salt for each user how do i then know what the salt was .when i try to authentication them to login

1416064
dictionary	map
the points is since salt is different for each user you cannot use a prebuilt dictionary of hash to map the hash passwd to clear text rainbow attack

1416068
hash	md5	salt	md5
create a salt random md5 or sha1 then use format something like sha1 -- passwd-- salt-- and then store hash passwd and salt in database

if you are using apache or lighttpd you can use the x-sendfile header to send files that are not in the web root provided you haven t changed the configuration of mod_xsendfile

1416077
prism	mef
today i would say prism and mef complement each other

1416077
prism	mef
thus as prism is currently built on unity you can use it to leverage mef

1416077
prism	mef
this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

1416090
prism	mef
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this points is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementation of the service necessary to talk to mef

1416090
prism	mef
it enables unity and mef to talk back to one another thus you can using the existing prism source with mef through the unity bridge

1416092
logout	login
im making a login logout class that logs users in sets cookies based on user s choice

1416094

it sounds like you are seeing an exception-handling which comes with a stracktrace set debugging to true in web-config it should tell you the types of exception-handling perhaps you are catching the wrong types like david andres suggests and it will also contains the line numbers from stack indicating where it s being throw

1416185
directory	folder
there s not such thing as wipping out .svn folder you just copy the files to the the checked out directory and since they are changed i just commit them using tortoisesvn

1416283
attributes	properties
2 use attr properties to set some attributes for the matched elements s

1416286
click	mouse
the standards way to do it is to use the attributes to pass in a javascript expression or to listen for the click mouse event once a click has been capture on the inline and before focus is transfer over to the plugins

1416286
click	mouse
i d also like to naturally believe that .when and capture the click mouse event that it also properly bubbles up

1416385
any	set
if any of the upgrade databases were set at level 80 or 90 you might see if that was really needed

1416391
primitive	boolean
also using the typename without new behaves differently for string numbers and boolean returning a primitive numbers string or boolean value but with new these will returned boxed object types which are nearly useless

1416392
dictionary	map
.so you could have a dictionary map hashtable whatever it s called in your language that maps a types to another dictionary

1416428
unsigned	short
i m initializing an unsigned short int with a 0xff all bits are set

1416428

2009-09-12 18 47 15.968 craigsalerts 10057 207 terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - uinavigationcontroller popnavigationitemanimated unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x191c7e0

1416504
apache-config	.htaccess
you could do it without a .htaccess if you had access to the apache-config files that defined your site

1416517
contains	elements
note that in this context panels is just a reference to an elements - usually a div contains the new content.

1416527
triggers	insert
5 do you have triggers that are firing on your insert updates operations that may be causing performance or locking issues

1416530
bmp	png
i have tried this with both a png and a bmp and same result

1416539
rubymine	textmate
personally i use textmate which is amazing however heard good things about rubymine from jetbrains - www.jetbrains.com ruby index.html

1416548
textmate	komodo	radrails	textmate
you might want to try komodo edit which is more inline with textmate than say a full blown ide like aptana radrails

1416554
selected	button
personally i d lean towards having the desktop be the default folder with a browse button to selected another folder in your save diagnostics dialog

1416567
put	get
put b over a using a blend mode get the resulting image

1416570
python	ruby
i have no experience with ruby .so i would tend to want to go with a language i know better like python but am not willing to rules ruby out for no rea.son

1416589
octal	hex	decimal	octal	decimal	hex
also if given base 0 it will assume hex if the string begins with 0x octal if it begins with 0 and decimal otherwise

1416596
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
the popnavigationitemanimated is used for a uinavigationitem only not for a uinavigationcontroller object

1416600
contains	any
the schema file does not contains my new field and any attempts to reference the field from my views fail miserably

1416610
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
note that this is ansi-sql .so will work across sqlite mysql postgresql oracle sql-server db2 etc. etc

1416610
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
limit is used by postgresql and sqlite a bit differently in mysql and not in oracle or sql-server as an fyi

1416619
binary	hex
the function nsrl_hex2bin takes a binary buffering the size of that buffering and the hex string you want to convert

1416625
python	ruby
imo if you re comfortable with python then you shouldn t have too much trouble picking up ruby

1416634
directory	folder
it might be better to saving to the local files folder in the .profile and popping up an explorer windows for that directory

1416636
arrays	loops
also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over order if order is an arrays you should use a normals for-loops

1416636
for-loop	arrays
another reason to avoid it is because the order of iterator used by this statement is arbitrary and iterator over an arrays may not visit elements in numeric order and also it seems to be much more slower than a simple for-loop

1416642
children	nodes
finally you ll need to defined a datatemplate for each child item types .so that the treeview knows how to display them you can use a hierarchialdatatemplate for the children as well if they in turn have child nodes

1416643
subtract	add
your code is doing exactly what you asked it to do because you didn t ask it to add or subtract one day you asked it to add or subtract 24 hours

1416649
sql-server	oracle
for example first i will get customer details from oracle and building the xml file and then the sql-server database and building the customer details xml

1416660
constructor	private
if you want to you can give a private constructor and a public nested abstract inherited class with temp as enum to prevent inherited versioning for non-enums

1416662
ref	out
sp.queryservice ref iid_iwebbrowserapp ref iid_iwebbrowser2 out brws

1416674
put	get
you can put before your arguments this way you ll always get a tuples

1416687
python	perl
bang head against table a lot and then either give up or use another language which has a usable libs already like perl or python

1416700
text-editor	editor
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text-editor that is more sensitive to binary-data

1416702
static-class	nested-class
edit trying a regular nested-class yield error extension methods must be defined in a top level static-class

1416703
constructor	private
if you want to you can give a private constructor and a public nested abstract inherited class with temp as enum to prevent inherited versioning for non-enums

1416704
any	set
you can set makeprg to run whatever scripting you need it to including running any configure scriptinging

1416726
linux	unix
the normals way to deal with this on a unix linux systemd is to use the file command-line utility

1416737
order	add
you should be able to modify any of the standards shortest-path algorithms to add the symbols order

1416738
revision	updates
all works extremely well even wrote my own upgrade function that detection if the codebase has changes based on the assembly revision numbers and then migrates all object updates to the db - pretty slick and efficent for auto-upgrading the db

1416742
contains	any
however this is not true for computer files in general as they can contains any kind of binary-data which is not necessarily ascii characters

1416742
binary	hex
hex-editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary

1416750
python	c++
in my business particle physics we pretty much move from fortran 77 straight to c++ and python

1416753
binary	hex
if you view a file using a hex editor you can see both the binary representation of the file and ascii text interpretation of the binary side-by-side

1416762
accumulate	aggregate
likewise 10 reads per second is unlikely to over-stress any competent dbms unless there is some complicating factors that you ve not mentioned such as the reads are aggregate of aggregate over the entire dbms which will accumulate billions of recording after a period of .

1416765
sql-server	oracle
you want to change sql-server such that it uses mvcc instead the default for oracle

1416765
sql-server	mysql
mysql and sql-server both have it too and your problem will go away

1416767
tiff	png
it takes a data that contains bytes of a recognized image format like jpg png or tiff parsing thoses and decompression the images appropriately

1416770
constructor	object
.when you invoke a constructor it always will return a new object unless an exception-handling is throw

1416787
click	mouse
in windows events like key presses mouse click and movements etc are sent as events messages to a thread dedicated to process them

1416794
player	movie
the first idea that occurs to me is creating a quicktime movie that directs quicktime to look to the files you expect to downloading or even to look directly to their remote urls for its media then siccing quicktime player qtmovieview on it and hoping that quicktime s support for progressive-downloading patches over any rough spots

1416798
queue	fifo
for this you re best off a file based fifo queue

1416811
constructor	object
.so instead calling the constructor of the date object the code is refactored to only create dates through a factory-method

1416821
google-chrome	firefox
sharepoint works on other browsers but it s a bit more frustrating to new users of it .when it s on firefox or google-chrome

1416827
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
it s pretty clear that you are ok with either ruby or python and obviously php can be made to work

1416827
smalltalk	lisp
slightly more seriously though lisp and smalltalk are still in tiny niche spaces after 60 and 40 years it turns out that the child of the two bore fruit

1416827
smalltalk	lisp
various lisp and smalltalk hackers are starting to show up speaking about their child ruby at ruby and ruby-on-rails cons

1416827
smalltalk	lisp
as it happens ruby timeframe 15 years has quite a bit of the lisp and smalltalk magic

1416827
perl	ruby
and to this party ruby brings about every single bit of the day-to-day and 3-line-script usefulness of perl

1416827
perl	ruby
ruby is an explosion on the language scene that combines the scripting superpower of perl with the object-orient superpower of an exotic language like smalltalk

1416833
boost	stl
once you get your head around programming with boost and stl it can really feel like a higher-level language

1416864
double	int
gcc vc++ partially initializer local arrays structure members are default initializer to zero int null char char string 0.000000 float double

1416888
tuples	any
see this general solution at sourceforge which covers any arbitrary python object including list tuples dictionary etc

1416895
udp	tcp
tcp or udp sockets

1416902
selected	button
matches all input textarea selected and button elements

1416905
arrays	loops
you want the arrays expression to be able to loops

1416909
show	next
i have a program that needs to start on 1 1 09 and .when i start a new day my program will show the next day

1416913
subtract	add	value	field
the calendar object has an add methods which allows one to add or subtract value of a specified field

1416913
assign	add
the add methods does not return anything therefore trying to assign the result-of calling calendar.add is not valid

1416914
contains	any
if the swf file contains any actionscript code flex printing a warning during compilation and then stripes out the actionscript from the embed symbols

1416916
arrays	loops
if you can loops through the database contents creating an arrays is simple

1416916
arrays	loops
loops through arrays here and add comma to separate value

1416916
concatenation	comma
alternatively and to avoid an extra comma due to loop-based string concatenation you can write the variables to the client as follows

1416924
isinstance	metaclass
use sequences metaclass isinstance myvar collections.sequences and not isinstance myvar str

1416931
boost-optional	boost-variant
consider investigating the implementation of boost-variant and boost-optional they are definitions of a general purpose generics types

1416962
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework in asp.net suited for different database

1416966
grouping	sorting
you could grouping the strings based on guesses about the alphabet and language and then use locale-specific sorting for each grouping

1416983
associations	model
and an associations model that looks like

1416989
combinations	permutation
you then call a function passing po1 po2 p1 p2 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 and have this function return all possible permutation based on po1 and po2 that s 36 combinations

1417003
exception-handling	try-catch	required	checked
which types exception-handling checked required in linq inside try-catch block while performing crud create read updates delete operations

1417006
exception-handling	try-catch
if it s not well-documented what exception-handling-handling will be throw in normals use-case scenarios and i can t say off the top of my head what will be throw in your situation i suggest trying to break it by performing operations you know will fail and then add the exception-handling that s throw to the try-catch block

1417011
cryptography	security
i expect sha-1 or even md5 would work just fine for this since cryptography security really isn t the goal but i m not sure if there might be other algorithms out there that might have desirable properties for this sort of problem

1417013
controllers	routes
with resource routes in ruby-on-rails the methods used determines the controllers action called

1417013
put	get
you need to specify the methods in your link_to_remote call - either get put .post or delete

1417025
g++	gcc
configure gcc for mips.. g++ core

1417028
any	set
what i would like to be able to do is detection if any properties were set this way and just automatically have the custom control call this.databind after onprerender or there about

1417028
assign	add
i should add that i don t want to pay the overhead of execution databind if no direct properties have been assign this way

1417028
any	set
this class is extremely lighting but i d like the ability to declarative set properties without needing any code-behind

1417053
cygwin	gnu
in general using the gnu kernel32.dll operating systemd sometimes referred to as cygwin is risky business

1417105
ibaction	cocoa
while reading cocoa tutorials i ve noticed that some of the tutorials use appdelegate and some appcontroller for defining ibaction that open various windows that use subclassing of nswindowcontroller

1417109
digits	base
it seems i have to do base 10 conversions or a if tree to split all 2 digits numbers to then be show in the lcd

1417112
hide	show
in those cases you either have to have all field thereby confusing the user or some javascript to hide show the relevant field again making the user experience a bit weird field disappearing appearing as they enter the credit-card numbers

1417120
formal-languages	semantics
- are there such formal-languages for defining programming language semantics

1417125
subclassing	base-class
hi ive got a subclassing and i use this subclassing on a bag however i want to use the order by from the base-class

1417126
32-bit	64bit
note however that many compilers for modern desktops defined long and long-long as both exactly 64bit whereas many compilers for embedded processor defined long as 32-bit and long-long as 64bit obviously witha few exception-handling

1417134
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i want to connect to a remote database mysql or sql-server or oracle via internet from my native iphone .app

1417143
ftps	ftp
what about ftp ftps

1417144
debian	rpm
it does not have admin-friendly features like rpm or debian package etc

1417180
firefox	safari
is it just firefox ie and safari

1417184
formal-languages	semantics
there are many formal-languages for programming languauge semantics - look at the wikipedia entry for some more terms to google

1417196
ftps	ftp
of course the ftp username and passwd are sent in clear-text anyway unless you are using ftps .so anyone listening to your .app will figure out the username and passwd fairly quickly

1417288
authentication	impersonation
if it s an authentication service you could turn on impersonation to carry your credentials through

1417291
contains	elements
the arrays contains over 40 000 elements .so i want it in a separate file all by itself

1417300
value	field
on login save this session s date time to the current field and move the value previously found there into the previous field obviously

1417300
value	field
it is this field that provides my last logged in on value

1417308
font-size	height
notice that i used a converter because the ratio height to font-size is not 1 1 and the text is too big for the textbox

1417313
sniffing	packets
this pretty much confirm what i thought - unless the game is using connect udp sockets then the only way you ll be able to get the remote address is via packets sniffing

1417322
base-class	inherited
it s been a while but there was a sort of middleware that asp.net let you inherited from a base-class and implements code that handles pre or .post session begin end

1417323
sql-server	oracle
edit updates to support examples in sql-server and oracle for ensuring the format a0+ .so that a1324 a2342388 and p2342 match but a2342junk and a234 do not

1417323
numeric	digits
the oracle regexp_like code was borrowed from mark s .post but updates to support 4 or more numeric digits

1417331
boolean	int
the promotions are outlined in 6.3.1.1 arithmetic operands boolean characters and int which says among other things

1417331
unsigned	short
even though the variables are unsigned short they are promoted to int since on your platform int can represent all the value of unsigned short

1417331
unsigned	short
as litb indicated in a comment if the platform had int implements as a 16-bit types which is permitted - ms-dos for example the promotion of unsigned short would be to unsigned int instead of int since an int wouldn t be able to represent all value of unsigned short unsigned short must be at least 16-bit

1417342
textblock	viewbox
one trick which could be used is to place every textblock in a viewbox

1417342
font-size	height
another trick could be to bind the control s height to the font-size

1417349
updating	updates
checked if the modification dates of your original files and copies in the .app wr.apper match and if after updating the resources the modification dates of the updates files are newer than those in the .app wr.apper

1417350
value	field	updating	updates
i m updating a single field value in the same row and then saving but i don t want it to updates the updatesd_at field

1417359
filtering	sorting
filtering and group-by but not sorting on mva attributes is supported

1417376
exception-handling	try-catch
overrides submitchanges on the server and add a try-catch to see if you re hitting some exception-handling

1417445
static-methods	unit-testing
oh i almost forgot if you are willing to use unit-testing you might find out that static-methods are not easy to test

1417451
web.py	django
deepen your python skills by using it for everything say django or web.py python

1417451
python	ruby
look at ruby and python lightweight frameworks

1417451
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	smalltalk	lisp
it s worth looking at the origins of languages php was originally announced as an extension of ssi ruby tries to take the best of perl smalltalk and lisp but has elements of a c java-like syntax perl is intimately connect to unix and everywhere although usually invisible to end users despite some very good perl web-frameworks

1417457
show	next
pressing the same button the next time should never show the messages it should forwarding to the next page

1417458
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate entity-framework activerecord or linq2sql

1417473
python	c++
i m trying to call a function in a python scripting from my main c++ program

1417506
instances	private
private static instances null

1417507
contains	any
serial no the returned resultset doesn t contains any entries

1417515
global-assembly-cache	gac
in the global-assembly-cache gac

1417522
constructor	private
if you want to you can give a private constructor and a public nested abstract inherited class with temp as enum to prevent inherited versioning for non-enums

1417530
udp	tcp
instead of using heavy-weight tcp we can utilize the connection-oriented reliable feature of tcp on the top of udp by any of the following way

1417530
traffic	packets
periodic acks help to reduce control traffic on the reverse path .when the data transfer speed is high because in these situations the numbers of acks is proportional to time rather than the numbers of data packets

1417530
udp	tcp
it aims to provide a solution where udp is too primitive because guaranteed-order packets delivery is desirable but tcp adds too much complexity overhead

1417540
radiobuttonlist	updatepanel
.so i have a radiobuttonlist inside an updatepanel

1417551
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
i m afraid it s not possible to hide members in a derived-class . that s against the inherited rules to solve this problem you can have two level of abstract classes.in level one there s a base-class with all the members that should be among all the derived-classes in second level you can have special classes with only the members you want to be inherited from this class down

1417566
base-class	inherited
if two or more classes have common data and behavior methods then those classes should each inherited from a common base-class that capture those data and methods

1417566
base-class	inherited
if two or more classes shared only a common interface messages not methods then they should inherited from a common base-class only if they will be used polymorphically

1417568
shutdown	restart
and lets say we have a language that can detection power shutdown and subsequent restart and somehow recover from it

1417581
protected	public
if you have an abstract-class with virtual properties they can either be protected or public and this is what the outside world will see

1417594
firefox	safari
in safari ie all 3 work fine however in firefox 3.5 only the news ticker seems to work

1417595
ftp	ssh
as long as no-one has an ssh or ftp access to your server and that there is no bug security hole in your website that would allow anyone to access the sources of the php files this should be quite ok

1417598
python	c++
.when you say as long as the previous call is finished before the function is called again i can only assume that you have multiple threads calling from c++ into python

1417608
children	nodes
finds nodes which match the selector td.threadtitle a and are direct children of this

1417618
.when	ready
.when the working thread is done and the page is ready to deliver the call simply returns the result

1417640
positioning	sidebar
.so if you have a ab.solutely positioning div in a sidebar with nothing after it you can add all the dynamic text you want

1417646
aggregate	grouping
grouping by wouldn t do it for me because i need all the columns not any aggregate of them

1417670
value	field
inside the foreach loops i m trying to get the attributes for each field and their respective value

1417674
decimal	octal
vb.net supports decimal without prefix octal with prefix and hexadecimal with prefix int literals directly

1417677
contains	elements
it s an contains elements of types htmlattributes

1417678
handler	service
if the problem is inside your .app rather than the service then you should be logging exception-handling-handling inside your .application_load event you should be logging exception-handling-handling anyway - however if you try with a global exception-handling handler well your .app is failing on startup and .so the global exception-handling handler will never start to run - instead of putting potential failable scenarios in .application_load i d move that out to a utility class which provides an access points to the information you need say myglobalthingumy.getstuff

1417681
glsl	hlsl
now obviously there are the shader languages such as hlsl cg and glsl that have native support for this kind of stuff however i m looking for something that s able to at least compile to sse without autovectorization but with built-in support for vector operations

1417681
if-statement	loops
dynamic branching would be nice for loops if-statement

1417696
dictionary	map
to map a list as a dictionary

1417706
decompression	on-the-fly
add advanced on-the-fly decompression

1417708
silverlight	wpf
do you have programmers that know silverlight or wpf or a keen to learn it

1417743
buffering	streaming
to be honest your streaming implementation is slightly dodgy too - it may well fail for characters which take up multiple bytes .when encode in utf-8 and you re decoding the whole buffering even .when only part of it is written

1417746
textbox	button
i would like that textbox to display a clear button on the right side of the box.

1417756
lightbox	jquery
or is there a better lightbox jquery plugins out there that i ve not found yet

1417757
put	get
if you put that sql_calc_found_rows and then if you put a limit you will get the full numbers of rows is no affected by the limit

1417783
postgresql	mysql
we are using containers isolation to run different instances multiples versioning of the databases postgresql and mysql but the naming scheme problem is still the same

1417783
scheme	let
however we ll probably let go off that naming scheme because customers have the ability to creating new databases and they all have their own ideas about naming databases

1417790
button	popup
the write can only be initiated by user integration a button click and it will always popup the hosts os s file save dialog box prompt the user to choose a location or cancel

1417797
put	get
in terms of the external urls i think it helps to distinguish between the urls that make up the api of the systemd get users 1 put users 1 etc and the urls that are just there as a convenience to humans using a web browser users new users 5 edit etc

1417797
put	get
these urls are typically just the address of the resource you want to interact with and then you use the http-method and the parameters to indicate what it is you want to do get show me this resource put change this resource etc

1417800
ggplot2	lattice
it s not a problem for ggplot2 or lattice graphics - you always have to explicit printing them .when they are called in non-interactive settings like from within a scripting

1417802
authentication	login
you can then write your own authentication on top of this to make it behave you want with regards to time based login e.t.c

1417827
header-files	makefile	qmake	cmake
be sure you run moc on your header-files qmake and cmake both support creating your makefile

1417841
positioning	slider
that is they slider appear at the top of the caption box and then .when the mouse goes over them then move to their correct mouse over positioning and then back to a correct stating positioning

1417841
shadowbox	lightbox
if i remove the .doc types the sliding caption function correctly but shadowbox and other lightbox types popup do not because they required the .doc types to be set to work correctly.

1417841
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome regardless

1417860
wamp	php
but if you are using wamp server is that not a server for php development -- and not java jsp

1417862
fireworks	photoshop
i fixed it by opening every jpg image and saving them again in a good image editor like photoshop or fireworks

1417869
value	field
you could use it in innerhtml or .html but not in a form field value

1417871
wamp	php
wamp server is primarily meant for php mysql development on windows and does not support java jsp out of the box. afaik while it would be possible to use the same wamp installation for configuring it to support jsps you would still need a servlet-container for interpreting your java jsp source files

1417875
default-value	arguments
i guess you can just add a set_default_location to your model and change the price_points_for_location to have a default-value for the arguments

1417878
push	pull
those distribute caching product use various push and pull model with pub-sub messaging to achieve consistency across the instances

1417893
nsstring	nsdata
if the description properties of the nsdata object can return a string is there any way i can produce an nsstring from the nsdata object without getting null

1417925
callback	methods
usually it is needed to call methodss on a given instances without knowning about the object so-called methods binding like in boost-bind these bound instances-methods can be used as callback for algorithms

1417938
groovy	java
you can do something similar by putting your controllers into java groovy package

1417944
implements	extends
in other words if you extends or implements something with generics remember to defined the generics arguments for them

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
i apologize if my previous answer misled you i was merely printing the description to demonstrate that the nsdata can be encrypted and decrypted. instead use nsstring s -datausingencoding and -initwithdata encoding methods to convert between nsdata and nsstring

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
base64-encode the nsdata then create and return and nsstring of the encode output

1417963
any	set
is there any way to set a cookies that is not readable on subdomains

1417968
emacs	vim
.so there is this question for vim users that keeps popping up in my feed reader but i m an emacs per.son

1417971
firefox	safari
in both safari and firefox the data instantly show up as it is supposed to as it is added to the database and then called to reload

1418012
buffering	capture
in your test.inc file you can use output buffering to capture all the output of the php scripting before it is sent to the browser

1418015
python	c++
i want to embed python in my c++ application

google-code	bitbucket
unfortunately i m not finding the archive downloading links on google-code but they re pretty standards in the mercurial and bitbucket web interfaces .so i d imagine they re .somewhere

1418045
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this feature is worked in all popular browser like ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

this is my jquery lightbox of choice slimbox 2

1418077
order	add
do i have to add collation_name as a real column in the application database for activerecord to see it .when order

1418084
silverlight	wpf
are there any product out there that convert flash swfs to xaml i m interested in wpf but silverlight could work too

1418092
udp	tcp
facebook for example changed some kernel level thingys in linux changed how memcached works for example they wrote a memcached proxy and used udp instead of tcp

1418101
haskell	c++
- remoting etc etc every sufficiently large and complex project must keep an eye out for ocp violations even were it written in eiffel or haskell and much more .so if the allegedly static language actually allows programmers to poke whatever they want anywhere into memory as long as they have the proper cast incantations in-place as c and c++ do -- now that s the kind of thing you definitely want to catch in code reviews

1418106
haskell	scala
i m looking into linq and the query language appears at least on the surface to be nothing more than an implementation of map and or list comprehensions as found in haskell and other fp languages particularly the generalisation of map and for in scala

1418110
embedded-fonts	fonts
the .source file is a pdf contains embedded-fonts .so it is the fonts already embedded in the .source file that i need to prevent being subset in the destination file

1418113
base-class	inherited
if you need the user s entity on every action then push the behavior into a base-class that your controllers inherited from

1418123
32-bit	64bit
for instances a 64bit pointers could be compared for or using only the lower 32-bit if an single allocation cannot exceed the size allowed for a 32-bit pointers

1418125
getter	setter
is there a way either via the user-interface or in configuration files to change the named of the c++ getter setter generator by eclipse cdt from the java-style getsomething to the more c++ like something

1418132
order	add
inorder for order to work you have to use a column that is known in the query that is created by the .all methods or you have to overload the .all methods in your class to add the missing functionality

1418141
void	main
int main void

1418146
value	field
yes you have to provide this field sir and this better be of this value

1418164
constructor	private
the error appears because your private constructor is calling a methods that can be overrides from a derived-class

1418174
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1418175
value	field
if you want to store value like 2008-7 you ll want a character field

1418185
any	set
also use bookmarks -- c-x r m to set a bookmark in any buffering give it a named and c-x r b to jump to a namedd bookmark

1418211
python	php
i have considered using php or python are they good choices

1418216
children	nodes
every nodess children has a left right value that is between the parent nodess left and right which makes it very easy to find for example all children parent of a nodes

1418220
python	php	erlang	python
but erlang is not at all like php or python and if you haven t had any exposure to a functional language before there s certainly a bit of a learning curve

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instances the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1418232
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
any of the web-friendly languages perl php python java jsp are ok on a back-end

1418244
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection per se would let you inject an implementation of irepository that accepts whatever call are made on it checked that the invariants and preconditions are satisfied and returns results satisfying the postconditions

1418244
dependency-injection	inject
.when you choose to inject a mock object that has very specific expectations for what methods will be called then yes you re doing highly implementation-specific testing -- but dependency-injection is totally innocent in the matter since it never dictates what you should inject

1418257
haskell	c++
a better possibility for providing fast abstractions for numbers would be the introduction of typeclasses concepts like in haskell or c++ where you could write

1418298
pointers	stack
a slightly quicker way is to move the the parameter value into a register but not as stephen says the esp register the push pop call and ret opcodes assume that esp contains a pointers to stack

1418301
python	c++
i m not terribly picky about language but i would prefer something with c++ or python

1418302
primitive	int
on most platform int and characters are examples of types that are primitive but can be boxed

1418305
type-safety	generics
granted this won t provide type-safety or generics or anything like that but it will still let you do similar things with a little more work

1418311
primitive	int
autoboxing is most useful in java .when working with generics since you can t use primitive with generics .so to store int in a list you d have to make a and put the int into the list boxed

1418329
boolean	int
autoboxing allows java to automatically convert things like boolean and int to their object versioning boolean and int automatically in most cases

1418334
subtraction	addition	multiplication	addition	multiplication	subtraction
say for example that the variables are the letters x y z t and the operators are a for addition and s for subtraction -- strings of adjacent letters implicit mean high-priority multiplication as in common mathematical conventions

1418364
pointers	stack
another possibility could be that filepath is a pointers to a local variables in a function that has returned - .so it points to .somewhere random in stack that is being reused by other code such as printf

1418368
selected	textbox
how do i allow selected all in my multi-lined textbox

1418435
ip-address	hostname
regular expression to match dns hostname or ip-address

1418448
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
the sequences in which the various methods like viewwillappear viewdidappear of uiviewcontroller and the is called is different between the first time the map is loaded with one particular location and the subsequent time the map is display with the same location

1418450
union-all	union
don t forget that a union eliminates the duplicates .so if you want duplicates to be include uyse union-all

1418453
entity-framework	ado.net
i am implements repository-pattern with ado.net entity-framework

1418459
constructor	object
i would say that since you are raising the event in the constructor before you even have a reference to the object in your parent class that you are unable to handle the event

1418482
user-input	output
any output generator from user-input should be encode before output

1418483
contains	sorted
if data contains sorted sub data max speed can be better then n log n

1418485
any	set
by any chance is there any easy way to set a default masterview for all the actions inside a specific controllers

1418486
typedef	struct
a small function i wrote to highlight functions globals macros s struct and typedef

1418500
subclassing	superclass
essentially types within generics have to match exactly to be compatible they can t be subclassing or superclass

1418512
exception-handling	try-catch
throw exception-handling in your object and handle them on the outside with try-catch logic

1418516
.net	wcf
o reilly has some excellent books about c# and .net including title like learning wcf programming entity-framework and programming asp.net 3.5 which should provide enough information for moving to .net

1418530
arcgis-server	arcmap
you use arcmap arccatalog to author a geoprocessing model i am assuming you are familiar with this which you later expose in an arcgis-server as a geoprocessing service

1418538
ruby-on-rails	camping	sinatra	ramaze
apart from ruby-on-rails i ve heard about merb camping sinatra and ramaze

1418553
terminal	prompt
.sorry if this is on the wrong site maybe superuser but i m trying to make my python.py file executable .so i can click on it and it automatically does its thing without me specifying it to open in the terminal by that default prompt and i already have chmod +x for its permissions

1418553
terminal	prompt
.when i click it right now it prompt me with do you want to open it in a text file terminal - can i make it always default to opening in the terminal or is this just an oddball request

1418580
exception-handling	error-handling
they are both accepted forms of error-handling however the preferred choice for .net languages is to use exception-handling

1418610
json	xml
another drawback of binary format like pb is that if there is a single bit of error the entire data file is not parsable but with json or xml as the last resort you can still manually fix the error because it is human-readable and has redundancy built-in

1418616
attributes	properties
search all known html elements attributes and css properties

1418624
json	xml
you can use any input format including json html table xml and text

1418624
click	mouse	highlight	selected
according to above .when i click yes mouse click a single row it will be highlight selected and supported actions will be applied edit

1418624
json	xml
minimal changes are required if you use json xml or text

1418632
required	checked
i would checked that the required d file exists before attempting to required it and throw a nice exception-handling that can be caught by the application and reported in a nice way

1418633
packets	ping
all being correct on the machine i m ping i can see the packets arrive and the response sent in wireshark but the remote machine gets nothing

1418636
arrays	loops
loops over the arrays and draw the index of the arrays at the centering of rectangle defined by bounds or workingarea

1418642
shell	bash
bin bash because bin sh is a very limited shell

1418642
shell	bash
this would explain why works in the terminal where the shell is bash but not as a shell scripting which is run by bin sh

1418642
shell	bash
they changed this a couple of release ago for performance reasons - most people don t need full bash functionality for shell scripting and this limited shell is much faster at startup

1418642
for-loop	arrays
edit i just noticed that you don t even have to use an arrays since you convert it to a spaces separated string in the for-loop anyway

1418645
opensuse	ubuntu
i usually am on either opensuse 11 or ubuntu 9.04

1418645
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
in python there is no choice its just python somefile.py same with php or ruby

1418681
opencv	itk
opencv has python binding - like vereb mentioned itk is also top notch

1418685
touch	drag	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
ideally .when the drag exit event is fired the button would stop receiving touch move events the customview would get a touchesbegan event even if i need to fake one myself somehow and all future touch-events touchesmoved etc would be sent to the customview

1418691
python	c++
opencv now has c++ and python apis

1418735
any	set
if the view size changes after i ve set the background the first time the image gets stretch instead of repeat for the new size - any ideas how i can fix this

1418735
background-image	background-color
background-image is now stretch even if i set the background-color again using the exact same code

1418741
put	get
yes get and delete map pretty cleanly but put can do create and updates but complete replacement only and .post is a wildcard verb

1418741
put	get
.post is really to handle everything that does not fit into get put and

1418781
implements	super
if implements properly an object will release any object it owns before calling the super this them to get deallocated if their retain count is also zero

1418784
ref	out
another approach to force programmers to handle errors better is to make the return code into an out or ref parameter .so that the caller is explicit made aware of the need to handle returned errors

1418791
udp	tcp	communication	messages
mmorpg s that i m familiar with probably don t use web-services for communication since they are stateless but rather a custom server-side program a service that listens for tcp and or udp messages

1418791
udp	tcp
they probably use a custom tcp and or udp based protocols look into socket communication

1418793
widget	button
if that s not an option you could consider creating your own button widget possibly derived from qpushbutton or qabstractbutton

1418801
jeditable	sortable
then i used sortable for all the siblings and then jeditable wont cancel edit .when click outside

1418805
instrumentation	trace
the .net trace api will be a better option if you expect the instrumentation to generator too much data for the normals event-log

1418821
observers	listener
more specifically the jbutton or the superclass abstractbutton is the observable class and provides methods to add and remove observers or listener as they are called in swing

1418847
basic	vba
i m not sure what the default error-handling of vba is but since its visual basic for applications and those applications include things like excel and words i assume just a dialog box will appear which will not be helpful to the user

1418889
double-quotes	single-quotes
one thing you ll probably have to change is to replace the single-quotes with double-quotes because variables like aren t substituted into single-quoted strings

1418901
tcp-ip	udp
online games are going to have their own protocols built on top of tcp-ip or udp

1418903
margins	padding
it isn t margins padding

1418912
python	perl
i was having .some trouble grokking the list-comprehension syntax in python .so i started thinking about how to achieve the same thing in perl which i m more familiar with

1418922
margins	padding
this essentially overrides browser rendering default back to 0 .so all margins and padding is at 0px all fonts are at 1em line-heights at 1em etc

1418934
lcov	gcov
for instances gcov or lcov both count the numbers of time a line is execute .so certainly you could modify the .source to printing out that line and sleep instead of just increment a counter

1418963
python	perl
i am aware of remobjects pascalscript and embedding python in delphi but in this instances i am interested primarily in perl support

1418965
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the resulting executable must be install in a numbers of linux distributions slackware arch ubuntu debian centos and a few more and i am completely clueless on how to achieve it

1418970
base-class	inherited	implements	sealed
i m a bit confused on the best way to implements idisposable on a sealed classâ specifically a sealed class that does not inherited from a base-class

1418970
implements	sealed
i m assuming that because memblock is completely sealed and never derives from another class that implements a virtual protected dispose bool disposing is not necessary

1418984
arrays	map	hashmap	arrays
more likely you will need to building a hashmap arrays data structure key character value count and iterate the large text file rebuildinging the map for each line

1418986
.net	wcf	asp.net-mvc	wcf
just wondering since with the new router api in asp.net-mvc wcf and .net 3.5 it seems like a possibility

1418987
gettext	poedit
from my previous questions about gettext one of the biggest benefits of using php s gettext extension instead of other methods of language-translation was that it is super easy to have other people make translation files with a program called poedit

1418988
factors	digits
edit sorry i realize now that you had almost my entire answer already you had just incorrectly determined which factors to use for which digits

1418988
factors	digits
you have the factors reversed you re multiplying the wrong digits by 2 depending on the length of the numbers

1418988
digits	zero
if the digits is 0 then congratulations your checksum digits was a zero

1418988
digits	zero
otherwise calculate 10-digits to get what you need for the last digits instead of that zero

1418988
digits	zero
digits 5 is not zero

1419010
assign	add
still it is a good practice to just assign nil just in case someone else decides to add code to your code and accidently uses the variables again within it s scoping but after it was free

1419027
triggers	insert
create appropriate instead of triggers on the view to handle insert delete and updates operations on the view relaying the changes to the base table

1419062
python	java
in this respect it is no more dangerous than java python or any other language

1419091
attributes	properties
in the case of the attributes you can design it .so that it takes the various table and properties named as attributess to the attributes and uses reflection to get the proper data from your repository based on the attributes s properties

1419130
implements	extends
for composition stack class should have a list not implements or extends a list-based class

1419131
javascript	dom
javascript in the dom is largely event-based programming

1419141
banking	billing
i don t want declined authorizations showing up on their billing statement as seen in an online banking systemd as pending

1419147
worksheet	excel
for example a vba udf called from your worksheet should certainly have an eh that makes sure you return an excel error value to the calling cell s instead of dropping your user into the code editor with an error messages

1419152
margins	padding
you can specify the margins padding and line-height to get them as close as possible but beyond that there is nothing you can do

1419154
.net	wcf
oook here s the deal .when you install the .net 4.0 beta for some reason it also overwrite at least one of your .net 3.0 wcf files at least on 64bit systemd namely

1419154
.net	wcf
.so the bad part is with this new versioning in-place you cannot longer enable the wcf http activation feature of vista and win7 and even worse uninstaller .net 4 beta does not restore the original versioning

1419160
arguments	default
you have to mention them after all of the arguments without named positional arguments and there must be default value for any parameters which were not mentioned at all

1419161
configuration	environment
the bare essentials can be gleaned from reading the comments the files in configuration environment

1419162
hide	next
this allows me to determine whether or not it s the first or last elements in the series .so that i can hide the previous or next button accordingly

1419166
contains	elements
just be careful because the blocks elements won t contains the pre opening and closing tags

1419199
put	get
on a sunday afternoon to put something together in a few hours you would need to know a framework and buy some plugins and get everything up and moving without much work

1419199
joomla	drupal
something like drupal or joomla where they sell templates for joomla you can buy pack of hundreds and plugins to do all kinds of things

1419201
malloc	free
valgrind uses its own malloc and free .so it can alert you to incorrect news and deletes

1419201
pointers	stack
make sure you to do not create a pointers from a stack variables that goes out of scoping

1419201
dwarf	coff
1 about -g from the manpage produce debugging information in the operating systemd s native format stabs coff xcoff or dwarf 2

1419219
mstest	nunit
is there really any difference between nunit mstest etc

1419240
cout	cin
in this code cout in usually stdout and is receiving the characters enter first named firstnamed which is presumably a variables is receiving the data from cin which is probably stdin

1419244
put	get
get and put would work just as well if they didn t conflict with alas-too-common other uses

1419244
cout	cin
but that doesn t seem to have much to do with right-to-left vs left-to-right just with your q s title about reading aloud -- cin absorb x or essteedee cout emit blach emit essteedee endl kinds of reading code aloud on the phone

1419249
report-designer	xtrareport
i think based on all the criterion you likely need to look at crystal-report since you want the report to be standalone although you could also create a report-designer out of xtrareport or activereport pro and have much of the same functionality

1419286
curly-brackets	conditional
for two you ve encapsulated the conditional in curly-brackets and i m a fan of that styles

1419294
intermediate-language	cil
finally the compiler will generator output that capture the semantic meaning of the source in the target representation be it machine-code an intermediate-language such as microsoft s cil or another programming language

1419314
subtract	add
why add length and subtract 1

1419320
mstest	nunit
both nunit and mstest as well as most of the other xunit.net frameworks can also be used for full integration-testing ones that use the actual dependencies such as calling web-services

1419320
msbuild	nant	mstest	nunit
mstest see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration

1419320
mstest	nunit
for a strict comparison somewhat biased in the other directions see comparing the mstest and nunit frameworks

1419320
mstest	nunit
from a per.sonal standpoint pure opinion the key features i need have been available in nunit .so i ve seen no rea.son to evaluate mstest

1419324
key-value	key
creating a dictionary from n key or key-value pairs is o n fetching is o 1 putting is amortized o 1 and .so forth

1419324
tuples	set
dictionary and sets don t gain much but tuples and list do even though dictionary and set remain vastly faster

1419353
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

1419353
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate and entity-framework are more complex but probably also more powerful and flexible than plain linq-to-sql

1419356
scalability	azure
however if you want to use the more scalability table storage then you might want to look into cloudstorage.api which provides a wrapper around this it purports to aim for other cloud-storage endpoint too but afaict it s quite azure specific

1419376
javafx	swing
javafx runs on top of java s applet technology but uses it s own graphics runtime instead of swing

1419378
show	next
alternatively you could make a timer and show each image in the next timer tick

1419379
distutils	buildout
i m working on a buildout scripting that needs to install a distutils package on remote-server

1419382
pointers	stack
sometimes in a later part of the program .when i m deleting the pointers with delete it says that the heap is corrupt and upon inspector of the call stack it appears that _crtisvalidheappointers is asserting that it is not a valid pointers

1419422
contains	any
has anyone had any issue with swapping between branches .when two branches contains some of the same subdirectories

1419435
http	ssl
the http client with ssl support that ships with erlang works reasonably well i can t say i have battle tested it

1419438
hide	show
i will show and hide it using jquery with

1419449
stdin	pipe
i have finally worked out how to get stdin and stdout to pipe between the main .app and a process created with createprocess win32 or execute linux

1419453
stderr	stdout
for example send data to stdout and errors or informational messages to stderr

1419453
stderr	stdout
you can also redirect data from stdout and messages from stderr independently

1419489
contains	any
is there any new better way of loopback mounting individual partition from within a file that contains a partition table on linux

1419496
value	field
i achieve this by having the view decide based on a value in the properties bucket which versioning of each field to show which is set by the action asp.net-mvc

1419509
contains	set
notice the following arrays contains a set of id s

1419519
margins	padding
this question is more about trying to pin down a semantic methodology regarding .when to use margins and .when to use padding

1419528
repository	entity
git repositories should be fairly atomicity in the way that each repository is a stand-alone entity for a specific purpose

1419528
directory	folder
edit another reason for this behavior in git is that it can t tracking things that are above the root repo directory above the folder contains .git folder which would definitely be required if you want your super-projects and subproject refer to the same repositories

1419529
margins	padding
vertical padding on the division - because if i decided i wanted a different amount of vertical spaces in between the multiple paragraph i d use bottom margins and the top bottom padding of the enclosing division pretty much will always stay intact assuming you just have staticly positioning elements inside

1419530
margins	padding
but if containers should have a 12-pixel gutter for all elementss period it makes the most sense to use the padding to avoid having to apply margins to multiple elements sets

1419532
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview control with sorting enabled inside an updatepanel

1419538
margins	padding
the border sits smack dab in the middle of the margins and padding

1419538
margins	padding
i have margins padding and a border

1419538
background-color	transparency	margins	padding
padding brings in background-color of the elements margins are basically transparency

1419538
margins	padding
some elements like td seem to ignore margins while they respond to changes in padding

1419544
associations	model
alternatively you could re-bind your associations on-the-fly to make them hasmany belongsto relationships most likely using the jointable model of a and b

1419559
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
the problem is that obfuscation only foils half-hearted attempts at reverse-engineering

1419569
mac-address	ssid
how can i get the mac-address ssid and signals strength of wifi router nearby in java

1419570
swing	awt
that is an awt component and you should not be using awt components in a swing application

1419570
swing	awt
awt components are painted on top of swing components which could be causing the problem

1419570
swing	awt
i ve never mixed awt swing components .so i don t know what wierd painting artifacts you will encounter

1419583
debugging	trace
unfortunately the log files are generator for both release and debugging buildinging even though trace is not enabled for my release building

1419584
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
i am able to hide the radio-button for selecteded their own scheduling and the selected scheduling button using css by changing reportservice.css located in c program files microsoft sql-server msrs10.mssqlserver report service reportmanager styles on my win 2008 server

1419610
for-loop	arrays
how to identify s length where is an arrays .so that i can use that in the for-loop now i have used as 15 by default.

1419616
show	next
i should read this list and show to user in the next panels from where he can chose the storage location of his choice

1419620
environment	building
i m trying to building a simple environment checked scripting for my firm s test environment

1419621
margins	padding
padding and margins gives the same effect except in the following cases i might miss some

1419621
margins	padding
two nested items the margins are collapse together where padding not

1419624
pthreads	fork
apache2 achieves this using a combinations of fork and pthreads

1419629
python	java
obviously there isn t a lot of points in just running a building since python project don t really building but i d like to be able to use bamboo for running the test suite as well as use bamboo to deploy the latest code to our various test-environments the way we do with our java project

1419630
attributes	properties
to this end my original hope was to use attributes contains a lambda on an object s properties

1419630
attributes	properties
however as this cannot be done i ve settled for having a func t bool member within the class and passing the types or first parameter types and named of this func through the properties attributes

1419650
debian	linux
i just install it with apt-get on debian linux with

1419651
contains	elements
if is an arrays you can use count to find out how many elements it contains

1419651
contains	elements
this way you won t need to know how many elements it contains

1419694
required	checked
i required a means of checked to see if a string has the following exact pattern within it

1419702
32-bit	64bit
you may find that one of the components is 32-bit and is incompatible with 64bit code

1419702
32-bit	64bit
it turned out that the crystal-reports components in it were 32-bit only and would not work with 64bit code

1419710
children	tree
of course there is one view that is the parent of all others and the view controllers keeps tracking of that one and can then follow the tree down to handle the children for the purposes of handling touch or updating etc.

jquery	.post
let me think a little more regarding if i want to do a little more reading before i .post specific questions i have on jquery

1419732
python	java
if you want precise non-integer numbers you need to use a decimal class such as that provided by .net or python or java for instances

put	get
i decided to put this issue aside and continue development which include adding things after level five .so the user can loops through levels and return to the main menu and .so on and .so forth...and i m not sure why but the userdefault are saving for level five now .so i don t know if it s because before level five was the very last thing the application did and even though it didn t terminate itself and did other things maybe it wasn t actually writing the default to disk...i m still not sure what was wrong but it s working now and i can t get it to fail to see if i can get an error with the synchronize.

1419866
arrays	loops
it s a pretty quick way to loops through arrays you know won t have false value

1419866
arrays	loops
the dangers of using this methods do exist though if its an arrays of numbers for instances and one of those numbers is 0 loops will exit early

1419882

your third example is not valid since you are assign to the myclass.prototype a reference to the object constructor and it s a function not a new object

1419982
constructor	object
edit the third example won t produce any errors but is not good at all for example you can easily clobber the object constructor function if you extends afterward the myclass.prototype

1420006
defined	declare
classes are usually defined declare in two different files

1420012
data-access	ado.net

base-class	inherited
the first one doesn t have to be implements in the base-class but enforces it to be implements in inherited classes

1420561
base-class	inherited
you have to implements the second one in the base-class and it can be implementss in inherited classes

1420564
contains	any
normally pure-virtual-functions will not have any implementation and you can not create a instances of a class contains a pure-virtual function

1420568
any	set	implements	extends
in this case there is no simply way to extends compile-time range checked to exclude the unused members but a couple of set types will simplify the business of implements any necessary runtime checked

1420575
derived-class	pure-virtual	derived-class	base-class	pure-virtual	base-class
it is meant to be used as a base-class where the derived-class implements the necessary behavior by implements the pure-virtual function

1420585
arrays	loops
the end result however is exactly as long as you use the arrays positioning rather than loops through the contents which we don t do on this golf course

1420628
superclass	inherited
you can t inherited from a generics types-parameter because the types isn t known at compile-time .so the compiler can t figure out what the superclass is

1420630
comet	chat
i am working on a chatting application and i was using simple ajax polling to retrieve the new chat but its working good because there are few more xmlhttprequest to checked online status and to send chat to others and .some for other rea.son .so i think there are many request in my form thats why its not working .so now i want to do these things in comet styles

just pass the properties through the constructor and set the set to private for the properties

1420870
value	field
in your example only a single field will exist that of the base-class and you can t have different value in a single field

1420987
sctp	tcp	turn	sctp
streaming provide usually i think you can turn it off an order guarantee within them much like a tcp connection but there can be multiple streaming per sctp connection

1420987
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
my personal summary of sctp is that it doesn t do anything you couldn t do another way in tcp or udp with substantial application support

1420987
sctp	tcp
diameter clients must support either tcp or sctp while agents and

1420997
quirks-mode	doctype
floating elements do not by default influence the height of their containers i believe this feature is not correctly implements in ie if the doctype triggers quirks-mode this probably account for the difference in rendering you are seeing

1421136
value	field	updating	updates
if for example you are updating rows based on some traits say the even or odd nature of a field s value the table then a case-statement is a wonderfully concise and maintainable way to updates rows in the table without having to resort to a huge numbers of updates statements that all shared a specific types of logic

1421136
updating	updates
the op may be interested in updating only specific rows .so the rest should remain as they prior to the updates

1421144
put	get
i can of course find mirror manually and put it in urllist but the geographical browsing in cpan was really handy but i can t seem to be able to get it any longer

1421151
selected	button
on click on edit button the selected rows detail in gridview should display in the registration form

1421151
selected	button
by selected a row .when we click on delete button it should delete that particular recording from the xml file

1421152
contains	set
it contains such a spin control and alternatively my personal preferences a spin-decorator that can decorator various numeric controls like integertextbox numerictextbox also part of the control set in xaml like this

1421155

installation	building
you re best bet is to store the installation directory of the application on the systemd and then use that to building your paths within the application

1421289
gethashcode	equals
types that implements comparator must overrides equals.types that overrides equals must also overrides gethashcode

1421294
stderr	stdout
keep in mind that you have to read everything the .app send to stdout and stderr else it might get stuck writing there

1421305
contains	elements
you could do this by defining a new class to contains both defining one more more subclassing of your original elements types using a generics pair using a general-purpose dictionary or just storing the meta-data in the original object which would the be obvious approach in say javascript

1421320
gethashcode	equals
two equals items should return the same hashcode which are used for quickly finding items used as key in hashtable .so if you overrides equalss then you should al.so overrides gethashcode

1421328
gethashcode	equals
there are two ways that object in your code could be compared equals and gethashcode

1421328
gethashcode	equals
for your object to be compared properly in all situations .when you overrides the equals methods used for some comparisons you must also overrides gethashcode used in the rest

1421332
value	field	gethashcode	equals
.when a class overridess equalss it should also overrides gethashcode since two equals object should hash to the same value and this hash should be based on the field properties used in the implementation of equalsity

1421334
controllers	routes
the idea is to inject routes at init and .when the request cannot be routed to one of the inject routes it should be forwarded to the error controllers

1421334
controllers	routes
.when i do that the error controllers no longer routes unrouted request to the error controllers

1421334
controllers	routes
in stead it routes all unrouted request to indexaction on the default controllers

1421359
order	add
add the main function that call those functions in appropriate order last

1421421
boolean	int
date boolean string text decimal int are distinct datatypes here

1421432
value	field
you still need an assignment to s and computing the other value in but that seems to be much more readable .when there are not 100 field

1421439
base-class	inherited
you could create a base-class that all your windows forms inherited from

1421446
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox plugins

1421453
execute	declare
prolog is declarative where you declare facts and rules and is execute by constructing queries on these relations

1421462
unix	aix
i am moving an application from unix aix to windows

1421489
selected	textbox
what i m trying to do is take the result-of a sql selected query and place that in a string variables .so it can be used in things like a textbox or labels

1421491
malloc	free
from what i know correct me please a memory allocated with malloc will never be release back to the systemd ever until the process ends i.e the allocation will simply keep it in the free list if i free it

1421493
updating	updates	rollback	commit
depending on the frameworks and tools you re using your session may get a lock on the recording .when you perform the updates preventing other sessions from updating it until you commit or rollback

1421502
rollback	commit
in that case commit rollback will be explicit

1421510
keyboard	mouse
you can overrides wndproc updates program.lastactiontime on each relevant keyboard mouse event messages

1421530
attributes	properties
i have written a custom credit-card validation attributes that checked cardnumber properties is valid for a particular card types another properties in the same class

1421532
malloc	free
this applies only to your current systemd based on the documentation you have provided for free and mmap and malloc but as the previous poster has stated behavior of these is implementation dependent

1421552
windows-xp	windows
there are systemd call that can do this but it is not supported on all versioning of windows in particular windows-xp does not support awe

1421559
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
i parsing a text cal code with bufferedreader and bufferedwriter in java unfortunately line which i red and wrote with outstream.write line

1421583
.when	ready
if there may be cases where you aren t ready to create the menu immediately .when the xml loads because for example you reload other assets or display an animation

1421583
.when	ready
it s clean and straightforward to process the xml immediately .when it finishes loading .so the xml object can be release .so if you re not ready to make the menu yet it would make sense to parsing it into an intermediate arrays

1421587
bufferedwriter	writer	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	bufferedreader	writer
well bufferedwriter and bufferedreader are encoding agnostic - they never deal with the actual encoding as they re just buffering existing readers and writer

1421587
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
to work round this you should usually use an inputstream inputstreamreader or outputstream outputstreamwriter pair possibly wrapped in a bufferedreader bufferedwriter and specify the encoding explicit

1421588
global-assembly-cache	gac
do the dlls get stored in a shared location ie. the gac -- global-assembly-cache or are they stored in the application folder

1421594
malloc	free
if you were to free the remaining allocation glib s malloc implementation should be able to return most of the pages allocated back to the systemd

1421607
erlang	python
i have a python scripting which manages an erlang daemons

1421607
erlang	python
now .when i include the same scripting under etc init.d and with the symlinks properly set in etc rcx.d the python scripting still works but my erlang daemons fails to start and leaves no discernible trace crash_dump dmesg etc.

1421610
void	main
unless you re doing anything special your .app probably only has one .appdomain .so putting this in your public static void main methods should suffice

1421613
scrollbar	tooltip
as we know ie selectdrop down list has limitations on tooltip on individual option items and also horizontal scrollbar

1421650
daemons	systemd
to manually run the scripting the same way the systemd does use service daemons start if you have that cmd or else try

1421662
hash	md5
yes if you hash the ip-address with md5 or sha1 you ll get the same hash for a given ip but without the ability to easily reverse it

1421662
hash	md5
if this is a concern instead of a 128bit hash like md5 use a 32-bit hash .so that the hash spaces is the same size as the ip-address spaces

1421662
hash	md5
to do this you could simply truncated an md5 hash

1421687
while-loop	arrays
you ll have to convert the string to bytes and replace the escape sequences with the relevant bytes in the process probably needs a while-loop and then use encoding.utf8.getstring on the resulting byte arrays

1421697
put	get
i admit i m not a c++ expert i m certainly not as seasoned in it as many of you seem to be but if i can cut and paste 99 of the code from c# to c++ and get it to work in 5 mins then i m a little put out that it takes twice as long to execute

1421700
ref	out
since c# does not allow me to pass a specialization of object .when using out or ref the solution i found claimed that assign the variables to a variables of the types object would be enough

1421701
contains	any
you cannot use any getstring on a variant contains numeric as the binary representation of the variant data depends on it s types and trying to get a string from what is actually a numbers would result in garbage -- hence the exception-handling

1421718
serialization	marshalling	boolean	int
the one downside of this approach is because matlab doesn t have a way to marshalling or serialization arbitrary matlab object into java you re limited to floating-point numbers int need to cast them in matlab using int8 etc. boolean strings arrays and java object

1421765
class-members	accessor
also are you under the impression that you should have accessor for all class-members

1421770
checkbox	button	radio	click
the click methods is intended to be used with input elements of types button checkbox radio reset or submit

1421775
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1421778
zipfile	archive
should i archive the folder in a zipfile

1421787
selected	button
i needed to run some javascript on a piece of selected text that was fired by click on a toolbar button span with background-image

1421793
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
true i do have a uitabbarcontroller waiting in the wings and it has tabs with uinavigationcontroller and other vcs in it

1421808
implements	abstract
in jdk 1.6 it can also be used .when the annotations methods implements an abstract methods defined in an interface or superclass

1421810
contains	any
each named that contains a double underscore.js _ _ or begins with an underscore.js followed by an uppercase letter 2.11 is reserved to the implementation for any use

1421821
arrays	loops
you would rewrite these algorithm to use pre-allocated arrays and run with tight loops over these

1421849
double	int
the big difference between converting int to long and converting float to double is that the int types have two components sign and value while floating-point numbers have three components sign mantissa and exponent

1421901
hotmail	gmail
imap settings for yahoo hotmail and gmail

1421948
rdbms	acid
if your need is data centric what you really need is a file if you need transactional acid then your need is rdbms database

1421950
malloc	free
for your specific implementation there is no rea.son to free since the malloc won t release to systemd memory and .so it will only release memory back to your own allocation

1421968
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
tested in firefox 2 google-chrome 2.0 opera 9.10 and of course ie 6

1421978
profiling	trace
looking at the profiling trace next to the iis request log there is an expected 1-1 correspondence between request and queries

1421978
profiling	trace
or how the profiling trace may be missing some queries that according to iis went through fine.

1422001
keyboard	mouse
am i just rubbish at using my mouse and keyboard or have i completely misunderstood this properties

1422002
jndi	jdbc
your modules lookup their jdbc connections in jndi they don t need to know that they are using different databases

1422027
httpconnection	downloading
you can downloading image using httpconnection and inputstreaming create encodedimage from streaming and then display it

1422052
any	set
any idea what i have to do to get the control to reflect changes made to the datasource after it has been set

1422100
json	xml
but then instead of parsing it with modules such as json or simplejson it tries to parsing it as xml -- and obviously this attempt fails

1422103
profiling	trace
sql 2008 will allow you to run a profiling trace on the query

1422119
hidden	reset
on windows this translation to storing information in the registry and is therefore hidden from the user to a certain extent but would allow you to reset the value in an emergency using regedit

1422121
mapping	unique
the overall concept of msi is that there is a 1 1 mapping between a component guid unique identifier and an absolute-path install location key path

1422121
any	set
set the versioned file if any as key file

1422124
malloc	free
there s no immediate problem with returning memory allocated with malloc or new but you do have the problem of ownership what function should free delete it .when and what do you do about possible copies

1422132
queue	fifo
if you want polymorphism you need pointers in c++ .so would use a deque of pointers to the abstract types assuming it s a fifo queue rather than a lifo

1422132
buffering	streaming
if you re implements techniques to marshall your messages object to and from binary anyway you might end up saving yourself some bother if your queue is just a buffering streaming

1422153
required	checked
checked what is the minimum client footprint required to connect c# to an oracle

1422170
conditional	parentheses
one confirmed and documented by microsoft bug i ran into was that datatable.select doesn t always evaluate and conditional correctly .when there are parentheses in the statement

1422172
stderr	stdout
you need to capture stdout stderr

1422175
python	ruby
python and ruby support the assignment you re trying to do

1422181
powerpc	arm
modern x86 chip have the sse instructions many powerpc chip have the altivec instructions and even some arm chip have a vector instruction set called neon

1422181
arrays	loops
vectorization simplified is the process of rewriting a loops .so that instead of process a single elements of an arrays n time it process say 4 elementss of the arrays simultaneously n 4 time

1422181
arrays	loops
the term vectorization is also used to describe a higher level software transformation where you might just abstract away loops altogether and just describe operating on arrays instead of the elements that comprise them

1422181
arrays	loops
consider the following very simple loops that adds the elements of two arrayss and stores the results to a third arrays

1422184
ns-3	ns2
templates argumentss and base-classes both affect adl .so i think gcc is correct here ns-3 comes from the current scoping ns1 from the x templates arguments and ns2 from the base-class of the templates arguments

1422188
python	c++
the thing is going to be not only cross platform but different clients in programming languages will access it c++ objective-c python etc .so i m trying to find most simple thing to work in all cases

1422201
browser-cache	caching
the avatars are already caching in the browser-cache .so don t try to implements your own caching mechanism

1422218
contains	elements	contains	any
a violation of this rules occurs .when a using directive or a using-alias directive is placed outside of a namespace elements unless the file does not contains any namespace elementss

1422220
environment	execution
if it is the execution context object in a context only call ones in the same context then you might use one thread per environment and store the local-globals in a thread-local storage or just a global map with key being thread ids

1422247
probability	cdf
the way i am trying to crack this is to get the cdf of my kernel and then get it to tell me the variate if i pass it a cumulative probability inverse cdf

1422265
put	get
i guess the question is does the custom validation get associated with the dropdownlistfor or do you put a custom validation on all of the field a b c d e f etc...or is there the concept of a form-level custom validation that i can have called

1422268
value	field
i can add to the table ok and in flame robin it show the timestamp field as having a millisecond value

1422299
textmate	macvim
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1422321
sql-server	oracle
i have 3 very large stored procedure i need convert from sql-server to oracle is that a converter out there that anyone has tried that would work for this

1422334
oracle	mysql
please see convert ms sql scripting to mysql and oracle

1422351
comm	grep
use a combinations of 2 grep and a comm as follows patterns are a and b

1422365
methodology	waterfall
it seems to me that some methodologies are more susceptible to being a death march waterfall as you mentioned comes to mind it seems like any methodology with sufficient bad management could become one

1422405
blacklist	whitelist
i have three tables being used for this problem songs blacklist and whitelist

1422405
blacklist	whitelist
the songs table has a column named accesstype which stores one of these four value public private blacklist whitelist

1422405
blacklist	whitelist
it seems to me like i need to join the blacklist and or whitelist table under certain conditional but i have no idea if this is possible or even the right approach

1422406
command-prompt	cmd
run the standards windows command-prompt cmd

1422406
command-prompt	cmd
at the command-prompt shell prompt run the following windows cmd

1422466
linux	unix
.when i look at-job descriptions for google amazon etc they all required c++ and linux unix experience

1422466
linux	unix
is c++ coding completely different for linux unix envs compiler should only be different right

1422476
defined	declare
after that you can declare a classpath in ant that is defined by the dependencies in your pom

1422485
cassini	iis
note the blank page is coming from cassini if you move the .app to an actual iis server you will see the 401

1422486
shell	bash
the shell available and their difference bash ksh sh as well as how to use the tools cmd to create sophisticated scripting

1422487
controllers	routes
the problem .when you remove the default routes is that zend no longer understands the urls module controllers action .so .whenever a route is sent it gets routed to the default module index controllers index action

1422501
stderr	stdout
the scripting runs fine .when stdout stderr are not redirected

1422501
stderr	stdout
.when i add both stderr and stdout redirection i getg the following error

1422513
ruby-on-rails	django
i d rather work with a team including management and users that truly understood the agile mindset but programmed in fortran than a team who chose ruby-on-rails or django because they sounded cool but couldn t tell scrum from spam

1422517
selection	cell
single and multiple row and cell selection

1422539
populate	row
i currently have a master datagrid at the top of the page which i would like to allow the user .when selected a particular grid row to see a sub-datagrid below be populate with specific data relevant to that specific row of master data

1422559
contains	any
the second grouping is split into the first part or the url assumed to contains any character other than then match any numbers of groupinging of followed by a non-digit followed by anything other than

1422568
credentials	account
the obvious solution would be simple impersonation .when launchd the application - however i run into a small problem whereas i am not priviledged to the user account credentials username passwd and therefore am unable to impersonate in the conventional way

1422592
webforms	asp.net
if i start running my asp.net webforms .app from the vs2008 ide in debugging mode is there a way i can tell it to then quit the debuggingging but keep on running

1422629
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but internet-explorer is generator an error

1422637
any	set
the trick is to make sure the indexes and partition if any are set up well

1422644
32-bit	64bit
if you re running on 64bit windows you must remember to make changes to both the 32-bit and 64bit .net configuration-files

1422645
row	col
i typically extends from abstracttablemodel .so that i can call nice functions like firetablecellupdated row col etc

1422647
value	field
instead you could probably have each field requiredfieldvalidator disabled maintain a list for each of the field validation and in the switching statement you can loops through them enable them call isvalid on them store the value in a bool and and the results then use the final bool result for the customvalidator s args.isvalid properties

1422647
switching	screens
this approach can get very tricky and feel hacked together if you don t debugging it properly because you need to be aware of all the enabling disabling going on otherwise you may find that you re unable to submit the page .when everything appears valid on screens but in actuality something was left enabled .when you should ve disabled all validation on each call before the switching then enabled just the ones you need

1422650
ruby	php
it is a common anti-patterns in the php world that frameworks like ruby or django are cloned only as a subset of what these modern frameworks deliver - as a typical syndrome yuo see a lack of good acl or rbac integration into these frameworks - what essentially is a joke

1422657
put	get
i could put the dance program in a network database but i d have to shove instructions in fairly quickly and there d be a lot of readers using a rather thick protocols dbi sqlclient etc.. to get a small bit of text

1422685
file-descriptor	pipe
the pipe creates two file-descriptor one for reading and an another for writing

1422712
json	csv
here s an extremely simplified example of what we re doing to use the bulkloader to load json data instead of csv data

1422721
executable	jar
one thing to add to all of the above if you don t have the jar executable available it comes with the jdk but not with the jre you can use unzip or winzip or whatever to accomplish the same thing

1422724
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
regarding the amf libs for python perl php which are easier to develop than .net java

1422725
hash	md5
in my user database-table i take the md5 hash of the email-address of a user as the id

1422725
hash	md5
convert_uuencode and convert_uudecode for the md5 hash

1422725
hash	md5
replace every character of the md5 hash by its ord value

1422727
ref	out
if the pointers is to a single primitive types and not an arrays use ref out to describe the parameter

1422730
vb.net	vb6	basic	vb6	file-handling	file-access
the data ideally can be read by normals windows file-access methods ie a std file filesystemobject object streaming and text file all basic pc vb6 vb.net file-handling methods even excel text import

1422755
json	xml
recently converted to json from ini files and dreaded xml

1422758
push	pull
mercurial works in changeset not files .so you can t use traditional pull push to do this

1422796
bmp	png
if you are converting between lossless formats ie bmp png etc any image libs including the fcl image bitmap classes will work perfectly fine

1422823
gedit	gnome
the technical answer is that gedit is a gtk gnome program and expects to find a current gconf session for its configuration

1422828
subtract	time
once you have the individual parts you can try figuring out how old the file is by simply doing the same process with the current date time and subtract

1422857
on-the-fly	tar
percona s opensource xtrabackup application will perform compressed tar backup on-the-fly - along with lots of other interesting things

1422872
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
windows powershell is easy to adopt learn and use because it works with your existing it infrastructure and existing scripting investments and because it runs on windows-xp windows-vista and windows-server 2003

1422906
pdfsharp	migradoc
i was planning on using pdfsharp migradoc to do it but then we d have to create document and time its readiness with sql-server data state and mail state

1422918
callback	methods
you ll specify the methods that should be invoked asynchronously as well as the callback methods to which control will return once process is complete

1422923
implements	abstract
if you would not implements an abstract member in a non-abstract class imagine what would happen at runtime .when calling a methods without implementsation

1422925
static-code-analysis	code-metrics
this also has the advantage of potentially running other scripting on the building such as doing code-metrics static-code-analysis etc whenever a building is checked in

1422925
restrict	shared
if the project reference from the shared location and explicit say not to restrict to a specific versioning everything should just work fine

1422943
routed-events	uielement
the routed event owner can be any class but routed-events must be raised by and handled by uielement or contentelement derived classes inorder to be useful

1422991
instances	self
plus self will be the class not the instances

1423000
web.py	django
but it seems that most frameworks such as web.py django zope are still based on python 2.x

1423005
tablelayoutpanel	panels	flowlayoutpanel	groupbox	splitter	panels
use layout engines the standards flowlayoutpanel and tablelayoutpanel ones or custom ones instead of creating deep hierarchies of nested panels groupbox and splitters an empty splitter itself consumes three windows handles...

1423018
latex	tex
parsing general tex is a task that might euphemistically be called nontrivial try running this file through tex but for typical latex math expression you could start from matplotlib s parsing and hack it to do the replacements you want

1423041
ruby-on-rails	django
frameworks that depend on persistent process including ruby-on-rails django zope and others some of these will run under cgi but will run slowly and are suitable only for development purposes

1423075
cursor	row
i would like to make a custom cursoradapter that takes a cursor and provides an extra summary row at the end

1423075
cursor	row
such that given a cursor with 4 rows the listview will contains 5 rows the 4 rows from the cursor plus a fifth row that containss some totals from the previous 4 rows

1423079
linux	unix
linux unix part is what ennuikiller describe knowing the systemd basic usage apis makefile etc

1423079
boost	stl
people are either looking for basic understanding of pointers memory usage stl templates and such or they re looking for development experience with specific libs like boost or qt

1423088
quicktime	qtkit
32-bit quicktime has mediasetsoundbalance but i don t see an equivalent properties for qtkit at the media or tracking level could be wrong though

1423123
.net	wcf
wcf service iis6 .net v3.5

1423125
.net	wcf
alternatively if you re using wcf and you have access to the .net interfaces used to specifications the web service you can get object out of the other end look into datacontract

1423130
http	ssl
is the http connection over ssl http

1423130
ssl-certificate	ssl
if .so it s possible that the ssl-certificate you are using to connect isn t recognized by the jvm as a trusted ssl cert

1423142
enumerator	any
2 if you do not want the list to be modified by any consumer the list of points can t change once you re done manipulating them then consider exposing an enumerator for the list instead of the list itself

1423145
command-line	cmd
first to level set i use embarcadero rad xe these days .so the cmd that follow are the command-line tools that ship with rad xe

1423156
instances	destroy
if you attempt to use .datepicker destroy this fails to destroy this ghost instances because it doesn t actually exist

1423162
seam	jsf
if memory serves the facescontext is set up and torn down in the facesservlet in core jsf you may know better than me if seam required other servlets to do some lifecycle lifting

1423178
licensing	eula
i think those controls would violate the ms office distribution or eula licensing agreements with microsoft

1423189
assign	add
in your case make a canvas hbox or vbox as the custom-component and add the combobox as a child.set the dataprovider on the datagrid itself and assign the itemrenderer to the column and then overrides the set data function of the itemrenderer to access all data from the given data provider for that instances as seen below

1423202
authentication	login
building an entirely custom login authentication framework

1423217
callback	methods
my conclusion .so far is inside this callback methods function result i do have read access to the outer object here but i do not have write access

1423218
binaries	install
1 binaries only - i use an install project for that

1423238
put	get
you ve spoke your piece now shut up and do the work they tell you to do do it well do it fast and if you want put as much asp.net-mvc into it your part as you want as long as you don t tell anyone else how to write their code if you re .so good you get it done extra fast then ask them for more work to do and repeat above step

1423239
cursor	row
another option instead of changing the cursor is to use addfooterview to add another row on your list that does not come from your cursor data

1423251
python	c++
i am having an issue trying to communication between a python tcp server and a c++ tcp client

1423251
python	c++
.when i run a c++ client and a c++ server a hacked replica of what the python one would do the client faithfully send both the psh ack and ack packets the whole time even after the first call

1423251
python	c++
if .so why would it do .so .when connect to my c++ server and not the python server

1423260
macros	vba
the end goal is to generator a text file in a format that is usable by a specific vba for words macros that generator a styled words document which will then be digested by a words-friendly cms

1423261
linux	aix
i use this on .solaris 9 and 10 macos x 10.4.x 10.5.x hp-ux 11.x linux rhel4 and 5 suse 9 and 10 and aix 5.x and 6.x - afaicr without problems .so far

1423279
highlight	selected	selection	highlight
there are certainly some advantages in having a selection rectangle highlight the currently selected elements which also has the focus

1423294
any	set
you can set the width of inline elements like and but you wonâ t notice any effect until you positioning them

1423294
any	set
b assuming width can be set - we wonâ t notice any effects thus the width we specify until we positioning inline elements

1423295
unix	aix
other unix systemd like hp-ux aix may have similar issues

1423301
children	nodes
basically i want to know if a given nodes children are visible in a gtk.nodeview

1423307
dto	dao
the controllers responds to a users updates request by invoking a service methods with the dto contains the updatess information including the versioning properties and the service methods in turn uses a data-access object dao to persistent the changes

1423333
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this is working exactly as expected

1423338
display	width
as others have mentioned setting the width or some other position-related properties of an inline elements will cause the browser to then display the elements as a block elements

1423343
actionscript	haxe
alternatively you could use flashplayer 9+ in theory but you d have to implements the whole protocols in actionscript 3 or haxe .so that s not .so much of an option i guess .

1423378
postgresql	mysql
i am changing from mysql to postgresql but can t find equivalent to mysql s collation utf8_general_ci

1423379
hashtable	set
i have a need to set a collections of named value pairs inside my application - representing effectively a many-to-many map key can have multiple value and vice-versa .so hashtable and hashmap don t really work for me

1423387
python	perl
alternative solution since the original one won t work without limitations as mentioned in the comments as part of your build-process use a scripting perl or python would do it easily to generator staticstring.h from staticstring.txt adding quotes and n s as necessary then use the other solution

1423389
llvm	gcc
there are a couple of difference between llvm and a regular compiler which i ll assume to mean gcc

python	ruby
as for javascript and other dynamic-languages we re seeing a lot of interesting in llvm from the dynamic-languages community with python and ruby implementation trying it out

1423389
interpreter	runtime
in particular the are optimizing long running executable using a mixed-mode interpreterer where they initially interpreter the programs and then compile them using llvm at runtime

1423405
code-coverage	cobertura
i ve been having trouble recording code-coverage in hudson with cobertura due to the tests run and recorded twice problem

1423405
cobertura	emma	code-coverage	cobertura	code-coverage	emma
the solution can be based on cobertura or emma or any other java code-coverage tool

1423429
delphi	c++
borland delphi does that via preprocessor i don t know about c++

1423436
value	field
it uses .some zero value for all data types - .so you need to use .some other noyes field to express what you want if 0 is not empty

1423461
markup	tidy
try running your code through html tidy and or the w3c s markup validation service and then fixing the problems that are identified

1423484
shell	bash
i need to use bash shell inside c# program

1423484
shell	bash
how ca i create a cygwin bash shell with tty device and redirect the stdin out and error

1423494
value	field
if all you need is to extraction the description field value perhaps replacing all the unwanted stuff with empty strings is not the best solution

1423494
value	field
assuming your question can be turned around to ask how do i extraction the description field value

1423520
authentication	login
is it possible to perform authentication of the ftp user as in ftp login not just ssl negotiation validation by supplying a client certificate public key

1423520
scp	ssh	sftp	scp	sftp	ssh
i know i can do this with scp or sftp because the ssh server handles that just great

1423520
authentication	login	ftps	ftp
a are there any implementation of ftp servers that support ssl ftps and client authentication login via certificate

1423532
benchmarking	profiling
again benchmarking and profiling are your friend

1423537
spaces	output
ok i found the problem by the help of the last comment from the dcaunt actually i just take look at the binary .source of the output file and noticed that there is tiny newline character and spaces at the first line .so by removing them the file return to it s normals state and it s become readable

1423539
if-statement	loops
1 another alternative is just to indentation the if-statement - but give some indication that you really did mean the if-statement to be in loops

1423551
hash	md5
but if what you want to do is convert an md5 hash into a string

1423560
contains	elements
.when i run the above code only one elements is pushed back into data which contains 4 bytes only from the original data in f

1423561
hide	show
i m trying to show up a containers if a input-field gets the focus and - that s the actual problem - hide the containers if focus is lost

1423566
double	int
except .when i try to convert a double types matrix to int types matrix or vice versa

1423567
put	get	floating	margins
similar to how you would do it on the web you can just put the tab control and floating control inside a grid and set the margins of the floating control to get it in the right spot

1423567
contains	elements	contains	set
you could also use a canvas elements to contains the grid and floating control and set the canvas.left and canvas.top

1423585
any	set
there is a properties called dataformatstring to get the format you want set this to mm dd yyyy then you dont need to do any formatting at all in the code-behind

1423599
javascript	dom
i ve some javascript that tests dom nodes types against like this

1423599
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
of course it all works fine in firefox safari and opera

1423601
margins	padding
2 why does applying padding cause the margins of parent div and child h1 not to collapse

1423642
contains	any	aggregate	grouping
any other db than mysql would throw an error if you tried to selected columns that weren t either in the grouping by or contains within an aggregate statement like sum colname

1423652
object-oriented-database	relational-database
furthermore i doubt your idea of storing everything as a blob in the database use a relational-database what a database has been designed for or switching to some object-oriented-database like which supports both java and c++

1423655
datagrid	textbox
my datagrid have combo boxes and textbox in them .so it s pretty common-controls

1423675
contains	any
you should also note that storing a path in any form other than flags 1 can cause problems if the path contains one or more of

1423682
push	pull
edit answering the question the image .when implements as a barbuttonitem will flow off the screens .when you push pull the next view controllers as expected

1423689
sql-server	oracle
that said if you re using a database the way you suggest you really shouldn t be using a full-strength rdbms like oracle or sql-server but rather a lightweight key-value store such as berkeley-db or one of the many cloud table engines

1423707
overwrite	import
if the install is that bad you may have better luck collecting the necessary hkcu registry settings use process monitor or reg export hkcu before and after installation and diff them into a .reg file and cobble up .some .sort of startup scripting that import the registry entries on login and leaves a breadcrumbs .so it doesn t re-run for the same user and overwrite their settings

1423712
cruisecontrol.net	buildbot
hudson cruisecontrol.net and buildbot can all be configure for perl project although feature support will vary hudson is a little java-centric

1423726
gridview	listview
i am really surprised at the scarce documentation sample code for the wpf gridview listview view gridview

1423740
value	field
and now a new .app has to add users to this database but it has a new requirement and a new field that needs to be added that s default-value is populate from a value stored in a completely different 3rd party .application s database

1423749
operators	keyword
.when using the through keyword the usual m2m manipulation methods are no longer available this means add create remove or assignment with operators

1423777
radio-button	selected
how can i checked whether a radio-button is selected

1423779
margins	padding
as a good practice get your layout correct first before you set padding and margins

1423783
radio-button	selected
if you re just looking to see if any radio-button is selected anywhere on the page prototypejs makes it very easy

1423783
radio-button	selected
here s a function that will return true if at least one radio-button is selected somewhere on the page

1423805
order	add
.when a user order they are presented with a list of product on their order and can optional add that product to myproduct

1423808
defined	declare
note that you cannot cast things to that types declare or defined functions with prototypes that use that types or even dynamically allocate variables of that types - there is no named for the types to use

1423808
typedef	struct
to a first approximation c++ automatically creates a typedef for you .when you use the plain struct x .

1423814
json	xml
if i want to go really really cross language i normally would suggest json as the ease of javascript support and an abundance of libs as well as being human-readable and modifiable i prefer it to xml as i find it smaller in terms of chars faster and more readable

1423828
selected	cell
i have a table below that has a selected box as the first cell in my table

1423841
conditional	operators
i find that chaining conditional operators

1423844
json	xml
i found a json plugins for mine that lets me view the json structure as a tree but it natively supports an xml view

1423852
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
checked limits it to checkbox radio button that are selected within the previous grouping

1423852
radio-button	selected
if you want to avoid this altogether mark one of the radio-buttons as checked in the html code which would guarantee that one radio-button is always selected

1423856
selected	button
.so you ve got selected textinput + where that + is a button to commit the contents of the textinput

1423856
selected	button
selected that option presents a modal windows of some sort with a textinput and add button

1423862
order	add
you could automatically add every product they order to my product

1423864
jquery	.post
i m doing a jquery ajax .post like this

then in a mouse click handler i call it again to create a blue box in a new glass panels

1423891
jquery	.post
form.serialize is the correct way to .post a form in jquery

1423898
.net	wcf
this can be a little more complex but can also provide strong-typing for dealing with changes from the service provider you ll know .when it breaks. the datacontractserialization class used for wcf provides the fastest and most efficient serialization within the .net as a points of reference

1423919
selected	button
how about something like a small button to the right of the selected box which turns it into a writable until you press enter or unfocus it

1423936
value	field
if you want to do any custom validation defined your own clean_filed_name that returns the cleaned field value or raises forms.validationerror

1423947
groovy	scala
if you are coming from groovy background where they have an implicit iterator or even from scala where you can do without this |i| using partials functions then you might find it a logical question however at the current moment the best you can do in ruby 1.9 or even inside ruby-on-rails is to use the symbol#to_block methods like jrl mentioned

1423961
binaries	install
set path .so that install binaries can be found

1423968
httpd.conf	hosts
normally i work locally using mamp and virtual hosts setup in my httpd.conf .so that i can points a browser to and have as many project as i need setup

1423972
margins	padding
a line of text has some spaces above it based on line height that has nothing to do with margins or padding

1423972
margins	padding
2 i don t know the exact reasoning behind why margins don t collapse .when padding is also involved

1423975
administration	account
did you add that account as an administration in the server

1424137
selected	button
right-click your toolbar and selected customize then click on the keyboard button in the lower left of that dialog

1424166
rowdatabound	databound
i think that rowdatabound and databound are too late in the game .so not sure what to do

1424173
ruby	php
i ve done very little work with ruby and have an .app i ve written in php

1424173
ruby	php
i could either try to translation the ruby to php or try mixing the two

1424173
ruby	php
i believe my options are to either mix ruby with php or translation the ruby code into php

1424179
configuration	environment
there are many different recipes for maintaining multiple parallels configuration environment for django project but i find the simplest methods to simply be adding something like this to the bottom of my settings.py

1424191
ruby	php
may be you can turn the ruby-on-rails part to rest api and use it gradually with php though honestly there is no one reason to turn back from ruby to php..

1424194
populate	row
i then populate a uipickerview from the object stored in the arrays and .when the user selected a row in the picker display content pulled from the same object

1424219

1424256
selected	button
i m trying to write a test for the routine to be called by a button click that will perform some operations on the selected rows of the grid

1424256
constructor	object
the datagridviewselectededrowcollection object has no constructor .so the only way i can figure to create it is to put together a datagridview in my test project then selected .some rows and pass in the selectededrows properties

1424266
ruby	php
i m not very familiar with php but one approach might be to write a shell scripting in ruby and call that from php

1424272
subclassing	accessor
similar to what i describe in this answer you can create a uiview subclassing and overrides the -settransform accessor methods to adjust the transform that the uiscrollview will try to apply to your uiview

1424272
uiscrollview	subviews
set this uiview to hosts your content subviewss and make it the subviews of the uiscrollview

1424309
attributes	properties
.when i dug into system.data.entity assembly using reflector on the positioning of failure system.data.objects.lightweightcodegenerator.validatesetterproperties runtimemethodhandle settermethodhandle methodinfo settermethodinfo types realtypes i noticed that it call runtimemethodhandle.value properties which has the following attributes on get accessor securitypesrmission securityaction.linkdemand unmanagedcode true

1424313
any	set
note how i ve set it s height to 5 and then given an upper margins of 5 to the second listbox .so that neither elements hide any part of the other

1424314
any	set
note any redundant set of parentheses surrounding the overloaded function named is ignore 5.1

1424314
conditional-operator	operands
but there s a conditional-operator in the way and conditional-operators determine their typess from their operands not from any target types

1424335
symfony	kohana	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	kohana	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	kohana
you can also use an asp.net-mvc framework such as symfony kohana solar codeigniter or zend-framework to help you keep discipline about separating your php templates code from the rest of your application code

1424363
rational-numbers	digits	rational-numbers	bigint
if you really need to see all 150+ digits you should use the bigint for int bigrat for rational-numbers and the bignum for floating-point numbers modules

1424374
python	perl
in theory i can wrap it with either perl or python whichever is easier to get this behavior but then i d need to shell out anyway to map the drive

1424412
silverlight	wpf
according to you it seems silverlight reverted to wpf behavior

1424415
input-field	selected
i think i did a bit of sloppy coding to get the footer divs to line up horizontally but that then meant that the top divs can t be selected which isn t great .when one of them is an input-field

1424426

autoscroll	panels
basically you d just have a user-controls with a vscrollbar docked on the right and a panels with autoscroll false docked on the left taking up the remainder of the spaces

1424501
constructor	object
.so the .solutions is the defining the copy_constructor in the class.the copy constructor takes reference to an existing object of the same types as its arguments and it is used to create a new object from an existing one

1424510
constructor	object
while this for most intuitively appears to be the declaration of an object a of types a taking a temporary b object as a constructor parameter it s actually a declaration of a function a returning an a taking a pointers to a function which returns b and itself takes no parameters

1424511
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
python perl and php all support tcp streaming sockets

1424523

for example to set my editor to gedit if in gnome and emacs if using a command-line

1424539
csla	wcf
however now that wcf and rest are out there they have removed a large part of the reason that one would want to use csla

1424542
installation	upgrade
then next upgrade simply import the source into a project in your new eclipse installation

1424546
export	csv
however it might just be easily to export to a csv file or tab-delimited or whatever and have your database import that file

1424548
contains	set
using asp.net-mvc .when trying to get the information stored on my session objectname from the constructor i see that the session has not been set yet but once the controllers has been construct then the session contains the right information

1424553
required	checked
.so inorder to make jboss use the new drivers remove the old jar from the .lib directory if it s not there look at the startup scripting and find from where it s added to the classpath replace it with the new drivers updates your mssql-ds.xml if required especially the and checked the drivers documentation restart jboss

1424570

any file that does not have the hidden attributes set

1424618
home-directory	tmp
for instances if i launchd idle from a directory called tmp in my home-directory the default save path is set to tmp

1424626
value	field
i don t think any of the answers here are robust given that it depends on the id field being consecutive and that even if it is consecutive that it is the right value in the next consecutive recording

1424653
object-reference	instances
building directory mypath . publication web object-reference is not set to an instances of an object

1424661

attributes	properties
i found the browsable attributes but it says it is for properties and events

1424687
python	php
make your php and or python self-aware enough not to .post the same messages twice

click	mouse
how can i detection .when a jradiobutton is changed from unselected to selected .when click with the mouse

1424738
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
i ve tried using an actionlistener on the button but that gets fired every time the radio-button is click not just .when it s changing state to selected

1424738
variables	boolean
i ve thought of maintaining a boolean variables that remembers the state of the button and test it inside the actionlistener to see whether to change its state but i m wondering if there s a much better or cleaner solution

1424762
changelistener	listener
a changelistener will fire for all sorts of things meaning your listener will receive 5 or more events per click

1424762
radio-button	selected
it just works better because you know that if you are in the methods then the radio-button has either just been selected or deselected not that the user is just banging on the interface for some unknown reason

1424777
getter	setter
should i have in model attr_accessor hours minutes seconds then how do i convert these virtual attributess into my duration attributes coming from java i d have setter getter on duration

each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a capacity and a capacityincrement

1424871
strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy
if you have to deal with data contains 0 keep their sizes separately and use memcpy instead of strcpy or strncpy

1424882
function-calls	void
another alternative your compiler may support a command-line option to add function-calls at the entry and exit points of functions some sort of void enterfunc const char callingfunc and void exitfunc const char callingfunc for function cost profiling more accurate stack tracing or similar

1424882
profiling	trace
we use this for getting accurate call trace as well as profiling information

1424939
python	java
java and python say no the other languages say yes well i don t know objective-c but the rest do

1424939
python	java
in a mixed paradigms language my opinion is that java and python have the right idea--if you want to mutate capture variables you re better off being forced to make a class instead which makes the capture process explicit .when you pass them to the constructor for example

1424946
rtsp	rtmp	rtsp	rtp	rtmp	rtp
in research i ve found that there are a few protocols rtsp http-streaming rtmp and rtp

i m looking to do authorize.net payment integration with a website using php

1424949
children	nodes
the simplest way to do this is to populate the children of a nodes in the beforeexpand event

1424949
children	nodes
however the treeview will not display a + - indicating a nodes has children until you actually add children to it

1424949
children	nodes	populate	row
therefore as you populate a parent nodes you should checked if the logical item data row has children and if it does add a dummy nodes

1424949
children	nodes	required	checked
for each of these nodess checked for children and populate the tag properties and a dummy nodes if required

subset	unique
what would be the best way to generator 100000 unique and random of that subset

1425187
credentials	account

1425202
click	mouse
now i have to click on the button with the mouse for it to work i am using onclientclick but how can i make it accept the enter button

1425208
git-branch	git-rebase
try git log git-svn - i don t have a bare repo but i ve just run git-svn fetch and standards git log gives me the current git-rebase log but with the git-svn arg which is the other branch besides master that is identified by git-branch -a in my case i get the log up to the fetched revision

1425217
compact-framework	.net
see windows communication foundation compact edition and the story of the lunch launchd and write an im .app with the .net compact-framework

1425239
installation	packaging
develop in ruby and then find packaging product to create windows mac installation package - not sure how doable this is yet

1425243
worksheet	excel
in sql-server management studio versioning 2005 and up you could also right-click on the result panels choose selected all then selected copy and just paste those value into an open excel worksheet

shell	bash
even a shell scripting bash solution will help

1425306
32-bit	64bit
if you can get away with having zero 64bit components in your setup then you can just make it a 100 32-bit setup and it will work equally well in 32-bit and 64bit windows

1425306
32-bit	64bit
this will allow you to only have 1 installshield project file but generator both 32-bit and 64bit release

1425315
order	add
if you have ways to sort out ties just add it to the order by

1425328

simply feed the numbers 0...100000 into the permutation use the output of the permutation as input to the combinations generator and process the resulting combinations

1425428
32-bit	64bit
the only difference is that one machine is 64bit while the other is 32-bit

1425455
32-bit	64bit
this is dependent on your viewmodel s internal memory setup packing of items 32-bit or 64bit pointers and words alignment size and is not specified by java

1425455
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit vms a pointers is 4 bytes on 64bit vms it is 8 bytes

1425455
hashmap	arrays	value	field

1425676
hashmap	arrays
depending on the context-switch s can also sometimes be replace by arrays or hashmap

1425684
implements	abstract
.so the refactoring here would be to add an interface or abstract types and have the different typess implements that interface and delegation the responsibility to that object

1425686
environment	restart
starting with server 2003 hosting iis6 it is enough to restart the service to bring environment changes and security changes into effect

1425695
required	checked
this construction seems to be a bit weird but in my case this is required because cbase does some checked and cderived can mix some checked in between them

1425695
protected	public
it seems to me it is impossible to have 2 constructor with the same arguments being protected and public

1425705
attributes	properties
c# code if possible each entity one class and each attributes one properties .so it s not necessary to use properties collections

1425710

for instances the flash plugins won t load in a gc-enabled .app although it loads in 64bit because as an npapi plug it is loaded in a 32-bit sandbox

1426016
tuples	any
you could use my jshashtable and then use any object as a key though assuming your tuples are arrayss of int i think your best bet is one you ve mentioned yourself use the join methods of arrays to create properties named of a regular object

1426024
lighttpd	apache
apache has limitrequestbody and lighttpd has server.max-request-size for example

mouseleave	mouseenter
perhaps the mouseleave or mouseenter events are enough in your case

1426390
constructor	object
you are initializer your smtpclient object using it s default parameterless constructor in this line of your code

1426390
constructor	object
since sending an email required that you have access to a valid smtp server this constructor will attempt to initializer the object using the smtp server settings as defined in your web-config file specifically in the system.net section

1426390
constructor	object
to resolve this you can either add this section to your web-config file specifying a valid smtp server for the smtpclient object to connect to or you can omit the and hardcode the server address directly .when you initializer your smtpclient object by utilising one of it s overloaded constructor that accepts the smtp server address port-number as parameters

phpmyadmin	heidisql
run this in your mysql administration tool phpmyadmin navicat heidisql what-have-you

1426824
ubuntu	debian
i think it may be debian ubuntu only though

1426834
constructor	object
the though process behind this is that virtual methodss are calling the most derived versioning of a methods and if the constructor has not finished then the most derived data has not been correctly initializer and therefore doing .so potentially provides an opertunity for use of an invalid object

1426874
innodb	myisam
myisam or innodb

1426892
implements	extends
nwire for java can give you the complete list of classes which extends a given class or implements a specific interface

1427213
updating	updates
the problem with extensions is that you need to updates them .when you re updating the database systemd itself

1427213
versioning	upgrade
databases tend to survive longer than most applications since administration are smart enough to not fix things that aren t broken .so they often don t upgrade their systemd with every new versioning

1427213
versioning	upgrade
still it s a real pain .when you upgrade your database to a newer versioning yet the extensions aren t compatible with that one and thus won t work

1427264
push	pull
aside from the discussion on whether this should be a push or a pull what s the best way to get what is effectively a software-update out

1427362
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
i read here that sorteddictionary does not allow indexed retrieval unlike sortedlist

1427366
selected	checkbox
as usual if choose option 1 it selected all the checkbox and .when it is unchecked it unchecks all

1427366
selected	checkbox
after this i couldn t get it right for the unchecking of a checkbox should uncheck the selected all checkbox too

1427377
hide	show
i have a javascripting which is a little larger .so i tried to show a .gif on the begin off the scripting and hide it after its finished

1427380
value	field
the bwidget combobox widget allows you to fill in an entry field with a value

1427418

your only option is to use the key portion of the key-value pair that was added to the dictionary

1427419
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
is this possible using only a php perl python hosting service

1427427
linked-list	arrays
how about a linked-list coupled with an arrays that holds only references

1427427
linked-list	arrays
the linked-list can grow without having to allocate new memory the arrays would ensure you have easy access

1427427
linked-list	arrays
and every time the arrays becomes to small you can simply trash the entire arrays and building it up again from the linked-list

1427457
double	int
arrays of six int value and an arrays of four double value

1427459
decimal-point	digits
.so basically the first digits before the decimal would represent the vertice and each edges would be represented followed by a decimal-point kind of like an ip-address

1427474
listboxitem	selected
the purpose is that .when the listboxitem is selected i want the grid to show having the selected item expand to show more detail information

1427474
listboxitem	selected
i m assuming this has .something to do with the default state of the listboxitem being collapse .so wpf skips the styles i was hoping it would put them on .when selected fired but it doesn t

1427479
arrays	loops
.so if i wanted the pet named mrfuzzybuttoms i could loops through an indexed arrays until i found the object with the instances variables mrfuzzybuttoms

1427485
instrumentation	debugging
i would think that you are conflating unit-testing with instrumentation debugging

1427490
annotations	mapping	base-class	inherited
use inherited annotations on the base-class and selected one of the 3 possible mapping strategies - single table table per class or joined

1427500
normalize	cosine
and dot-product of normalize vectors which is the same as the cosine of angle between the vectors would be

1427502
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
one way of doing this is having a linked-list of arrays nodes

1427502
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
you have a linked-list and each nodes within the list references an arrays

1427502
linked-list	nodes
accessing the correct nodes required accessing the correct nodes within the linked-list and then fetching there

1427509
put	get
if i put everything in one single i will have that output which i don t want to get

1427541
perl	php
cheap perl php hosting service don t want you running your own long-running process

1427542
any	set
you need to create a dll that sets the caption and intercepts any attempt to set it

1427550
midp	cldc
most mobile-phones use some combinations of the mobile information device .profile midp and the connect limited device configuration cldc

1427558
xlsx	.doc
the xlsx extension is not because the file is hosted in sharepoint but because it is an office 2007 templates all office 2007 extensions have an extra x behind their extension .so .doc becomes .docx

1427573
order	join
it doesn t matter what order you call join in if you only want to wait until they ve all finished

1427578
any	set
i have .some requirement to implements a very non-standard .sort in my datagrid the grid is currently bound to a dataview with the original rows data row filtering set the data comes in realtime .so i do an accept changes on a timer every second to show any changes made on the underlying data table

1427581
subtract	add
rectangular problems with only add subtract bit-shift + table essentially doing rotation by angle of the form tan -1 2 -n

1427581
temporary	copy
in your case take one vector as a fixed reference and copy the other to a temporary vector which you rotate using the cordic angle towards the first vector roughly bisection until you reach a desired angularjs accuracy

1427581
cos	sin
although if multiplies are cheap enough to allow using dot-product then don t bother with cordic perhaps use a table of sin cos pairs for rotation matrix of angle pi

1427595
python	c++	python	java
the protoc tool can generator code in c++ java python .so you can serialization it on one end and deserialization on another

1427605
textbox	button
tabbing out of the textbox triggers the lost-focus vs click a button .so make sure that this isn t the case if you haven t already

1427612
any	set
all that will do is set the rowstate on all of the rows to original which shouldn t have any effect on what s being filtering and sorted through the dataview that you re using unless it has an active rowstatefilter

1427633
digits	base
with base 64 digits

1427657
e-commerce	product
i am making an e-commerce .app and there is a table for order product etc

1427676
constructor	private
the private constructor forces all subclassing of my model to initializer the model with the soruce controllers

1427676
base-class	inherited
this helped me find all of my controllers that were returning views that weren t inherited from the proper base-class

1427701
getter	setter
there is a setter and a getter for the effectivefromdatejulian which is a numbers representation of the date

1427701
getter	setter
it is a getter only though and relies on the setter for the numeric properties to get its data from

1427707
postgresql	mysql
my question is this since ruby-on-rails looks for employees_projects projects_roles and employees_roles but not employees_projects_roles is there a way to alias those namedd to the real table named and still allow crud functionality in the database mysql or postgresql

1427718
hide	show
the above code sets a dom object with id loading to show and hide .when any asynchronous request has been initiated and stopped

1427718
hide	show
this is also possible without jquery of course there s just a bunch of browser compatibility javascript and its not as easy as simply subscribing to the ajaxstart and ajaxstop events to show and hide your loading img

1427765
contains	set
to adjust the size of the image which i assume you ve display on a set of axes using the image cmd you will have to adjust a numbers of axes properties for the axes contains the image

1427777
contains	set
if all that you are concerned about is that the field contains an int not concerned with a range then add a comparevalidator with it s operators properties set to datatypecheck

1427778
authentication	login
if you need some kind of authentication via login then that authentication needs to be part of every web service call

1427781
any	set
i d like to set it up .so that any date that has passed like sep 10 in this example is contracted by default

1427783
execute	declare
in your mojo declare in the javadoc the lifecycle to be execute

1427784
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you re asking whether you can move the mod_rewrite configuration from .htaccess to httpd.conf then yes

1427812
constructor	object
keep the os from buffering the output using the fileoptions parameter of the fstream object s constructor

1427835
runas	cmd
to start an .app as .someone else you could create a batch-file scripting that launchd your .app with the runas cmd though i believe you are prompt for a passwd .so it may not be what you re after

1427850
attributes	properties
note that order-by attributes needs to specify column named s not properties named

1427855
python	php	python	java
i am a java php delphi programmer and only use python .when hack someone else program -- never to write a complex python myself

1427865
.war	jar
if the 3rd party jar is defined as a dependency in your .war project it will automatically be bundled into the web-inf .lib folder of the .war .when it is packaged by the .war plugins

1427865
.war	jar
once the jar is on the .war s classpath you can reference any spring configuration-files it declare by import them into your .war s application context

1427872
gwt-rpc	gwt	event-bus	gwt-rpc	event-bus	mvp
without using css-based ui-design event-bus command-pattern based gwt-rpc mvp presentation tier and gin gwt implementation of guice it s hard to overcome complexity in gwt just like in any other heavy gui framework

1427890
connection-pooling	pool
i was researching some jdbc oracle connection-pooling items and came across a new entity-relationship oracle pool implementation called univentity-relationshipsal connection pool ucp

1427908
restrict	shared
i am developing a site on a shared hosts and have to restrict my data schema to a single provided database

1427919
python	perl
scripting this in perl or python would make this task far easier

1427921
nsstring	nsdata
you really need to change the nsstring object into either a utf8 representation to send or to archive it as an nsdata object you send with the full length - you can t just cast an nsstring as a cstring either for sending or receiving

1427923
malloc	free
using rcpp and with stl containers classes like vector etc means you never have to explicit call malloc free or new delete which removes another frequent source of error

1427923
exception-handling	try-catch
rcpp allows you to wrap everything in try-catch blocks at the c++ level and report the exception-handling back to r --- .so no sudden seg.faults and program deaths

1427928
pixels	line
is there a way to move a path on screens by x y pixels using directly a cgpathref instead of walking through its points and line again in drawrect methods

1427978
pixels	line
i don t know what is commonly used but it seems to me that you could use bresenham for the 1-pixel-wide line but extends it a set numbers of pixels vertically or horizonally

1427978
pixels	line
for instances suppose your line is roughly 30 degrees away from the horizontal and you want it to be four pixels wide

1427978
pixels	line
you calculate that the vertical thickness of the line should be five pixels

1427978
pixels	line
for overkill make a pixels map of the stylus a circle or diagonal nib or whatever then draw a set of parallels bresenham line one for each pixels in the stylus

1428009
.net	wcf
if want to learn how to program n-tiered distribute applications in .net what technology should i start my learning with com+ remoting web-services wcf

1428037
silverlight	wpf
i am learning wpf silverlight and saw in an ms vidcast that it is now recommended to use routedeventargs over eventargs

1428057
selected	textbox
standards way would be to selected the existing text as you land in the textbox then as the user types it will automatically replace the existing text

1428092
assignment-operator	comma-operator
the parentheses on the other hand are important since the assignment-operator bind stronger than the comma-operator it has higher precedence and would get evaluated before the comma-operator without the parentheses

1428104
security	owasp
however owasp guidelines as well pretty much all competent security guidelines tell you that you should not try to limit bad characters in your validation but instead you should filtering .so that only specifically allowed characters are used

1428109
value	field
if .so how can i loops round each elements in jquery and extraction the field value

1428118
bufferedoutputstream	outputstream
i am streaming binary-data a csv file extraction from the database as a clob to the browser by calling response.getoutputstream and would normally wrap the outputstream in a bufferedoutputstream .when copying the data

1428118
bufferedoutputstream	outputstream
should i close the bufferedoutputstream or will this also close the underlying outputstream

1428141
buffering	streaming
yes you could have a buffering on the streaming that is whatever size you are comfortable with

1428146
bufferedoutputstream	outputstream
closing the bufferedoutputstream will also close the underlying outputstream

1428146
buffering	streaming
i guess that whether or not the response streaming given to your servlet is buffering or not depends on the implementation of your servlet-container

1428146
buffering	streaming
fwiw i know that tomcat does buffering its servlet response streaming by default inorder to attempt to set the content-length http header

1428178
display	height	display	width
the only way to get a map to display in a tab at all is to set the css width and height of #map_canvas to be absolute value

1428178
display	height	display	width
changing the width and height to auto or 100 causes the map to not display at all even if it s already been successfully rendering using absolute width and height

1428193
frame	width	height	frame
i would like panels a to be sized to the height width of the frame and maintain that size on frame resize but i would like panels b to overlap a

1428209
deployment	install
based on your clarification it sounds like local .lib might work for you in single simple cases but i do this for industrial strength deployment where i set up custom private cpans per application and install directly from those custom cpans

1428209
configuration	environment
from that i use custom cpan.pm configuration that analyze their environment and set the proper value to each application can install everything in a directory just for that application

1428223
attributes	properties
rather than depends you can checked a properties using the if attributes

1428225
environment	building
get the code and make your building environment work document sdks building-tools you need if it isn t already

1428231
order	add
the more code intensive way is of course to just change the order in which i add the tables to the dataset

1428238
callback	methods
he recommends adding a connect and disconnect methods to the service contract - since the callback must be provided to the service .when these are called the service can manage client callback

1428261
where-clause	sql
you should note also that putting the join syntax in the where-clause is deprecated in sql 2008

1428289
subclassing	base-class
imo it s even occasionally a good thing not to .when i subclassing a microsoft types the case add distinguishes my methods from microsoft s methods add in the underlying base-class

1428298
swing	awt
do not mix lightweight swing and heavyweight awt components within a containers where the lightweight component is expected to overlap the heavyweight one

1428306
python	php
it doesn t let you integrated python in html like php

1428323
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etal

1428328
slidedown	slideup
there are the slidedown slideup and slidetoggle functions native to jquery 1.3+ and they work quite nicely.

1428334
json	xml
it probably depends what technology you have available on your embedded devices - if you can easily consume json or xml then a webservice approach using the above may work for you

1428352
webforms	asp.net
i haven t touch asp.net webforms in years and i m a bit rusty with it

1428371
for-loop	arrays
make a regular for-loop around your streaming and use the counter as index in your totx arrays

1428379

a grab the current coordinates width height and zoom of the currently display dynamic map the one the user is seeing

1428394
ordinals	numeric
it replace every occurrence of a character with ordinals value between 0 and 31 mostly control-characters and spacing except the actual spaces character with its numeric value

1428401
lightbox	colorbox	lightbox	jquery	colorbox	jquery
using a lightbox like colorbox or jquery lightbox plugins how can i make a single link which opens a gallery arrays of images

1428418
seam	jsf
i recently sat down to ports a simple ruby-on-rails .app i have to jsf using seam to get a feel for which i would be more productive in

1428418
seam	jsf
jsf seam appears to be very popular but it doesn t make sense to me that it would forbid all http methods but .post

1428428
arguments	undefined
for debugging i ve changed scripting to perform only in arguments printing action and saw that input is null undefined

1428433
protected	public
annotations public protected private

1428437
contains	elements	photoshop	layer
probably the simplest way to do it is to snag this iphone guser-interface photoshop file that contains lots of user-interface elements in psd layer then change the tint of the large button in photoshop and save it as a png

1428437
selected	button	highlight	selected
one advantage of doing it this way is that you can also create versioning for button selected and or highlight state and assign the images to a standards uibarbuttonitem

1428444
coalesce	nvl
to supplement the rest of the answers here which deal primarily with null value and coalesce nvl nvl2

1428456
lightbox	jquery
using jquery lightbox plugins the example code says to do the following

1428475
web-frameworks	turbogears
if you want something more minimalistic the worlds your oyster there are an infinite amount of web-frameworks for python from bfg to turbogears

1428487
ruby	php
what i have done before is use the same standards for languages in the same ballpark php java ruby and then some specific ones if it was absolutely impractical to use that same set of standardss and the code looks different enough for your brain to also make the switching for bash scripting for instances

1428499
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
something that would allow me to ports schema from say microsoft sql-server to postgresql or mysql to sqlite

1428517
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements	contains	set
on the whole from your methods it seems that you re trying to defined set equalsity - treat lists as equals if they contains the same elements disregarding duplicates and order

1428523
for-loop	arrays
if order is unimportant sort the new arrays the old arrays will naturally always be sorted and then do a for-loop through the list

1428526
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	svg	vml	safari	opera
raphaã l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics and supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet-explorer 6.0+

1428529
subtract	time
then you can just keep checked microtime true and subtract that from your start time to get the numbers of seconds since execution

1428537
attributes	properties
beta2 attributes targeting properties

1428537
getter	setter
getter and setter specifically are

1428544
show	next
whenever i use nslog it always show this mysterious 10b next to the process id

1428558
mousemove	mouseup
matlab slider has a problem that it fires callback only on mouseup and not on mousemove .so pure matlab implementation would always feels strange

1428559
any	set
the first time you read elements.styles.left is there actually any left styles set on the elements

1428559
attributes	properties
remember element.styles only reflects styles properties set in the inline attributes and not those applied by stylessheets

1428560
controllers	routes
this should be handled by your routes .so in my view it s logic that is fattening your controllers unnecessarily

1428565
any	set
is it possible to set the clientid of any asp.net server control

1428568
.when	ready
does this mean that .when i am ready to distribute that i need to sign the .app with the distribution certificate and .when i am debugging it should be signed with a development certificate

1428586
contains	any
is there a quick way to obatin this without reading the entire response line by line and determining if the line contains any pattern that i am lookinng for

1428587
deployment	install
you can start with development first and install the deployment only .when you distribute or submit to app-store

1428590
silverlight	wpf
the product will initially be developed in c# using wpf then ported to silverlight

1428602
tostring	equals
a frame object contains few properties but doesn t overrides equals yet overridess tostring seen above

1428606
filtering	sorting
more on queries filtering sorting complex lookup

1428626
haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml	scheme	ocaml
i would highly recommend picking a functional-programming language you are comfortable with f# ocaml haskell or scheme and taking a long look at how its standard-library is structured

1428647
haxe	mxml
if you want to target the avm2 use either flex through mxml with least possible ammounts of as3 or haxe .

1428647
haxe	mxml
but you really should just building a clean .app from scratch using the best of what the language you use provides being a subset of oop aop and fp haxe avm1 would allow all of these things or a declarative .approach as allowed by mxml .

1428678
innodb	myisam
i converted my primary tables over to innodb and now many of my queries are taking over 1 minute to complete where they were nearly instantaneous on myisam

1428684
export	report
alas .when export the report to pdf the links drill down no longer work because pdf doesn t handle the javascript.

1428686
moss	wss
you can install moss or wss the baseline package on vista or windows 7 but it s officially unsupported however it works perfectly imo

1428711
subtract	time
next i need to subtract any time that is either marked as pto or ot exempt to get me my total regular hours

1428711
show	next
for example if an works his first 35 hours for the week in a job in netcat and then spends the next 15 on job in sc the report would have to show something like the following

1428715
web-config	app-config
below are my project s web-config and my wcf class-library s app-config

1428721
arrays	loops
if my assumption is not right can you loops through the list in the beginning and building an arrays of strings which can then later be searched

1428734
silverlight	wpf
my company is doing a fair bit of wpf and silverlight development recently and we are discovering that while we are darn good at slinging code our ui-design skills lack some pizazz

1428734
silverlight	wpf
i ve had experience with web developers with these skill sets but not .so many with wpf silverlight experience and looking on the internet for these people hasn t turned up much

1428814
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
.when it comes to finding primes the sieve-of-eratosthenes and the sieve of atkin are two possible solutions

1428815
unique	words
given a dictionary with m strings with q words per string and n unique words and a search string with l words the time complexities are as follows

1428827
contains	lookup
you might lookup for __autoload .when a class is not found it is called and supposed to include the file contains that class

1428828
value	field
simple if a field reference value suddenly goes from never changing to changing it can violate subtle assumptions in the class and consumers

1428840
prototypejs	mootools
for example do they use a libs like jquery mootools or prototypejs and how do they avoid namespace clashes

1428851
arrays	loops
now you an arrays of files in images set up a configure arrays for the image_lib class and loops through them resizing the images

1428852
textbox	button	any	set
any changes that i make in the first set of textbox would enable disable the submit button for the first grouping

1428852
any	set
now i have the jquery set .so that it works if they are not nested any farther in than the parent div by setting the parent div s class to submitdisable..

1428852
textbox	button
ultimately i want to be able to take any page with this jquery-on and put a div around a grouping of textbox and submit button and it will cause the button s to disable if all of the textbox in the same grouping are not filled in

1428865
user-permissions	root	user-permissions	rbac
using solaris rbac role-based access-control one can give a non- root user-permissions to execute those cmd but the cmd still fail internally

1428867
capacity	storage
one solution perhaps would be to use a data structure such as a hashtable with the malloc address as the key and the size as the content and using the same wrapper technique store the size separately from the block - at the expense or performance additional storage and perhaps some finite limit on capacity in terms of numbers of blocks that can be managed

1428874
rad-controls	telerik
however controls with complex markup such as the telerik rad-controls don t play with simple markup and often extra markup and classes are needed

1428886
contains	elements
this should throw an error because the last screenresult elements does not contains a unique value for the types attributes

1428897
boolean	int
if you re using votefu which it looks like you are then i d recommend that you convert to using int to store the vote value instead of boolean

1428900
debian	linux
could threads work just as well it s debian lenny linux

1428913
factors	primes
if you want to generator primes from 1 to whatever then the fastest way is probably a wheeled sieve as implements here which can typically test more than 3 000 000 candidate primes a second on an average laptop and that s using an unoptimized language like vb.net and factors the non-primes to boot

1428920
latex	tex
because my latex or pdflatex does not understand paths with tex

1428922
silverlight	wpf
because one of the main roles of this person is to understand the platform wpf silverlight and how to leverage it to make the designs into real live software .

1428933
handler	service
if the service doesn t mandate that the scripting is to be include at the bottom of the page hook the body onload event without stepping on the toes of any existing handler by intercepting the existing handler function which could in turn be chaining to other functions

1428964
identifier	temporary
i d save the file to a temporary location and store both a unique identifier as well as the current timestamp in the filename

1428970
png	gif
i have used it extensively to dynamically create class instances from remote jpg gif png

1428971
native-code	unmanaged
in thinking about it the use of ngen to precompile a .net project probably is no worse than compiling an unmanaged c++ project to native-code

1428977
input-field	textbox
you could always populate a disabled textbox to hold the named of the picture - it won t populate the browse input-field but is better than nothing

1428979
arrays	loops
as tom hawtin - tackline mentions you should .when using an arrays of arrayss try to loops over members of each arrays rather than than loopsing over the same index of different arrayss

1428994
unmanaged	c++-cli
however i m now trying to create a nunit test dll in c++-cli that loads the same unmanaged and runs the same code as the application above

1428994
unmanaged	c++-cli
the c++-cli dll compiles just fine with the _matherr function defined but .when i force a math error from the unmanaged the _matherr function is not called

1429005
freebsd	osx	freebsd	linux	solaris	osx	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux	linux	osx
solaris freebsd osx have dtrace linux has oprofile

1429016
grouping	sorting
maybe i m missing something but what about grouping by foreign key and sorting by the resulting value

1429033
checkbox	button	value	field
otherwise it is possible that a value of inappropriate types to your button field reference to checkbox instances will be assign to a variables you pass

1429038
affinity	cpu
use cpu affinity masks for both sql and iis asp to i.solate the two on separate cores configure sql to reserve less ram .so that it leaves free memory for iis asp configure your .app pool to recycle aggressively to prevent .application-pool growth

1429050
arrays	loops
you have no inner loops to worry about but you need to do some index arithmetic .when referencing particular arrays elements as opposed to loopsing over the whole arrays

1429052
data-access	nhibernate
i wrote a series of blog post on this topic regarding with nhibernate fluent-nhibernate data-access patterns

1429068
final	super
object x super transform final result

1429076
macports	fink
i downloading macports used easy_install tried fink

1429076
macports	fink
this predates the macports fink apt approach but you have much more control on it although you have to do everything by hand

1429076
macports	fink
does macports fink whatever allows me the same flexibility of rehacking if something goes wrong

1429076
development-environment	platform
considering my makefile solution .when my software is finally out for downloading what are your suggestions about solving the potential troubles between my development-environment and the actual platform on my user s machines

1429076
installation	environment
do you perform testing on your environment to checked proper installation on an integration machine

1429076
python	perl
what about the same issue for python perl and other

1429112
value	field
.when a user click on an input-field a hidden div appears with some selection for that field they can then choose an option and this set as the field value

1429114
stdin	eof
the spidermonkey shell has a readline function that reads a line from stdin but it doesn t have a way of knowing .when you reach eof

1429155
buffering	streaming
scanf can use up all bytes in the streaming buffering

1429159
seam	jsf
in my personal experience jsf seam aren t actually very popular due in large part to these sorts of issues

1429169
revision	updates
you can look through all submitted changelist look at file history drag and drop one revision onto any other revision and get an instant diff look at a revision graphing which show you branching history look at a time-lapse view of a file s revision very neat feature - drag a slider back and forth across the top and watch the file contents updates with each revision

1429197
directory	folder
i ve played with the idea with subversion of having a myproject_eclipseproj folder that only contains the the eclipse project files and directory with an svn-externals prop that pull in all the myproject files directory

1429197
versioning	upgrade
you could al.so have specific folder for different eclipse versioning .so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if .something changed in the .settings or .project file between versioning

1429203
temporary	copy
you would of course do this to a temporary copy of the workbook

1429210
histogram	plot
after this step i would like to plot a histogram with the intensities on one axis and the angle on the other axis

1429215
scriptmanager	updatepanel
controls can register with the scriptmanager directly or via an updatepanel

1429221
processor	cpu
if it uses 5 time as much processor power but completes in 1 5 the time then the cpu used is basically equivalent

1429228
for-loop	arrays
a length properties is also set which is why the matched elements of a jquery object can be iterated over like an arrays using a for-loop or cmd such as

1429259
base-class	inherited
if i understand what your problem is correctly then you might want to create a base-class controllers and make all your controllers inherited from this base controllers

1429271
drawimage	draw
otherwise you d have to use fillclosedcurve or fillpath to get slightly less than half a circle or draw a half-circle onto an intermediate slightly smaller bitmap and copy that back onto your main bitmap with drawimage

1429273
innodb	myisam
as written in should you move from myisam to innodb

1429273
innodb	myisam
innodb needs tuning as a final note about myisam to innodb migration i should mention about innodb tuning

1429273
innodb	myisam
tuning myisam from default rarely gives more than 2-3 time gain while it can be as much as 10-50 time for innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads

1429273
innodb	myisam
just for the recording the people behind mysqlperformanceblog.com ran a benchmarking comparing falcon myisam and innodb

1429273
innodb	myisam
the benchmarking was really supposed to be highlight falcon except it was innodb that won the day topping both falcon and myisam in queries per second for almost every test innodb vs myisam vs falcon benchmarkinging â part 1

1429280
unique	words	sequences	unique
for example if your list has 2 million english sequences chances are that the list of unique words is many order of magnitude smaller say a few hundred

1429280
lookup	any
in that case you can have a map of words - sequences and testing for matching sequences for any given words is reduced to a lookup in the map

1429285
optional-arguments	default-value	optional-arguments	arguments	default-value	arguments
a better approach would be to defined all expected arguments and have optional-arguments have a default-value

1429294
arguments	default
another option if you know the mamimum numbers of possible arguments would be to use default optionnal parameters

1429298
toggle	slider
1. .when having the line with the following styles tag the problem is that the toggle display does not hide slider in the layer

1429298
toggle	slider
it should slider in on the first click and slider out on the next click.... .so the break the jquery toggle function but why

1429298
positioning	slider	toggle	slider
2. if i remove the which seem to cause this problem then i get another strange behavior that the elements to toggle is display the rendering of the slider not in its correct positioning but rather on the right hand side and jumps then after rendering to the final positioning

1429317
firefox	opera
.when i tested it at home at work on windows 2000 ie6 xp four different machines and a virtualbox instances ie6 7 opera 9 firefox 3 and vista ie 7 as well as through konquerer and firefox on ubuntu on two different machines it worked fine i don t have a mac

1429326
subdirectories	symlink
tracking your configuration file in main project directory and put a symlink into libs subdirectories

1429329
command-line	cmd
unfortunately there are no command-line equivalent to the gf and f styles of cmd .so you have to mimic .something equivalent .sorry untested

1429364
penetration-testing	owasp
look at the owasp testing guide v3.0 project and its best practice penetration-testing framework

1429367
udp	tcp
rv is udp ems is tcp

1429371
environment	restart
if i understand your question correctly i think that you are asking whether it s possible to guarantee that a particular algorithm that is a program plus any recovery options provided by the environment will complete after any arbitrary numbers of recoveries restart

1429394
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m porting an application from webforms to asp.net-mvc

1429398
groovy	java
groovy is its own programming language but runs on a java virtual-machine

1429398
groovy	java
similarly grails is a framework for the groovy language both of which support integration with java

1429402
fseek	ftell	fwrite	fread
each time you do an fseek fread or fwrite what is your output .when you invoke ftell

1429403
udp	tcp
basically i am trying to convert activestate code recipe 392572 using the win32 iphelper api to getting the active tcp udp connections using the getextendedtcptable function

1429411
initializer	setter	viewdidload	dealloc
.so if you are adding your subviews viewdidload gets called and you initializer your player then perhaps you are removing the subviews and adding it again since you didnt release the view assuming you have only one copy dealloc does not get called i dont think .so anyway then if you re add the view masscheer.soundid will get overrides and leak.. another problem might be that since you have masscheer.soundid as a properties you allocate it and the setter generator al.so retains it .so then you are left with a +2 reference count .when it should only be +1....so assuming my assumptions are correct i would suggest to write viewdidload like this

1429414
javascript	dom
you can manipulate xml with javascript just like the dom

1429437
javascript	dom
the pop-up windows contains a ton of html javascript etc and loading them in the dom is not going to result in a good ux

1429444
zend-studio	eclipse-pdt
this notation will give you code assist in eclipse-pdt zend-studio and probably a good few others

1429453
droppable	draggable
i am using jquery draggable droppable bound to a live mouseover event

1429453
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari i m getting a strange behavior where .when i initially load the page only some of the droppable areas work

1429474
32-bit	64bit
the pyqt compile troubles seems to be caused by snow leopards default 64bit compiles and the 64 32-bit mixed versioning of python it ships with

1429495
constructor	object
note the object in question is construct properly through static factory methods and all other constructor are internal .

1429500
32-bit	64bit
a more common case is that an int will usually be 32-bit on a 32-bit architecture and 64bit on a 64bit architecture

1429508
32-bit	64bit
if you re unlucky 32-bit size_t 64bit long its uint_max - sizeof struct + 1 and a long int may be able to hold this large postive value and the seek won t do what you want it to do

1429508
fseek	ftell
fgetpos and fsetpos use a fpos_t .so can potentially work with very large-files in scenarios where fseek and ftell won t

1429532
environment	execution
in either environment you can set breakpoints these are points you can specify in your code where code execution needs to halt .so you can investigate what s going on

1429540
any	set
not setting any varybyxyz causes a cachingdrawresponse to be stored in the asp.net output caching but if you do set any varybyxyz during your request asp.net expects a cachingdvary at that location

1429565
constructor	object
often merely having a user-defined constructor break the guarantee although sometimes you can pass a pointers to such an object to a c function expecting a pointers to a struct with and identical data structure and it will work

1429600
groovy	java	ruby-on-rails	grails
grails is a java versioning of ruby-on-rails using groovy instead of ruby as the programming language

1429600
spring	grails
itâ s a lot easier to use grails then it is to write spring xml files by hand

1429612
licensing	lgpl
if the licensing is acceptable lgpl java native access provides a rather friendlier ffi than the jni does

1429617
defined	declare
that is the const and volatile types-specifiers for each parameter types are ignore .when determining which function is being declare defined or called

1429623
updatepanel	gridview
but i would rather take off paging and have just my gridview reload in the updatepanel

1429624
radio-button	selected
the idea is to be able to perform some search query depending on radio-button selected or drop-down choice

1429624
radio	click
my older versioning with radio button only works fine as you could test here click

1429651
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup
in short that solution uses the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events of the controls to allow them to be dragged around

1429661
e-commerce	product
lets say we have an e-commerce mall that stores product where only some product are maintained by any given store manager

1429672
nsapplication	appkit
you need to link against foundation and appkit especially the latter for nsapplication or whatever gnustep s equivalent are

1429676
complement	negation
bitwise negation yield the bitwise complement of the operands

1429713
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
for this to be possible through pure button pushing the browse dialog popping up after selected add external jars... and add external class folder... would need something like a checkbox to specify if you want to add the relative or the absolute-path

1429720
ubuntu	linux
i prefer dynamic shared linking but .when i tried to building boost shared-libraries on ubuntu linux i got lots of errors or warnings why there are always errors warning notes and other stuff .when compiling grrrrrrrr .so i don t know if it was compiled alright

1429721
continuous-integration	build-server
that is usually the goal of a build-server or test suite server running continuous-integration tools like nunit launchd from cruisecontrol.net

1429726
http	ssl
http is the protocols used to request a page from the server using ssl or tls encryption

1429741
swing	awt
btw it s awt s event-dispatch-thread not swing s.

1429767
dependency-management	build-process
if it is only dependency-management you re after and you re happy with the rest of your build-process i would use ivy as it can unobtrusively manage your dependencies leaving your existing build-process intact

1429768
integrated-security	connection-string
i can successfully deploy .when the connection-string is using integrated-security but .when i switching to using a sql-server authentication i get the following error

1429768
integrated-security	connection-string
again .when i change the connection-string to integrated-security it works

1429772
value	field
from there in your controllers .when the form is submitted you would get the value of that field like .so

1429805
haskell	ocaml
here is ocaml code that uses functor to give a strict implementation of haskell parameterized over the monad in question

1429811
internet-explorer	firefox
this is one of the first time i ve noticed a real difference between the flash player in firefox and the one in internet-explorer

1429811
any	set
i did try to set a manual tab-order this did not make any difference

1429813
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
my concerns are with how to manage the code compile and test phases .when using modern programming languages especially interpreted-language like python perl and ruby and ides

1429820
order	add
you can use a vector and add the strings on the end which will be in the reversed order

1429821
hide	show
this is a link to using a windows function to hide the horizontal and force vertical to be show at all time

1429832
constructor	private
the no-arg constructor for jaxb doesn t have to be public it can be private

1429834
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i can get a downloading prompt for text files fine in opera google-chrome and firefox but not ie

1429837
administration	account
i am attempting to impersonate an administration account from a localsystem service inorder to get data from administration hkey current user registry - inorder to impersonate i am using the codeproject code found at the following site written by uwe keim impersonator

1429848
attributes	properties
furthermore i d like the selected attributes s to be eagerly loaded and sorted by the seq properties

1429852
administration	account
if applications were able to impersonate an administration account and write value to the registry in windows it would present a huge security hole

1429852
constructor	object
if you look at the registry.currentuser properties in reflector you ll see that it is set by the static constructor of the registry object

1429852
constructor	object
static constructor get called .when the static object is first referenced

1429852
constructor	object
in your case if you re referencing the registry object whether it involves currentuser or not the static constructor is being called which is setting currentuser to your original user...not the impersonated account

1429858
toupper	tolower
this search is case-sensitive but you can just as eaily use toupper or tolower to change it

1429901
gwt-rpc	gwt
currently i have a gwt project which happens to use gwt-rpc that uses a command-pattern wherein my rpc servlet that looks like this.

1429904
constructor	private
you should probably move the initialization code that you need to perform last into a separate private methods and have that called from both constructor where appropriate

1429905
sql-server	oracle
from odp.net 10.2.0.3 onwards you should if you have appropriately configure ms dtc and the oramts dll is present be able to simply use the system.transactions transactionscope just as you would if co-ordinating between two sql-server databases but using a sql-server and oracle connection

1429916
filtering	sorting
alternatively consider supporting filtering rather than sorting to accomplish the same purpose

1429929
put	get
in fact i want to put connection-string for sql database in this file and get it .when needed .so i need to change it if the connection changed

1429933
entity-relationship	diagram
at the top of the section he talks about e-r entity-relationship diagram

1429950
administration	account
you ll need to find the sid for the administration account but you should be able to deduce that using regedit

1429965
windows-applications	wpf
there is nothing special regarding using this solution as is other than facilitating the existing interoperation between wpf applications and other types of microsoft windows-applications windows forms in your case

1429969
shell	bash
this isn t a function of bash as all the shell does is open the file in question and then pass the file-descriptingor as the standards output of the scripting

1429993
document	editing
business people might prefer use an ms-word user-interface for editing but ms-word produces document information silos

1429994
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
as long as you use dynamic-sql you are potentially vulnerable to sql-injection

1430004
windows-xp	windows
i have a .net 2.0 .app that uses unicodeencoding.unicode .when saving to a file .when the data contains foreign characters this works fine on windows-xp and vista but not on windows 7 on windows 7 i get a question marks

1430034
value	field
it s being rendering from a string field value

1430034
export	report
one more thing to it if i export the report to a pdf or html the problem disappears

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to troubleshoot why ie is slow slow process this javascript compared to google-chrome and firefox

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there is no delay for any onclientclick events but in ie it pauses for like 5 seconds before doing anything

1430047
children	nodes
assuming that isn t an absolute requirement i would handle this in the properties that returns the children of the specified nodes

1430053
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
since the procedure construct dynamic-sql in a careless fashion is still open to sql-injection

1430094
lookup	any
on page load i lookup the database and checked if the current logged in user has run any one of the 3 scenarios available via an audit table

1430096
for-loop	arrays
i had declare some variables as const which ie doesn t recognize and i was also using the for..in construct on arrays which i replace with an indexed for-loop

1430100
associations	model
i d like my #create action to initializer new instances of all three model with the specified associations

1430109
triggers	insert
triggers are intended for other use cases such as for example keeping a log of all insert

1430113
any	set
checked the visual-studio option debugging exception-handling to see if your debuggingger is set to catch any unhandled-exception before it bubbles up and out of user code

1430118
base-class	inherited
the c++ class points inherited this layout for its base-class portion and since it adds no data or virtual members it will have the same layout

1430121
sql-server	oracle
you didn t specify what database but i ll assume an ansi standards relational dbms such as oracle or sql-server

1430123
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera	inspector	webkit
i agree with you as far as firebug s performance goes in recent release therefore i have found myself using the excellent webkit inspector - in both google-chrome and safari - and opera dragonfly a lot more recently

1430129
sweave	latex
agreed that sweave is the way to go with xtable for generator latex tables

1430148
directory	folder
right click in package explorer - import - filesystems - browse to the directory contains your jars - checked the boxes next to the jars you want - browse to the workspace folder you want to import to probably your .lib folder - finish

1430151
display	height
i have a listview with several rows the problem is that even if the vertical scrollbar is visible it doesn t work i explain it seems that because the grid height is auto then there is no maximum height and all the content is display even if part of it is not visible the only part-.solution i ve found is to set pixels height to the grid like 600 and then you can scroll the content of the listview but obviously this is not a very good .solution since i would like the height be defined by it s containers i have tried to bind the height properties to actualheight of the tabitem but that doesn t work either i m desperate .so if anyone knows how to .solve this problem i would highly appreciate it thanks in advance

1430154
jquery	.post
i have a form that i use jquery i don t think i need to put code in this .post the question is pretty basic

1430164
emacs	vim
without getting into a religious arguments about why one is better than the other what are the practical difference between emacs and vim

1430168
click	mouse
you can use sendkeys as tr3 said to send mouse click which is different than using sendmessage

1430171
emacs	vim
the biggest difference for me in choosing to use emacs over vim was the built-in gdb support in emacs

1430171
macvim	vim
vim doesn t have this include in it s default distribution and the project there for integration gdb and vim was nearly impossible to get working with macvim

1430188
emacs	vim
there is a huge difference on a day-to-day level - vim or any vi variant is inherently modal you go into cmd modes where you cannot edit and emacs along with most other editor are not

1430188
emacs	vim
that is at the heart of the vim emacs debate

1430199
emacs	vim
also emacs shortcuts are mainly accessed through modifiers and obviously the vim interface is famously modal giving access to an absurd amount of direct key for manipulation

1430199
python	ruby	emacs	vim
emacs used to be the only editor of the two that was proagrammable and while vim has a lot of weird levels to it s programmability with the addition of python and ruby binding and more i forget vim is also programmable in most ways you d care for

1430200
python	ruby
also extensible in python ruby

1430209
pixels	line
and use this index matrix to get the x and y coordinates for the pixels crossed by the line

1430213
stderr	stdout
i m trying to redirect the output of a third-party native dll which output to stdout stderr from within c#

1430213
stderr	stdout
the output of both stdout and stderr should go to a logfile

1430214
jquery	dojo
i would suggest using a standards framework jquery dojo extjs etc

1430216
nested	order
it s somewhat unstable because it required careful management of the lock object locking order nested locks coordination among threads blocking waiting on a resource in use by another thread that s waiting for you to do something etc. which depends on the context

1430218
web-services	security
.when the first page loads it presents a list of report available for that user communication from the asp.net .app to ssrs via web-services and with identity imper.sonation .so that the list is security trimmed

1430227
mousemove	mousedown
the alternative is listening on mousedown instead of mousemove which fixed the previous issue however the nested button loses it s click

1430228
sweave	latex
i use the statet plugins for eclipse for developing the report and sweave is integrated eclipse recognizes latex formatting etc

1430230
emacs	vim
emacs has viper-mode .so in .some real sense it provides a superset of features excepting those describe in what vim features are missing in emacs with viper and vimpulse

1430236
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i like using the wiki feature built into fogbugz for this assuming you already use it for feature bug-tracking

1430242
tcl	lua
tcl tcl extension archive tcl extension repository lua luaforge

1430275
contains	elements	markup	xhtml
currently my xslt file contains the xhtml markup elements as well as text labels which are currently in english

1430275
resource-files	resx
i was thinking of using .net resource-files .resx but i don t know how the resx string resources would get pulled in to the xslt .when the transformation takes place

1430285
value	field
or maybe the part that represented the length field contains a value far larger than what was available at the address in the pointers

1430293
common-lisp	lisp
it s not common-lisp -- it s mostly just lisp syntax for javascript though for simple things you can write the same code to target both if you re careful

1430296
xelatex	tex
texml and xelatex first one to make scripting easier -- tex has lots of quirks in syntax

1430304
puts	gets
asp.net-mvc page has one link ajax.actionlink which gets the form to create and puts it in one of the div

1430308
contains	elements	contains	set
this makes the initial contains usage technically unnecessary but you may experience performance benefits by starting out with a smaller collections of span elements before filtering down to the exact set you re interested in

1430312
tuples	sorted
a simpler and cleaner way is to just use a dictionary with sorted tuples as key

1430312
tuples	sorted
overrides __getitem__ and __setitem__ to access the dictionary by sorted tuples

1430327
children	nodes
does the order of children of a given nodes

1430354
revision	updates
this means that they would have to consciously updates to a newer revision which is what you want for production code

1430367
perl	php
too much php provided the perl versioning with the

1430393
triggers	insert
you might want to checked if there is any code in the insert and updates events of the main form that would cause a requery of the main form on the insert of a new recording triggers by editing the subform

1430409
shell	bash
if you re using bash here s a handy example of a small shell scripting that allows you to do calculations from the command-line including specifying precision for floating-point numbers

1430434
emacs	vim
vim was always faster to startup than emacs

1430434
emacs	vim
i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box install of vim will startup faster than out-of-the-box install of emacs

1430434
emacs	vim
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still startup faster than emacs

1430435
contains	any
the model that php scripting operate off of doesn t really contains the notion of any kind of persistent in memory for those scripting since generally they re designed to only run for the minimum of time required to serve the requested page

1430452
double	int
for an anonymous types with an int and a double as properties i disassembly the following c# code

1430455
execute	declare
jquery should execute all of your handler in the order they have been declare without issue

1430475
punctuation	words
punctuation is defined to be include with the words it is closest to

1430602
administration	account
using iisreset utility as the batch-file will be used by others who may login the domain without the administration account of the target server

1430615
hide	show
at this points once the user logs in he will see the master tempdb and will al.so see the new db which he is a db owner of..you may want to go to tools option and enabled the option to hide systemd object .so that you don t show the master tempdb etc

1430621
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you might find it easier to simply relocate your webforms from your existing webforms project to your new asp.net-mvc project

1430624
put	get
get rid of the semi-colon after scrolltop and put it at the end of the line-

1430631
double-quotes	single-quotes
i m unsure how someone would break mysql if i simply replace all incoming single-quotes with double-quotes

1430631
sql-server	oracle
can someone enlighten me for both oracle and sql-server examples

1430632
.net	wcf
you could create a windows service using .net wcf for example that execute this cmd

1430632
administration	credentials
then the service can run using credentials with administration access

1430634
contains	set
and holds a reference to a dataset class that contains an unfiltered set of data

1430657
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and works in firefox but not in ie

1430658
build-system	cmake
it works very well with cmake if you use that for your build-system but it also works without it

1430666
spaces	output
but this approach does output a trailing spaces like some of the other solutions

1430669
contains	set
example find all books where the title contains one of a set of search terms and the publisher is o reilly

1430700
defined	declare
warning documented function brg undocumentedfunction1 was not declare or defined

1430704
any	set
in methods that respond to search or paging i first load up any value from the session then overrides them and set the session value if necessary with value from the query-string or form parameters depending on whether it is a get or .post

1430708
dictionary	arrays
i have an dictionary arrays such as this

1430710

i presume it s because of the infinite while-loop constantly checked for input but i want to know if there s any way to decrease the cpu usage without losing function

1430900
webserver	nginx
unless you are running a very non-standard setup your webserver apache iis nginx etc. will have multiple-processes that run php separately for each request that comes into the server

1430917
processor	cpu
while listening for an event your program has no need to consume cpu time and thus will sleep until an event occurs freeing the processor for usage until then

both are old but still you will get the philosophy and you might choose to use the current tool vim 7.x or emacs 25

1431019
subclassing	base-class
the easiest way to do this is to write a common base-class that all of your controllers types subclassing then stick an action-filter on that base-class or overrides its onactionexecuting methods

1431033
contains	elements
each segment contains elements which are essentially positional field

1431047
heuristics	greedy
just greedy fill towards the corner to compute the heuristics

1431055
arrays	loops
i have to initializer this arrays because i call this in a loops and it overwrite the previous value

1431069
put	get
you should probably rewrite this to put things like start increment and span somewhere in static storage rather than in function arguments because this will get rather confused if they change but i m feeling lazy-evaluation about that

1431080
google-chrome	firefox
the same url works fine in rest of the browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

1431084
any	set
this claim can be disproved directly by providing an algorithm to produce a set of related elements for any set of dt and dd elements that are children of a dl

1431084
contains	elements
specify a collections types to contains dt and dd elements called a dt_dd_group

1431090

however i have not really come across any practical usage of some of the data-structures like the linked-list queue and stack etc

1431179
any	set
my prob is that is there any to set oncomplete event of the ajax request

1431201
callback	methods
i general procedure are used for callback and hooks .so that you don t have to write named methods and refer to them putting the code in question directly in the option hash and such

1431203
administration	account
then at a certain points serv.exe call createprocessasuser using the admin account inorder to launchd an administration task note that user is currently logged in

1431283
google-chrome	safari
i have made it work in google-chrome safari by making the following two changes

1431283
google-chrome	safari
the effect is quite jittery in google-chrome safari this seems to be something to do with webkit report the newly applied height of the textarea as 4px less then you set it to i assume this is due to the box model and some browser applied styles but i don t know

1431288
directory	folder
pack uri-scheme is only used for files inside resource directory where else if you just add a file or add a file as a link and set its types to content it will only copy the file in your bin folder but it will not be packed inside application resource directory

1431318
binary-compatibility	shared-libraries
a key advantage to using shared-libraries is that if the libs is updates you can replace the shared-libraries with the newer versioning assuming binary-compatibility and reap the benefits of the improved implementation without recompiling your application

1431318
ubuntu	linux
if you are trying to install boost on ubuntu linux just run sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev

1431318

well my example is a wpf .app that adds files folder in a directory to a treeview but you should get the general idea

1431400
show	next
next .when i click the option border the logo div should be hidden and the border div should be show

1431401
contains	set
additional to this i al.so often have a job set up that restores production database-backups to the test environment .so that testing prior to deployment can be done against systemd that contains a copy of live data

1431418
hide	show
.when you show one you want to hide the others .so .something like

1431418
hide	show
or you may wish to hide them all before the switching and then show the one specified

1431428
difference	factors
i know that if you preform remove or existing elements .so there is a difference between hash and tree but i don t think it is the factors that sun refer to at least i hope .so since it looks like a very small thing another thing is the hashcode methodss can be not .so good and then adding elementss to the hash will not be o 1 or the hashcode methods can be complicated

1431436
scons	cmake
this works quite well and we support invocation of scons autopain cmake

1431444
hashtable	sorted
it depends on how many operations happen in the hashtable before you copy the elements to the sorted tree

1431444
hashtable	set	hashtable	sorted	hash-collision	key
hashtable do have an even larger advantage over sorted tree .when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash-collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to caching the hashcode for key already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result

1431452
constructor	object
the purpose of a constructor is to initializer the object

is there a way of replicating this .when connecting to a jet database via ado

1431500
printf	scanf
it seems to be that the scanf and printf statements aren t getting the right data types passed in but i can t work out what they should be

1431501
constructor	private
if that seems like a trivial points consider the case where the base-class contains private state that is only initializer properly in its constructor

1431501
derived-class	base-class	instances	destroy
it is only safe to destroy finalize the base-class instances after the derived-class instances has been done because the derived object may rely on the base object s state still being valid

1431507
numeric	digits
assuming the data streaming starts with â œisaâ towards the beginning there should be a section â œ st â followed by three numeric digits

value	field
i have also implements a simpler auditing pattern that just keeps tracking of the named of the table that changed the field that changed the old value and the new value along with the usual metadata

1433312
any	set
it is set any time one of its properties changes but since it s a base-class it doesn t know what its properties are

1433315
emacs	vim
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1433332
constructor	object
in the constructor it gets set to an autoreleased object is that correct

1433352
operators	keyword
as madkeithv points out these replacements came from c s iso646.h and were include in iso c++ as operators keyword

1433383
parsing	comma
what i feel is missing is a proper way to manipulate paths parsing distinguished named and .so on and since this should be a pretty common need i hope there s a cleaner way to do this than split a string on comma 1

1433387
defined	declare
best way to declare and defined global-variables

1433387
defined	declare
declare and defined global-variables is to use a header file file3.h to

1433387
double	int
of the files declare i as a double instead of as an int c s

1433387
double	int
a machine with 64bit int and double you d not even get a warning

1433387
32-bit	64bit	double	int
on a machine with 32-bit int and 64bit double you d probably get a

1433387
typedef	struct
definitions enum struct or union types or typedef generally do not

1433387
defined	declare
file2c.h to defined or declare the global-variables

1433387
defined	declare
file5c.c which show that you can declare and then defined the global-variables

1433387
defined	declare
file6c.c which show that you can defined and then attempt to declare the global-variables

1433402
object-reference	instances

1433491
jsonp	ajax
checked ajax methods jsonp option

1433504
versioning	upgrade
or you could specify a versioning for the file .so upgrade rules will treat it like replacing a non-versioninged file with a versioninged one but then patches can get antsy about having the wrong versioning of this file

1433505
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you roll along the menu you will see in google-chrome safari firefox ie7 etc

1433535

1433537
jndi	jdbc
i m developing java apps on tomcat 5.5 using jndi to connect to shared dbcp connection pool with jdbc 3.0 drivers and db2 8 on zos and also db2 9 on luw

1433537
between	sql-in
currently all portlets and .apps use the same connection pool to connect to the database and the only way to distinguish between .apps is to match the sql run with the sql-in each .app

1433568
fflush	stdout
fflushing stdout after the printf isn t normally needed for terminal io but can be if you re piping it to a disk typically .when you re logging a crash program it will lose the most interesting bit just before the crash if you don t fflush

1433568
getchar	fgets
because fgets reads up to and including the end of the line there are no characters left in the buffering .so you only need one getchar and slightly awkward input such as 1234 spaces enter doesn t cause the program to terminate without pausing

1433568
linux	unix
however most of the time you don t need to wait after running a console application - on linux or other unix systemd you typically have a console open and run the program there after which control returns to the shell

1433568
any	set
you really only need to make the program pause itself if you re on windows and you re using a debugger to run it and you haven t set any breakpoints

1433574
variables	boolean
in the handler associated with the gotfocus events you would set a cansave boolean variables to false that in the lost-focus handler you ll set back to true

1433580
installshield	inno-setup
i dont know inno-setup but i guess it supports custom actions like the other setup tools visual-studio wix installshield or wise

1433583
checkbox	textbox
one limitation is that this only fires .when focus leaves the textbox - ideally the rules would also fire .when the checkbox was click

1433602
swing	swt	swing	awt	swt	awt
i never liked to design windows in java awt swing swt too much work for an ugly interface

1433623
firefox	opera
now for the question is there a way to set the bloody colour in opera for this focus event which would solve that issue or to have it in firefox without having to bloat the design in every other browser or a way to make ie conform at all

1433632
static-code-analysis	pmd
obviously on the java side the free tools available include findbugs compiled code-analysis and pmd static-code-analysis

1433637
font-size	display
i either need to force windows to apply the display settings a process which seems to be associated with the please wait dialog screenshot include or i need to programmatically change the appearance settings individually which include altering advanced font-size settings

1433647
key-value	key
note that .sort_by has possibly expensive and possibly beneficial it depends on .sort key complexity side-effects it generator and stores a temporary key-value pair for each item .so that it can .sort by your new key

1433710
value	field
for earlier versioning i recommend wrapping a dictionary t object with nulls in the value field to replicate o 1 add remove and lookup time

1433714
reflection	runtime
i m wondering if it s possible to use reflection to locate an object at runtime

1433724
static-methods	unit-testing
it used to be an it depends on personal opinion decision but with the rise of unit-testing static-methods are often more harmful than not

1433736
getter	setter	protected	public
i would personally stop using a protected field as well - consider adding an indexer to your base-class with a protected setter and a public getter

1433745
safari	opera
you can also use firebug lite wich works on ie opera and safari

1433768
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this in firefox and google-chrome

1433795
datagridview	databound
i have a databound datagridview

1433795
populate	row
.when i click on the new row the defaultvalueneeded event is fired and the row is populate with my default value

1433797
meta-inf	jar
you ll need an ejb deployment-descriptor in test.jar meta-inf ejb-jar.xml and the ear deployment-descriptor has to go to your.ear meta-inf application.xml not inside the ejb jar

1433797
ejb-2.x	ejb
btw if ejb-2.x is not a fixed requirement then have a look at ejb 3.x

1433798
any	set
then the servletcontextlistener could set those variables on startup and any other code can access those statics regardless of whether they have access to the servletcontext itself or not

1433805
properties-file	jar
also the classes that load the properties-file you can bundle in a jar and put that jar in the classpath of your server you can refer to server startup scripting and put it in the classpath there .so .when your server is loaded load a class with a static bloc inside it and refer to those properties-file

1433811
contains	elements	contains	set
therefore the anchor will have a effective width of 128 + 5 + 1 + 1 pixels 135pixels and the contains list elements only 111pixels therefore the anchor will overflow because overflow is not set to hidden

1433818
terminal	prompt
the cls and clear are cmd which will clear a terminal ie a dos prompt or terminal windows

1433864
callback	methods
the callback methods has the big disadvantage that it is very slow and it is called once for every entry which makes it unuseable for a longer list

1433866
actionlistener	mouselistener
use an actionlistener instead of mouselistener

1433885
credentials	security
2 use a custom credentials which from what i understand required a custom security token as well to store the string

1433892
contains	any
is there a log somewhere that could contains any more information

1433898
firefox	opera
i gave it a couple tries and found that opera and firefox both rendering it wrong

1433898
firefox	opera
it would rendering correctly in opera and firefox however now its wrong in ie7

1433901
uilabel	uiview
the one gotcha .when using uilabel instances as the custom view is that uilabel default userinteractionenabled to no uiview on the other hand default this properties to yes

1433909
factors	primes
i ll just add that if the 128bit numbers is primes or has a primes factors larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

1433926
datagridview	databound
to add a row to a databound datagridview add the row to the underlying datasource datatable or bindingsource then refresh the grid

1433976
silverlight	wpf
i wish to use silverlight rather then wpf as it is more likely a customer will already have siverlight install and it works on macs

1433978
arrays	loops
is there a way in a mysql scripting to declare an arrays or any collections and loops over it to do stuff

1434016
value	field
i want to write a generics awk scripting that can take as input a file and a field numbers in that file and give me the average value of that field in that file

1434044
document	editing
it allows you to see who is working on a document see their editing region in its own color tracking who made changes to a file etc hellip

1434047
marquee	button
the problem is that i have a marquee that slider .when you click the next button

1434053
any	set
the value was set to any

1434061
filtering	sorting
from here i have access to the all the object from via icollectionview via sourcecollection in which i for now presume sorting and filtering is respected

1434062
base-class	inherited
for historical reasons neither of these classes inherited from the same base-class or shared a common interface

1434063
contains	elements
my personal recommendation - if feasible to implements - would be #1 above allow jumping to the page contains the currently selected elements

1434063
filtering	sorting
i definitely support the add filtering idea as well if feasible - i find myself using excel for 50 of the work with tables lists originated from any .app website due to its exceptional combinations of filtering and sorting

1434067
margins	padding
the layout tab does not show that there is any padding margins or border

1434087
firefox	safari
some browsers firefox 3+ and probably safari

1434088
triggers	insert	value	field
i d like to insert and retrieve the identity value but also use a triggers to ensure that certain field are always set

1434088
triggers	insert
originally the design was to use instead of insert triggers but that break scope_identity

1434088
triggers	insert
the output clause on the insert statement is also broken by the instead of insert triggers

1434088
triggers	insert
this works it allows me to use scope_identity after insert and appears to be safe if my after triggers fails my insert fails

1434100
keyboard	mouse
pair-programming is about one having keyboard and mouse and the other one providing feedback

1434100
keyboard	mouse
you can switching these roles or give the keyboard to one and the mouse to the other but you will always have to work on think about the same piece of code for it to be pair-programming

1434135
buildr	maven	dependency-management	buildr
finally buildr is an excellent way of using maven s dependency-management and plugins while also supporting ad-hoc tasks

1434138
quirks-mode	doctype
it s most definitely because website located on internal networks is rendering in quirks-mode by default by ie8 while pages located on the internet will determine rendering mode based on doctype

1434139
google-chrome	firefox
edit i m using a cross browser inline-block hack that works great in firefox ie s google-chrome

1434145
vbscript	basic
if you want to make a binary executable out of your vbscript code you will need to ports it to visual basic or visual basic .net first

1434165
contains	sorted
a non-clustered index on a b is a copy of a part of the table whose rows are sorted on a then on b and contains the reference to the original row

1434192
versioning	upgrade
you should know exactly what s in the database and your upgrade scripting should do the create or alter as appropiate based on the current versioning of your application schema versioning-control and your database

1434214
conditional	operators
also any intermediate value generator using the assignment-operators have a .post conditional that they compare equals with operators and-operators is transitive for iterator

1434230
webserver	security
better security if you re planning to have the checked out files on the server accessible from a webserver

1434230
updating	updates
the ability to updates your server repository independently of updating your live service code

1434230
ready	live
this is pretty crucial if you re working remotely and need to send something to the server and then do further work before it will be ready for your live service or if you have changes in your live service code say different configuration settings and need to merge those changes with the changes in the repo but can t do it just now

1434231
configuration	environment
that way you need only supply a different configuration file for the different environment the spring xml stays the same

1434233
build-system	cmake
instead i would use a build-system that generator project files makefile whatever cmake is my flavor for doing this

1434240
response	timeout
our server would wait until one of the events happen and then report it back as a response or timeout after a set amount of time notifying that nothing happened

1434256
value	field
doctrine_access provides a function setarray which is nearly exactly what i need - except it cares about value that don t have field in the model

1434257
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
oracle sql-server and postgresql do have those connect by recursive cte s and generate_series respectively

1434275
nhibernate	ado.net
nhibernate retrieves raw entity s data from db using ado.net

1434275
contains	set	value	field
if db field contains null the properties will be set to the defaul value for its types

1434275
value	field
now .when transactional is committed nhibernate compares the value of the properties to the original field value it read form db and since the field contains null but the properties contains a non-null value nhibernate considers the properties dirty and forces an updates of the entity

1434281
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
their service features a simple call and can return results in xml json or csv formats

1434284
execution	jobs
nonetheless my test was quick and dirty and in the comments to my answer to is there a way to run a process every day in a .net web application without writing a windows service or sql-server jobs someone has suggested that asp.net actually defers removal and execution of the callback until something tries to access the caching again

1434292
python	c++	python	java
python unlike the curly-brace languages like c++ and java uses indentation to mark blocks of code

1434298
sql-server	mysql
does sql-server 2008 have a a data-type like mysql s enum

1434316
callback	methods
guessing what you might have tried yes all button fire their events to the same methods but the sender -parameter of your callback methods contains a reference to the button that actually caused the specific event

google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but doesn t work in google-chrome

1434342
callback	methods
the code works good using the send methods but .when using sendasync it goes to waiter.waitone but i never get the callback i think thats what its called to myping_pingcompleted

1434351
ado	jet
you need to either create a schema.ini file for your import file or add the extension to the hkey_local_machine .software micro.soft jet 4.0 engines text format registry key .so ado knows how to parsing the file

1434374
internet-explorer	firefox

i am using oracle sql developer and trying to export a table to a csv file

1434448
account	api
why wouldn t you just get a ups api account and request up-to-date rates directly from ups

1434459
sqrt	pow
if you are just comparing relative magnitudes of distance you can probably get away with using the manhattan distance which will save you two call to pow and one to sqrt

1434462
mstest	nunit
that doesn t mean that you can t use a unit-testing framework such as mstest xunit.net nunit etc. to drive your service tests

1434462
value	field
in the aspx scenario you will need to collect value from form field and assign those value to to the service methods paramters

1434468
ref	out
i too see very little use of out ref parameters although in sql it sometimes is easier to pass a value back by a parameter than by a resultset which would then required the use of a sqldatareader etc.

1434486
python	java
as it happens the standards versioning of python will compile this to bytecode just like java etc

1434486
linux	bsd	linux	unix	unix	bsd
and yes on unix including linux bsd and mac os x or in a unix shell on windows you can use a shebang line at the top of the file to make the file automatically run using python

my constructor are usually passing in different object not just int

1434505
wait	hang
unfortunetely this causes the application calling the c# dll to hang whilst it wait indefinitely for the process to exit

if the command-line exe doesnt finish execution within 1 second its never going to exit

1434511
floor	ceil
the aforementioned ntdll.dll export only a few of the math.h functions floor ceil log pow ...

1434527
export	csv
it addresses export to csv

1434530
constructor	private
especially since the newer features that allow you to set variables in a block with the initializer i tend to only use parameters on creation for things that have to be set .when the class is created in which case i make the basic constructor private or protected

1434530
constructor	private
for example if you had a class rectangle it might make sense to make the constructor rectangle double width double height and make the rectangle constructor private

1434534
arrays	loops
as a plan-b if you can t figure the proper sql statement to use you can read the whole thing into a memory construct arrays class etc and loops it that way

1434535
constructor	private
also you might put a parameterless private constructor if you believe that your class should only set it s properties value through the constructor

1434538
response	timeout
or is it not a timeout because the response has not actually stopped

1434547
ms-access	mysql
if this is a one time conversion just use ms-access link to your mysql database tables and use updates queries to transfer the data

1434550
vbscript	jscript
as far as i understand the scripting could be ported to jscript vbscript or plain batch-file which shouldn t be a problem

1434553
documentation-generation	doxygen
how can i tell doxygen to disable documentation-generation for some classes

1434554
entity-framework	massive
we ve adopted the entity-framework and we re finding that .when multiple people make isolated changes in their individual source control branches there are massive conflicts .when they come together in a merge resulting in broken model files

1434571
seam	jsf
jsf with seam can do get fine

1434581
value	field
the output clause in sql-server 2005 onwards is a great step forwarding for getting any field value for rows-affected by your dml statements

the code works 100 on linux but .when i run it on windows-xp haven t tested with any other versioning of windows the text is never written to the image

1434587
push	pull
.so it .sounds like you have an existing database-schema and an existing entity-model al.so known as a repository and you want an orm to push pull data to from your database and your application

1434596
buffering	streaming
you don t need a separate buffering to write a string to a streaming

1434599
contains	elements
i want it it .so that if you drag an elements out of the containers .when the mouse crosses the border of the contains div the elements you re dragging to change

1434604
jquery	.post
no methods in jquery but you can just use xmlhttprequest object returned from the jquery get .post ajax functions

1434606
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
if no what is criterion for assign a bit numbers like 8bit 16-bit 32-bit to processor

1434607
attributes	properties
i found teh category attributes but that is for properties

1434611
signals	sigint
your application will stop immediately or you can handle the event with a sigint signals handler

1434612
google-chrome	firefox
i found out by trying a difirefoxerent browser that is firefox google-chrome instead of ie

1434621
any	set
any ideas on how to match null incident area codes while excluding the given set of area codes without using pl sql

1434632
32-bit	16-bit
you can do an operation on only 8 bits 16-bit 32-bit etc

1434662
boolean	double
in fact i use few types â int32 double string or boolean

1434662
boolean	int
i want my users to use spinedit for int checkbox for boolean etc

1434669
32-bit	16-bit
the motorola 68000 and 68010 cpus implements a 32-bit register set but did it via microcode on top of a mostly 16-bit internal architecture

1434669
16-bit	8bit
all successful 8bit cpus implements 16-bit addressing for example often via odd hacks to make up for the lack of a single address register c.f

1434672
json	xml
learn javascript but in my opinion it is best to use json for data transfer and not xml

1434675
json	xml
the xml part of ajax isn t strictly xml--very often it s json or html

1434687
json	xml
you can use xml json html or even plain text as the media

1434687
jquery	dojo
it is also good if you learn one of the javascript libs jquery dojo prototype etc that will simplify a lot of things in doing ajax

1434704
regedit	autorun
as a test in regedit i created a new key in the hlm branch show above called autorun with the string value echo hi

1434714
malloc	free
the pointers from the malloc in create_bitmap_data_provider is never free

1434730
http	ssl
these are more complex requiring an encrypted transport such as ssl for some of the integration and a client which can speak http redirects and handle cookies or other stored state

1434734
decrement	increment
in the controllers if one of the submit have been pressed the page# should be increment or decrement by 1

1434740

change the selected value with javascript on the click of the next or previous button right before your postback

1434758
droppable	draggable
i use draggable droppable jquery feature as follows

1434779
32-bit	64bit
i m more interested in knowing the maximum both theoretical and practically achievable heap size for a 32-bit jvm running in a 64bit os

1434779
32-bit	64bit
as to why a 32-bit jvm is used instead of a 64bit one the reason is not technical but rather administration bureaucratic - it is probably too late to install a 64bit jvm in the production-environment

1434790
any	set
what one would normally do is set a budget for the specified scoping and any addendum to this would produce billable hours above and beyond the scoping budget

1434797
decrement	increment
and you don t get anything weird like string.empty forcing an increment and decrement

1434824
textbox	button
i am writing one simple webpage with bunch of textbox and a button control

1434824
textbox	button
now .when user finished editing the value on this textbox user has to click the button and this button invoke heavily process intensive algorithm on server side codebase on the data received from client textbox

1434838
.net	wcf
ok thanks for your reply - i do understand what you re trying to accomplish - but i m afraid you re pretty much on your own since i don t think there s any bits and pieces in the .net and or the wcf subsystem to would aid in creating proxy pool

1434843
exception-handling	error-handling
if you were doing actual error-handling there i could see solving this problem but i would just let the exception-handling happen and not try to catch it at all

1434846
c++	lua
.when making lua binding for c++ classes should i return tables or userdata object

1434861
registration	login
customer registration and login 2

1434868
parentheses	operators
being able to control the precedence of your operators is sometimes useful especially if you are concerned with reliability -- extra parentheses in conditional-statements can sometimes obscure the actual logic

1434868
perl	ruby
to be frank though i think the reason ruby has the boolean operator-precedence levels it does stems mostly from the fact that matz was a perl programmer before he ever wrote ruby and borrowed much of the core syntax and operators from that language

1434876
32-bit	64bit
the limitations of a 32-bit jvm on a 64bit os will be exactly the same as the limitations of a 32-bit jvm on a 32-bit os

1434876
virtual-machine	virtualization	32-bit	64bit
after all the 32-bit jvm will be running in a 32-bit virtual-machine in the virtualization sense .so it won t know that it s running on a 64bit os machine

1434876
32-bit	64bit
the one advantage to running a 32-bit jvm on a 64bit os versus a 32-bit os is that you can have more physical memory and therefore will encounter swapping paging less frequently

1434882
32-bit	64bit
i doubt that running a 32-bit jvm under 64bit would make any difference

1434882
32-bit	64bit
we ported the .app to linux and we are running a 32-bit jviewmodel on 64bit hardware and have had a 2.2gb viewmodel running pretty easily

1434887
checkbox	button
i have an html form that works fine it show a list of things with checkbox the user checked some of them and click the remove button which submit the form

1434894
lookup	any
but if we imagine that this could not be done any differently and you are worried about performance you could always implements some sort of caching to reduce the numbers of database lookup and to store the entire contents of the order in caching as well

1434898
getchar	gets
now the first getchar gets the w the second gets the and your program terminate before you intended it to and in a gui environment if the terminating process owns the windows it is running in then the os closes it

1434901
32-bit	64bit	.when	ready
if you expect to be hitting this limit you should strongly consider starting a parallels tracking validation a 64bit jvm for your production-environment .so you have that ready for .when the 32-bit environment break down

1434901
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit operating systemd running the 32-bit viewmodel the max heap size can be higher approaching 4g on many solaris systemd

1434903
ref	out
this may not be what you want but if your scenario were such that you wanted a function that you called to modify your local boolean you can use the ref or out keyworkd

1434904
assign	add
another way would be to add an invisible menu item assign the ctrl + shift + c shortcut to it and handle the event there

1434907
directory	folder
the other option you have is to create another folder beneath the original folder and then that folder will be deployed to the out directory

1434907
directory	folder
and then in the testrunconfig you still selected the testfolder folder and the testdeployment folder will be deployed to the out directory

1434913
automated-tests	selenium
what little qa staff we do have gets to spend their time writing their own automated-tests with selenium or engaging in new functionality

1434914
python	c++
i am writing an xml-rpc client in c++ that is intended to talk to a python xml-rpc server

1434916
32-bit	64bit
for a 32-bit jvm running on a 64bit hosts i imagine what s left over for the heap will be whatever unfragmented virtual spaces is available after the jvm it s own dll s and any os 32-bit compatibility stuff has been loaded

1434929
append	input
in other words an output operation might automagicly append these characters at the end and an input operation might stripes them from the input and or terminate reading there

1434931
json	xml
i would like to avoid the circular dependent item from showing up in the json output like it is done in xml because of the xmltransient annotations

1434932
variables	boolean
if i have a boolean variables in a viewmodel class lets say

1434932
variables	boolean
if the mouse is over a certain object the boolean variables should become false otherwise it should remain true

1434956
repository	entity
the above code would live in the respective repository classes for a given entity

1434976
constructor	object
for the repository object i would pass the session to it via a constructor

1434998
private-members	private
i would prefer namespaces that way you can have private data in an anonymous namespace in the implementation file .so it doesn t have to show up in the header at all as opposed to private-members

1435006
one-to-many	entity
i have an entity called category that has a one-to-many relationship with an entity called item which in turn has an inverse relationship to a category

1435021
knopflerfish	equinox
what is new is that a few items have been standardised which should enable for better interoperability between different osgi engines like equinox felix and knopflerfish

this consolidates the properties that get set on the framework by any launchd utility

1435024
revision	svn
do a svn blame to annotations line with the revision numbers which contains the last change

1435026
frame	width	height	frame
you can not defined the arrays with non-constant dimension width height outside of the function that is - not in stack frame because the dimension aren t known at compile-time

1435042
constructor	object
derived code should be able to depend on the base constructor having set up the base state of the object

1435084
linux	unix
linux unix

1435094
animation	rotation
how do i stop the animation .when the needle reaches a rotation value of 3

1435107
put	get
more important than which database you use is to get up to speed on relational-database design before you start to put this together

1435114
buffering	streaming
also make sure the server buffering the page and does not immediately while building streaming it to the client browser

1435131
export	csv
most scientific webapps like blast for example have the option to export the data as a delimited text file like a csv

1435131
updating	updates
then your updates queries will be significantly faster as you will be able to do them entirely in sql instead of pulling the entire url table into php accessing and pulling one or more other recordinging for each url recording and then updating your table

1435147
contains	any
to elaborate this regex figures out all strings with an odd numbers of a s first section and or s those strings with any strings contains an odd numbers of b s

1435156
constructor	object
what i often do .when i find myself passing in a lot of variables is make a configuration class for the object that holds the information needed to construct the it passing that to the constructor

1435168
.net	wcf
if you want to go down that path from performance improvement for wcf client proxy creation in .net 3.5 and best practices

1435171
filtering	grouping
is there a way in infopath or moss to filtering the list .so it doesn t include grouping

this is actually very rare in the unix linux world

1435223
instance-variables	class-variables
use locals then instance-variables then class-variables avoid global anything.

1435229
contains	any
.so the table contains many nodess each nodes could be the root in the hierarchy parent is null or any level of the hierarchy parent exists elsewhere in the table

1435229
children	nodes
given an arbitrary starting nodes is there an elegant linq query that will return all children of the hierarchy from that nodes

1435244
xsd	xml
is there any way to validation xml against an xsd schema in silverlight

1435249
sortedlist	hashtable
sorry to be blunt but it simply seems like you are using a dictionary hashtable or sortedlist and are trying to add an item to that list who s key in this case admin already exists in that list

1435256
floating	margins
you can a wacky double margins in ie6 .when you put a margins in the same directions you re floating

asp.net-mvc	webforms	business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
i have a business-logic-layer bll and a data-access-layer dal that used for winforms webforms and asp.net-mvc project in the past

1435288
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
i could use one of the c++ implementation i could run the perl scripting as a resource to my cocoa .app i assume could use the python implementation and the pyobjc bridge or the perl implementation and the camelbones or perlobjc bridges

1435289
contains	any
also note that your original code for finalscore uses string-formatting without any arguments which is either a no-op or unsafe if it contains a symbols

1435290
windows-xp	windows
on windows the difference is negligible but then there is still the problem of dll hell which disappears if you add the versioning to your libs named or work with windows-xp

1435306
children	nodes
if you want to selected all direct children of a nodes a simple query like the following should do the job

1435319
contains	any

1435333
firefox	safari
i want the solution to work in ie firefox safari etc

1435359
haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
i have only used 3 functional languages -- scala erlang and haskell but in all 3 of these the correct way to building lists is to prepend the new data to the front and then reversing it instead of just append to the end

1435371
appdelegate	rootview
in the rootview of this controllers i have my frontview or main view of the application which have an info icons which flips the screens to info page which is an another view in my appdelegate

1435420
twitter	tweets
i wrote a scripting that polls twitter via prototype s ajax methods grabs json results evals them and then updates a div with the formatted tweets

1435433
erlang	ocaml
i think ocaml is a great way to get started in fp and erlang is not very difficult once you have the basic fp concepts down

1435452
contains	elements
furthermore xslt is no use since the correct order of the elements is determined solely by the data dictionary contains in the schema

1435491
installation	environment
it will defined environment variables points to various installation directory including where various standards header-files are install

1435493
xsd	xml
with xsom you can read the structure in the xsd and perhaps analyze the xml but it still would need additional mapping from the invalid form to the valid form

1435493
xsd	xml
.so i would use x.som to generator a stylesheet for the xsd which would just copy the xml nodes by nodes to re-use over and over again

1435493
xsd	xml
it would be very generics and would be able to handle almost every xsd xml

1435512
show	next
you will need to implements logic to figure out what to display on these textview which part of the text to show and use this logic to fill the current page the previous page and the next page

1435514
arrays	loops
i need a help in my code i cant figure out how to loops value from arrays and putting them a list menu

1435557
versioning	upgrade
this started happening .when we upgrade to the release versioning of s#arp-architecture 1.0

1435560
contains	set
.so while this may seem silly ensure that the table you are insert your data into contains a column with the auto_increment properties set

1435580
installshield	uninstaller
for some dumb reason installshield increment the legacy ref count for all files whether they are versioned or not and this frequently makes for mysterious stray files on uninstaller occurring on development pcs

1435592
linux	bsd
although familiarity with excel and sql is very useful and valuable try a foss free and open source software operating systemd like linux or bsd for an enormous choice of free programming languages to play with

1435612
assign	add
then .when populating my dropdownlistfor i add c2 to the top of the dropdownlistfor .when modifying a project that is assign to c2 for deleted category only

1435616
implements	extends
can anyone give me a code example of how i would create and implements this category to extends this class

1435622
hardware	monitor
under the traditional architecture of the graphics systemd in linux some direct rendering management in the kernel but everything else driven by a userspace x11 server the kernel is unable to detection new monitor because it has given up control of the hardware and x is unable to detection new monitor because a userspace program cannot handle hardware interrupts

1435682
puts	gets
this form puts the named of the field inside the textbox and uses a really simple scripting to clear the field named .when the the field gets focus

1435682
firefox	safari
this has worked fine in ie6 ie7 firefox and safari but seems to have broken in ie8

1435694

1435725
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
.when you display a viewmodel instances in a contentcontrol or itemscontrol wpf will automatically initializer the appropriate view for the viewmodel and set the view s datacontext to the viewmodel instances

1435728
authentication	login
this should ensure that both sites use the same membership database and the same authentication cookies but they ll use their individual login pages and .so the return url should be fine

1435745
python	ruby
take a look at interpreted-language like ruby or python

1435747
required	checked
it will required a box checked in your code to verify that the object is invisible .so there will be .some process overhead but not much

1435771
sql-server	oracle
is there an equivalent sql-server 2008 function that can be used to decrypt the oracle encrypted phone strings

1435780
void	main
move the cursor inside the braces and do psvm and hit ctrl-j - this expands the psvm into public static void main string arguments

1435780
keyboard	mouse
another big bonus i like about intellij compared to eclipse is that it s much less intrusive - i really hated how eclipse would manage to get popup on top of popup and mouse focus would be somewhere but keyboard focus is stuck on something underneath etc

1435780
click	mouse
you mouse over but focus stayed on the editing panels .so you have to click with the mouse to transfer focus and then be able to use the mouse wheel to lookaround

1435786
samba	root
another possible fix is describe in this kb article error occurs .when you configure iis to use a samba network shared as its root

1435796

at this points do i need to enter the named we d like to appear as in the app-store reallycoolapps llc or can i enter our real company named company llc here and choose a different named to appear as later .when we re ready to distribute

1435813
compression	streaming
iirc the #ziplib allows you to set the compression level have you tried flushing the streaming and dropping the level to 0 and then sending the already compressed data before raising the compression level again

1435852
radio-button	selected
#form input skips the radio-button and selected field

1435867
contains	any
inorder for the value to be truly constants after assignment though it should not contains any parts which might be special to the shell which make call inorder to actually run the updates rules etc. in particular backticks are best avoided

1435880

1437987
emacs	vim
ide my favorite choice would be eclipse which has a c++ plugins and many more interesting pluginss but i would also advice you to learn to use at least one among the sacred monsters vi vim and emacs

1437997
entity-framework	nhibernate
i know about a quite few orm tools that i can use entity-framework and nhibernate

1438007
selected	cell
you could add a temporary column to flag invalid items and not allow the user to leave it selected and then delete it .when the user navigated off of the cell

1438012
decrement	increment
however since you don t decrement or increment all recursive call to roundedsq you will never hit the bottom and terminate

1438013
getter	setter
put a breakpoints inside the setter getter and debugging making sure that you use step into f11 not step over - this should help explain whats going on

1438015
sql-server	mysql
this is easily done in mysql but in sql-server you will have to write a cursor or use cumulative subselects which are less efficient

1438053
contains	set
i make a new class lets call it thread_type which contains a board and a new set of board manipulation functions

1438059
contains	set
i have set of 200 document .doc contains data as follows

1438084
virtual-machine	virtualbox
go for a dual boot or if you have a good enough pc try using a virtual-machine virtualbox is a decent one

1438084
gentoo	ubuntu
if your new to nix ubuntu is great or if you dont mind getting your hands dirty try gentoo

1438093

i didn t know you could make a generics nsobject and put some subclassing in it

1438124
compact-framework	.net
have you checked out the clrprofiler for the .net compact-framework

1438124
compact-framework	.net
it s part of the power toys for .net compact-framework 3.5 downloading

1438125
display	height
i tried to inspect this elements from firebug and while source is ok height is omitted by firefox and probably other browsers and firebug display this css elements as

1438171
arguments	default
as for the arguments of this default delegate..

1438171
any	bag
i depart from his positioning however in that i see no problem defining strongly typesd delegation and generator events with strongly typesd signature in the case where i know that the handler will never care who the sender is indeed often it should not have any scoping into that types and i do not want the inconvenience of stuffing state into a bag eventarg subclassing or generics and unpack it

1438176
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoint on your systemd including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

1438188
javascript	dom
if you required this solution to still work without javascript then you may need play around with the javascript logic a little more to do more modifications to your initial dom tree or modify the server code

1438231
click	mouse
a non-c approach use java and the java.awt.robot class to move the mouse around perform real click i guess there is something in the windows world for this too

1438233
boolean	int
there s quite a few little bits of java which come from it being a better c++ - in c or c++ there s an automatic conversion between boolean value and int .so in c++

1438233
boolean	int
java concentrates on fixing this ambiguity with parsing two binary-operatorss by making boolean and int types non-convertible .so you have to join them with another operators

1438234
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie gives priority to the the text in the table rather than the a tag .so you get a text selector cur.sor and can t click the link .when you hover over the text

1438249
contains	any
you have to invalidate any caching object that contains a modified item

1438258
margins	padding
as you probably know margins specify the distance between elementss it s not an outer padding that surrounds each elements

1438258
margins	padding
if the margins would be counted to the boundary of the parent elements putting elementss in a div elements would introduce extra spacing between the elementss eventhough the div itself has no margins or padding

1438289
administration	account
typically this will be network service but it could be a different account if your hosting administration has set it up that way

1438300
treeview	listview	datagridview	treeview	datagridview	listview
i ve noticed that the xxxview listview treeview datagridview controls tend to clone things unexpectedly

1438312
display	width
the normals approach would be to put a link in every cell contains only a nbsp if it s empty and use â display blockâ to make the link fill the width of the cell

1438317
ruby	php
thrift looks like a very good alternative if you want support more platform like php ruby c# etc

note the table does not contains any recording

1438365
cursor	row
you may want to use the css cursor properties to make the row appear clickable as well

1438387
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional associations with the many valued end the set or bag marked as inverse true

1438389
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
i cannot do a hard conversion to any other character set either such as iso-8859-1 as the data can contains cyrillic and arabic characters

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in all the other browsers ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera it animates in a motion which seems like the computer is hanging

1438403
any	set
question can i write equivalent statements using where to set my conditional for any outer left right-join statements as well

1438418
overlapping	padding	overlap	padding
my thinking is that maybe ie sees overlapping elements as in positioning on top of one another as a possible conflict and thus makes a decision to try to accommodate both well the link is yay big but the text outside of it really isn t a link .so let s treat it like normals text etc but that elements that overlap purely for styles which i think padding is considered would not raise any alarms because hey it s just a visual thing

1438430
value	field
aka the value that the db created for my id field

1438430
value	field
q using pygresql what is the best way to insert recording and return the value of the id field without doing any additional reads or queries

1438440
oracle	mysql
i am no mysql expert but in oracle the syntax for an outer-join in a where conditional is where t1.id + t2.id

1438461
positioning	slider
i suspect that the problem lies in the styling of the slider namely the float left - it s redundant since you use absolute positioning

1438485
any	set
can i write equivalent statements using where to set my conditional for any outer left right-join statements as well

1438516
build-process	msbuild
alternatively you can use a msbuild xml parsing to drop that section of the web-config each time you run your build-process

1438530

you can t assume ruby perl or python as they are non standards on windows

1438552
silverlight	wpf
these days you probably want to also consider silverlight which is essentially a subset of wpf but with very much smaller downloading footprint wpf is between 30 - 300 mb silverlight iirc is about 4mb

1438552
silverlight	xbap	silverlight	wpf
the decision between wpf vs xbap vs silverlight is discussed further here

1438556
any	set
we can use the returning clause to get the value of any column including those which have been set with default value or by triggers code

1438557
contains	set
the contract for the set interface is that it may not contains two object that are considered equals by the equalss methods

1438598
postback	ajax
sorry every request to the server ajax or otherwise triggers the full page lifecycle - you need to find a good way of determining if you are dealing with an ajax request or a full page postback

hudson or teamcity for continuous-integration

1438599
continuous-integration	teamcity

i have an abstract-class with multiple functions implements using various protocols by the inheriting classes and simple tcp and udp pthreads sockets work fine

1438641
value	field
this works very well after some tries giving a list of field operators and value

1438657
temporary	copy
if the id value doesn t matter at all in the final product that is if you could renumber them all and it would be fine and if id is a serial column then just selected distinct on the two columns into a new table delete all the data from the old table and then copy the temporary value back in

1438668
contains	any
nor is the string contains in any of my libs

i have a vba macros for ms-word that i am trying to improve

1438684

1438728
value	field
if the static value is initializer .when the types is loaded via a field initializer or via the types initializer static constructor then it should contains the value

1438738
.war	jar
if i have an dependency jar for my application is it better to place it in the .war files .lib directory or to place it in the global application-server like tomcat .lib directory

1438743
testdriven.net	gallio
if you have a look at testdriven.net and gallio they both have test runners that integrated to the ide and allow the use of other testing frameworks

1438746
value	field
sounds like your php scripting handles the form submission by process the input and redirecting the browser to the value in the rec_thanks field

1438825
bugzilla	fogbugz
fogbugz bugzilla whatever i am not a shill for spolsky but i will say that facebook is by far the easiest to use systemd for our testers and easy to use really matters for them

1438842
c++	lua
i m trying to load tables from lua to c++ but i m having trouble getting it right

1438844

the user would write scripting that checked on commissions for their sales perhaps alerted them to order that were pending after a certain length of time or automated common comments that policy required them to attach to each order

1438854
webserver	upload
this worked great .when i was running it from a dedicated windows 2003 webserver but now that i am trying to run this on an ec2 instances it has stopped working and i only get the file upload failed messages

1438861
datagrid	textbox
but the problem is once page datagrid load with textbox column i am enter some data in that column

1438865

i m using mvcsitemap .so you can t have duplicates elements in there

1438870
digits	zero
if more than four digits leading zero are prohibited and 0000 is prohibited

1438876
scala	java
both java and scala have varargs and both only support it for the last parameters

1438883
.when	ready
however .when i remove the ready function and call the methods straight-up everything works just the same but execute significantly fasterâ almost a whole second faster on a pretty basic file

1438897
subtract	add
if you add subtract two to of these big numbers the libs adds subtract all int elements in the arrays separately and handles the carries borrows

1438897
subtraction	addition
it s like manual addition subtraction in school because this is how it works internally

1438902
python	php	python	c++
it s points of view is python and c++ but many solutions works for php too

1438910
default-value	default
regardless of t s types you can fallback to default t which will provide the default-value for the given types string.empty 0 false null etc...

1438913
gnome	kde
the product does not have a graphical user environment in the classical gnome kde fashion

1438956
internet-explorer	firefox
one of the problems was that with internet-explorer if there are too many messages sent through localconnections it will slow the messages sent through but in the standalone player and in firefox this threshold is significantly higher

1438958
firefox	safari
now if you start the .app and enter something like localhost 8080 springmvctest a.abc you should be redirected to the russian wikipedia site and the browser ie and firefox safari or else possibly not should show a nice utf8-decode native russion url

1438977
contains	elements
as a rules of thumb whatever dom you are using once you ve located the elements s you are interested in getting data from accessing the text nodes they contains required a bit more work

1439008
custom-server-controls	user-controls
what we re therefore doing is to generator these user-controls based on a set of standards custom-server-controls we ve developed but we ll generator just the first time from some static information about the entities in our application

1439053
contains	elements
different control sets may allow for the hiding or disabling of the user-interface elements but the expectations is that your finished application will still contains an application menu elements you may seek to implements it yourself as part of your windows frame or through other means

1439057
javascript	dom
if .so then client-side javascript to add nodes to the dom will have no effect - since the server-side jsp engine is not interpreting those

1439057
javascript	dom
your javascript needs to work with raw html and dom such as adding an elements

1439064
put	get
the error i get is on the line where i put the function in the hashtable

1439096
security	owasp
typically i d go with the owasp s top 10 web application security vulnerabilities google owasp top 10 2007

1439108
compatibility	platform
that way you don t need to worry about platform compatibility it s their file .so they must be able to open it and all the rest

1439116
build-process	release
we use an automated build-process and therefore any change to our svn repository would generator changes that we couldn t link to project bugs issues and would triggers automated building and release which delivered no functional change to previous versioning

1439118
contains	elements
the span elements contains the selected page which isn t an anchor .so that s not what you want to target

1439130
selected	cell
in which i want to show some detailing by the means of expansion of that cell by the means of touching the cell it should animate and exapnd and show the details and in that show the details related to selected row

1439176
show	next
.when you just delete dir2 the next svn up will bring it back as svn status of course show it as missing now

1439188
triggers	insert
if you need to do it with tons or tonnes but certainly not tones of email addresses and or you re doing it frequently the right time to do it is .when the data enters the table by using an insert updates triggers and splitting it into two columns at that points

1439190
initializer	getter
in the customers getter we d like to initializer a dataservicequery instances populate it with the customers in customerstoreturn and return it

1439191
hide	next
you could provide the selected text value next to the dropdown and hide it via css

1439191
hide	show
then use a printing stylesheet to show the text and hide the dropdown .when printinging

1439201
loading	gif
edit 2 if your loading page is a php file you can checked the to-be-downloadinged file s size and display an estimated downloading time to the user along with an animated loading gif or whatnot

1439208
moss	wss
.so i ve been asked to move the content of a sharepoint wss 3.0 no moss install only the free versioning test site to a development moss 2007 site

1439229
ubuntu	linux
the reason i am doing it is i m trying to run the gwt on linux ubuntu 64 as the link below indicates is possible

1439230
value	field
before reading any form field modify your response.codepage value -

1439230
value	field
finally my personal preferences don t .post xml as field value in a form

1439230
value	field
instead turn it around by adding the other form field value as attributes or elements to the xml then .post the xml using xmlhttprequest

1439239
any	set
the value labeled b peal working set is the largest amount of physical memory allocated at any instant during the life of the process

1439244
c++	lua
since it works .when you remove external stuff but doesn t .when you add it back in my best guess is that you re corrupting stack somehow either the c++ stack or the lua stack

1439258
ubuntu	linux
but on ubuntu linux i can downloading the precompile mingw32 package which is of the versioning 4.2.1

1439265
environment	building
recently i ve tried to integrated this in an automatic building environment hudson and i came across many obstacles

1439265
cppunit	cunit
i expect that if you run on pc cunit and cppunit can help you a lot to implements good unit-testing

1439270
keyboard	mouse
the problem was that the pager was positioning on top of the grid even though it looks like its positioning below the grid its boundaries actually stretch across the whole grid hence stealing all mouse and keyboard input

1439271
value	field
the value of that field in the recordset is 8.90 and is typed as varchar 255

1439273

updatepanel	gridview
.so as you can see .when one or the other is hit i set a textbox to .some value then i do a partials postback to my gridview which is in that updatepanel

1439327
debugging	trace
i prefer the first not just for code-readability but for runtime debugging sake also for the original example - if you put the result-of the getter in a local you see that value rather than having to trace into the getter the first time

1439333
moss	wss
the primes api upon which moss content deployment functionality is construct is present in the wss platform .so you could conceivably building your own versioning .

1439338
updatepanel	gridview
i m trying to building a sort of accordion effect using a gridview and updatepanel

1439339
webforms	asp.net
coming back to this question 6 months after i asked it now that i ve gained some experience with asp.net webforms i m going to answer my own question

1439339
gridview	listview
using the actual asp.net-controls like listview and gridview is not really all that hard and i can see that it is indeed a common practice to use them on forms and not feel like you a cheating

1439339
asp.net-mvc	webforms
sure asp.net-mvc forces you to low-level html coding but using asp.net-controls on webforms .app is fine and actually not nearly as hard as i was affraid it would be

1439353
directory	folder
the directory that i want to write files to has been created in the same folder as the php scripting that are trying to write the files and the rights for this folder is rwxr-xr-x

click is apache s versioning of a component based web framework equivalent to jsf other component base java frameworks are tapestry and wicket

1439428
callback	methods
if you need it to expire after a period of time exactly then you ll need to use a timer and replace the instances in the callback methods beware the timer will callback in a different thread .so make sure to implements a thread safe singleton pattern

1439438
flyweight-pattern	factory-pattern
patterns such as flyweight-pattern seem to me to be a specialized versioning of the factory-pattern to promote high scalability or .when working within memory or storage constraints

1439446
sql-server	sql-azure
it s not really all that different from making a sql-server accessible from the internet - except with sql-azure you don t have to deal with router making sure power is available even during a thunderstorm keeping the server up and running applying the latest security patches dealing with internet connect adding ram as needed swapping out defective harddisks as needed load balancing amongst a farm of 20 servers and .so on and .so forth - the micro.soft datacenter will do all that for you

1439448
vbscript	perl
these articles provide more information on the subject and contains vbscript code samples hope it won t be hard for you to convert them to perl

1439449
firefox	safari
firefox safari had most of the javascript stuff

copy each of these files to a destination folder wherever that is preserving directory tree or creating any missing intermediate directory as in current folder

1439590

options include using the newer 64bit 32-bin python 2.7.x install from python.org or installing a newer python 2.6 and pil and the various 3rd-party libs using macports homebrew or fink

1439780
windows-xp	windows
you can use this to verify at compile-time that your application will work on windows 2000 0x0500 for example or on windows-xp 0x0501

1439783
windows-xp	windows
what #define winver 0x0501 means is that the program required windows-xp or server 2003 to run and that it therefore can use windows functionality up through that release

1439801
linux	unix
if you are using telnet then a linux machine and a unix machine should respond identically

1439801
linux	bsd
however on a linux machine you are going to have gnu tools while on other unixes you are more likely to have bsd or sysv tools

1439808
buffering	streaming
bufferingedstreaming is just a buffering over an existing streaming

1439808
buffering	streaming
memorystreaming is a buffering for the whole streaming - it isn t chaining to another one

1439822
value	field
however what i thought will be the obvious logic for a null scriptpath field returns no value

1439851
inno-setup	nsis
i would prefer not to use nsis or inno-setup for this

1439852
arguments	default
| the optional argdefs tuples specifies the default arguments value

1439854
duplicates	contains
if i verbally express it as an author can write many post and many post can be written by one author i see it as a one-to-many but if i view it from the actual data stored in the tables such as post will contains multiple post and author will contains multiple author then it seems like a many to many .so is this what the cross-reference table is for to remove duplicates

1439858
buffering	streaming
a simple close triggers the fflush of the buffering to the underlying streaming

1439865
macports	fink
here are the step that i took to successfully install pil on mac os x 10.6 without using macports or fink

1439865
macports	fink
your best solution that doesn t involve macports or fink would probably be to compile and install python from the 2.6 release branch from either the mercurial python repository or the subversion python repository

1439865
virtualenv	fabric
i ve been seeing similar errors using python 2.6.2 install from the mac disk image while trying to then install fabric in a virtualenv .so i plan to compile and install from the 2.6 release maintenance branch

1439870
put	get
put a linkbutton inside the updatepanel and get rid of the link you currently have

1439871
memcached	apc
another idea instead of using a database would be to use some caching engine like apc memcached .

1439884
show	next
everything is working perfectly except for the lack of a cursor on the uilabel to show the user where the next character typed into the field will show up

1439884
any	set
before i abandon ship and go for a uitextview with its own set of issues i was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to how a blink cursor can be added to the textfield on a labels text

1439886
hide	show
i have to warn you though - it s not optimazed at all and is not using overlay .so .when i tried putting 50+ markers in the manager and toggle the hide show the class is sloooow.

ie8-compatibility-mode	opera	ie8-compatibility-mode	firefox	ie8-compatibility-mode	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
edit after more testing it appears the code works on ie8 and ie8-compatibility-mode but not in firefox google-chrome or opera

1439934
python	perl	gitolite	gitosis	gitolite	repo	gitosis	repo
you should however take a look at repository access management tools such as gitosis in python using setuptools or new gitolite in perl simpler or repo tool from the google s android project or something else

1439946
sweave	latex
i prefer eclipse statet because i use it for all my development and it has many rich features svn integration sweave latex integration project-management

1439951
keyboard	mouse
as it can be slightly annoying to have the mouse jump 1px diagonal every second i intend to use autohotkey to write a scripting that does basically the same thing but only after a configure keyboard mouse idle timeout and maybe use the shift key or scroll lock instead of a mouse move

1439956
implements	super
this is free and super easy to implements

1439963
value	field
a field in date_column with value of 2009-09-17 will return as september 2009

1439969
arrays	loops
i would rather not have to loops through the arrays to count it because i am loopsing through it later inorder to draw a table and i need to know the last iterator before the table draw begins

1439972
duplicates	contains
if i verbally express it as an author can write many post and many post can be written by one author i see it as a one-to-many but if i view it from the actual data stored in the tables such as post will contains multiple post and author will contains multiple author then it seems like a many to many .so is this what the cross-reference table is for to remove duplicates

1439975
contains	any
edit just worth mentioning there is no inline-styles or any other css that would overrides anything and using web-developer-toolbar it show the flash movie has the extra height not the contains h2

1439976
contains	any
make clean generally only cleans built files in the directory contains the source code itself and rarely touches any install software

1439981
conditional	parentheses
the if is telling the compiler that you have a question and the question is the conditional between parentheses

1439983
dependency-properties	attached-properties
do i have to go toward dependency-properties and attached-properties to building an equivalent or is there already something baked in the oven waiting for me

1440001
arrays	loops
ecmascript doesn t handle the length of assocative arrays like php does - either use a real list that has a .length properties set the .length properties manually in the json as you populate properties in the object or do a for..in loops and make sure to use .hasownproperties and increment some counter

1440006
comparator	sortedmap
i ve heard that sortedmap and comparator are the best way to do this

1440006
comparator	sortedmap
how do i initializer the sortedmap and pass in the comparator

1440020
linux	unix
since linux is the most popular unix derivative in use today many developers have learned to just never checked the result-of malloc

1440020
glib	gtk
for example the glib and gtk libs use this approach

1440028
contains	any
queryable.oftype itself isn t meant to contains any of the logic for omitting returning any value

1440035
comparator	sortedmap
the simpler way is to implements comparable with your existing object although you could instead create a comparator and pass it to the sortedmap

1440035
comparator	sortedmap
as with the sortedmap you could instead create a and pass it to collections.sort list comparator

1440038
treeset	treemap
edit2 if you only have a bunch of object that you re throw into the collections and it s not a map it s not a mapping from one set of object to another then you want a treeset not a treemap

1440045
any	set
any ideas how to set it to auto or 100

1440057
display	width
the horizontal menu should be 100 width display block also works and the closing block placed inside

1440063
checkout	payment
does anyone know how the entire checkout process including credit-card validation and payment transactional can be done in flash without redirecting to another html page

1440071
instances	private
the application windows w n tmywindows are all the same and all have an private object class instances associated with them e tmyobject

1440077
radio-button	selected
run git gui selected the amend last commit radio-button and unstage commit unstage from commit or ctrl - u changes that you do not want to go into first commit

1440089
contains	any
you could even use httaccess to append scriptinging contains this to any scripting called

1440099
rollback	commit
that said do you really need to explicit begin commit rollback transactional within your stored procedure

1440100
any	set
you can do it .when you load with any xmlreader if you set the appropriate option

1440104
python	ruby	python	tcl

1440107
margins	padding
the browsers naturally default to different padding margins settings

1440108
attributes	properties
please advise how it can be done as well as how to add browsableattributes to a myclass instances s properties at runtime if this attributes doesn t exist

1440116
design-view	designer
using the query designer in design-view for an updates query

1440116
design-view	designer
using the query designer in design-view for an append query

1440127
virtual-memory	paging
it is true that desktop systemd have virtual-memory and demand paging but even then not checked malloc 3 only works in a debugged program with no memory-leaks

1440128
configuration	logging
the logging configuration for the stdout logging in jboss omits the date as you ve noticed

1440128
stderr	stdout
it s worth noting that any applications which use stdout stderr should get those recording written both to the pipe stdout strerr streaming as well as to the log4j log files

1440132
value	field
to differentiate by document types you can generally use the form field value on a document

1440132
value	field
.so after you get the document handle the notesdocument object use getitemvalue to get the value of the form field

1440142
order	join
does the order of the join statement make a difference as compared to the order of the index

1440149
administration	account
i am attempting to modify access for a proprietary directory in environment.specialfolders.commonapplicationdata that an administration account is the owner of

1440165
order	join
note i d personally prefer to change the join around to match a natural order

1440165
order	join
that is i try to use my columns in the same order join where that matches my key and or indexes

1440180
arrays	map
this code creates a map where each entry then contains an arrays aka bag

1440180
dictionary	arrays
if i release the dictionary object leveldict which owns the arrays of object for each entry i am assuming that release will cascade through the arrayss as well

1440180
dictionary	arrays
or do i have to iterate over the dictionary and explicit release each of the arrays

1440185
order	add
to limit index fragmentation by using order that tends to add recording towards the end of the table and or nearby non-selective parameters

1440185
order	join
but this important issue may be getting off topic as the op s question was whether the order of the join conditional mattered

1440194
dictionary	arrays
of course adding anything to a dictionary will retain the key and value and adding anything to a mutable arrays will retain the entries

1440195
spaces	output
if the output target is html then extra spaces don t matter - browsers don t rendering multiple contiguous spaces which is why we have

1440197
contains	set
if all of the strings that you are encoding contains only characters from the us-ascii character set make it clear by specifying that encoding explicit

1440218
asp.net-mvc	wcf
which has a full pledged orm inversion-of-control asp.net-mvc wcf domain driven unit-testing validation each of these tools are based on patterns.

1440219
children	tree
you are receiving this exception-handling probably because you are trying to add children to timelinepanels or you are overrides the visual tree of the panels and returning something other than 1 in visualchildrencount

1440225
any	set
it sets the depth for dir2 to zero and it will immediately vanish from the checkout and no updates will bring it back unless you explicit set the depth of this directory to a value again or just do an updates on it without depth option since not giving any depth always means infinite unless you use non-recursive which means files

1440235
decimal-point	numeric
.when dest-item is numeric or numeric edited decimal-point

1440239
put	get
i get the key from the recaptcha website and already succeed to put the public key to load the webpage with the challenge

a two binding in your case would be that setting the font-size would affect the height of the textbox

1440262
restart	reload
is there a way to dynamically reload the terracotta configuration file without restart terracotta and losing session replication for every web .app

1440263
membership	guid
userid is a nullable guid field on the members table that corresponds to the asp.net membership table aspnet_member

1440267
oracle	mysql
most are aware of the sql dialect being used for example oracle 9 vs mysql 3 and can generator the sql syntax that is most efficient for that dialect

1440271
arrays	loops
then in the foreach loops maintain a counter for the arrays index you need to updates next

1440280
ptrace	mmap
played around with ptrace and patching all cpuid opcodes in all executable mmap ed regions that are created by a process replacing them by int3 s

i m in the habit of doing executenonquery on begin transactional and commit or rollback by hand

1440298
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to fade out the overlay on mouseenter but only fade it back in 2000ms after mouseleave

1440298
fadeout	fadein
for the same reason i can t use fadeout and fadein

1440302
dictionary	arrays
code is simpler using autoreleased dictionary arrays since the branching doesn t affect the retain count

1440310
firefox	safari
related to this it may be possible that firefox other browsers will attempt to load the same resource on multiple connections until one is successful whereas safari only tries one connection for a given resource

1440312
triggers	insert
create a triggers on tblemployee to updates that table on any insert updates delete

1440319

if you add a parameterless constructor to your foowrapper and then use object initialization instead like .so

1440322
tripledes	aes
128bit aes or tripledes are still considered secure

1440323
keyboard	mouse
transmit keyboard and mouse events wrapped in xml to remote-desktop

1440323
keyboard	mouse
i could transmit a information for keyboard and mouse events to remote computer and it will be received

1440323
python	java	keyboard	mouse
ok is there any equivalent of robot java in python to control mouse and keyboard events

1440328
noncopyable	containers
no noncopyable elements can t be in c++ containers classes

1440337
key-value	key
stability a key that changes often is a poor candidate for a clustered key as each updates the clustered key-value and force all non-clustered indexes to updates the lookup key they store

1440340
directory	folder
however .when i throw the stripes folder into the same examples directory and tried to access the files i received the following error

1440359
put	get
i ll put a code-snippets at the end of the answer that ought to get you off and running

1440396
windows-vista	windows
i ve managed to maximize the margins and printing the image in landscape mode but it simply does not look as good as .when i printing the same image file from windows photo gallery formerly windows picture and fax viewer the default image preview program in windows-vista

1440396
bmp	png
are there any simple printing drivers that can intercept photo gallery printinging output as a standards image file bmp png etc. that can be read by the .net image class

1440420
textbox	button
the way i usually implements this is by adding a button to the form like add another phone-number that if click would postback to the server and generator a new form with an additional textbox

1440454
hide	show
for example if you need to just hide show a couple controls i d include controls into the view that would be empty in some cases and contains data in others

1440454
hide	show
if it s more than a couple controls are show hidden at once and your framework supports a concept of panelss reusable parts of the view i d separate that grouping of controls into a panels and show hide that panels depending on the conditional

1440460
worksheet	excel
then in excel i merge all 169 worksheet into a single workbook

1440469
any	set
any ideas why ie wouldn t set the div to display block

1440489
background-image	transparency
i ve had pretty good cross-browser success with this code it also fixed background-image transparency pngs the only code libs i ve found that actually did this on all browsers

1440503

unsigned short

1440515
click	mouse
i m used to working with a windows framework that provides events for things like a mouse click or a mouse double click

1440541
windows-vista	windows
for windows-vista and windows 7 you need to get the remote-server administration tools rsat - the active-directory users computers snap-in is include in that pack

1440542
environment	restart
if you had visual-studio open .when you created the environment variables then i don t know if it will pick it up until you close and restart vs

1440542
environment	building
i m not exactly sure how vs launchd an executable after you building it but it probably is a subprocess and as a result isn t picking up your new environment variables

1440545
unsigned	short
a unsigned short in c++ is usually a 16-bit unsigned-integer uint16 or ushort in c#

1440556
unsigned	short
ushort assuming unsigned short produced by your c compiler is 16-bit

1440556
32-bit	16-bit
in c# ushort is always 16-bit and uint is always 32-bit

1440559
any	set
to me this question is more like a company policy coding guidelines question and if any company wants to choose methods that help in producing easy to understand and easy to debugging and read practises then they should choose using get set over properties

1440592
for-loop	arrays	while-loop	for-loop	while-loop	arrays
if you have the data in an arrays for you can replace the while-loop with a for-loop

1440599
value	field
this way you get the raw value assign to the field

1440606
subset	unique
if the string is guaranteed to have only a subset of possible characters -- for example a-za-z0-9 -- it can be shortened even more by converting these to unique ordinals and using a higher base encoding

1440614
selected	listbox
if you re merely trying to get the selected items from a nested listbox have you tried giving your listbox an x named and exposing your selecteditems via a properties in your user-controls itemview class

1440627
varchar2	clob
i presume the same is true in oracle just substiture varchar2 for varchar and clob for text

1440649
value	field
this should be the field in the table where you want to store this second value

1440652
value	field
instead you add form field with named corresponding to the parameters of the action methods you .post to and the model binder automagically puts the right value in each parameter

1440679
er-diagram	diagram
er-diagram are simpler than uml diagram

1440685

i have run into an instances during development .when the xml file does not validation against the xsd provided

1440731
selected	checkbox
i m not sure what it s expecting i m assuming that it s going to pass the true false value of the selected ness of the checkbox into the methods but it appears not to understand what this is in this context

1440808
right-join	union
this basically is the union of a right-join with a left join

1440824
blacklist	whitelist
i ve tried a few things either to whitelist ow.ly or to blacklist the offending website but i can t get around the cross-frame security long enough to search top.location

1440831
keyboard	mouse
you can control the keyboard and the mouse with python on windows by calling the win32 apis keybd_event and mouse_event thanks to ctypes

1440836
scp	ssh
ssh scp via 3rd party .app install

1440836
ports	dmz
consider the production servers being on the internet or in a dmz push required opening insecure firewall ports for unc or ftp does it not

1440843
constructor	object
otherwise you can put some logic in the constructor of the object

1440892
arrays	loops
not surprisingly my implementation involves calling uiimagewritetosavedphotosalbum inside a loops that iterates over an arrays of 12 full paths to the corresponding image files all are jpegs

1440895
children	nodes
read the children of the root nodes of all secondary rss feed

1440895
children	nodes
append those children to the new xml document root nodes

1440900
value	field
all we really need to do is execute a selected query that returns two field and parsing those field value out for each row

1440907
accessor	ivar
will create properties accessor methods that access the _engine ivar instead of engine

1440909
stateful-session-bean	ejb
whenever i try to access ejb 3 stateful-session-bean deployed on jboss 4.2.2 application-server using a web client within jboss server such as servlet jsp i get following exception-handling

1440925
variables	boolean
obviously creating a boolean variables and then trying to set it like readonlyattribute boolvar doesn t work and now i m out of ideas

1440935
getter	setter
the author wanted to make sure that there was no confusion between accessing the ivar directly and accessing via the setter getter

1440940
png	gif
i d like to tweak the mantis code or configuration to auto-display images gif png jpg

1440944
base-class	inherited
what i would do is create a base-class with a protected versioning the properties then create two classes that inherited the base-class that have the readonly and the non-readonly bits

1440948
header-files	makefile
presumably you use the same header-files for both the import and export code .so you could do .some makefile magic to defined a preproces.sor macros on each side then do .something like this

1440956
hide	show
this is quite a bit of work in the first place but it gives you the possibility to dynamically return a properties named and description helpful for localization dynamically mark properties as readonly dynamiclly show and hide properties and do a lot of other usefull things

1440975
version-control	cvs
what is a regular expression i can use in vim to find conflicts in cvs and possibly other version-control systemd

1441011
integration	payment
no payment integration or file-handling

1441029
frame	width	height	frame
yes the frame and bounds stay the same you should checked the viewcontroller s interfaceorientation properties and treat the width and the height accordingly if your layout depends specifically on these

1441041
put	get
if you need a shared view simple put the view file in the view shared folder .so that all controllers s can get to it

1441045
duplicates	contains
the reason i am asking is that i have a service class that contains logic that i would like to use in other service classes and i do not want to duplicates the logic only to avoid injecting a service class into another service class

1441046
openssl	gnutls	libcurl	gnutls	libcurl	openssl
ubuntu pylibcurl uses gnutls while ubuntu libcurl command-line uses openssl

1441064

1441200
artifactory	nexus
it s worth noting you can do largely the same things more or less with artifactory or archiva as nexus i ve include nexus references because i prefer it and the documentation is really good

1441208
attributes	properties
note that you have to set the default colour in this case #ccccd0 via a properties setter and not via an attributes on the page itself

1441218
touch	drag
what im tyring to create is an application the utilizes book features like .when the user drag a touch or just touches the right screens the page turns the book im trying to create has atleats 300 pages

1441225
return-value	arguments
the problem is that types parameters are only deduced .when they re used in arguments context but never in return-value context

1441260
joomla	drupal
from my experience with wordpress joomla and drupal

1441260
joomla	drupal
i think drupal wins hands down here with views cck afaik joomla and wordpress only support it on a low database-access level

1441260
joomla	drupal
joomla has a new from the time i ve used it oop framework that i haven t used - but it looks like it s as complex as drupal but doesn t

1441260
joomla	drupal
the documentation for joomla and drupal is lacking imho

1441260
ruby-on-rails	django	kohana	django
in my opinion if the site is sufficiently big complex and the site you ve linked to certainly is it s better to go with some nice framework django ruby-on-rails or if you re only know php - kohana or something instead of a cms

1441286
any	set
if protected-mode is set to on you cannot run ie as an ordinary user in any desktop except the default one

1441287
contains	any
calling doget or dopost or any other visible methods in the instances of the servlet object will execute the contains code

1441289

the class doesn t store the parameter value in field but rather acts as an access points by reading and writing them to and from the actual store be it configuration file registry or database

1441296
push	pull
i push pull the repository between my various computers to sync it up

1441296
bazaar	git
if you want to use git instead of bazaar you can instead use

1441302
append	input
one issue that may cause you problems you re append your new input box to the end of your outer div text which means it s not inside the form tags

1441311
constructor	object
public functions defined on the constructor function are more computationally expensive than adding a simple function to the object prototype but they also give you much more flexibility

i m guessing those versioning of ie are not picking up your changes to the margins padding h6 and #cartcomputer h6 styles in table.css and cartsidebar.css .

1442901
udp	tcp
for heartbeats use udp not tcp

1442901
udp	tcp
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance .so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1442908
directory	folder
i named the stopword file stop.txt and have placed it in the usr folder the etc mysql folder and the root directory

1442915
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this presents the usual challenge around authentication and authentication - namely how does authentication flow between tiers. but that s are unique to asp.net-mvc a webforms solution would have the same sticking points you ll also lose the model-validation bits that an orm may supply and will have to provide that yourself in your web-services repository but that s just a matter of implements the right interfaces

1442940
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the link named subcribe in a reader should be in centering but it show in left in safari and opera but in firefox and ie7 show perfectly in centering

firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
and the border is 5-6 pixels going up in opera and safari but in firefox ie 7 it show perfectly fine

1442940
pixels	line
and in ie6 it show border line 10-12 pixels downside .

1442954
linux	unix	openbsd	linux
porting a c program from unix to windows or even from linux to openbsd may be a straightforward recompilation but for an assembly program you may find that some callee-save registers become caller-save or that the floating-point parameters are passed differently

1442968
hidden-field	checkbox
basicly i m trying to get the value of a hidden-field increment it on every checked checkbox using javascript and reasign the increment value to the hidden-field on every postback

1442981
put	get
websphere has a hierarchy of classloader parent classloader cannot see child classloader hence you get surprises .when you put different aspects of your application in different places

1442981
websphere	ibm
you can specify the search order preferences parent last .so that these take prececdence over jars supplied by websphere - but note that .some fundamental jars cannot be overrides you cannot replace the ibm security for example

1442982
ip-address	hostname
an attacker can observe both the hostname by watching your dns traffic and the ip-address you re connecting to

1442991
contains	elements	contains	set
a set contains only one elements and thus unable to load the others as it isn t a proxy is out of hibernate logic

1442999
put	get
remember to put the javascript part before the closing tag .so .when it get s there the hidden-field is already rendering and can usable

1443007
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

1443007
google-chrome	firefox
also upvotes for anyone who can give me some tips on how to write pages and use styles that work across firefox google-chrome and ie 7

1443014
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you want to do class first design as opposed to database first design nhibernate is pretty much your best and only option right now neither llblgen pro nor entity-framework support this mode although it sounds like entity-framework is improving it s support in the next versioning

1443022
password-recovery	login
also it is supported by standards components the login loginview loginstatus loginname and password-recovery controls and can be administered through the asp.net administration pages

1443023
export	report
if you already running adwords on those keyword you can export the keyword report and parsing them in you .app ms excel is a better tool here

1443030
where-clause	sql
you can t concatenation kriter into the rest of the where-clause like that - it s evaluation it as a string not a piece of sql

1443032
margins	padding
instead using padding and margins for layout your sidebar

1443039
quirks-mode	doctype
could be because your not defining a doctype and ie is viewing your page in quirks-mode as appose to standardss mode or almost standards

1443039
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked your site in standards mode and in ie7 the 2 column behave as they should like in firefox google-chrome

1443041
authentication	login	default	reset
if you use the default controls for usermanagement login passwd reset etc then you can just change a web-config setting and your users are able to use another mechanisem to authentication

1443054
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
be careful with dynamic-sql this approach i ve exampled is preferred over just concatenation the myparam directly on to the string as it helps guard against sql-injection

1443062
http	ssl
i need to set up ssl for each instances but i lose the option to do binding to a specific hostname that option is only available with regular http

1443062
http	ssl
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same http binding and the binding is configure with a different certificate ...

1443074
http	ssl
ssl sets up an encrypted session between the two machines and then runs ordinary http over that encrypted connection .so they can see what physical machine you are connect to but beyond that can t see anything at all in your connection

1443077
ubuntu	linux
on an ubuntu linux box already configure for development you should not get any errors at all

1443078
dbase	bde	dbase	dbf	bde	dbf
various flavors of dbf dbase clipper foxpro are similar with one notable exception-handling dbf7 which was introduced with visual dbase 7 and powered by bde

1443102
asp.net-mvc	wcf
asp.net-mvc should have no impact but you will likely end up using something like wcf

1443105
concatenation	comma
but then you need an aggregate-functions to tell mysql what to do with the other columns - the ones you are not grouping ing by . example using grouping_concat as aggregate-functions which just concatenation all columns in each grouping using a comma

1443109
http	ssl
the hostname information is part of the http headder which is encrypetd and decrypted by ssl .so inorder to have several ssl website you have to do either

1443111
jcarousellite	fancybox
ended up combining jcarousellite with galleria and using fancybox to pull it altogether - took longer than i had available but the client will be happy i hope .

its first column contains strings of the format chrx where x denotes a set of strings 1 2 ... x y

1443172
32-bit	64bit
having move our asp.net site from 32-bit windows-server 2003 iis6 to 64bit windows-server 2008 iis7 classic mode certain active-directory operations are intermittently experiencing huge delay

1443179
base-class	inherited
sounds to me as though you just need to inherited from the base-class

1443181
subclassing	superclass
it is not a nice idea to expect the superclass to know the parameter to be used in the init of its subclassing since it is really hard to ensure that all the constructor will be the same maybe the animal dialog windows takes diff parameters

1443185
button	popup
in a wpf application i have button which popup instances of windows

1443185
button	popup

1443185
button	popup
i click the second button and the second windows popup correct in front of the main application

1443187
short	base
glad you asked short answer - because the calculation that determines the common ancestry base of related files depends heavily on how prior merge conflicts between them were resolved

1443187
hash	md5
ditto if you chose an acceptmerge resolution but happened to commit a file with the same md5 hash as a foo.cs

1443196
any	set
unfortunately current msdn doesnt list any of them we also had connection-timeout issues which was set only for 120 seconds but we came to know that .when users do long upload the session break because the timeout reaches sooner for bigger files

1443198
doubly-linked-list	nodes
you can have any numbers of hash or other indexes into doubly-linked-list nodes doubly linked .so you have o 1 deletion

1443200
selected	checkbox
you could use advanced filtering with the unique recording only checkbox selected and copy unique value to a new location

1443208
export	report
.when you create a report using sql-server report service 2008 sp1 that uses .jpg images sometimes you get the following error .when you export the report to words

http-get from mysite.com product - returns xml or json listing all product

1443211
json	xml
http-get from mysite.com product 14 - returns xml or json for product 14

1443212
base-class	inherited
the best way to do only if your entityattrib and gamenode are two different classes inherited from same base-class would be actually defining two data templates as below

1443212
filesystems	fileinfo
consider filesystems object both fileinfo and directoryinfo classes are actually derived from filesysteminfo class which shared common properties

1443212
children	nodes
you can defined multiple templates provided they have something to distinguish the types will be automatically chosen for the children of the nodes

1443212
attributes	properties
.when you change an item in collections your actual instances of attributes properties remains same

1443215
boost	stl

wrap the database image value expression in this call code.converttopng field

1443222
ncover	nant
since i use the nunit ncover nhibernate nant stack .when doing most .net development sometimes i feel like we are just a bunch of copycats

1443223
display	outline
the outline table column see is the nstablecolumn that draw the triangle and left padding as needed to display the hierarchy

1443223
selected	cell
note that you may have to overrides the following methods to draw correctly .when the cell can be typed in selected for editing and the tooltip

1443237
children	nodes
now i want to hide visibility.collapse some items depending on wether a nodes has children or not

1443237
children	nodes
what i aim at the throughput value of a nodes is how much of something flows through this nodes from its children

1443237
children	tree
the structure of the tree that is bound to the treeview is essentially stolen from dan vanderboom a bit too much to dump the whole code here except that i here of course use an observablecollection for the children and the value items implements inotifypropertychanged

1443241
duplicates	contains	contains	set
of course you d have to be careful for duplicates etc defined the behavior of add x add x remove x contains x - you could end up with it in the list but not the set but it wouldn t be too hard

1443253
instrumentation	debugging
you should definitely use instrumentation to debugging this issue unless somebody has the answer right away

1443253
instrumentation	debugging
you can easily debugging frame-rate + see what layer are opaque transparency with the blended layer option in the core-animation instrumentation

1443277
codeigniter	symfony
i know you don t want to use one but codeigniter does keep things very simple is lighting and doesn t try to do as much for you was other frameworks like cake and symfony do

1443299
keydown	keyup
if that s not quite right for you you could use some of the other jquery-events like keyup keydown or keypress - depending on the exact effect you want

1443305
contains	lookup
if you can do contains in o 1 then you could do index lookup in o 1

1443305
duplicates	lookup	duplicates	elements
but of course index lookup is not unique if you have duplicates elements

1443305
data-structures	map
as what you essentially need is two data-structures a set or map and a list and there isn t a much more efficient way of doing it than this the standard-library author leave you to combine the data-structures yourself

1443309
c++	lua
you can always call a c++ methods from lua that takes a pointers to enemy

1443313
constructor	object
call a constructor to create a new object

1443314
attributes	properties
i only saw that i can filtering the output by attributess but i don t want to add another attributes to the properties in my types just for this

1443337
double	int
the first one is slightly different in that 0 is an int literals which will be widened to a double

1443342
authentication	impersonation
all our inhouse project use active-directory authentication and impersonation as this is the accepted security policy for the company

1443350
restart	exit
.when the user exit the .app and after some time restart the .app the timer would just get the current time and compare it with the original timestamp it kept

1443361
malloc	free
i was bothered as i was used to develop in c++ since suddenly all the open close create destroy lock unlock patterns that show up in .so many ways in .software apart from malloc free could be broken since everybody believed that all cleanup was automatic

1443370
value	field
i use self-written printer class but dir is also good for outputting the instances field value

1443383
textbox	button
i have a bunch of textbox and a save button to updates something

1443397
any	set
to set any site dependant variables like mysql-connect info paths etc

1443434
gridview	formview
they want a small application using asp.net gridview formview and an objectdatasource with a dataset xsd file

1443444
contains	elements	contains	any
but caml in t does not contains any where elements

1443447
cross-compiling	cmake
package using cmake are usually less cross-compiling friendly

1443508
constructor	object
but .when creating object having references to other object we must pass these references as input arguments to the constructor

1443508
constructor	object
but .when the menuhandler creates a menu object it must pass a timer reference arguments to the constructor

1443515
asp.net-mvc	wcf
the background is that i am working on an application that uses asp.net-mvc 2 unity and wcf

1443515
asp.net-mvc	wcf	attributes	properties
we have written our own asp.net-mvc controllers factory that uses unity to initializer the controllers and wcf proxy are inject using the dependency attributes on public properties of the controllers

1443536
constructor	object
the menuhandler creates a timer object passes it into the menu constructor and forgets about it

1443541
display	height	display	width
i m trying to make sure that .when a messages is too long for the available width the textblock gets extra height and the text gets display on 2 line

1443542
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the trick to make this easier is this visual-studio can mark keyword as case-sensitive or case-insensitive

1443546
constructor	object
if each menu object has a timer it can be a member and initializer by the menu constructor s

1443546
constructor	object
the timer object internally may obtain a reference to the systemd clock in its constructor but that s not your concern

1443549
itemscontrol	grid
the grid is the itemspanel of an itemscontrol object

1443559
derived-class	base-class
recreating your example verbatim in a new unit i get mymethod in my code-completion list as expected .so is it possible that in your actual case that your base-class and your derived-class are actually separated by other code perhaps even in separate units and that that other code contains errors between the two declarations at the time at which you are trying to invoke code-completion

1443576
perl	c++
i want to access a templates list of c++ program from a perl scripting and use those value

1443585
environment	building
currently i am building a continuous-integration environment at our place and we use ivy to handle our dependencies

1443588
cross-compiling	toolchain	toolchain	platform
.when cross-compiling you have to building the toolchain targeting the platform you want it to generator executable code for which means that you may do it without a scripting

1443594
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit machine has both 64bit and 32-bit versioning of system.data

1443594
32-bit	64bit
in this case my dll referes to which system.data - 32-bit or 64bit

1443617
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox google-chrome all manage to negotiate the proxy sucessfully as do adobe air applications

1443628
cakephp	symfony	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
but if you use a framework such as zend-framework symfony cakephp codeigniter etc.

1443634
prolog	lisp
i m reasonably familiar with c++ although haven t touch it since the nineties work on a daily basis and 100 confident with c# would consider myself advanced to expert with java and have developed a reasonable amount of stuff in lisp and prolog back in the day

1443646
sql-server-express	sql-server
can this be achieved without using local instances of sql-server even without sql-server-express

1443662
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
if you want something modern you might want to look at python ruby or asp.net-mvc before php as it s easier to write bad code in php than in any of those

1443667
defined	declare
i move to it from cppunit which was good but too java like this was a problem because junit uses reflection to find and run your tests since this is not available in c++ you have to use macros to register your tests in cppunit you have to declare register and defined your tests in three different places

1443667
defined	declare
boost-test lets you declare register and defined your test in one statement this is very nice

1443713
user-interface	look-and-feel
and even where they are available there are look-and-feel and usability problems .when the conventions of one user-interface are bolted on top of another

1443726
.when	ready
how do i know .when it is ready

1443738
reflection	runtime
it s not possible and will never be possible because are compiled as metadata and static-variables are initializer at runtime and of course the former cannot access the latter except via reflection

1443744
boolean	int
i would say i m pretty new to this but could someone explain the basic about data types more specifically int characters boolean string and floating-point numbers

1443746
double	int	primitive	int
the int literals 0 is converted to a double with a widening primitive conversion see 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion in the java language specifications

1443752
sql-server	oracle
you can assume the oracle and sql-server databases have the same tables and field

1443761
boolean	int
one downside is that you can defined only boolean floats strings or int no complex data-structures

1443791
.net	wcf
if you worried about the size of the install then i would target the .net 2.0 framework over the .net 3.5 framework - if you are just doing a basic windows forms application no wcf wpf or linq etc... then the .net 2.0 framework has 90 of the functionality of .net 3.0 or 3.5 and it also present on a much higher percentage of machines 80 according to this blog

1443800
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter or it s successor kohana

1443803
duplicates	contains
if foos might contains duplicates ids you should use first or firstordefault

1443803
order	join
maybe even a join will work but i am not sure if it preserve the order

1443813
databound	formview
i cannot see that formview raises the databound event didn t you forget declare event handler

1443816
contains	any
if i have a string which may contains any characters including etc... how do convert it safely into xml that can be stored like this

1443821
children	nodes	children	tree
this will read the entire document into memory and then provide various ways of accessing particular nodes of the tree such as requesting a tag by named then asking for the children of that tag

1443839
iframe	popup
well if you use an iframe in your popup windows in this day in age i would avoid popup windowss like the plague due to popup blockers

1443846
entity-framework	ado.net
you would not believe how much code is generator on it by ado.net entity-framework

1443858
xsd	xml
we have an xsd that matches the xml that we get back

1443858
xsd	xml
how can we bind the xml with the xsd such that we can treat the xml document as if it were strongly typed

1443871

1443886
base-class	inherited
dont i have an option to selectively inherited the variables i want in my base-class

1443888
silverlight	wpf
how i would go about this is i d study the free wpf silverlight versioning out there i m familiar with wpf .so i wouldn t bother with flash versioning then try to apply that in xna

1443892
protected	public
changing the private to protected or internal or public depends on what you need should help

1443894
put	get
i think this approach worked well for me because the mac os is the bigger picture and the iphone is a subset - it helped me get context on how things had been put together

1443894
shell	bash
i found i needed to get pretty comfortable with the terminal and read a book on the bash shell and polished up my vim usage

1443918
substring	strstr
why don t you just cycle over your arrays and checked with a regular expression or strstr or substring ... search_string

1443922
arrays	loops
you can either loops on all line of the arrays and use strpos on each string

1443925
getter	setter
and then overrides it in class b but throw an exception-handling in getter and setter

1443925
attributes	properties
also if this properties is used in a visual designer you can use browsable attributes to not display

1443942
xsd	xml
once you have your xml back as a xmldocument you can either validation that against the xml schema or just try to deserialize it into the types that is represented by the xsd schema you have

1443954
any	set
make sure you do not set the width on any containers like grid or canvasses

1443982
defined	declare
in c++ do methods only get inline if they are explicit declare inline or defined in a header file or are compilers allowed to inline methods as they see fit

1443988
constructor	object
--- system.missingmethodexception no parameterless constructor defined for this object

1444001
member-functions	inline
also note that class member-functions have an implicit inline decoration if they are defined right in the class definition

1444002
associations	model
some of it might be possible to put in the model and controllers by using associations proxy but i can t help you there

1444002
associations	model
also a join model should never be edited provided that you don t have more attributes in it than these field it is either create or delete since all it do is keep the associations

1444016
put	get
.so you need to get the image data with getimagedata and put it back with putimagedata

1444018
libxml2	libxslt
nokogiri wrap libxml2 and libxslt with a clean rubyish api that supports namespaces xpath and css3 queries

1444027
isnull	nvl
i think you are looking for left outer-join and isnull nvl functions but without knowing the dialect of sql and the tables cannot be exact

1444028
switching	screens
the application required a lot of switching between the various screens and is also graphic intensive

1444031
click	mouse
the ui-thread has a messages pump that handles windows-messagess like mouse click etc

1444034
defined	declare
main can be declare or defined as

1444048
member-functions	inline
member-functions are declare inline by default. the compiler decides here also

1444060
inlining	inline
the compiler can inline whatever it wants in case inlining doesn t violate the code semantics and it can reach the function code

1444077
version-control	bazaar
from other similar post bazaar and mercurial seem the best distribute version-control systemd for my needs

1444089
arrays	loops
i want to go through all the bytes and increment by 1 on each iterator of loops .so eventually i go through all possibilities of the byte arrays

1444095
factory-pattern	factory-method
edit in c# this factory-method can even be used by using delegation as a true factory according to the factory-pattern

1444099
constructor	object
you re right to think that the constructor shouldn t do any more work than to simply initializer the object

1444128
value	field
something like assuming the field is called value in the setting item

1444138
.when	ready
in your main view controllers .when you are ready to push the subordinate view controllers you set the subordinate view controllers s properties accordingly

1444138
contains	elements
by setting references in this way each view controllers is pointed at the same mutable arrays contains the desired elements

1444163
bazaar	git
i have used svn git and bazaar quite extensively on various different project

1444172
solaris	linux
technically on solaris linux and most unixes the jvm process will execute in the lp64 model

1444172
32-bit	64bit
the lp64 model is different from the 32-bit model ilp32 in that pointers happen to be 64bit wide as opposed to 32-bit pointers

1444172
32-bit	64bit
.so there is greater bloat for the same numbers of object at a given time in a 32-bit jvm and a 64bit one

1444177
jprofiler	yourkit
i also looked into yourkit and jprofiler

1444186
pointers	stack
later .when you go to access it you still have a pointers to that portion of your stack

1444187
revision	svn
svn diff returns difference between working copy and the last committed revision

1444201
configuration	logging
that is really useful to set server based logging configuration parameters using same log4.properties for test and deployment

1444212
key-value	key
if it does make clear that itâ s the key of a key-value pair

1444213
dom4j	jdom
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444228
pointers	stack
now your pointers is points to a spot on stack that hopefully won t get clobbered by the call to printf .when it passes in a pointers to stack-memory that is no longer being used

1444242
object-reference	instances
is it correct to assume a java object only takes up the 8 bytes for the object-reference as long as all it s members are set to null or does the definition of members already use up spaces in the instances for some reason

1444246
postback	ajax	updating	updates
one of the pages has a button which does a postback and updates a ajax grid after updating the database

1444272
instances	destroy
presumably a call to destroy on an image instances but can t be sure

1444282
xerces	jaxp
once you obtain the dom interface you really don t care which implementation of xml parsing is used underneath xerces or jaxp

1444332
highlight	selected
.when a comboxbox gains focus you can disable the text highlight by selected no text upon the gotfocus event

1444341
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in .net i would throw an argumentnullexception rather than a nullreferenceexception

1444364
perl	c++
you can not access c++ list like a perl arrays by a subscript

1444366
children	nodes
for example if i have a client nodes which has multiple children called endpoint then it will only mass copy the first endpoint nodes while eliminating all the others

1444379
dialog	pop-up
secondly you can use jquery to unobtrusively insert a javascript printing this page link which will pop-up the browser s printing dialog on the user s screens .when activated

1444393
sql-server-express	sql-server
if i have some code which works on sql-server enterprise edition and i also want to make it work on express edition any general step and advice for migration and testing to verify my code on sql-server enterprise edition works for sql-server-express edition as well

1444437
bimap	map
both are free have the bidirectional map implementation that i was looking for bidimap in apache bimap in google are amazingly nearly the same size apache 493 kb google 499 kb ed. no longer true

1444456
uptime	reboot
.so no internet time no user time setup in settings and no bsd uptime time since last reboot

1444478
silverlight	wpf
it s like a domain-specific versioning of data service for silverlight or wpf clients

1444499
bazaar	git
it s free very very easy to set up and use doesn t required a server because it can just access the local filesystems and you can find loads and loads of documentation and help if you get stuck because i think there are far more people who use svn than bazaar or git for example..

1444500
triggers	insert
provided you use insert updates triggers to keep the columnar and combined data in sync you won t have any problems

1444502
value	field
if you are not dealing with attributess just capturing and showing the data then you can go ahead and store in one field with some separator make sure the separator wont occur in the attributes value

1444503
internet-explorer	firefox
the reason both exist is that keycode is available within internet-explorer while which is available in w3c browsers like firefox

1444505
put	get
what would be nice is if i could put it in the deploy directory of the jboss server and could somehow get a reference to it

1444511
windows-vista	windows
the windows-vista styles guide line says to defined an application specific volume control in the windows mixer

1444520
restart	exit
then i exit the application and restart it i want the logs to be written to log.1

1444538
order	add
i m looking at implements some linq-to-sql but am struggling to see how we woudl add in access-control business rules such as customer a can only view their order

1444549
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1444566
hide	show
now i managed only to show hide the control

1444573
python	php
otherwise i have found a solutions using webkit and python but you will need full access to your linux server inorder to install the necessary package then you will be able to call that scripting from php and get your screenshot

1444574
row	col
i think that i would rewrite it to use const iterator instead of row and col indexes

1444597
ruby	php
to send the selenese cmd you can use any language such as java php ruby etc

1444598
versioning	migrate
although you don t specify this in your question i assume that you re going to develop the new versioning of your application database and then at some switchover points you need to migrate all of the live data from your old database into your new database

1444638
webforms	asp.net
this approach imo is actually easier than the user-controls approach you were previously using in asp.net webforms

1444643
value	field
you need call use uri.escapedatastring on each field value

1444646
json	xml
if they do then it will return xml json markup in response to your query

1444671
python	java
i think python is a good suggestion but also java - maybe in combinations with jsp

1444673
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
the user-interface user-interface thread is the main thread in your application responsible for process windows-messages such as mouse click keyboard input repainting the screens etc

1444683
contains	any
basically have your non-user-interface thread pull a reference to some user-interface object any pre-existing instances of the control class will do perhaps your restoredatabasebutton instances and call the invoke methods on it passing a delegation contains the code to be execute as the parameter

1444683
click	mouse
the ui-thread might already have a stack of messages to process click mouse movement resize etc. and will handle each in the order it was received

1444685
mongodb	couchdb
i was wondering if its possible to use a json-based schema-free document-based database like mongodb or couchdb on a symfony project like its used for ruby-on-rails website

1444691
reflection	runtime
this is a better oo approach leads to less coupling and will certainly perform better than runtime reflection

1444705
spaces	output
in testing i ve learned that its tripping up on spaces in the output filename .so i ve tried using sed to escape them but its not working

1444803
json	xml
i m much more familiar and comfortable working with xml than json

1444803
json	xml
will there be a noticable performance difference between using xml and json

1444803
json	xml
if i m better off doing this with json than xml is there some really good documentation on best practices or maybe a nice jquery plugins i m missing

1444803
json	xml
maybe there are other data formats i haven t considered beyond xml or json though i already know i don t want to use a relational-database

1444808
private-key	rsa
the .pem cert needs to include both the certificate and the rsa private-key

1444831
profiling	trace
second take a trace of your sql-server using sql profiling already install and make sure that you selected on the events selectedion the item locks deadlock graphing which will show what is causing the deadlock

1444840
windows-vista	windows
updates here is a .post named launchd an interactive process from windows service in windows-vista and later

1444898
daemons	systemd
then have the systemd start this daemons at startup

1444898
ruby	php
realistically i d write it in ruby or php or whatever and have .something like delayed-job or crontab or whatever scheduling run it every .so often because i wouldn t need stuff updating ever clock cycle

1444901
x-ua-compatible	compatibility
alternatively you could use the x-ua-compatible meta tag or header and see if this can be resolved by resorting to the compatibility mode i would personally use this as a last resort and would instead attempt to write javascript that does not cause ie8 to behave as describe

1444916
instrumentation	profiling
instrumentationation in xcode 3.2 also now has a nice time profiling instrumentation although that s mac-only

1444916
instrumentation	profiling
i ve found that instrumentation works well for profiling but it can drop samples if the systemd is under heavy load

1444919
toolchain	binutils
during this initiation period i came across some terminologies stuff that i am not acquainted with like configure toolchain binutils etc

1444940
user-input	output
if there is a need for user-input or screens output those tasks should be in separate subroutine not comingled with your primary algorithms

1444950
toolchain	binutils
your examples toolchain and binutils are not complex concepts and a simple wiki article should suffice

1444952
actionscript	mxml
yes you can use any text-editor to write mxml and actionscript code and then use the command-line to compile the code into a swf flash movie

1444956
postgresql	oracle
in oracle and postgresql 8.4

1444959
difference	factors
in comments below you say you re not using optimisation and this appears to make a big difference in this case - normally it s less that a factors of ten but in this case it s over a hundred time slower

1444959
required	checked
in the debugging building there are two range checked on each access each of which call std vector size using a non-inlined function-call and required a branch predicition

1444961
python	c++
i have a bunch of existing working c++ code and i d like to use python to crawl through it and figure out relationships between classes etc

1444975
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i need to support ie6+ as well as modern browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari

1444991
udp	tcp
client send some messages to server using udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
server must be able to support both udp and tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
in my program user client is given choice in the start to selected what he want to use udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
.so my main problem is how can i know or differentiate in the server side if the client is sending messages using tcp or udp

1445000
rome	feed
i m using rome to read and combine rss feed caching is done with ehcache in a java environment

1445000
rome	feed
is there functionality built-in to the rome api that allows you to search the contents of a feed or a combinations of different feed and then combine the ones that meet a specific search criterion

1445000
rome	feed
i m thinking of implements that myself by reading the feed contents and searching using a regex or whatever but would rather use built-in api logic if it s available i ve looked at the rome tutorials here

1445005
udp	tcp
just let the tcp socket listen on ports x and do the udp connections through ports y

1445010
python	c++
this page show a c++ grammar written in antlr and you can generator python code from it

1445011
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
is it possible to turn off opaque resizing on qmainwindow qdockwidget separators

1445027
udp	tcp
before the packets reaches you you don t know whether it s udp or tcp

1445027
udp	tcp
.so you want to bind to both udp and tcp .sockets if you expect request both ways

1445045
any	set
if i was running this from outside the swing event thread i would assume that in most cases though a race conditional is possible by the time the swing edt comes visiting the properties is already set to yellow .so there ll never be any red painted

1445047
union-all	union
changed union s to union-all

1445049
udp	tcp
.when you create the socket you pass a types - sock_stream tcp or sock_dgram udp

1445055
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the only thing that change is that i m using asp.net webforms instead of asp.net-mvc

1445056
double-quotes	single-quotes
try replacing the double-quotes with the correct numbers of single-quotes

1445064
flash-builder	air
just a bit of background flex builder a.k.a flash-builder the mxmlc compiler free and flash csx all compile actionscript code into swf files and or air files

1445064
actionscript	mxml
mxml is an xml language that acts as a shortcut for actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can code in mxml instead of actionscript and the compiler will convert your mxml into actionscript before compiling

1445064
actionscript	mxml
the compiler converts the mxml into actionscript classes and then compiles the actionscript classes the ones created as mxml and the ones coded natively in actionscript into bytecode

1445064
actionscript	mxml
currently you can code both actionscript and mxml -- and then compile using flex builder flash-builder or the mxmlc compiler which is free

1445064
actionscript	mxml
flash csx can does not understand mxml .so you it can only compile straight-forward actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
note there are third-party tools such as fdt that can also be used to write and compile actionscript and mxml

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can even use mxml to auto-generate actionscript that s not part of the flex framework your own custom classes

1445083
swing	awt
the event-dispatch-thread belongs to awt not swing

1445100
asp.net-mvc	webforms
regardless of webforms or asp.net-mvc your pagemethods still has to return a json object

1445100
webforms	asp.net
.so the .solution in that .post should work fine in a asp.net webforms project

1445118
configuration	environment
add required syslog_logger to the top of configuration environment production.rb

1445134
configuration	installation
then do the installation configuration per.sonally .so no-one but you is able to figure out how everything should be set

1445135
value	field
if you have a large table oracle can prefer deriving the field from the indexes rather than from the table even there is no single index that covers all value

1445135
aggregate	grouping
you need to replace with expression based on the grouping columns and aggregate of the non-grouping columns

1445135
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
since it will contains everything for both filtering on field_two sorting on field_three field_four field_five useful for grouping by and making sure that field_one is not null

1445139
setinterval	settimeout
that might required falling back on setinterval or settimeout but i m uncertain of the syntax to do that

1445141
protected	public
for example technically the standards allows for shuffling the layout of members that belong to different access specifiers public protected etc.

1445146
deployment	install
note this is suitable for prototyping only not a production deployment due to restrictions in the basic install

1445162
authentication	login
.when the login expires the authentication filtering always send a login form in html

1445165
return-value	arguments
this is dangerous as the third arguments for read is a maximum of bytes to be read and you should use read s return-value to checked how much actually got read

1445173
contains	any
my viewmodel subscribes to the collectionchanged properties of any observablecollection that contains iindexedobjects

1445178
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern
you could also look into observer-pattern and publish-subscribe

1445182
dependency-properties	attached-properties
mechanisms of dependency-properties and attached-properties

1445184
buffering	streaming
the roout cause can vary depending on the streaming types but essentially the return-value will be less than the actual buffering size whenever you are trying to read beyond the end of the streaming

1445188
svnadmin	dump
backup the repository svnadmin dump manually once a month or .so

1445202
environment	building
would you trust a green building to auto-deploy for acceptance-testing environment

1445213
versioning	staging
where nightly building to a staging area start paying real dividends is .when you have clients project managers and qa people that need to be able to see an up to-date but relatively stable versioning of the .app

1445213
versioning	staging
it sounds like you don t have a staging setup since you just automatically updates the production versioning

1445228
keydown	keyup
do not try to get character codes for keyup and keydown events

1445228
keydown	keyup
secondly you get different sets of value in a keypress event to what you get in a keyup or keydown event

1445274
double	int
it seems that in the original example the return-value from foo operators double is cast to an int and then back to a double

1445279
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit machine filesystems redirection causes 32-bit process accessing system32 to actually access syswow64

1445279
32-bit	64bit
.so if one of your process is running as a 64bit process and the other as a 32-bit process they will actually be accessing two different location .when they read from or write to system32

1445289
subclassing	base-class
it should also be noted that this may lead to memory-leaks as creating a subclassing adds the subclassing to the base-class list of subclassinging and isn t removed .when all instances of the subclassing are gc d

1445294
double	int
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1445295
hash	md5
it could be anything but i would try md5 or hmac-md5 first because they are most popular 16-byte hash algorithms

1445298
gnome	kde
i d suggest something like kde gnome firefox or eclipse

1445313
repository	entity
it doesn t matter whether or not you explicit fflush the session between modifying a foo entity and loading all foos from the repository

1445327
double	int
is not ambiguous the conversion from foo to int is used using your conversion function that converts to double that works because after applying the conversion function a standards conversion that converts the double to int truncation follows

1445327
double	int
in the second case since the operands has types double no such trailing conversion to int takes place and thus the result types of

1445331
contains	any
if the user has connect account with any facebook connect sites and if your site has specified an account reclamation url the email will contains a section with your application logo named and reclamation link in addition to an explanation about the link s purpose

1445348
scala	java
the goal is to make a better java especially more immutable and more functional but without introduction of much more new features like in scala

1445358
if-statement	while-loop
perhaps your if-statement right after the while-loop begins comes back false

1445360
groovy	scala	python	ruby
but .when it comes to ruby i suspect that he can give a useful syntax review if he never did functional-programming before or at least did some code in modern languages such as ruby like groovy scala or python

1445376
coding-style	indentation
if he is purely concerned about coding-style casing indentation etc. then this will be less helpful

1445390
directory	folder
try the public folder in the user profiling directory

1445407
double	int
it cannot convert item to int but it can convert item to double which it then converts to int

1445411
value	field
i am looking to use javascript or jquery to pull the alt tag from the specific image that had been click in the html and copy its value into a caption field

1445453
children	nodes
it works great but i would have liked to modify it to get only the first nodes next to the selected category here product without the children of the sub category

1445454
double	int
we can convert a foo since we can implicit convert a foo to a double and thence to an int

1445466
filehandle	pipe
open a filehandle using a pipe from dir cmd

1445512
fadeout	fadein
if i use fadeout and fadein here the .overlay disappears completely and the scripting thinks i ve move my mouseout even though i m still hovering over the .overlay

1445520
exception-handling	try-catch
we have a try-catch block of code in our web application to trap a certain exception-handling

1445523
updatepanel	gridview
my gridview is in an updatepanel and my filtering button is not

1445549
firefox	safari
additionally it will be limited to only mac users with safari or firefox

1445564
shell	bash
this is available in most versioning of bash and should be bourne shell sh compatible also

1445571
expression	brackets
but my current regular expression doesn t detection the escape sequences and always considers the substring between brackets as a placeholder .so i get things like hello 0

1445579
where-clause	sql
are you sure that the last clause in your sql statement is a where-clause

1445590
stateless	stateful
put another way if this were an non-web application the stateless servlets would be object i would delegation a task to and the stateful object would maintain the results

1445592
function-call	inline
the compiler cannot inline a function-call unless it has the full definition

1445613
burp	ntlm
soapui doesn t seem to work directly with ntlm authentication but you can use a proxy such as burp suite to do the auth for you

1445613
burp	ntlm
it will send request through burp proxy which will do the ntlm authentication for you

1445614
any	set
dreamhost and the svn faq both say that the problem could be that i m behind some kind of proxy that my isp has set up without me having any control over it

1445618
variables	boolean	boolean	int
if you have registered a parameter as pdo_int but the variables holds a boolean pdo converts the bool to an int long

1445619
export	csv
export it as a csv

1445621
export	csv
can t you do some export to a file using csv for example

1445627
stderr	stdout
i have a program that writes to stdout and possibly stderr

1445627
stderr	stdout
i want to run it from python capturing the stdout and stderr

1445647
stderr	stdout
to a stdout or stderr pipe such that

1445647
.when	ready
if you can t use communication for some reason have the subprocess write to a temporary file and then you can wait and read that file .when it s ready -- writing to a file instead of to a pipe does not risk deadlock

1445655
put	get
this will put it in with the already defined ccharacter grouping .so it ll get whatever highlight that gets - in this case character

1445676
constructor	private	instances	private
sealed can be winged with a private constructor and a sort of factory-pattern to actually obtain instances of the sealed class

1445688
versioning	upgrade
i have an asp.net application that i ve upgrade from versioning 1.1 visual-studio 2003 to visual-studio 2008 .net 3.5 asp.net 2.0

1445694
one-to-many	entity
owner entity can easily checked its own fk and in case of one-to-many empty collections proxy is created initially and populate on demand .so the as.sociations can be lazy-evaluation

1445694
associations	model
has a valid points however you may not be able to implements it depending on your model if your one-to-one associations is nullable

1445701
contains	any
are there any useful and reliable keyword being reliable here that contains sql-server scripting especially for viewing the statistical usage of the database

1445706
csv	xml
i am trying to write an awk scripting to convert a csv formatted spreadsheet into xml for bugzilla bugs

1445711
32-bit	64bit
i do have the family license upgrade dvd but need snow leopard to fix .some things before i can upgrade .so i have no first-hand experience with that yet but i do know it s a 2.6 building and it comes in both 32-bit and 64bit versions.

1445714
jruby	mri
for mri i always use ruby-prof but i don t think this works on jruby

1445718
managed-code	unmanaged
thats literally where i insert my dispose call o my presenter which itself is a managed-code but yet contains unmanaged com object

1445729
any	set
django is just a set of libs .so in one sense you can definitely run it on google-app-engine or any wsgi-compatible web containers

1445743
perl	awk	python	perl	csv	xml
i think it just splits on tabs - as the other answers note it needs to be change to split on python perl .net etc have object to fully deal with csv and xml and probably you could write the solution in as few characters as the awk scripting and more importantly understand it

1445745
callback	methods
i ve also tried setting up a callback on this methods and doing assert.fail inside of it but as this gets swallowed as well the testing framework vs 2008 built-in test doesn t get notified of it.

1445752
perl	ruby	perl	awk
awk vi perl ruby and many more let you specify wahtever delimiter that you want

1445778
versioning	upgrade
in investigating this further and testing more options i think the best answer is to modify the product code in addition to the product versioning and author it as a major upgrade which removes the previous versioning first and then install the new files

1445807
any	set
if there is common prefix you can set these variables using any accessor field

1445816
click	mouse
the users would also like to be able to interact with the object using mouse integration - things like grabbing the corner of the charts and dragging to expand contract it click on a numbers and getting a textbox to edit it or right click on something to get a menu of possible integration

1445821
fread	seek
then you seek backwards that many bytes and fread that data and copy it out to the filesystems where you could treat it as an executable file

1445821
executable	upx
you ll also probably want to upx your executable before you append them

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
in fact your solution depends on this because you can t triggers the mouseenter and mouseleave events on the overlay and still have the elements beneath clickable

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
the containers should have the mouseenter and mouseleave actions bound to it and .when the overlay fade out completely it should be hidden as well

1445827
scheme	lisp
a classic programming exercise is to write a lisp scheme interpreter in lisp scheme

1445831
connection-pooling	pool
the only problem could be on connection-pooling it will fragment the pool in 2 that s it

1445835
any	set
if you can set any value make sure there s some way to query that same value

1445844
click	mouse
.when mouse event is made checked the list for which object is click

1445862
contains	elements
i d like to know if there is a way to dynamically modify access the data contains in html images just as if they were an html5-canvas elements

1445898
drawimage	draw
you could draw the image to a canvas elements with drawimage and then get the pixels data from the canvas

1445907
binaryreader	writer
using the asciiencoding on the binaryreader writer ended up fixing most of the problems a few issues with an extra character being prepend to strings occurred but i fixed that up

1445927
streamreader	streamwriter
.when you read or write to your file you can however use a streamreader streamwriter set to force ascii encoding like .so

1445929
value	field
in the constructor of pen after setting the field pencolor to the value passed into the constructor i updates a global static weak hashmap that i m keeping where the key is the this-pointer - in my case a pen and the value is another weakhashmap whose key is the string pencolor and whose value is a reference to the pencolor member field

1445952
expression	evaluation
there is a high cost associated with evaluation the expression perhaps io or an expensive computation

1445959
expression	evaluation
the short-circuiting evaluation automatically provides conditional evaluation of a part of the expression

1445959
expression	evaluation
another consequence is that side-effects of the evaluation of the expression could be affected

1445976
any	set
i don t know of any native way to show which recording are dirty .so i m thinking that for each updates or insert to cases an inuse flag will be set

1445976
value	field
my question is whether this is reliable - if we updates two or more field inuse plus the other field in a single statement is it possible that a concurrent nolock query would read some of the new value but not others

1445987
strcpy	memcpy
of course you could always extends that to incorporate a function-call to do the operation .so supporting memcpy or strcpy or similar would be trivial

1445989
dictionary	arrays
put another way i want to create a javascript object or arrays from a python dictionary then insert that object into the javascript code and then insert that javascript code into the html

1445992
textmate	vim
i m trying really hard to learn vim after using textmate for the last few years

1446013
contains	elements
rather all of a sudden some hyperlink were rendering with a dotted border the only attributes i remember changing is display inline on an h2 elements that contains a link afterwards the dotted border appeared

1446026
implements	final
i know it s not the final solution that we ll see with asp.net-mvc v2 but it s easy to implements and very flexible

1446038
subtraction	addition
edit for a range of hours you want a timespan object which is automatically the result-of addition subtraction of datetime object

1446061
wamp	php	installation	environment
a local installation of magento through mamp wamp prepackaged lamp desktop environment for mac and windows with php 5.2.6 mysql 5 and apache 2.0.59

1446063
boolean	int
2. .when you re performing boolean math with int

1446066
quadtree	octree
dividing the world up into a grid quadtree octree and rejecting any object that you know is within a zone that you have already determined is currently invisible or more commonly a combinations of both

1446070
textmate	vim

1446141
post-increment	pre-increment
remembering to use pre-increment rather than post-increment

1446168
loading	png
only minus is that you will have to create custom loading procedure to load the png data into your object not too hard

1446206
any	set	background-color	display
if you want to use these subviewss purely for hit testing and not for display then you can set their background-color to but don t hide them set the hidden properties to yes disable user integration with them via the userintegrationenabled bool properties or set the alpha below 0.1 since any of those things will cause the hittest withevent methods to skip over that subviews

1446361
xerces	jdom
you can use jdom which required xerces saxparser

1446366
any	set
how about a backtracking approach at generator the codes where you would invalidate any solution that doesn t fit a set of rules like not having similarly-looking characters next to one another

1446366
contains	any
if you can identify all the unwanted pairs of characters and flag as invalid any solutions that contains them i guess it s pretty straitforward

1446391
type-safety	generics
everything will become more complicated in case you do not know arity beforehand because generics product will let you retrieve elements as any only see product.productelement n int methods -- thus you are loosing type-safety

1446393
quadtree	octree
couple that with an octree or quadtree depending on whether your game is 3d 2d .so you dont need to checked every single game object against the frustum

for example at my freebsd box i got einval and erange value and under linux the same happens where the standards referrers only to the erange errno value

1446626
callback	methods
.so i m not really sure how a callback fits into this but using the createdelegate methods is a good idea .when your javascript-objects handle events that are caused by .some user-interface elements

1446626
callback	methods
most of the time the __dopostback methods is used to preform the callback

1446626
callback	methods
this methods takes 2 parameters...the object that caused the postback callback to the server and the arguments for the postback callback

1446637

i don t like having to types cout and cin unnecessarily 9 sequential time

1446841
arrays	loops
.so i was thinking i could use loops to handle the input like i ve done with arrays earlier

1446844
order	add
to .solve this you would have to add a class attributes to the elements .so you selected all the elements with that class than you use only one css selectedor which would imply that the elements would be in the right order

1446852
beautifulsoup	mechanize
is it possible to encapsulate python modules mechanize and beautifulsoup into a single .py file

1446852
beautifulsoup	mechanize
i have a python scripting that required mechanize and beautifulsoup

python	php
just make sure the libs are in a directory readable by your python scripting and therefore by your php .app and added to the python load path

1446882
mocking	tdd
bringing in pair-programming tdd concepts like broken windows organizing project folder and bringing in mocking for tests were all excellent additions that while we may have gotten there on our own it may have taken a long time which wouldn t work out .so well

any	set
i m having an issue with the columns properties the properties is set to as readonly .so i can t edit any information in it and need to add columns to the datagrid

1447036
contains	lookup
if your file contains line with different lengths and you need to read line often and you need to read it quickly you can make an index of the file by reading it once saving positioning of each newline and then .when you need to read a line you just lookup the positioning of the line in your index seek there and then you read the line

1447167
contains	elements
by setting references in this way each view controllers is pointed at the same arrays contains the desired elements

1447196
attributes	properties
but what i would really like is a nice big dictionary of attributes showing all of the actual systemd properties mainly .so that my nsdateformatter don t keep blowing up .when a user chooses 12 hour format even though i have forced the formatter to use en_us_posix locale and a fixed setdate format

1447200

it s perhaps a little more manual than for instances a gridview in .net but the treeview widget will do what you need and much more

1447208
pagespeed	yslow
last if you haven t looked at it one of the best tools out there is firebug and some plugins for it pagespeed and yslow

nsresponder	nstextview
i see that nscontrol subclassing nstextview which implements nsresponder - .so implements mouse events in the control and forwarding to the cell is simple

1447314
32-bit	x86
as a result .when your .app runs on a x86 machine it uses 32-bit dll

1447314
32-bit	x86
if you compiled as x86 it will use the 32-bit dll

1447376
dictionary	arrays	contains	sorted
the source for this dictionary of arrayss is an arrays contains store named sorted alphabetically

1447376
dictionary	arrays
the dictionary of arrays that s created from the source should look something like this datatype in parentheses

1447376
dictionary	arrays
a dictionary of arrays like the above structure populate the tableview and display like this

1447376
dictionary	arrays
the code i ve written that creates the dictionary of arrays ends up putting the last store white barn candle co. after every section header

zend-amf	amfphp
also i know that amf is native for coldfusion to flex communication whereas php required weborb zend-amf or amfphp for php to flex communication

1447421
environment	execution
note that you especially don t want to busy-wait in a spin loops since your browser is almost certainly execution your javascript in a single-threaded environment

1447441
arrays	loops
in fortran arrays are laid out .so that the last index varies slowest .so we nest loops in k j i order rather than i j k order to increase caching usage

1447441
if-statement	loops
avoiding if-statement inside inner loops

1447485
numeric	digits
going inorder of numeric value does give you lexicographic order on the digits

xsl-fo	xslt
i have an xml document that i am transforming with xslt into an xsl-fo document

1447554
constructor	object
is there a way to do this without turning the class into a templates class or sending some unused t object to the constructor

1447555
pointers	stack
fixed-sized arrays in c will have the slight advantage that their address is fixed after linking if global or that they live directly on stack rather than indirectly through a pointers to somewhere on the heap

1447577
double-quotes	single-quotes
use of double-quotes whereby string variables required single-quotes

1447598
calayer	uiview

as one more possibility you might consider declaring all your non-copy- constructor private or protected and creating one or more static member function-templates

1447612
zend-framework	codeigniter
from my php background codeigniter and zend-framework has query builder

1447649

i would like to know how to use session state in a simple login logout in asp.net-mvc

1447696
javascript	dom
i have found the javascript dom tests especially for the simple integration that you are describing are not that useful

1447700
udp	tcp
if you don t have a special reason to use udp you could also use tcp by specifying socket.sock_stream instead of socket.sock_dgram

the import feature can be problematic for moving a wordpress blog as you have to configure your php-ini file often because the default-value of files you can upload on a hosted php implementation tends to be too small by default

1447714
any	set
what you really want to do is use staticexample.com images instead of static.example.com images .so that you don t pick up any cookies on the example.com domain that you may have set

1447729
malloc	free
the problem that arises then is .when you have to pass allocated pointers between the dll and its hosting .app since most of the trouble with mixed runtime comes from having more than one implementation of malloc and free in a process

1447729
installation	packaging
one practice that you should follow as part of your release packaging is to use dependency walker to verify that the expected crt is used and that all other dependencies are either a systemd dll from your hosting application s installation or also include in your package

1447729
perl	lua	installation	building
.when releasing project based on lua for instances i run my final building under dependency walker from the makefile as part of the target that buildinging the installation package and use a perl scripting to inspect the log to verify that the only dlls used are either part of my install or from the systemd

1447729
perl	tcl	perl	lua	python	tcl	python	lua	python	perl	tcl	lua
given the recent rise in popularity of dynamic-languages such as lua perl tcl and python that often can be easily bound to libs implements in c it can also be greatly appreciated by those user communities if you can supply binding to those languages along with binaries compiled against the local custom for choice of crt

1447731
subclassing	base-class
table per subclassing instead of trying to shared the base-class in the database just create separate tables for each one

the filtering methods is essentially about building the where-clause in the sql query and that s a realy awkward place to be quibbling about exact types

1447767
order	join
however the left outer join need to occur in the same order as i write my query in

1447790
inno-setup	nsis
the best way to learn it is to get your hands dirty and make some install using install creating tools like wix nsis inno-setup etc

1447796
realloc	free
if realloc fails you asked for way too much memory and it couldn t allocate that much then the original memory is not free

1447805
versioning	upgrade
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 .when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloading the files and install successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1447809
spaces	output
how would i get awk to output 9 10 11 etc as some of my files have spaces in them

1447824

sorteddictionary	sortedlist
have you looked at sorteddictionary or sortedlist

1447846
csv	xml
data tabular dumper csv - dump a table directly into a csv file object with the same interface can dump to xml or ms excel files

1447846
csv	xml
csv or xml use

1447847
duplicates	sorted
as for removing duplicates i dont think sorted list handles that but you could inherited from it and add this functionality

1447864
decimal	hex
even with i conversion as the hex 0x is a longer sequences than the decimal 0 .

1447871
duplicates	lookup
the problem isn t that there are a lot of users with potential duplicates because if that were the case you could just caching the lookup

1447879
exception-handling	error-handling
i was thinking about error-handling strategy and exception-handling seemed to be right and industry standards way of report errors

1447884
stderr	stdout
you php can read and write to stdin stdout stderr

1447922
setinterval	settimeout
the difference between setinterval and settimeout is that settimeout triggers expression only once whereas setinterval keeps triggers expression again and again unless you tell it to stop

triggers	insert
i have created the following triggers for insert in the deleted user table the corresponding recording has to be deleted from the userlogin table

1447928
triggers	insert
the above triggers does not generator any error however .when i try to insert a recording in the deleted user table i notice that the recording is deleted from the userlogin table but the same is not been insert in the deleteduser table

1447930
hide	show
then after you add the segment control you can hide or show the tableview based on the state of the segment

1447933
firefox	safari
from the cursory tests it seems that some browsers firefox 3.5 and safari 4 actually put these elements into head .when creating a document tree

1447950
triggers	insert
why are you insert into deleteduser in your insert triggers on deleteduser

1447951
triggers	insert
with an after triggers the deed has been done already-- the insert-into deleteduser has already occurred .so you do not need the insert statement

1447951
triggers	insert
the use case disabling a user suggested only a single insert at a time but it s better and easier to built triggers to operate against the entire set of recording in the insert deleted metatables

1447958
device-driver	hardware
unless you re writing something like a hardware device-driver which has to be incredibly fast the overhead from setting up a stack frame and making a function-call is generally something that s trivial compared to the cost of the alternative

1447993
32-bit	16-bit
for the implementation note that the multiplying of two 16-bit int needs a 32-bit result .so temp should be 32-bit

1447993
32-bit	16-bit
al.so 32768 isn t representable in a 16-bit variables .so be aware that the compiler will make 32-bit immediates

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
also the first parameter to settimeout setinterval is expected to be a function which suffers from the same problem here as your window.onload did it call settimeout undefined 10000

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
a side note - setinterval and settimeout both allow passing strings that get eval ed at runtime but i would suggest against using that methods which looks like this

1448016
ruby	php
i want to store my database connection information in a single file which both php and ruby scripting can use

1448031
json	xml
yaml xml json a proper database â any common format will have support on both sides

1448045
export	csv
at that points i tried the tool include with mssql sql import and export wizard but the result-of the csv dump only include the column names.

1448061
value	field
the users enter simple value in the form field x and y co-ordinates measurements lot numbers

1448102
dictionary	map
java actually uses the term map as well as dictionary -- map was added later .when they realized dictionary should have been an interface but since the named was already used they had to come up with a new named.

1448110
jquery-plugins	jquery
with jquery user-interface and the scores of jquery-plugins you can create powerful user interfaces

1448121
implements	abstract
you can t easily forget to include a sprite in your subclassing since the compiler will complain if you don t implements the abstract methods

1448123
mediawiki	redmine
did you see this mediawiki integration patch for redmine

1448123
mediawiki	redmine
i know you didn t want to import but just in case someone else did here is a rake file for import mediawiki pages into redmine

1448184
contains	elements
the json has many elements if that s what they are called and each contains 3 field an int namedd id a string namedd named and a datetime namedd creationtime

1448198
contains	any
you can create a new file called jamroot in any directory contains the .lib definitions above

1448208
subtract	add
these functions add or subtract one from the index ++ means add one and -- means subtract one

1448208
positioning	slider	minimum	max
this function determines if you ve scrolled past the max numbers of slider too far down or below the minimum too far up it then sets the numbers appropriately to equals the maximum or minimum positioning

1448208
scrollto	slider
now it stops any animation .stop and call the scrollto function and tells it what slider numbers should be show at the top of the box sliderindex and how long it should take to scroll that far

1448210
multiplication	division
at least for for the x86 platform multiplication is slow division triply .so and floating-point may take ages

1448213
python	java
languages that fall into this class include at the very least java javascript and python

1448213
python	perl
python regex syntax is also based on perl 5 s with non-greedy quantifiers most of the

1448239
uploadify	.post
passing scripting data specified in the uploadify initializer as the way i was doing it was al.so causing an error - i havent worked out why and ronniesan the father of uploadify didnt seem to see anything wrong with it .so if anyone does know maybe they can respond to this .post

1448250
32-bit	64bit
unfortunately it doesn t work .when trying to register a 64bit dll from my 32-bit application

1448250
pascal	delphi	32-bit	64bit
is there any alternative to register my 64bit dll compiled with free pascal from my 32-bit application compiled in delphi

1448254
response	timeout
both of these approaches are synchronous meaning your code becomes blocked while it is awaiting a response from the server - at least until the timeout hits or an error is detected

1448257
button	popup
it works fine except .when hitting the back button on the browser it popup up the alert even if we are on the site

1448270
priority-queue	queue
this sounds like you do not want a sorted queue but a priority-queue

1448280
matplotlib	scipy
to get a matlab-like image-processing experience with python get numpy scipy matplotlib and spyder

1448334
ethernet	packets
.so the lock-free code will generally be less block-y but due to the memory allocation it isn t guaranteed to be and performance with a mutex shouldn t be all that shabby unless you have a truly huge streaming of events to process like you re writing a network drivers and the messages are incoming ethernet packets

1448339
versioning	packaging
there used to be an arch linux packaging page which stated that aegisub only supported versioning 2.9 of wxgtk and not earlier versioninging however the link i used to have here in this answer is now dead and .so i ve removed it

1448345
triggers	insert
your triggers is written assuming that there will only be one row in the insert table

1448345
triggers	insert
sql does not have row triggers like oracle does its triggers fire once for a statement and the insert deleted tables will have all the rows-affected by the statement

1448345
triggers	insert
in addition to the problems noticed by the earlier replies you need to code the triggers .so that it can handle any numbers of rows in the insert table

1448353
extends	final
since it will create source code that will be include in the final html file are there existing components within zend that i should extends from or reuse

1448355
.when	ready
during development you could do test driven development- make your developers write the test first and .when their code is verified against the test it is ready to be committed to whatever source code repository you use

1448363
32-bit	64bit
no a 32-bit process can not load a 64bit dll

1448366
button	popup
i have a button in one of my mxml components pressing which we can preview image in a popup canvas which is another mxml component

1448386
mongodb	mysql
i plan to run mysql for the normals database requrements and only use mongodb for file storage .so to be clear i dont want to use mongodb as my main database

1448388
32-bit	64bit
you will have to use a 64bit process to perform the registration as the 32-bit delphi program can t load a 64bit dll into its address spaces

1448391
arrays	map
create a map - basically a two-dimension arrays of rooms - alternatively you can make it three dimension if you need to have your character go up and down as well.

1448395
expression	evaluation
furthermore newer syslog daemons like syslog-ng allow for splitting messagess to different files by evaluation the messages against a regular expression write log strings which have railsapp_1 in them to variables log railsapp_1.log and .so on

1448407
acceptance-testing	bdd
singleton is generally a bad idea if you are doing unit-testing and its generally a bad idea not to do unit-testing or bdd or acceptance-testing

1448407
spring	guice
the ideal methods would be to use an inversion-of-control di containers spring guice etc. to request object

1448419
lgpl	gpl
lgpl libs or lesser gpl only required you to gpl your own source code if you incorporate the lgpl-ed libs in such a way that it becomes irreplaceable

1448419
freebsd	osx	freebsd	linux	linux	osx
that is why apple chose freebsd over linux as the kernel for osx

1448430
getter	setter
activerecord has setter getter methods for you

1448445

python	ruby
duplicates here and here for ruby and python

1448467
istream	std
.so my question is how can i create a std istream from this memory block typed as char

1448471
salt	md5
just use something like this pseudo code sha1 salt + time + mac-addr + another salt + some other random data crc32 or md5 would also work inestead of sha1 and store it in a database and then isvalid checked the db if the key exists

1448476
32-bit	64bit
of mysql-python says here that one of the most pernicious problems is that os x comes install with a 32-bit versioning of python but most average joes myself include probably jump to install the 64bit versioning of mysql

1448476
32-bit	64bit
remove the 64bit versioning if you have install it instructions on this fiddly task are available on .so here then downloading and install the 32-bit versioning package here

1448479
web-services	api
my software application exposes an api web-services using httplistener

1448482
python	ruby
easiest thing i could find is to create an empty python ruby project in xcode 3.1 then make copies of this project folder for every new project you work on

1448489
getter	setter
you don t need attr_accessor as getter setter are already defined for model attributes

1448506
aggregate	grouping
jdoql grouping and other aggregate queries

1448521
any	set
if you can t modify the tableadapter s timeout and assuming the procedure can t run any quicker then i don t see any option other than to set the report s datasource to the stored procedure directly

1448522
arguments	default
you may supply arguments as well default sendmail -t -i

1448539
.net	wcf

you can get a constructor from a object via the getconstructors methods

1448563
literals	hardcode
then write a separate program with hardcode literals using uxxxx where necessary to upload into the database

1448566
baud-rate	parity
definitely definitely definitely document the baud-rate parity etc

1448577
background-image	transparency
but if you have a fixed size on the thickbox you could create a background-image with that size and make it transparency using your favorite imaging application

1448595
put	get
since the dataset is more or less a 1 1 copy of your database you could in theory put an orm on top of that to get object from it - but what s the points

1448597
local-variables	nested-function
the requirement to save local-variables for each nested-function call constitutes an overhead in languages such as c which support recursion

1448597
python	ruby
in a traditional oo language such as smalltalk smalltalk is the oldest pure oo language but this also applies the recent smalltalk inspired languages such as ruby and python

1448597
smalltalk	lisp
but smalltalk isn t a modern language in many ways it s a dialect of lisp .so its heritage is 1950s even though it only arrived in the 1970s and the improvement is made to the implementation not the language

1448597
double	int
it s just that it s a lot of work and very error prone to wrangle a 12 double and int arguments in and out of a function in c

1448600
spaces	output
.so what i d like to be able to do is to change the default prompt from to either an empty string or a blank spaces and al.so prefix all output line with a hash mark #

1448603
boost-function	boost-any
but you ll find the use of type-erasure in other libs like boost-any and boost-function

1448673
decrement	increment
and the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators can indeed be defined as non-members

1448677
value	field
this page describe an in operators that can be used in gae datastore to compare a field against a list of possible matches not just a single value

1448678
plugins	add-on
they also have a lot of plugins add-on available

1448699
checkbox	button
for instances tab button are actually checkbox

1448699
radio-button	checkbox
however i required four modes of a list item simple text only with icons with a checkbox and with a radio-button a radio-button is derived from a checkbox and iradiobutton interface

1448701
variables	boolean
as for runtime turning on off you may do that with boolean variables

1448707
compact-framework	.net
the higher-level ways of playing sounds in the .net compact-framework are theoretically capable of polyphony but in practice they work horribly lots of glitches stuttering and distortion

1448712
amazon-cloudfront	amazon-s3
amazon-cloudfront works seamlessly with amazon simple storage service amazon-s3 which durably stores the original definitive versioning of your files

1448715
contains	elements
this sets wrappedset to contains the first five elements of target as a grouping

1448716
windows-server	windows
codymanix might have the answer but i m not running windows-server using windows 7 and i don t know where the setting is to test

1448734
apache	squid	http-proxy	squid
my idea is several apache process each one with different configuration listening on different addresses and or ports and a http-proxy squid or apache in the front redirecting to respective server

1448740
scripting	shebang
unix does not care about how you named your scripting it is the so-called shebang #

1448744
progress-bar	progress
however it s progress-bar display not total progress but progress for every file

1448744
progress-bar	progress
is there any easy way to modify code .so progress-bar would display total progress and not progress for every single file

1448751
value	field
however if the field consists of just two delimiter characters its value is null

1448770
delegation	dealloc
my guess it that addphoto is wired up to some button click dealloc would only be called once .when the delegation is trying to destroy

1448781
versioning	upgrade
one way to go would be to develop a single module each systemd would install it locally and decide which versioning they wanted to use and .when they would upgrade

1448782
checkbox	button
i.e. you re saying that a list item is-a checkbox while the natural state of affair is that a list item has-a checkbox and similarly for radio button

1448782
execute	declare
however this does not imply that the checkbox base-class constructor execute before the iwidgetobject s one that depends on the order in which you have declare your base if you declare iwidgetobject as the first base its constructor will execute before the other

1448783
sinatra	ramaze	ramaze	shoes
are the same unit-testing frameworks used for different web-frameworks - ruby-on-rails merb sinatra ramaze and desktop frameworks - shoes

1448785
32-bit	64bit
3 - will my application i compiled with delphi on 32-bit windows work this 64bit versioning

1448785
32-bit	64bit
the overall question of this would be as someone who is moving to windows seven 64bit will i be able to should i use this as my main delphi developpement platform or will i be better off keeping a 32-bit boot for delphi dev

1448789
constructor	object
this technique relies on the fact that statically allocated object without constructor are initializer to 0

1448804
primitive	int	contains	any
how can i convert a nsstring contains a numbers of any primitive data types int float char unsigned int etc.

1448813
instances	private
i d go with the first one since despite it being a static methods you ll have to have an instances to use it it s private and this won t be subject to the whimsy of future renamings

1448821
cucumber	testunit	integration-testing	testunit
what are other peoples experiences of cucumber and where to draw the line between writing cucumber integration-testing and testunit and or rspec based unit and functional tests

1448822
windows-xp	windows
no idea about windows 7 64bit versioning but i have been using delphi 4 5 2007 and 2009 for nearly a year now on windows-xp 64bit and given the effort microsoft spends on backwards-compatibility i don t see why things should be very different on windows 7

1448822
windows-xp	windows
windows 7 does afaik offer you a virtualized windows-xp subsystem - at no cost but you may need to downloading it separately

1448822
32-bit	16-bit
i have only ever been compiling 16-bit delphi programs on 32-bit windows versioning without problems

1448822
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
your delphi programs will run on a 32-bit layer wow64 - windows on windows 64 of windows 64bit which is close enough to the real 32-bit os that you do not need to care about it unless you work very closely with the lower systemd level

1448827
ruby-on-rails	rspec
behavior driven testing has yielded tools like rspec and it seems like right now that may be the most popular test framework in the ruby ruby-on-rails world

1448845
subclassing	superclass
that static variables in the superclass is shared effectively a singleton by all the subclassing

1448859
rapidxml	pugixml	rapidxml	tinyxml	tinyxml	pugixml
the nicest thing about pugixml is the xpath support which tinyxml and rapidxml lack

1448859
rapidxml	pugixml
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parsing i know of he had tested against versioning 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently versioning 0.42

1448859
wstring	ansi
more or less unicode-aware actually it assumes utf8-decode of the input data though it will readily work with ansi - no utf-16 for now see future work with helpers conversion functions utf-8 - utf-16 32 whatever is the default for std wstring wchar_t

1448864
contains	elements
and i want a string contains all the elements separated by a newline

1448865
gentoo	ubuntu	linux-distro	gentoo
that s entirely dependent on what linux-distro you re using -- is it fedora suse ubuntu gentoo mandrake or which other one out of the dozens out there

1448880
windows	ms-dos
this is an obsolete microsoft form dating back to ms-dos and very early windows days

1448885
cucumber	testunit
cucumber is a acceptance functional-testing framework that can use testunit rspec whatever for doing the assert

1448887
defined	declare
start at x which is the identifier being declare defined and the innermost identifier

1448909
arrays	loops
that does not return an arrays but you can use it in a loops to iterate through all matches

1448919
arrays	loops
if you have access to the 2008 wwdc talks eric postpischil gave a nice talk on basic vectorization techniques in which he walked through writing vector code to handle exactly this loops in the case where psrc and pdest are single-precision arrays on intel though for simplicity he used c with vector intrinsics instead of assembly

1448925
ostream	std
error declaration of c function â std ostream operators std ostream const meminfo â conflicts with| previous declaration â std ostream operators std ostream const speedinfo â here|

1448925
ostream	std
error declaration of c function â std ostream operators std ostream const analyzed_result â conflicts with previous declaration â std ostream operators std ostream const meminfo â here|

1448941
any	set
you could try putting quotes or some other begin and end delimiters around each of the user input and ignore any special character between a set of quotes

1448956
subclassing	superclass
in java is it possible to overrides member data in a subclassing and have that overridess versioning be the data used in a superclass s implementation

1448976
subtract	time	subtract	add
but if we do the same conceptual transformation in our head that we perform every time we add or subtract numbers we can easily rethink the above as this

1449010
arguments	default
c++0x extends sfinae to expression and together with decltype and default templates arguments for function-templatess we can write

1449020
value	field
if i execute an insert query with a stored procedure with php and the mysqli _ functions is there a way to retrieve the value of an autoincrement id field

1449022
arrays	loops
an alternative worth benchmarking may be building a branding new dst arrays with just a few powerful primitive rather than performing loops

1449028
markup	xhtml
generator html 4 or xhtml markup

1449030
oracle	mysql
why are you using an oracle connection pool with mysql

1449038
revision	svn
this has the flexibility of whatever building you re working with being able to take its cue from whatever such as the svn revision the current date and time or whatever

1449044
oracle	mysql	ms-access	oracle	ms-access	mysql
what if i want to connect to oracle mysql or even ms-access

1449052
contains	elements
the j.son being returned is an arrays the brackets contains one object the curly-braces .so you have to access the first elements of the arrays to be able to get the filename of the first file

1449057
postback	ajax
i am asking you guys with experience in web 2.0 aka ajax jquery and other client technologies no postback about performance and responsive matter

1449068
minidump	pdb
pdb s allow debugging of applications for examlple .when they crash or if you have a minidump

1449069
value	field
the value of the auto_increment field that was updates

1449080
union-all	union
union will explicit remove duplicates rows while union-all retains them

1449080
union-all	union
moreover the explicit sort operation may cause a result set collected by union to differ in sort order .when compared to union-all

1449086
sql-server	postgresql
we won t really be able to afford a sql-server license though .so we were perhaps looking into using postgresql

1449092
post-increment	pre-increment
as gumbo stated in a comment try using pre-increment instead of post-increment

1449104
instances	self
this will create a timer that is fired after 2.0 seconds and call targetmethod on self with one arguments which is a pointers to the nstimer instances

1449110
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc vs webforms standards asp.net

1449110
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms has been around longer and definitely has more coverage through tutorials but asp.net-mvc is just as capable

1449110
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is going to be leaner and meaner which is good if you are going for pure responsiveness but it s possible to do that with webforms too it just takes more work turning off viewstate sessionstate minimizing postback etc and removes some of the benefits of webforms

1449110
data-access	nhibernate
if you have already decided on using stored-procedures as your primary data-access methods you aren t going to get much of anything from any orm linq2sql linq2entities nhibernate subsonic etc

1449115
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
it may perform slower than raw ado.net call but you will greatly minimize coding and you can use stored-procedures in l2s and entity-framework and they both can work well under stress

1449115
asp.net-mvc	webforms
they are fine choices and with asp.net-mvc you have complete control over the html and no viewstate to worry about as compared to webforms

1449134
triggers	insert
insert and deleted tables are available within the triggers .so calling them from stored-procedures is a no-go

1449145
safari	opera
.so far only safari 4 and opera 10 seem to support it

1449177
overwrite	import
what i want is to have a single database dump file somewhere within my repository that would be overwrite with a current dump .when the database changes and import into the database .when i want to rollback to another versioning

1449201
calayer	uiview
in my benchmarking uiview and calayer provide about the same level of performance on the iphone

1449204
default-value	arguments
if you want to set a default-value to your arguments you can do something like this

1449204
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
keep in mind that the default-value will be set if arg1 contains any falsy value like null undefined 0 false nan or a zero-length string

1449226
javascript	dom	json	csv
if you give an id to each cell and get the data using json or simple csv and then updates all with javascript it would be faster because the browser doesn t needs to redraw the table and make new dom structures

1449228
contains	elements
afterwards the configuration files are modified to contains only a configurationsource elements with a relative-path to the corresponding configurationfragment file

1449237
contains	any
i ve looked around here and other places and everything keeps telling me about libx.a files but the fftw-3.2.2 doesn t contains any files with the .a extension

1449252
value	field
.when the value of the field is correct a checkbox image appear at the right of the field

1449256
chdir	cmd
go ahead and parsing cd and chdir like any other cmd

1449267

callback	methods
i have a methods on my client a callback methods that receives data from the server

1449335
webforms	asp.net
the approach you re looking for is some kind of databinding mechanism that bind the value of an object you may load from the db if it already exists to your asp.net webforms

1449341
average	max	average	min
if you do this then you can shift the wave to centering on the x-axis by subtract or adding the average value and determine 1 min max value which provides an amplitude and 2 x-intercepts which provides the period

1449345
synchronous	.when
on the client side the caller of the async callback contract wcf should do the right thing and behind the scenes your synchronous versioning will be called .when the data arrives on your end

i d like to see the .source and building structure of a large project oss or whatever .so that i can see how modularity is best handled in such an environment

1449425
scala	java	groovy	java	groovy	scala
the context of my question is that i want to start a large jvm project and i m currently thinking of choosing a java groovy mix or a scala groovy mix

1449425
groovy	scala
i don t want to go with the scala groovy mix unless i m going in the functional directions because i don t like scala for oo programming a completely different topic

1449434

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in ie 7 8 opera the 100 height of the tags is interpreter as 100 of the page where as in firefox google-chrome safari the entire table takes up the entire height of the page and instead the table rows fill in the remaining spaces that they are given

1449472
selected	checkbox
i m looking for a sensible way how to styles selected boxes checkbox and or radiobuttons with css

1449490
salt	md5
should i md5 the current timestamp and salt it or will php s uniqueid function be sufficient enough

1449495
exception-handling	try-catch
right now i m creating the table inside a try-catch block and if that throw an exception-handling i know the table has been created

1449504
hash	md5
to clarify confusion created by my naivety consistent with the comments made below md5 like most useful hash by their nature are not injective .so their output is not guaranteed to be unique for all input

1449504
hash-collision	key	required	checked
if hash-collision are an issue in this case they are using this technique will required checked after hashing whether an identical key has already been generator

1449511

it contains no compile-time information about what it holds and will return the size of a pointers 4 on 32-bit 8 on 64bit .when queried with sizeof

1449511
strcpy	memcpy
the only way you can fill arrays is by using strcpy memcpy or similar manual copy

1449515
.when	ready
i ofcourse could handle the event which is triggers .when my listener hears that the job is ready and re-schedule the job but i was wondering if there isn t any standards functionality for this

1449529
perl	lua	python	lua	python	perl	python	java
and even if you do need to write your own for .some rea.son you should use a safe language python java lua c# perl .something .so that if you make a trivial error count characters you don t end up with a big security hole in your program

1449543
any	set
the set volume cmd part of standards additions allows you to set the volume to any value between 0 and 100

1449545

yet .when i option+click common symbols like cgrect or cgpoint i get

1449550
selected	button
linked to the selected edit button

1449552
haskell	ocaml
ghc is a large project written in haskell and of course the ocaml compiler etc. are written in ocaml

1449566
distutils	buildout
to make it easier i created a distutils package that you can easy_install and or include in buildout

1449575
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera

1449607
pointers	stack
just make sure you don t return pointers to data on stack

1449620
boolean	int
in particular i m unsure how best to convert an nsdictionary which might hold int strings boolean or all of the above into a format that i can then pass on to python as keyword arguments

1449636
sql-server	mysql
here s wishing some future versioning of mysql gets something like sql-server s row_number function.

1449642
scheme	lisp
i came from a heavy java background with lighter amounts of c++ and also some lisp scheme as you have - i ve been doing iphone application development full time since the sdk release

1449644
exception-handling	try-catch
implements specific exception-handling for each violated pre-condition would could encourage the caller to use the try-catch pattern around the methods call what is in contradiction with the philosophy of the design-by-contract

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
to see what i mean look at in both firefox and google-chrome

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
the difficult panels in question is title systemd construction area - the teal colored border in firefox sprays itself everywhere whereas in google-chrome it display properly

1449660
google-chrome	safari
things work fine in google-chrome or safari there is no spaces with no some spaces with 1 more spaces with 2 etc..

1449664
font-size	height
the size of the br elements depends on the font-size line height

1449673
ruby	php
try a little php and ruby while you re at it

1449684
linked-list	arrays
btw i don t know whether your task allows it but using a linked-list instead of an arrays might make your life easier regarding managing the list as might using types int for backptr frontptr midptr and current

1449693
priority-queue	queue
and you want to create a priority-queue that order the elements based on the priority field items with greater priority stay in the front of the queue you can use the following

1449702
defined	declare
and to answer your finale question to defined a properties or instances variables simply declare it in your .h file as a variables inside the braces

1449720
webforms	asp.net
i started off with using asp.net webforms model but this has meant that some of my code is in class libs .dlls and some in page code-behind

1449740
.war	jar	packaging	building
the lifecycle binding for .war packaging are listed in the introduction to the building lifecycle see the default lifecycle binding - packaging ejb ejb3 jar par rar .war section

1449748
csla	wcf
i m writing an .app in csla and want to log ip addresses but only if the client is calling a remote data portal such as the wcf one

1449751
contains	any
a typical fact table in a-star schema contains foreign key references to all dimension tables .so usually there wouldn t be any need for custom join conditional - they are determined automatically from foreign key references

1449758
assign	add
if the use of s to assign to other variables is separated from where s is initializer by more than a couple lines-of-code you open the possibility that someone else will come along and add code later that alters the value of s between its uses or somehow branches around the original assignment to s

1449771
getter-setter	setter	getter-setter	getter	getter	setter
properties is the way of telling that you are going to write getter and setter kind of enforcing it but you can write getter-setter without setting them properties

1449771
getter	setter
synthesis will in actual implements getter and setter if you dont synthesis but you have set them properties you have to implements those getter and setter by your hand

1449783
copy-constructor	temporary	temporary	copy
.when you call a function with a parameter pass-by-value the compiler will make a temporary copy of it calling the copy-constructor

1449783
temporary	copy
and if you return from a function by value the compiler will again make a temporary copy of it

1449786
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s painful i know but the sheer amount of hackery to make webforms ape asp.net-mvc concepts is overwhelming to say the least

1449789
windows-vista	windows-xp	32-bit	64bit
- i encountered the same issue with cuda 2.2 and 2.3 under .net 3.5 sp1 on windows-vista 64bit + geforce 8800 and on windows-xp 32-bit + quadro fx not sure which numbers . br

1449809
attributes	properties
since the email table is but one of several entities related to a domain model class say user the ideal is to create a user domain model class and use the validation application block attributes to validation properties

1449820
xsd	xml
have you properly referenced the xsd in your xml file

1449875
json	xml
i took the database example because it was the first that crossed my mind but scenarios like representing the unit in xml or json are equally likely

1449876
row	col
if you access both a 0 col nrows + row and a col row then you re violating the inner restrict .so things might break

1449897
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have a methods in a uiviewcontroller of my iphone application inside a uinavigationcontroller that is called whenever a row is selected in the table in the viewcontroller s view

1449910
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it s legal to retain an nsstring as in this example but it is often considered good practice to use copy instead of retain since an might actually points to an nsmutablestring object which may later change .when your code expects it to stay the same.

1449910
getter	setter
declaring a setter and getter methods in the class s interface and

1449910
getter	setter
indicating how the setter and getter behave

1449910
any	set
the common retain keyword indicates that the object retains any value that s set and release previous value as they re let go

1449910
getter	setter
with the dot notation you re calling the setter or getter if there s no afterwards and these two line are the same

1449910
getter	setter
they can still use the getter and setter to access it if you declare a properties for it

1449910
getter	setter
now .when you get around to actually implementss your class synthesize says something like make sure the getter and setter get implementss for this property. it does not say implements both of these for me because the compiler is polite enough to checked for your own implementsation first and only fill in the pieces you ve missed

1449910
getter	setter
you don t have to use synthesize at all even if you use properties out the wazoo -- you could always just provide your implementation for your setter and getter if you re into that sort of thing

1449910
getter	setter
the points here is to understand that a properties declaration is really just about declaring a setter and getter methods which usually corresponds to an actual instances variables -- but not always

1449927
row	col
is accessing elements through a 0 col nrows + row undefined

1449933
spaces	output
this spaces fills the field if the output is undersized note it does not cope with over-sized field

1449945
revision	updates
simply make this a scripting which updates your file with the proper versioning numbers as it is being committed the revision numbers is passed to your scripting as it s run

1449953
value	field
listening for a keypress doesn t seem to work either as this event is fired before the field s value is updates with the new letter .so i m not sure if there s a good way to get the current value of the field using a keypress handler inorder to copy it over to the other field

1449975
checkbox	button
i had previously thought the implementation was for the add button to function almost as a checkbox with on and off

1449981
value	field
yet for some reason i cannot either add an elements to the form initializer in this action nor can i populate the value of an existing field with any value

1449982
getter	setter
as you are using the shortcut for properties you can only access the properties through their setter and getter

1449985
radscheduler	telerik
i m trying to utilize the radscheduler component from telerik for a public facing website and do not want a user to be able to edit the details of the events on the calendar but would like them to be able to double click on the event to see the details

1449987
any	set
unfortunately the low-level entry-point you can set by ld s -e option is a bit too low-level the dynamic loader is not available .so you cannot call any proper libs functions

1449992
groovy	java
and css design is best done in another tool more suited to the purpose just as intellij is to java and things groovy

1450023
order	add
the problem is that i have to create many vertices and add them in between one another for order

1450027
carbon	cocoa
is qt cocoa or carbon based

1450029
linux	unix
there may be difference among different implementation of sql and there may even be some cruftier versioning of the unix linux fnmatch globbing libs that would make a difference if you tried to rely on such claims

1450037
php-gettext	poedit
i have created a language file in poedit for the use of the php-gettext function now on the page i am trying to test it on i cannot get it to find load the .po or .mo file i created does anyone see what i am doing wrong

1450038
rabbitmq	activemq
i ve looked into rabbitmq and activemq but i m thinking that there is a better solution for my use case

1450074
division	modulo
divide by 10 the modulo is your next digits repeat until the result-of division is 0

1450115
value	field
it works by keeping a counter of all occurrences of each value in the second field and the line which have that value then it printing out the line that have counters greater than 1

1450118
gearman	worker
gearman is good in that it optional allows you to synchronized multiple jobs execute on multiple worker

1450118
execution	jobs
the latter is better-suited to async jobs and the former gives you more flexibility .when you d like to block on job execution

1450122
configuration	environment
catalyst plugins configloader has code to help you with site-specific configuration in the form of the myapp_config_local_suffix environment variables

1450125
environment	building
this is a situation that is all too common in a startup environment -- coders banging away furiously on a project without deciding what it is they re building

1450129
google-chrome	safari
in every browser but safari and google-chrome the third box is 200

1450129
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome it is almost the width of my screens

1450137
any	set
you can then set category to any set you want using something like

1450141
perl	awk	python	perl
as mjv surmised - awk or perl or python is a better choice

1450141
value	field
also mjv commented that there could be memory problems with solution such as this one if the input is huge because it keeps a recording of each distinct field 2 value in the associativity arrays assoc

1450153
codeigniter	drupal
wordpress codeigniter drupal etc..

1450156
duplicates	contains
at this points the standards output contains a list of duplicates second field one per line

1450168
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
in java asp.net-mvc it appears that servlets are mapped with the url-pattern in the deployment-descriptor web.xml but the file-extension and url-pattern doesn t appear to be very flexible

1450175
contains	any
for the most part i turn any question about how to delete from a list the items that i don t want into how to create a new list contains just the items i want

1450180
widget	button
.so often in many user interfaces hitting the tab button will change the focus from one text widget to another

1450195
inspector	webkit
google-chrome s dom inspector confirm that this is a webkit issue

1450198
onkeydown	onkeyup
you may also want to look at onkeyup and onkeydown events

1450208
constructor	object
one way could be a recursive algorithm without a base case another common one is creating object a and b that create one of each other in the their constructor etc

1450212
linux	unix
for example in unix linux programming using ncurses one would normally link dynamically to the ncurses or nncurses libs

1450212
python	perl
you see this in things like the apache webserver it only tries to load the mod_rewrite module if the configuration file include references to it and in perl and python loading .so .

1450212
installation	packaging
usually you ll just dynamically link your applications and document the resulting dependencies and perhaps provide installation scripting or packaging as appropriate to your supported targets

1450220
cucumber	selenium
it may be possible to replicate unit tests in their entirety with cucumber but it would be painful and crazy slow to execute especially if you re using selenium

1450220
ruby-on-rails	rspec
the best time to write tests is .when you re developing code and the quickiest and easiest way to do that is by using in the built-in ruby-on-rails testing and maybe some additional help such as shoulda rspec also i m a huge fan of factory-girl

1450226
freebsd	linux
there may be major difference between how linux implements ld-linux and how the linkages are done under open.solaris freebsd and .so on

1450248
command-prompt	command-line
now initialy i thought this would cause a problem as admin is running the process .so why would the createwindows ... output in the user desktop .so i tried with a simple command-line test.exe .app and .when launchd as admin the command-prompt windows .appeared - .so why does that work fine where-as the createwindows ... doesn t display correctly

1450254
hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
if i tell it to hide one elements and the show it again it will simply ignore the cmd because the final result will be the same as do nothing.

1450257
fflush	stdout
after your final printing statement you could probably call fflush stdout

1450257
fflush	stdout
to fflush stdout to the screens

1450258
fflush	stdout
you need to fflush stdout

1450258
fflush	stdout
fflush stdout should do it added after the printing

1450259
fflush	stdout
try flushing fflush stdout after each printing input

1450281
buffering	streaming
by default input output is buffering i.e the input and output bytes are stored in a byte arrays before being display to the streaming

1450281
buffering	streaming	fflush	stdout
fflush stdout causes the buffering data to be fflush to output streaming which in this case is stdout

1450306
superclass	inherited
i have the id annotations field as part of my mappedsuperclass and i am letting all my entities extends the mappedsuperclass.now how do i overrides the superclass id if i have to defined a composite primary key for my entity...ie.how do i ask my entity to use its composite primary key annotations as embeddedid instead of the id annotations field inherited from the mappedsuperclass

1450311
duplicates	contains	value	field
printing copies of the first and all subsequent line which contains duplicates value in the second field

1450311
value	field
from there we simply keep tracking of the first line we see with a unique value in the second field and a flag indicating whether we ve printed this one before

1450311
dictionary	arrays
it should be obvious that this can be done in any scripting or programming language which support for associativity arrays hash dictionary tables whatever your preferred language call them

1450318
multiplying	addition
why should generics be able to do addition .when it isn t obvious how to add or multiplying

1450341
dictionary	arrays
if you are using python 3.x it does not work anymore because locals are optimized as an arrays at runtime instead of using a dictionary

1450341
dictionary	arrays
.when python detection the execute statement it will force python to switching local-storage from arrays to dictionary

1450341
dictionary	arrays
dictionary but an arrays whose

1450350
core-location	mapkit
you should get the coordinate from core-location instead of mapkit

1450368
cvs	git	version-control	git	version-control	cvs	perforce	git	perforce	cvs
version-control systemd like cvs subversion mercurial git perforce etc

1450369
any	set
on the other hand if you re using a more dynamic-languages like python for instances you can pretty much set up unit tests with hardly any knowledge of unit-testing by making a few testxxx methods with the unittest module

1450370
arrays	loops
selected all the events which occur on dates on or between the start and end of the active week put the results in an arrays then loops through the days in the week and checked whether events in the arrays take place on the active day

1450373
value	field
what i mean by data-aware widget is that the widget themselves know that they re linked directly to database field .so you would have a combobox that knows that it s backed by an enum and fetches the possible value directly from the database at runtime just like you suggested

1450373
order	add
.so you have to add a new column to the table to specify .sort order if you go with the quickest methods or a new table to specify each field s order index to their field id

1450380
superclass	inherited
.so don t inherited from your entity superclass in this case use another entity superclass

1450380
superclass	inherited
well again don t inherited from the entity superclass that holds these field and use another entity superclass

1450400
onchange	onkeyup
assign the function onkeyup and onchange to the textarea you want to reflect each other

1450416
shopping-cart	cart
remember that a properties doesn t have to have an underlying instances variables â for example the totalprice properties in a shopping-cart class might dynamically sum the prices of all the items in the cart

1450417
postgresql	mysql	sequences	unique
in ruby-on-rails model the object id represents the unique id from database which never can be 0 i speak for mysql maybe there are exception-handling with sequences and serials in postgresql

1450434
contains	elements
forms are block level elements .so they are semantics correct for contains other elements

1450439
any	set
random set of characters if any

1450445
cairo	gtk	glib	gtk
i have gcc install in c programfiles also set as a path variables and i have all the necessary files for gtk from glib gtk pango atk and cairo

1450457
put	get
i need to make a down down list in the item add page but i can not find a good way to get all of the value from another table into an arrays to put into the page

1450487
authentication	login
i don t have much clue how login authentication and that stuff works since i always used asp.net membership

1450489
webforms	asp.net
as my application is also a web form asp.net application than is how i have to do it because i cannot use constructor-injection on webforms either

1450513
contains	elements
the json has many elements if that s what they are called - they mimic the item class and each contains 3 field an int namedd id a string namedd named and a datetime namedd creationtime

1450522
contains	any
if named contains any non-acceptable characters then display error messages

1450532
directory	folder
if you have directory level security set perhaps only certain roles can access a specific folder in the web application that will work etc

1450533
oracle	mysql
sadly this unit behaves differently .when it has its oracle day compared to its mysql day

1450536
content-length	content-type
i would use httpwebrequest to get the headers then checked the content-type and that the content-length is non-zero

1450557
streamreader	streamwriter
do you know about textreader and textwriter and their descendents streamreader and streamwriter

1450560
jquery-plugins	jquery
you are better off using something like jquery and the jquery-plugins and achieve the effects you want with more control and spaces for customization

1450579
onresume	onpause
you could save all the value you need into the preferences inside the onpause of each of the activities then restore it in the onresume

1450608
exponentiation	mod	exponentiation	modulo
my problem is to compute g x mod p quickly in javascript where is exponentiation mod is the modulo

1450608
multiplication	exponentiation
the obvious idea of using square-and-multiply exponentiation by squaring is too slow for 2048-bit numbers it needs up to 4096 multiplication

1450608
multiplication	exponentiation
updates by doing some extra preparations precomputing a few hundred powers as recommended by the article mentioned in outis answer below it is possible do to a 2048-bit modular exponentiation using only at most 354 modular multiplication

1450608
google-chrome	firefox
the traditional square-and-multiply methods is much slower it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications. doing .so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factors of 6 in firefox 3.0 and by a factors of 4 in google-chrome

1450612
lighttpd	apache
if i plan to have a numbers of other dynamic-content that may time some to execute involving images and the like would i be better advised to hosts it with say nginx over lighttpd or apache using fastcgi mod_wsgi etc

1450633
contains	any
if your scripting does not contains any or you don t need a cdata section anyway

1450675
create-table	alter-table
it is possible to generator with fluent-nhibernate schema export statements with alter-table instead create-table

1450692
libjpeg	libpng
images libjpeg libpng libgif

1450692
zlib	libz
compression libz zlib libgzip libbz2

1450694
entity-framework	data-access
i would say using dtos and wrapping the entity-framework with your own data-access methods and business layer is a great way to go

1450705
callback	methods
it send the ping goes to the callback methods

1450705
callback	methods
the callback methods keeps running and keeps generator a timeout exception.

1450708
order	add
if new vertices are added at an index determined by some linear order then add all the elementss to a std map or std multi_map o log n per elements o n log n total then copy that to a vector

1450730
json	xml
yaml works with java and json in 3 to modernize dwr i too smoothly loosening xml towards more natural yaml

1450735
http	ssl
also keep in mind that sending passwd over http without ssl is very insecure especially in public networks like wlan hotspots

1450748
constructor	private	instances	private
this all works fine .when the code is built as part of a standards iphone application but .when it is separated into a static libs these files don t make it into the final application binary and .so the constructor for the private class instances they contains don t get run and this causes problems

1450748
instances	private
the solution was quite straightforward just use __declspec force_export on the private class instances and all is well

python	java
this rules out almost all modern languages including python but also java c# etc etc since almost all of them rely on dynamic memory handling and garbage-collection of some kind or other

1452532
python	java
if you re programming for an embedded device which you expect to be produced and .sold in huge numbers every bit of rom may add measurably to the overall costs .so you want a language focused on squeezing the application down to the last possible bit -- any language that relies on a rich supporting runtime environment or operating systemd including python and again al.so java c# etc etc would no doubt force you to spend extra on many more bits of rom consider threaded-interpretive languages like good old forth they can make a substantial application s code be measurably more compact than straightforward machine-code would

1452532
python	java
- rather than java python c# and .so on

1452532
python	java
of course there are excellent rea.sons most modern languages python java c# etc choose to do dynamic-memory-allocation garbage-collection and .so forth despite the importance of application niches where those techniques are a negative aspects essentially if you can possibly afford such nice memory handling writing applications becomes much much easier and a whole class of problems and bugs connect with the need to carefully manage memory if you lack such support can go away -- programmer productivity really .soars.

1452532
python	java
note that despite the common misconception that interpreted-language ones with a rich underlying runtime or viewmodel like java c# python etc are slow in fact for most cpu-intensive applications such as scientific computation python is perfectly suitable as long as the rich supporting runtime environment numpy is factored in

1452533
scp	ssh
.when you bring up your ec2 instances you can use scp winscp to transfer the files then ssh to configure your server and database

1452546
interpreter	runtime
nearly every language developed in the last 10-20 years has some kind of runtime support usually in the form of a bytecode interpreter or virtual-machine

1452546
python	ruby	python	java
the points is i would say there are very few things you can do in java c# ruby etc. that you couldn t do in python

1452553
postgresql	mysql
the standards open source dbs mysql postgresql even sqlite are not far behind

1452566
python	perl
well the short answer is since you mentioned perl anything you could built-in perl you could built-in python

1452568
scala	java
i m writing a java application using struts 2 but now i d like to make it a hybrid java scala project instead

1452568
haskell	scala
i don t have much experience with scala but i learned haskell years ago at college -- i really liked the functional programmed paradigms but of course in class we were only given problems that were supremely suited to a functional solution

1452568
scala	java
in the real world i think some code is better suited to an imperative styles and i want to continue using java for that i know scala supports imperative syntax but i m not ready to go in the directions of a pure scala project just yet

1452568
scala	java
in a hybrid project how does one decide what to code in java and what to code in scala

1452574
contains	any
to prevent becoming a malware distributor i would suggest making hard and fast rules upon how media is served that contains any sort of client-side scripting

1452574
external	embed
my recommendation is to never embed client-side code directly into a browser but always reference some external file

1452576
blender	maya
most of the 3d package these days such as maya softimage houdini realflow blender etc

1452591
spaces	output
i ve been able to preserve white spaces in the output by replacing spaces chars with a non-breaking spaces however .when export to pdf leading white spaces is not preserve on line that do not begin with a visible character

1452592
firefox	safari
firefox required 2 click in the windows to make it work safari doesn t work at all

1452603
constructor	object
constructing a page object by calling it s constructor does not invoke the page lifecycle

1452635
fckeditor	wysiwyg
to be clear i m not looking for a wysiwyg html-editor like fckeditor or the telerik r.a.d controls editor

1452644
value	field
ok i have a database full of value with one field value for prospects and another for clients.

1452656
tokenize	parsing
you want to tokenize your input text and then parsing your tokens

1452669
hash	md5
hence once i apply these byte arrays to the md5 hasher i get distinctly different hash value

1452669
hash	md5
if i reverse the c# byte arrays before putting it through the md5 hasher i get the same hash generator by sql

1452670
python	perl
no deployment step like python perl etc

1452670
codeigniter	kohana
kohana it s like a more modern versioning of the more popular codeigniter

1452676
python	php	python	java
you ve already tagged your question with java php python and ruby-on-rails .so researching and learning more about those tools would probably help to answer your question

1452689
virtualization	virtualbox
the winxp virtualization can most likely improve invaluable on pro and ultimate for testing differnet building although it s easily circumvented with something like virtual-pc or virtualbox

1452691
object-reference	instances
ruby-on-rails msb4018 system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object. r

1452705
arrays	loops
what you want is two arrayss and one loops iterate over each arrays once adding the results

1452710
python	c++
i am trying to find any rtsp streaming libs for python or c++

1452710
python	c++
how much easy or difficult it is to implements rtsp in python or c++ and where to get started

1452721
cout	cin
i ve been told by others that writing using namespace std in code is wrong and that i should use std cout and std cin directly instead

1452728
arrays	loops
changing the arrays from a method-local instances to a class instances that is only allocated once but then initializing in a method-local loops eliminated the scalability problem

1452738
versioning	upgrade
but one day you upgrade to a new versioning of foo 2.0 which now offers a function called quux

1452739
ruby-on-rails	django
where django or ruby-on-rails or any other asp.net-mvc framework for that matter isn t going to be rapid is the learning curve .when you first come to developing on them

1452739
ruby-on-rails	django
django and ruby-on-rails have quite a bit of seperation-of-concerns and if you re not used to that sort of environment it takes a while to learn the framework

1452770
enterprise	platform
i am using windows-server 2003 x64 enterprise with sp2 and i want to install platform sdk

1452775
abstract-class	subclassing
as for how the ast deals with this a parenthesisexpression is a expression .so it can be represented as a subclassing or an implementation of if expression is an interface abstract-class of .sorts

1452827
callback	methods
and i need to be able to pass this methods to another class for callback purposes

1452836
multiplication	bit-shift
however any compiler worth its salt will optimize 2 or any multiplication by a power of 2 to a left bit-shift .when a bit-shift would be faster

1452851
lotus	ibm
there is a product by ibm called lotus forms server that include a component called webforms server that rendering xfdl in html yet also runs all of the application logic that may be embedded in the form by making ajax call back to the server as needed and occasionally round-tripping if necessary

1452862
user-interface	drawing	transparency	frame
while you can have a big textures with every little decoration for your user-interface windows frame button etc you re gonna have a harder time to use a single textures for different enemies because they might not even appear on the screens at the same time or you might be unable to draw them one after the other because of the back-to-front drawing scheme necessary for transparency

1452881
plugins	add-on
wether you call it add-on plugins or extra peices of code that is connect with the original software later it really doesn t matter

1452883
python	c++
is there a way to get python functionality in c++ code something like

1452888
children	nodes
in my codes item.element named will get its children nodes named s value value is that right

1452898
feedback	in-app
there are plenty of other ways to give feedback to the user and plenty of ways to handle in-app purchases and i highly recommend doing some mockups of methods that could not potentially confuse the user

1452903
contains	any
have a dynamic way to load a dll containss the plugins types that implementss your interface for instances have a configurable folder location to test whether any dlls in that folder contains any typess that implements your interface and dynamically load any that do

1452920
has-many-through	associations
i m having problems adding to a has-many-through associations using user_ids

1452952
value	field
selected the applicationnamed filtering and add value to like to include only the connections you have indicated ie using myportal in the like field will only include events for connections that have that application named

1452956
perl	ruby	perl	awk	python	ruby	python	perl
.so what about taking ifconfig in the default mode and cherry-pick the specific info you want in a scripting python perl ruby awk bash+sed+... whatever floats your boat

1452959
order	add
you can add order and another has_many since you really care about the return date

1452960
directory	folder
...and write your import_conf.rb to do more complex conf management like placing a specific configurationuration file in some directory besides home or handling a configuration folder like .ssh .subversion etc

1452971
triggers	insert
the easiest approach might be with a triggers on insert

1452971
triggers	insert
on mysql side the triggers logic would delete all but 4 most recent or whatever criterion you desire recordinging prior to insert the new recording

1452971
triggers	insert
the triggers could be made after insert instead and this would avoid the possibility of deleting some recording unnecessarily if the new recording was a duplicates

1453007
subset	unique
the subset of pricetypes for these classes are totally unique from each - measured prices are 1 to 6 ndi prices are 7 to 15 and extracost prices are 16 to 22

1453013
semantics	keyword
to get the other semantics to have explicit entries winning such conflicts pass award_dict as the sole positional arg before the keyword ones and bereft of the form -- etc etc

1453027
32-bit	64bit
it sounds like you may have a 64bit building of imagick which you re trying to run on a 32-bit only cpu

1453031
selected	textbox
which is better to selected textbox

1453047
children	nodes
note that i ve chosen to use nil as the root nodes and have not bothered keeping empty lists to signify no children

1453059
dictionary	arrays
like i said both the arrays and dictionary are mutable and allocated

1453063
emacs	vim
i can totally understand why someone not already familiar with emacs wouldn t want to use viper-mode but as someone coming from vim you really have the opportunity to get the best of both worlds

1453063
emacs	vim
in general get used to the fact that viper-mode isn t perfect learn how to do the things you re missing from it the emacs way and make sure you explore the cool features that emacs has that aren t available in vim

1453066
scala	java
99 of java code can be expressed in scala

1453066
scala	java
your scala code can call your java code and your java code can call your scala code

1453066
scala	java
if you want to do the latter i suggest defining the interface in java and then just implements it in scala

1453066
scala	java
otherwise calling scala code from java can get a little ugly.

1453066
scala	java
your scala code can call java libs

1453066
scala	java
.so pretty much any parts you could write in java you could al.so write in scala

1453066
scala	java	haskell	scala
if you re familiar with java and have learned haskell in the past i suggest treating scala as a better java

1453066
scala	java
fundamentally scala compiles to jvm-bytecode that is very very similar to what java output

1453066
scala	java
the only difference is that scala is more productive it produces more bytecode per line of code than java does

1453066
haskell	scala
scala has a lot of things in common with haskell first-class-functions for-comprehension are like haskell s do-notation limited type-inference but it s also very different it s not lazy-evaluation by default it s not pure

1453066
scala	java	haskell	scala
.so you can use .some of your insights from haskell to inspire your scala styles but under the hood it s all java bytecode

1453070
row	col
then accessing the arrays will be made according to this boolean row col or col row

1453079
command-prompt	cmd
is there any way i can run sybase sql cmd from command-prompt

1453082
access-control	authentication
typically if you can identify the source of a request positively it acts as a form of authentication which can lead to access-control

1453085
telnet	tcp
currently the application works by having the server listen on a straight forwarding tcp socket and the users can use a telnet client to connect

1453085
telnet	ssh
the only options that came to mind for that are telnet and ssh

1453085
telnet	ssh
as far as i know there s no way to increase security using a standards telnet client .so that leaves ssh

1453094
droppable	draggable
its composed out of many handy helpers functions like making object draggable droppable resizable sortable etc

1453095
base	zero
also the use of zero is also popular with pointers arithmetics where you would use one base pointers points at some allocated memory plus a second pointers which would be at an offset from this base pointers

1453095
base	zero
here using the value zero makes a lot of sense to points the offset to the base of the memory block

1453106
contains	set
i have an input string that could only contains a given set of defined characters

1453109
winmerge	ignore
2 if you scan your tree with an external comparison tool like winmerge you can teach it to ignore .svn directory entirely

1453109
winmerge	svn
checked for any evolutions with winmerge and copy the new versioning of files to your .svn-filled tree your svn workspace

1453130
handler	service
security because you can examine incoming request an http module can perform custom authentication or other security checked before the requested page xml web service or handler is called

1453131
constructor	object
that is the object doesn t officially become an instances of derived1 until the constructor derived1 derived1 begins

1453138
web-services	api
api key are just one way of authentication users of web-services

1453141
constructor	object
you can t call virtual methods from the constructor or to be more precise you can call them but you ll end up calling the member function from the class currently being construct . the problem is that the derived object does not yet exist at that moment

1453156
windows-mobile	windows-ce
if you are targetting a windows-ce device and not windows-mobile then each device has it s own specific sdk

1453156
windows-mobile	windows-ce
don t mix windows-ce and windows-mobile

1453156
windows-mobile	windows-ce
windows-mobile 5-6.5 is based on windows-ce 5.0 but has a standards sdk different sdk s for different versioning of the windows-mobile at use

1453157
temporary	copy
if you want to increase performance you can copy a full line into a temporary arrays and the full matching column into another then copy them back

1453180
ms-access	mysql
i m working on a project atm and i need to import data that is stored in a ms-access database to mysql

1453180
ms-access	mysql
for mysql i m using phpmyadmin on a ubuntu machine i have another windows machine where i can access the access db from in ms-access 2003 i can t find an option to convert the data to mysql

1453187
derived-class	base-class
that will not work as the derived-class does not yet exist .when the base-class constructor is execute

1453208
dictionary	arrays
if you need to keep the order as well use additional data structure arrays or list along with the dictionary

1453213
key-value	key
this is because the implementation uses the hashcode of the key object to insert key-value pairs into buckets and the value are usually stored in the buckets in the order they are insert

1453216
.net	wcf
wcf- if it is .net to .net like it sounds like it is then you should use wcf with tcpbinding

1453259
sip	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtsp	sip
they have a lots of libs and modules for implements rtp and rtsp as well as sip into your c and c++ programs

1453285
blacklist	whitelist
i came across these terms called whitelist data and blacklist data i tried to find out on google but couldn t

1453286
click	mouse
just to be clear i know how to get a merged pkcs#12 from the key chaining by export both the private-key and certificate together but i want to remove all the extra mouse click and typing if i can

1453287
any	set
in any case using the + symbols to encode a spaces is not valid url-encoding but specific to a limited set of protocols and probably widely supported for backwards-compatibility reasons

1453290
getter	setter
provide a getter but not the setter

1453292
version-control	git
this format is very efficient one of more efficient if not most efficient version-control systemd formats making git repositories smalles or one of smallest among different version-control systemd

1453311
blacklist	whitelist
a spam filtering would be a good example - you have a whitelist of people you re willing to receive email from without checked for spam and a blacklist of known spammers whose email get automatically deleted

1453327
font-size	width
for example if i have a field nvarchar 5 named idclient and the font-size is 13 i want to create a textbox with a width enough to write 5 chars

1453333
duplicates	contains
i have a vector contains few non-adjacent duplicates

1453333
duplicates	elements
i am trying to make this vector unique by removing the non-adjacent duplicates and maintaining the order of elements

1453338
blacklist	whitelist
greylist items may be reviewed or further tested for inclusion in a blacklist or whitelist

1453350
administration	account
i think for administration account like mycorp george the account should have no privileges authentication and authentication limitation issues

1453380
duplicates	lookup	duplicates	elements
the complexity is o n .log n as the lookup for duplicates elements uses the set not the vector

1453407
contains	any
an iframe just contains an html content like any other html page

1453412
temporary	copy
note how the fact that the gui module only knows where each value lives expressed as an offset allows us to provide the dialog function with a temporary on-stack copy

1453413
value	field
created new date field to prepend the locate date-format string to the list of value it tries to use

1453415
fontfamily	font-size
how can i set the fontfamily and font-size for the application in app.xaml

1453419
assign	add
basically you add a table in your database to manage user groupinging and assign grouping permissions to those groupinging

1453424
quirks-mode	doctype
stuff about-box model deleted as david dorward mentions this is caused by quirks-mode and moving the styles down past the doctype causes the slider to behave sensibly

1453443
python	java
jpython runs the emulates c python in a java jvm

1453477
executable	jar
on many systemd the jar will be double-click-able and .so act as an executable

1453483
value	field
during insert the value for that field is null and the null gets insert

1453483
value	field	addition	division
i do some arithmetic manipulation like addition multipilcation division using that field s value

1453483
value	field
don t the db support default-value for the field like int decimal may not be for string types as null is valid for string if their insert value is null

1453483
value	field
the value that gets insert into that decimal field is the result-of avg mysql function

1453486
boolean	int
this was necessary in c as it had no true boolean types it just relied on the interpretation of other value like int where 0 is false and non-zero is true or pointers where null is false

1453512
binary	hex	decimal	hex
reflector comes up with some source which would compile to the same binary code - it doesn t know whether you used a hex literals or a decimal one etc

1453512
decimal	hex
you can change the numbers format it uses under view options disassembly forcing it to hex or decimal or leaving it to decide

1453551
authentication	login	authentication	logout	logout	login
authentication user login logout

1453561
any	set
these value should fall within a general area of any profile-esque picture if you want to be fancy carry weight with these value and develop a types of game tree that would be able to search hundreds of thousands of images quickly finding where this image falls in the tree within an age-specific set of value

1453566
value	field
i thought the value of the priviledge field was already a list but it seems it works in a different way

1453572
getter	setter
i understand that a javabeans is defined as a class that contains mainly getter and setter for its properties

1453588
common-lisp	scheme
i am familiar with common-lisp and trying to learn .some scheme .so i have been trying to understand how i d use scheme for things i usually code in common-lisp

1453615
exception-handling	error-handling
i looked over to the line that cause exception-handling it s the error-handling function of .ajax

1453616
administration	account
if in a workgroup unless you change it all remote access by administration account is disabled they are treated as guests

1453616
authentication	login
if you are auditting account login events checked the security event-log to see the login that should have happened if the user was authentication

1453625
daemons	systemd	launchd	daemons
maybe you can configure your helpers application as a windows service unix daemons launchd it automatically on systemd startup

1453630
cout	cin
however if i often use cout and cin i write using std cout

1453630
cout	cin
i think that noone sane will ever named a streaming cout or cin

1453632
common-lisp	scheme
in scheme functions are not tied to symbols like they are in common-lisp

1453632
common-lisp	scheme
there is no direct way in portable scheme to achieve what your example code wants to do as symbols in scheme are simply kind of unified strings lacking common-lisp s value function plist slots

1453651
caldav	vcard	caldav	webdav
it s like caldav but stores the contact resources in vcard files and makes them accessible using extensions to webdav

1453656
response	timeout
the connection comes up but the server fails to respond - i m not clear on the details of this but i d expect the javascript to eventually timeout because no response was received and return a failure based on that

1453669
value	field
and if the gui-class want to change a field like email in the customer it send a hasmap with the key and value to change

1453670
styledtext	swt
i m using styledtext widget in my swt .app

1453670
append	input
swt by default append input methods submenu to the end of existing context menu

1453713
paraview	vtk
to see some of what vtk can do i recommend checked out paraview

1453713
paraview	vtk
paraview building usable application around vtk .so you can immediately visualize data by coupling various vtk components together

1453713
paraview	vtk
i would recommend some small scale experiments using either paraview or the python vtk binding to see if you can create a reasonable visualization of your simulation

1453716
firefox	safari
one webpage all works in firefox and safari but ie throw an error on debugging on line of jquery

1453739
keyboard	mouse
then you can control exactly how each mouse and keyboard integration behaves

1453740
json	xml
asp.net-mvc is a good alternative .when it comes to generator rest xml and json feed

1453747
between	sql-in
is there any way to selected the numbers int that are include between two numbers with sql-in oracle

1453760
value	field
use each value in the first table to selected recording from table childdata with several field about individual children including which school they attend schoolname

1453760
basic	vba
please be aware that i know very little about either vba or sql and am pretty much starting from scratch therefore even the most basic explanations would be very helpful

1453765
ubuntu	linux
the server will be linux likely ubuntu

1453773
put	get
how would you start the query looking for tags starting with the letter f for example extraction them and put them in the dropdownlistfor and also get the url from the url field at the same time ofcourse

1453780
getter	setter
make the readonly getter bindable and dispatcher the corresponding event from the original setter methods

1453782
textbox	button
on a button click i want to copy all the contents of the textbox

1453787
access-control	authentication
the first would be an access-control list acl and then second would be authentication

1453793
seam	jsf
seam has a jsf tag that allows page-fragment caching

1453815
subclassing	superclass
.when superclass variables is used to refer subclassing .obj then compiler first searches the similar methods in the superclass if not found gives error

1453839
.when	ready
i ve set up teamcity to notify the whole team .when a new internal release is ready

1453839
teamcity	msbuild
the folder is generator by msbuild using teamcity s build.number properties

1453847
base-class	inherited
in java every class you construct inherited from the base-class object

1453858
variables	boolean
the g_debuggingging boolean variables is a package variables that can be default to false and set to true .when debugging output is required

1453883
webforms	asp.net
it s a somewhat broad question and for that i apologise however i am struggling to get to grips with an approach for turning an overly complex read poorly designed asp.net webforms application into something more maintainable

1453890
forms-authentication	credentials
asp.net forms-authentication can redirect users to the login page if they do not have the credentials to access a specific page

1453913
duplicates	contains
contains null value or duplicates

1453914
order	add
add an orderid column to the pizzas table and make it a foreign key to the id column in the order table

1453917
value	field
depending on the field required value i might validation it on each key press and disable the ok button if it s invalid

1453918
web-config	app-config
if i have a web application with its own web-config and a .dll it uses happens to have its own app-config which settings file wins .when there is a conflict

1453926
value	field
i m trying to use jquery to combine the user s selected field choices category + contributors and insert this into a hidden-field with an id of as_q but .when i run the scripting the value of as_q is always empty

1453926
value	field
at the moment i call the function .when the user click submit - it gets the value of the two selected field and combines them before assign them to the as_q field - at least that s my logic

1453930
expression-blend	wpf
c program files expression-blend 3 systemthemes wpf

1453938
webforms	asp.net
the site is mix of html and asp.net webforms

1453952
os.path	sys
even though response probably vary depending on your field web programming science etc. i feel that some modules are commonly needed math sys re os os.path logging â and maybe collections struct â

1453958
selected	textbox
and then a form which has selected textbox to show the information in the object

1453962
handler	service
whether this handler belongs in the business layer - i guess it belongs in whatever project contains your service class - the one that inherited from windowsservice

1453968
subclassing	base-class
this uses the activerecord function becomes to do an up-cast of all subclassing of thing to the thing base-class

1453970
updating	updates
but updating the client does not cascade and execute the updates of contact persons

alternatively you could use aspx to store the value of the username field somewhere else on the page

1455797
margins	padding
i can t be sure but an elements probably had padding and margins properties set to some large numbers and browser didn t provide scrollbar but instead just removed the margins and padding from the elements

1455808
multiplying	subtract
the rest just involves multiplying current price by 1.00 - discount 100.0 or subtract

1455811
numeric	digits
its probably easier to use a very simple lexer that returns tokens like alpha one or more alphabetic chars numeric one or more digits or whitespaces one or more spaces or tab and have the parsing assemble them appropriately and you end up with rules like

1455832
configuration	installation
you can run .app engine .apps on top of .appscale which in turn does run on eucalyptus xen and other clustering solutions you can deploy on ubuntu not sure about there being any windows support -- looks like it may required substantial systemd installation configuration and administration work to get started sorry no first-hand experience yet but once you ve done that investment it .appears it may be smoother going forwarding

1455949
double	int
for simple types int double string datetime use attributes

1455964

1456064
value	field
.so far i have a form set up like i like it but no value are bound b c i need to switching between tables i could probably just add all of the field from the first table to the second table but half of the points of me doing this myself was learning

1456077
compatibility	legacy
i am using the nusoap .lib with a cakephp .app for legacy compatibility reasons i was just wondering if it was totally necessary to create an instances of nusoap_server i can t figure out any obvious reason for doing this .when i can just output any data formatted as xml nilly willy without creating a server instances - is it perhaps just for debugging purposes

1456081
any	set
you will not get any performance improvements with this setting if cascade is set to all because hibernate would still load each child entity to checked for further associations

1456200
jlayeredpane	jviewport	jlayeredpane	jscrollpane	jscrollpane	jviewport
well this is pretty much a guess because you haven t provided much information but it sounds to me like the jlayeredpane s preferred size is 0 0 and the white you re seeing is the background of the jscrollpane s jviewport child

1456213
repository	entity
i would like if i could avoid getting the related contact entity for the customer in my repository because some views only need the customer data not the contact data

1456228

this means that in the end this conflict manager does not allow any conflict like the strict conflict manager except that it follows a best effort strategy to try to find a set of compatible modules according to the versioning constraints

1456241
children	nodes
then in this function you process the current nodes s properties as needed and then recurse into children if they are present

1456243

you should solve that issue in javascript or in application code either setting a default-value if the user doesn t give one or else returning them to the form and telling them that they can t proceed without giving a value for required field

1456251
value	field
is it possible in a sharepoint 2007 list moss though i don t think that this is enterprise edition to allow users in one sharepoint grouping to edit value in some field and users in another grouping to edit value in the other field

triggers	insert
that said the choice between a triggers and another methods depends entirely on the need for the action in question to happen no matter how the data is updates deleted or insert

triggers	insert
first the triggers fires once for each batch-file .so whether you insert one recording or 100 000 recordinging the triggers only fires once

1456284
triggers	insert
this is why it is critical to write all triggers as if you are going to insert updates or delete a million rows

1456287
pecl	pear
there used to be a sax parsing in php i think it has now been move to pear or pecl

1456440
os.path	shutil
therefore i d say the modules os and os.path are probably the most important and also mention globbing fnmatch and shutil

1456719
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java
in terms of productivity there is a level .when terseness can help python and ruby are considered more productive than java c# because they are more terse and then there is a level where terseness makes the code very hard to read apl is famo.us for that as well as short perl scripting

1456785
ironpython	ironruby
but others such as ironpython ironruby delphi-prism etc are also relevant

1456785
default-parameters	lambda
the more of a corner case it is the more interesting it will be - things like removing members are pretty self-evident but subtle integration between method-overloading optional default-parameters lambda type-inference and conversion operators can be very surprising at time

1456788
unique	words
i was wondering if some one enters a words into a database from a php form how can you count how many people have entered that same words in the database as well as how not to create a whole unique id for that same words just a count for that same words .when the user enters the same words

network-interface	ethernet	network-interface	packets	ethernet	packets
this sits practically on top of the nic network-interface card and you have absolute control of what goes in or comes out of the nic before anything else - right down to the ethernet packets level

1457515
cassini	iis
you can always create a website or webapplication that runs through cassini instead and provide a folder path vs a iis path

1457518
base	zero
zero crossing won t work because a typical sound has harmonics and zero-crossings much more than the base frequency

1457547
attr	src
i have the following scripting and i can t find out how to use the value inside car 0 img inside this #img2 attr src car 0 img

jtapi	tapi
and or they may support standards call-control protocols sip and or apis jtapi tapi ccxml and if they do do it more-or-less well

1457550
jtapi	tapi
higher level a voicexml ccxml engine or a tapi or a jtapi engine

1457550
jtapi	tapi
you write xml or use the tapi and jtapi apis

1457550
ivr	pbx
can you narrow down what any potential pbx ivr or pbx combo means

1457566
callback	methods
.so the question is where along this chaining of events your delay is occurring - in main the service constructor or the onstart callback methods

1457577
children	tree
findcontrol only searches in the immediate children technically to the next namingcontainer not the entire control tree

1457585
dictionary	arrays
javascript has separate datatypes for arrays and dictionary a fancy term for key-value stores like associativity arrays

1457585
dictionary	arrays
arrayss are either defined through the arrays constructor as you did or through square brackets while dictionary are defined with curly-braces

1457586
fuzzyfinder	nerdtree
i use a combinations of nerdtree directory sidebar fuzzyfinder textmate go-to-file like textmate s cmd+t and sessions h sessions to help me deal with large project

1457612
contains	elements
.so if it had five elements before after your call to cvi_instant.add it now contains only four the first nodes is gone and nodess 1â 4 have move down to positioning 0â 3

1457634
directory	folder
it says that you have to create a folder with your test-case m-files in it then make that your working directory using cd

1457639
display	width
try the following with a common width for the labels used to display the header text

1457658
lookup	any
before i tried to load for any handle the searchhistories that matched the logic but don t know how using the include logic you posted .so in the mean time i think a reverse lookup would be a not .so dirty .solution

1457669
constructor	private
the dealer class has a private car pointers that is initializer to a dynamic arrays in the dealer s constructor

1457675
arguments	default
try adding some additional tracing to the constructor destructor to verify that the constructor you think are being called actually are - it appears that dealer should be invoking the constructor with a default arguments you specified but if not it is getting the default-constructor

1457676
any	set
set ... ... then it works .so i m not really having any concurrency error

1457692
mouseover	mouseout
it ll give you greater control of the behavior of the mouseover mouseout events by configuration

1457694
revision	updates
note that different folder or even files can be at different revision numbers in your working copy depending upon how you updates

1457703
associations	model
it gets more complex .when you look at the model code - provided you have foreign key set up correctly in the database the generator model code should completely handle associations management as well

1457717
subtract	add
to do it around a points you have to subtract the centering value first making that reference points the centering origin then apply the matrix and add the original centering positioning back

1457731
object-reference	instances
it does object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1457740
selected	button
i got 3 buttons-links triggers some javascript code with indication if certain button is selected selected button got styles attributes set to

1457740
selected	button
button brown selected

1457740
selected	button
only one button can be selected at one time each of button got different unique id my question is how using jquery access certain button to modify it s styles attr

1457747
value	field
your ccc labels field must be assign a value before you try to modify the .text properties

1457750
carbon	cocoa
like dtw and nuskooler we are using wxwidgets on mac carbon cocoa linux 32 64 windows 32 64 and all works fine

1457756
json	xml
is it bad to store json directly instead of xml or should i store the xml and introduce an xml parsing

1457766
hide	show
the best way to accomplish the effect that you are looking for would be to arrange hide show any object that you don t want to be visible in a fullscreenevent.full_screen event handler

1457777
cryptography	security
any time you choose to use two-way encryption in your application you are taking on a much heavier cryptography burden to maintain the same level of security

1457782
unpivot	pivot
microsoft sql-server supports pivot and unpivot as extensions to standards sql

1457782
unpivot	pivot
i don t know of any other branding of rdbms that supports built-in pivot unpivot functionality

1457792
arrays	map
because you called map on the arrays of selected options you ve now got an arrays of value using the map methods

1457804
perl	php
i m running usr bin perl or usr bin php via an nstask and want to retrieve the http-headers of the program

1457804
perl	php
i ve been through the documentation on nstask and the manpage for php and perl and haven t seen any way to force the output of http-headers

1457809
double-quotes	single-quotes
.when i run bash -x myscripting.sh i see that it adds single-quotes around the entire flag while maintaining the double-quotes causing the perl scripting to error

1457833
webforms	asp.net
is this set in the web-config still like traditional asp.net webforms

1457849
google-chrome	safari
.when an html elements is focused currently selected tabbed in to many browsers at least safari and google-chrome will put a blue border around it

1457854
double-quotes	spaces
with the value as you re giving them no spaces no specials those double-quotes are totally useless and it would do absolutely no difference to omit them

1457863
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
what is the difference between noclassdeffounderror and classnotfoundexception

1457866
arrays	loops
also the elements that are not filled in are populate to the errorelements arrays which you can loops through and add any warning notifications

1457870
document	editing
if using mono s mdoc documentation systemd you can document namespace members by editing the ns- .xml documentation files

1457874
perl	php
thus you can set up the initial environment of your perl or php subprocess but you can t read what environment it has later and you certainly cannot view what environment it had .when it exited

1457874
perl	php
you need to make the perl or php scripting output its environment in some format and read that into your cocoa process through a pipe

1457876
contains	lookup
finaly another improvement could be to introduce a separate lookup table contains the most common abbreviations of given namedd pete for peter jack for john bill for william etc and to use this for search purposes the named columns used for providing the display value would remain as provided in the source data but the extra lookup normalize at the level of the search would increase recall

1457877
configuration	environment
to overcome this go to project_path configuration environment development.rb and add this line

1457879
required	checked
there is no compile-time checked to see that all the required classes exist .so any problems with finding the desired classes will appear at runtime

1457893
filtering	sorting
fwiw i find that code more difficult to understand than a simple call to datatable.select which also allows filtering as well as sorting by parent or child tables if needed

1457900
subtract	addition
instead i had to subtract the lower value from the initial addition to compensate

1457916
vbscript	vb.net
my .app bundles a set of vbscript utf8 text files into a vb.net assembly

1457930
cout	cin
however i don t understand why you still want the cout to go ahead - if the cin call didn t succeed you will only be printing the old contents of the string - you do not clear it anywhere unless you do .so in other code which you haven t posted here

1457933
margins	padding
try messing with the margins padding on the ul and give layout to the lis possibly

1457935
bison	yacc
the problem with grouping them like that is that you lose the precedences on the ruless -- you only have one rules that has different precedence depending on which mathop it is which bison yacc cannot handle

1457959
folder	dir
i have a numbers of gifs in a folder on my webserver dir subdirectories bla.gif etc

1457960
json	xml
difference between using xml and json are

1457960
json	xml
extreme portability interoperability - not everything can read json natively whereas pretty much any language framework these days has xml libs

1457960
json	xml
now please notice the common thread any of the benefits of using pure xml listed above are 100 lost immediately as soon as you store json as xml payload

1457960
json	xml
if wide interoperability is an issue and you talk to something that can t read json like a db that can read xml natively use xml

1457960
json	xml
never ever use json as xml payload unless you must use xml as a transport containers due to existing protocols needs and the cost of encoding and decoding json to from xml is somehow prohibitively high as compared to network storage lossage due to double encoding i have a major trouble imagining a plausible scenario like this but who knows...

1457964
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
in short a noclassdeffounderror is usually throw on new statements or methods invocations that load a previously absent class as opposed to the string-based loading of classes for classnotfoundexception .when the classloader is unable to find or load the class definition s

1457993
arrays	loops
how to loops through an arrays using plain ol javascript

1458002
contains	any
one of the strange aspects is that the flat-file contains other columns with data in the same format mm dd yyyy that map to datetime columns but those don t seem to cause any errors

1458032
silverlight	wpf
here is another way to do it in wpf - using the visualstatemanager - that will also work in silverlight

1458050
entity	pojo
it s a big deal for me because entity interface part of api visible to users and implementation pojo mapped in hibernate are two different classes and implementation is not available to user at compile-time

1458056
exception-handling	try-catch
for an example of a procedure templates that uses t-sql try-catch blocks and properly handles transactional see exception-handling and nested transactional

1458062
textbox	button
my first thought which i am attempting now is to have a button next to the tags edit and .when you click on it it turns the link into a textbox where you can edit autocomplete and hit enter to commit

1458072
order	join
similar comments apply to join order too

1458072
order	join
the order of the join should not matter - for join of the same types

1458072
order	join
the process order may be forced to some extent if you are dealing with a chaining of join

1458073
order	join
the order of the join on the other hand still matter to a greater extent

1458073
order	join
edit do see jonathan s leffler s response for he provides additional detail in particular regarding the order of join

1458088
implements	abstract
matlab will tell me both are of types b and if i call the abstract methods from a that both implements foo it execute essentially two copies of b

1458088
put	get
i know that i can put them in a cell-array and get 90 of what i need

1458090
click	mouse
the only issue with low-level mouse hooks is that they don t receive double click per se - which means you have to query the registry for the doubleclickpeed and then checked for two mousedown events within that interval before triggers a double click

1458097
listboxitem	selected
my listboxitem expands .when selected

1458097
listboxitem	selected
.when i selected a listboxitem it expands but other two listboxitem s in same row also expand to the same height of selecteded one

1458098
constructor	object
for example if i have an object that takes an implementation of filenamefilter in its constructor how can i make a defensive copy of it .when all i know about it is that it implements filenamefilter

1458111
32-bit	64bit
simply uncomment the right typedef depending on whether you are running against a 32-bit or 64bit binary

1458131
spaces	output
how can i eliminate all but one of the spaces or tabs between the columns .so the output looks like this

1458148
python	ruby
c# has linq smalltalk has roe and glorp python has sqlalchemy and sqlobject and django in python has quite a bit of query power built into its orm see simon willi.son s notes ruby has activerecord and .so on

1458150
arrays	map
you would create an arrays then use parallels map to map do_suff across that arrays

1458166
wmv	3gp	h.264	mp4
iam writing an application which will do conversion from avi to mpeg wmv to avi wmv to mpeg or h.264 avc video avi to mp4 rmvb to 3gp etc

1458167
selected	button
project edit target settings general tab + button add any targets that are prerequisites to building the selected target

perl	php
you might have to prefix your output with the http header built by you based on the raw output from your perl or php scripting

1458175
fclose	fread	fclose	fopen	fopen	fread
which means no need for fopen + multiple fread + fclose

1458194

1458235
project-management	project
in project-management all the extra possible things like company goal project-planning project monitor estimation timesheet booking defect tracking etc can be covered

1458240
notepad++	komodo
i ve heard people reference komodo intellij-idea as good solutions but i ve always just used notepad++

1458244
authentication	login
maybe what s causing it to ask for login again is an authentication checked and you have an issue on some roles related code

1458246
markup	xhtml
.when xhtml strict is considered to be a proper markup that works across all platform my webpage that s in xhtml-1.0-strict does rendering differently in quirks-mode

1458246
contains	elements
the original markup contains nested divs with floated elements

1458276
display	width
.when the viewportwidth 1 the whole image is display .so it will be a fractions of the total width of the image

1458277
default	reset
in such a case converting to the other class and then converting back would likely cause those properties to be lost reset to their default value

1458277
subclassing	superclass
you could set the subclassing to be superior to the superclass see discussion above such that concatenation object of the two classes will always cause the superclass object to be converted to the subclassing

1458286
attributes	properties
however one of my favorite uses of reflection is to find properties that have been marked with attributes

1458286
attributes	properties
for example i ve written attributes that mark which properties in my classes should be indexed using lucene

1458295
reflection	runtime
reflection is just a way of investigating object during runtime

1458300
mstest	mbunit
i like it but it seems that unlike mstest or mbunit etc.

1458303
jquery	.post
to .post form-data one would need to use jquery s serialization function

1458304
panels	grid
use a list box and edit the templates to be a grid horizontal stack panels with borders etc

1458310
radio-button	selected
.when you submit the form and the controllers s methods is called asp.net-mvc will set the browser parameter to the value of the selected radio-button s value

1458319
selected	button
right-click the project selected add existing item and in the dialog drop down the add button and selected add as link

1458332
silverlight	wpf
i ve been very happily using the mvvm mvvm pattern in wpf and silverlight apps in combinations with c#

1458332
ironpython	ironruby
what are your thoughts on using ironpython or ironruby at the viewmodel and model layer in mvvm apps compared to c#

1458346
any	set
set this to false and any form thus marked won t steal no focus no more

1458356
javascript	dom
after you ve gained a bit of javascript dom knowledge try to take it apart step by step

1458400
linked-list	arrays
it could also be made more flexible by using a linked-list instead of a fixed arrays and could be modified to not assume each column only contains a single words as long as the columns are delimited by a specific character

1458403
httphandler	httpmodule
generally i would say an httphandler and turning off the httpmodule you don t need should be a very effective solution

1458417
subtract	division
the clever parts seems to be that they are only using the division operation for the first digits a1 and avoid having to use the other a x s in the same way by applying them in the next step by subtract their product against the partials quotient from the interim remainder

1458417
digits	zero	digits	base	base	zero
that this can validly be done and that it always works is probably due to the fact that the digits base 100 in this case aren t real digits and can legitimately assume value both greater than their base over 100 and even less than zero

1458417
subtraction	division
this allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each digits to the operation like for instances deferring the application of the secondary digitss of the divisor a x 1 until after a partials quotient is created from the prior step s division by a 1 which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction rather than a division operation

1458419
click	mouse
the mouse could not click on the top of the page

1458423
value	field
nb i want to use hidden field to pass value from 1 page to another

1458429
jeditable	jquery
editable jquery jeditable i ve used it recently in my project as such and with slight modification to work with pagemethods

1458448
terminal	prompt
you might want to use httpd.exe -x which will run apache as a single process without giving back terminal cmd prompt control

1458452
worldwind	jogl
there is a large and active jogl community in nasa worldwind - a very neat jogl based .app

1458479
.net	wcf

add appropriate versioninging of that string for each versioning 2.2.1 etc and platform simulator or iphoneos

1458564
windows-xp	windows
.when i execute my soft in windows-xp and sql-server is install at the same windows it runs very fast it takes up to 3 seconds to selected and fill report

1458579
hide	show
basically i was changing a class on a parent elements to hide some elementss and show others

1458593
subtraction	addition
with 16 byte alignment it can be used directly with simd load instructions where you d load it up into a 128bit registers that allows addition subtraction dot product and all manner of vector operations

1458596
environment	execution
these specifications ed package are automatically exported by the equinox system.bundle depending on the execution environment level you are at j2se-1.3 j2se-1.4 etc.

1458599
constructor	object
it s because you re trying to call virtual methods on an object before the constructor is done execution

1458614
arrays	loops
then you need to loops over the arrays and do the manual filtering

1458615
background-position	background-image
simple hack for it is to create two class for all snipped object one common for all with background-image and the second one with background-position

1458627
hide	show
it seems that the simplest way to do that is to create two uitableview for each purpose and show hide them according to segmented control value

1458644
connection-pooling	pool
by default connection-pooling is used and the connection will be returned to the pool .so that it can be reused the next time you need a connection to the db

1458662
contains	any
.so if a1 a10 contains the int 1 to 10 i d like to plot a decimal numbers like 3.5 without having to add any new rows to the worksheet

1458673
semantics	keyword
that it does not improve performance and that it instead gives different semantics to the methods since it allows to change the reference and that you should only use the ref keyword .when it is indeed necessary that the methods can change the reference

1458692
ref	out
.when i see a methods with ref or out parameters i expect them to either completely change the instances passed in or that the methods initializer the passed in object s respectively

1458729
credentials	security
i seem to remember the reason that you can t overdraw the login windows is purely for security if you could someone nasty could trick you into typing their credentials into their dodgy screensaver which would be a very bad thing

1458744
callback	methods
i am looking for a methods where i can make sure that no callback is waiting to be execute on a system.timers.timer thread after i have called stop on it

1458750
jvisualvm	jstat
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1458751
entity-relationship	diagram
if you re using mysql then mysql-workbench will create entity-relationship diagram from a database

1458760
callback	methods
if i were not using the throw methods then i can use the callback methods however its not available after a throw

1458761
sql-server	mysql
it depends on the database branding for example the sql management studio has a means to generator a graphical representation of sql-server databases mysql-workbench will do it for mysql and .so on

1458761
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
among the paid generics alternatives i ve liked ems tools which has a versioning for sql-server mysql postgresql and firebird and dezign which supports 12 databases

1458765
python	c++
the situation is that i have a dynamic libs written in c++ that is wrapped for python by another dynamic libs also written in c++ generator by sip to be specific

1458773
contains	elements
this block elements can contains links

1458788
export	csv
i need to export all data from a database into a text or csv file from mssql server2000

1458812
assign	add
think about a methods with just 2 parameters assign int entityid int someotherid and let the client figure it out how to add more items

1458884
implements	extends
back2dos has mentioned the approach you should use what i did was extends the movieclip class and implements all kinds of functions that i use on daily basis but are not part of the movieclip class

1458885
dictionary	map
why not go with a dictionary map types whatever java call it nowadays i think it used to be hashtable

1458896
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd would have been much more popular if it wasn t for all those pirated windows versioning that are roaming around

1458902
scheme	let
named all your classes ids with a consistent and obvious naming scheme but don t go naming everything you can let smaller object that are children to be unnamedd object if they are all identical

1458906
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in firefox and google-chrome it order the first column .when click by url not the content of the link

1458909
arrays	loops
in earlier versioning you would just have to loops through the arrays yourself

1458921
specifications	w3c
see the w3c specifications for more info

1458942
javascript	dom
javascript makes things tricky .so if you need any i d try to keep javascript out of css s way - make sure than any modifications that javascript makes to the dom are consistent with your api - don t hardcode specific layout overrides into the javascript

1458942
javascript	dom
the dom is a manageable interface javascript is quite a bit more complex

1458963
bazaar	git
maybe it helps but bazaar and mercurial are both using dulwich for their git interoperability

1458963
command-line	cmd
the other might just be a wrapper around git s cmd .so it could be simpler to use from a high level points of view commit add delete it probably means their api is very close to git s command-line .so you ll need to gain experience with git

1458964
command-line	cmd
run it from the command-line start run cmd

1458994
internet-explorer	firefox
the easiest way to install your ca certificate for the current user is to navigate to your target url in internet-explorer must be ie not firefox- firefox has its own cert store ignore any cert warnings it gives you

1459006
binary	hex
i m searching for a python compatible methods in c# to convert hex to binary

1459009
nhibernate-validator	xval
i have an asp.net-mvc project working with nhibernate and nhibernate-validator and i d like to use xval 1.0 most recent release

1459021
contains	set
i have found out that if i set the scoping to provided then i can building a jar that contains exactly what i don t want but i cannot figure out how to get inverse behavior of that

1459026
pointers	stack
the bytes variables is a function-parameter in dumpbytes in this case a pointers you get a new pointers copy-paste from the passed pointers but it is still a new one with his own address in stack .so taking its address is going to be different every time unless it is called from the same place and stack addresses result in the same by pure coincidence

1459050
binary	hex
but it s very easy to convert hex to binary byte by byte well nibble by nibble actually

1459062
pointers	stack
but that is not what you are printing you are printing out the address where this-pointers is located the address on stack where the pointers is passed

1459080
python	java
updates can you tell me how is this done in python or java

1459099
python	c++
it is implements as a python extension module native-code that wrap the popular wxwindows cross platform gui libs which is written in c++

1459111
solution-explorer	csproj
in visual-studio 2008 team edition versioning 9.0 with .net 3.5 sp1 .when i copy and paste references from one csproj to another with the context menu in the solution-explorer view i get the following error

1459135
boolean	int
but i also need to send int boolean and floats with json and can not find a way to do this in the same way

1459140
contains	set
an smtp messages contains a set of headers such as from to cc subject and a whole range of other stuff

1459155
treeset	treemap
for a start the treeset and treemap in the runtime are red-black-tree implementation

1459157
contains	any
deny any compressed files that contains compressed files

1459157
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
deny any compressed files that contains files over a set size or the size can not be determined at startup

1459162
contains	any
in fact any commit range will do as long as it contains that commit

1459203
contains	any
also note that despite being resident in the javax.swing.tree package this class does not contains any user-interface code

1459216
windows-xp	windows

however at this points this process is running on the server under the credentialss of the network service and providing the network service credentialss to the remote machine where the stuff is that you need to complete the process will result in permission-denied because .when the network service credentials goes over the wire it becomes the machine account .so even if we did give the machine account access to the re.souce it is still not what you want

now i can defined on every properties against what it should be validation for a regex length etc... and i get the messages on client side via xval on server side via nhibernate-validator

1459923
salt	md5
decode the passwd yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1459923
hash	md5
although md5 is a hash and should not be decodable it can be broken using rainbow tables with probability almost one you can find a unique here s the probability string of at most say 20 characters with a given hash especially if your character set is limited say to alphanumeric

1459925

i work in asp.net webforms and the way to do that as you probably know is putting the event named in the asp.net control and calling a particular procedure

1460986
webforms	asp.net	ruby-on-rails	django	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know django is a very different framework because it s asp.net-mvc but i have taken a quick view to a ruby-on-rails tutorial and i think i ve seen they use something similar to asp.net webforms if i ve understood correctly something like embedding ruby code in the html interface and declaring an action there which i suppose call the respective function something like this

1460986
webforms	asp.net
... action action1 ... which call a function def action1 in the controllers similar only in that sense to asp.net but webforms doesnt rendering a view with the named of the function among other things

1461045

floating	padding
you usually lose the list decorations to the overflow of a div .when your ul ol and li don t have enough padding or you are floating elements or display inline

what you ve done is show the sheet and then not pushed a new loops .so the os just show the sheet sees there s no rea.son to keep it running and thus shuts it down and resumes execution on the next line

1461150
put	get
under this scenario the put would succeed on the server return a 200 but the client would get an application json representation

1461376
32-bit	64bit
my problem is that excel is a 32-bit .app hosting a .net dll and according to processmonitor the excel process is loading the oraclient10g_home1 oracle client at c oracle product 10.2.0 client_1 bin oci.dll which h.appens to be the 64bit client and that gives me a badimageformatexception .when my .net code tries to use it

1461389

1461662
getter	setter
the points of getter and setter regardless of language is to hide the underlying variables

1461662
value	field
this allows you to add verification logic .when attempting to set a value - for example if you had a field for a birth date you might only want to allow setting that field to some time in the past

1461662
getter	setter
this cannot be enforced if the field is publicly accessible and modifyable - you need the getter and setter

1461662
getter	setter
writing the getter and setter now means the interface is kept consistent .so existing code won t break .when you change it

1461669
associations	model
it model a ternary associations

1461671
getter	setter
consider how you would access public data without getter and setter

add a div inside your div width height 100 no margins no padding and put your content there

1462809
nsmutablearray	nsarray
an nsmutablearray already conforms to the nsarray interface and that s what most will deal with

1462811
hide	show
if you hide reshow the windows after calling setwindowslong it then show in the taskbar

1462840
any	set
does any one have any idea why this isn t working or have any ideas on how i might set the resolution to nothing

1462843
postfix-notation	operands
i have a computer program that reads in an arrays of chars that operands and operators written in postfix-notation

1462847
exception-handling	try-catch
i m using the code below and occasionally boolupdate is not true or false and i get an exception-handling i can t surround this with a try-catch block as it is using return how can i catch this correctly

1462851
date-difference	difference
if i were you and if i were using xslt 1.0 i would use the exslt date functions to get the current date and then use date-difference to determine the time difference between the two dates

1462854
any	set
only one row can have this column set to 1 at any one time

1462881
show	next
the first example is more readable as it show exactly where the error occurs the exception-handling bit is right next to the line which will cause the exception-handling

1462887
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
.so nullreferenceexception argumentnullexception and the like shouldn t be caught unless they re due to a nasty api which .sometimes throw exception-handling which you can handle but which shouldn t really be being throw in the first place

1462919
google-chrome	firefox
in case this matters i tried the form in various browsers ie8 ie7 ie6 firefox 3.5 google-chrome with similar results each time

1462939
json	xml
why not just have it respond with json or xml which contains the new url

1462948
csv	xml
i found this scripting which parsing a csv file to xml

1462974
bash	zsh
to delete them with some bash zsh magic

1462976
dependency-injection	inject
the value of the setting can then be inject using an inversion-of-control or dependency-injection containers .so the consumers of the weather class don t need to explicit supply the value from .somewhere as it s handled by the containers

1462986
directory	folder
unfortunately itunes won t tell you where its downloading folder is .so i ve written a function that grabs the filepath of a few podcast tracking and climbs backup the directory tree until it finds the downloadinging directory

1463018
ubuntu	linux
i have a large several gb berkeley-db that i am thinking of migrating from windows 2k to linux either redhat or ubuntu

1463033
wait	hang
wait for the hang

1463052
overwrite	import
if i use php s extraction function to import a variables from an arrays will a variables with the same named be overwrite

1463080
contains	any
examples any contains

1463096
32-bit	64bit
my only other suggestion is that often dependency walker is useful in these sorts of situations in particular if you are running this vb6 application on a 64bit os then pay attention to whether or not comdlg32.ocx has all of its dependencies present as 32-bit libs

1463110
debugging	trace
its a small microsoft sysinternals tool that capture all trace debugging statements written on the machine its running on without having to attach a debuggingger

1463142
firefox	opera
is it possible to rotate text by 90â clockwise or counterclockwise using only css and compatible with ie6+ firefox 2 and opera

1463182
javascript	dom
we re calling the code by a remote javascript file that inject a few dom elements

1463191
identifier	temporary
and there s no way to do the same for a temporary without binding it to an identifier at which points it s no different from an auto variables

1463219
row	col
if the data starts at col 1 row 2 if the cell 2 1 has an empty value the methods fails

1463220
contains	any
typically if your view controllers containss outlets properties or raw variables that contains the iboutlet keyword you should use the viewdidunload methods to relinquish ownership of those outlets or any other view-related data that you no longer need

1463221
document	editing
however there is one against - i haven t found a .solution to quickly load many child windowss each time the windows is created and maximize to fill the parent s area there is an animation of resizing which takes a lot of time .so far thus i m considering switching back to tabbed interface which required .some more work i need to embed a form to the page sheet as there are many kinds of forms available .some for editing text document .some for other object .

1463242
json	xml
i have also seem recommendations for implements complex mapping or xml json styles storage retrieval of user defined field

1463255
cucumber	webrat
how would you test multi-user integration with cucumber webrat

1463266
sql-server	oracle
if i recall correctly weblogic ships with drivers for oracle sybase and perhaps sql-server but you have to add any others that you need

1463267
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this only works in firefox safari google-chrome but not ie - please help

1463277
perl	php
to make it more easily portable i would like to somehow compile the scripting and the include d libs it into a single php scripting in the same way that ack include all its perl dependencies in one file

1463285
spring	guice
this is true for guice spring picocontainer and all di frameworks

1463293
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
i m curious to know what are the performance impacts of using http basic auth on a webserver like apache or lighttpd or nginx

1463310
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the page works perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome and safari with not speed issues sluggishness whatsoever

1463312
continuous-integration	nant	continuous-integration	build-process	build-process	nant
the reason we wanted to go down this path was because we are using cruisecontrol.net as our continuous-integration server and we have a nant scripting that we use to perform both the build-process and the deployment process

1463312
web-config	app-config
.when the zips are unpackaged in the production-environment we have to remove all the web-config app-config etc from the zips and if we have new entries in the configuration they are made manually

1463339
contains	set
if the set contains standards items you will not be messing around with hash-function as that has been done for you

1463339
contains	set
if the set contains custom classes you have to implements hashcode to use hashset although effective-java show how but if you use a treeset you have to make it comparable or supply a comparator

1463339
treeset	treemap
i have .sometimes used treeset or actually treemap for very small sets maps 10 items although i have not checked to see if there is any real gain in doing .so

1463341
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
it really seems to be a careful case by case basis as to what strategy you use where some internals you could obfuscation to make decompilation reverse-engineering hard and that would be enough

1463354
compact-framework	.net
i just published wmautoupdate a .net c# framework that will do auto-updates on the compact-framework

1463359
bugzilla	fogbugz	bug-tracking	fogbugz	bug-tracking	bugzilla
use bug-tracking - bugzilla or fogbugz if you can afford it

1463370
dictionary	arrays
stored in a dictionary but an arrays whose indic are determined at

1463401
interpolation	splines
you can also use splines to interpolation - just search in wikipedia

1463412
contains	any
are there any tools that would help with reading software requirement document that contains a mix of domain specific and company specific acronyms and jargon

1463416
seam	jsf
if you just go for bookmarkable you still have to carefully design how you link things together in your jsf pages and flows although seam 2.2 added some features to make this easier

1463425
getter	setter
and the habit of making the getter and setter the same function is confusing and here results in the bug.

1463446
contains	elements	contains	any
if you have an arrays of pointers remember that you would need to have previously explicit initializer any unassigned elements pointers to null if you haven t initializer them they ll contains random non-null value

1463455
groovy	java
not groovy but an alternative approach that works - as long as you don t change add remove and methods signature - is to set the server in debugging mode and use java hot code replacement functionality

1463462
carbon	cocoa
recently i changed a large project from carbon to cocoa

1463487
digits	short
in cobol you had to declare variabless such that you actually had to say how many digits there were in a numbers year 99 declare the variables year such that it could only hold two decimal digits .so yes it was an easier to make that mistake than in c were you would have int or short or char as the year and still have plenty of room for years greater than 99

1463497
any	set
also is there any convenient way to set up a global exception-handling handler in javascript

1463510
launchd	daemons
how can i launchd a cherrypy .app as a daemons and forget about it

1463526
exception-handling	try-catch
in .net try-catch only incurs an overhead if an exception-handling is actually throw

1463532
hide	show
can you not simply show it and then hide the original

1463538
any	set
i want to set a specific class to any packets that come from a specific computer in my network using --set-class how can i achieve that

1463541
exception-handling	try-catch
basically there is no problem using try-catch but i tend to limit what i have in them as i think it is bad practice to depend on them rather than doing what you can to ensure exception-handling aren t throw as exception-handling will be expensive .so checked that that string is not null before getting the length of it

1463542
required	checked
note that the value in inc may be relative to the current directory if you put relative directory in inc .so be careful if you change directory between the required use and checked inc

1463552
platform	gpl
gpl does not make a libs public domain nor does the fact that the libs comes with a development platform

1463557
zend-framework-mvc	simpletest
i am using zend-framework-mvc and unit-testing with simpletest libs

1463566
versioning	upgrade
it may required a versioning upgrade though

1463574
constructor	object
you can t use a singleton methods inside a constructor as the object has already been created and you can t return anything

1463581
contains	any
ideally i would really like to keep it all contains within this particular scripting rather than having to add any extra stuff to the page that is being opened

1463584
selected	checkbox
allow remote clients selected this checkbox if you want this dtc to coordinate transactional for remote clients

1463584
selected	checkbox
allow remote administration selected this checkbox if you want to allow administration of this dtc from remote computers

1463594
any	set
.so i set the class to be configure for any data from the slingbox s ip-address instead of a specific ports

1463600
default-value	arguments
the intention of this decorator seems to supply a default-value if either the named or val arguments are missing presumably if they are set to none

1463629
base-class	inherited
.so i m basically defining a base-class with the needed methods to handle content items and then add-ins are written which inherited from that to deal with specific item types

1463629
base-class	inherited
i do want these add-ins to inherited from a base rendering class that i provide because very simple rendering may simply need to call functionality from that base-class rather than having any of their own code a note and a memo might well use the simplified rendering functionality from the base rendering class

1463635
http-request	postdata
how would i go about creating a http-request with postdata in classic asp not .net

1463637
stateless	stateful
our project uses the wicket web framework which allows stateful or stateless integration

1463637
stateless	stateful
anything that s possible in a stateful application could also be implements as stateless - you simply have to store the state on the client and submit all relevant state information on every request

1463640
sine	sin
for example if you implements the whole sin function with just the two tests above you could accidentally break it by returning a triangle function that almost looks like a sine function and your tests would not be able to detection the error

1463643
json	xml
twitter s rest api allows you to append a json or xml at the end of the uri

1463668
capacity	storage
it was 80 about storage capacity pure and simple

1463669
show	next
.when you click on vs the next time it will ask you to reload because the project file has changed and your new classes should show up

1463671
business-logic-layer	data-layer	business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
bring in a web service tier .when the distance between your user-interface systemd and your data-layer starts to cross boundaries that a data-access-layer or business-logic-layer would begin to encounter difficulties

1463678
spring	guice
my primary need is dependency-injection which both spring and guice can do well

1463678
spring	guice
should i use spring or guice

1463714
hash	md5
if it matters the caching file is an md5 hash off a key-value in the links table

1463722
profiling	trace
you can try using profiling such as dottrace -- set it into a memory trace and run your application

1463752
spring	guice
spring would probably give you more flexibility but if you just need di then guice may be a better choice

1463752
spring	guice
here are a couple of comparisons between spring and guice and spring guice and picocontainer

1463756
tapply	lapply
i m really surprised no one has posted about apply tapply lapply and sapply

1463756
tapply	lapply
remember use apply sapply lapply tapply and do.call

1463761
input-field	checkbox
we are currently using a repeater to display input-field drop downs checkbox and calendar items on each row

1463776
directory	folder
each application has to have their own folder and virtual directory and a web-config specific to only that application

1463805
default	reset
- reset all settings - save current settings optional - choose a default collections of settings from the list presented

1463826
keyvaluepair	key
for purposes of enumerator each item in the dictionary is treated as a keyvaluepair tkey tvalue structure representing a value and its key

1463852
shell	bash
i wanted to know why i am seeing a different behavior in the background-process in bash shell

1463852
shell	bash
i changed to bash shell

1463852
shell	bash
i changed to bash shell

1463853
negative-number	zero
that will force a negative-number to be positive first .so that it round towards zero then changes the result back to negative

1463863
constructor	object
one way of doing this is to use the pythontuple object constructor with an ironpython.runtime.list

1463864
constructor	object
you can now refactor your orderprocessor class to take in an instances of an iorderparser object through its constructor

1463892
spring	guice
to understand the motivations behind guice the bob lee i don t get spring news on theserverside.com and its comments is the perfect starting points

1463892
type-safety	generics
i was thus happy to see a new player in the di framework landscape especially a modern framework leveraging java 5 features generics and annotations for the sake of type-safety

1463922
updating	updates
on some other engines i d suggest doing first a selected into a temporary table then reading from that temporary table while updating the primary one but i m uncertain how the performance would be affected in sqlite depending on what indic you have if no index is affected by your updates then i suspect that such a temporary table would not be an optimization at all in sqlite -- but i can t run benchmarking on your data the only real way to checked performance hypotheses

1463935
echo	die
echo printing die required required_once include include_once and others i am sure i missed some are not functions but language construct

1463945
swing	swt
i ve personally ended up using swing swt + jruby

1463950
json	xml
serialization to from json or xml if you need allegedly-human readable text files suggested by another answer is one possible approach but not too hot no standardized way to serialization completely general class instances to either xml or json

1463958
constructor	object	enumerator	any
you can actually give the object constructor any enumerator object

1463964
constructor	private	constructor	object
another benefit of the singleton over the global static object is that because the constructor is private there is a very clear compiler enforced directive saying there can only be one

1463969
javascript	dom
has anyone tried simulating the dom and javascript runtime using something like rhino or is that just asking for pain

1463984
automated-tests	selenium
the only sane way i ve found to run automated-tests on web apps involving substantial javascript w or w o comet is selenium rc -- basically mechanizing automating a real browser from your favorite programming language

1463984
javascript	dom
simulating browser s dom and javascript is just too painful -- been there tried that failed miserably

1464055
pixels	line
start with one any pixels in a crack then follow it to make a multipoint line out of the crack -- save the points that make up the line

1464055
pixels	line
just follow the pixels in one or two directions to make up a line then remove these pixels from the set of crack pixels

1464087
stress-testing	jmeter
jmeter is an excellent tool for stress-testing web-applications

1464089
tuples	any
in such situations you normally need to checked for any iterable not just lists -- if you re accepting lists or numbers rejecting e.g a tuples would be weird

1464094
komodo	emacs
i am using the emacs keybinding on komodo where komodo uses the cmd key for meta by default

1464110
cucumber	webrat
i am learning cucumber and webrat with ruby-on-rails and would like some advice on the best way to test an edit form

1464118
directory	folder
i created an extensions folder in my eclipse directory and dropped it in there

1464118
selected	button
click on the help menu and selected software updates... click on the available software tab then the add site... button

1464118
selected	button
in the dialog that comes up click on the archive... button and browse to your extensions folder and selected the blackberry plugins .zip file and click open.

1464136
pointers	stack
stack pointers are .so crucial and the distinction between a microproces.sor and any other kind of cpu .so utterly meaningful in this context.

1464143
any	set
i am having a really unsual problem i have never had before i have a signup page form and a process page that for submit to on the process page i set any errors that are in the user data like empty field and set them to a session variables arrays

1464168
emacs	vim
better integration wrt the motley collections of plugins for powerful-but-not-ide editor such as vim and emacs

1464168
emacs	vim
- and i stand in awe of my emacs entity-relationship colleagues have to ack that no mattentity-relationship how incredibly powentity-relationshipful vim is emacs is a notch above

1464186
logout	login
the site does work showing data from sql but .when i use the login link on the site it brings up the login form i login it redirects to the main page where it still says login instead of logout

1464194
32-bit	16-bit
hark back to the days of segmented 16-bit architectures for example an arrays might be limited to a single segment .so a 16-bit size_t would do but you could have multiple segments .so a 32-bit intptr_t types would be needed to pick the segment as well as the offset within it

1464198
unsigned	short
for example even though unsigned short and wchar_t are the same size on windows i think using wchar_t instead of unsigned short show the intention that you will use it to store a wide character rather than just some arbitrary numbers

1464216
http	ssl
i did not test the http ssl implementation itself but we figured that while we are sitting around click on links in a building we may as well do some ssl versioning of the http request

1464216
http	ssl
once you know that ssl is working w http at all failures that are request-specific are going to be pretty limited based on my recollection

1464218
lighting	shading
make sure only solid colors are rendering which means no shading lighting or texturing and that dithering is disabled

1464222
output	mode
in the above example the s tells it to output a short 16-bit and the forces it to little-endian mode

1464230
32-bit	64bit
perhaps 128bit distributed-systemd internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a systemd call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464238
daemons	systemd
this numbers is liable to increase and decrease depending on the virtual-memory demands of the systemd service daemons and applications running on the machine

1464252
any	set
the post-receive hook starts out with the git_dir environment variables set to the repo .git folder .so no matter what path you cd into it will always try to run any following git cmd there

1464267
hash	md5
in the old days the last time i wrote code for this i could just store previous md5 hash and compare new ones to that list

1464274
hash	md5	salt	md5
as for storing the md5 hash plus salt - presumably you re already storing the salt + hash inorder to validation the user s current passwd

1464279
short	base
short of that you could still configure your tomcat server to pick up your web-applications from wherever you want by specifying appropriate document base in either server.xml or your webapp s context.xml

1464299
hash	md5
firstly stop using md5 if you are using it and use sha-2 md5 sha-0 and sha-1 are all dead hash

1464323
click	mouse
the expanded content should come infront of the page cotent ex flash advertisements maximize to occupy the page on mouse over and gets collapse on click close button - yahoo inbox

1464356
put	get
you have to put the textbox into a every form to get the value in every .post - no solution

1464356
user-controls	ascx
a custom user-controls ascx might be a solution

1464356
value	field
replicate value changes of your original textbox into hidden field placed in the formulars where you need the value

1464366
linux	unix
and then using the unix path separator as i m on a linux box

1464374
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
my asp.net application only comes out properly if i am previewing it in internet-explorer but its the ugliest thing ever if i view in firefox google-chrome or safari

1464386
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1464398
jsonp	ajax
unfortunately jquery doesn t support json parsing outside of the ajax functions with json or jsonp as datatype deserialization si very tightly bound to the ajax and callback code

1464399
contains	set
hence the result set contains way too much redundant data and besides i canâ t find a way to filtering out the redundancies in the ssrs report itself

1464399
any	set
any idea on how to rewrite the mdx .so that it only returns the result set above

1464402
google-chrome	firefox
i d advise using firefox as your development browser while testing in ie and google-chrome as well

1464405
buffering	streaming
calling fflush is irrelevant to that - it just ensures that the strings that you have already written to the streaming are in fact sent over the connection and not kept in a buffering

1464416
triggers	insert
after any place in the file that call this.input.val like line 231 insert triggers mycustomevent

1464455
associations	model
although nhibernate supports many-to-many mapping it is strongly suggested that you if i remember it correctly from hibernate in action include the associations class a class representing your reference table in your domain model

1464455
associations	model
with the new model event 1 - x eventaddress x - 1 address in-place remember that you must do the book keeping of the bi-directional associations yourself following fowler s master-slave pattern from uml distilled

1464476
malloc	free
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard value that happen to contains null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contains a null byte right at that positioning

1464477
export	report
i m at a loss with an annoying issue to do with export a report

1464477
export	report
the building operation of the export controllers buildinging the report to a temporary file on the server

1464478
annotations	mapping
also some annotations can become really big and be multi-liners on their own i think of hibernate mapping redefinition in a subclassing

1464492
web-services	security
things get a bit more interesting .when we move away from basic soap http web-services and use standards for security transactional messaging etcs the whole ws- spaces

1464500
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
as dove suggests it s best to use a relatively standards compliant browser to do your development work firefox opera google-chrome or safari and then tweak to make it work in ie 6 7 8 afterwards

1464500
default	reset
try having a look at tripoli which gives you a common cross browser css standards a reset plus rebuild of default styles

1464502
json	xml
first thing you need to do is the communication with php mysql application based on json or xml whoever suites you

1464502
json	xml
you have to have a page like website.com employee_list.php which returns you the xml or json that you call from actionscript

1464514
radio	click
updates there is only one button to be show corresponding to each radio button..for eg if radio1 is click show button 1 if radio 2 is click show button 2 and .so on

1464516
python	java
watch this .app for changes in python and java performance

1464516
python	java
currently python and using the low-level api in java are faster than jdo on java for this simple test

1464525
any	set
.when you set an elements to be absolute you re taking it out of the rendering flow which means it won t interfere with any other elementss on the page

1464534
arrays	loops
you have to loops through the arrays

1464564
hide	show
for eg consider a situation where you have a show hide div and .when you click on the div it should opne and if you click anywhere else in the document it should close

1464574
sql-server	ms-access
i have tried to open the session by providing it my own idbconnection on sql-server 2008 ms-access and sqlite i am positively 100 sure that the database setups and the connections are valid to no avail

1464575
annotations	mapping
creating mapping files from annotations classes create a hibernate mapping file

1464596
value	field
the other advantage here is you not restrict to just variables but can use field control value events properties etc

1464606
required	checked
i need to checked whether my required text for verifying exists in the page

1464628
arrays	loops
you are trying to innitialize a new arrays on every loops and on top of that you are also trying to assign it as a string and not an arrays

1464628
populate	row
you could also use for example string myarrays dt.tables 0 .rows 0 if you want an arrays populate with a specific row

1464637
push	pull
from the client end i d constantly pull from the repository make changes and push back

1464640
boost	stl
not in the stl i think the boost versioning may let you do it but i am not sure

1464642
revision	svn
or is it possible to tell git to merge only a certain range of revision like in svn

1464644
value	field
if you know the rgb value you want then you can just enter by hand into the color properties field

1464648
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
this is how i manually call viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear here

1464648
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
and one of the view controllers i load this way has the following viewwillappear note that this is viewwillappear since at the points that viewdidappear is called your view is viewable by the user

1464651
hash	md5

1467723
buffering	streaming
what you would need to do inorder to achieve you goal is to use a streaming buffering that writes to a .net streaming

1467948
expression	evaluation
the basic principles is that expression evaluation is easier for a computer using a stack and reverse polish notation .so the algorithm converts a in-fix notation expression with as.sociated order of precedence and parentheses to rpn and then evaluates it by popping operands performing operations and pushing results until there are no operations left and one value left on stack

1467958

i want to get a new list contains just those elements of the observed list that are different from what s in the expected list

1468858
constructor	object
you should pass the session object as an arguments to it s constructor like i illustrated in the example

1468858
constructor	object
because now your user object are tied to the global session object but with passing it to the constructor any data could be passed in

1468858
constructor	object
here s an example of how you could pass an object for instances your session object to the constructor

1468878

spaces	output
i have indented spacesd both the source xml file and the associated xslt templates to make it easier to read and develop but all that extra white spaces is getting itself into the output

1468984
spaces	output
besides stripping all extra white spaces from the xml and xslt making them just one long line of code is there another way to get rid of the whitespaces in the output

1468997
aggregate-functions	sum
use grouping by and aggregate-functions sum min max etc to collapse the many rows into the output row set you want

i m curious if anyone has a good strategy for getting example data into a listview gridview or really any itemscontrol for that matter

1469059
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i know that your answer will be to extends the elements in my javascript code the problem is not in the validation.javascript code itself but in another function that i built to checked if all field in the form are valid according to validation.javascript rules if it s all ok then the code go and call the function that include the ajax request its work in firefox and google-chrome and opera but not in ie

1469060
double	int
for example #pragma pack 2 aligns int long-long long float double long-double and pointers on two byte boundaries instead of their natural alignment boundaries

postgresql	mysql
derby is a viable option .so are mysql which even has a csv storage engine or postgresql

1469086
packets	ping
the servers block icmp packets .so ping won t work

1469092
webserver	upload
my thought is that i could have users upload their images and css to the server in a single zipfile to the webserver which could then extraction the files from the zip push the images on to an image hosting service programmatically get the corresponding url from the service and updates the css accordingly before attaching it to the user s display .profile

1469093

postgresql	firebird
postgresql 7.4+ 8.x firebird 1.x

1469159
contains	elements
since your scripting is contains right after body and has no defer attributes it s probably safe to assume that during scripting execution body tag is already parsing and body elements is already created but not the rest of the tree such as elementss created from the markup following scripting in question

1469161
entity-framework	ado.net
of the ef performance issues are related to the specific ado.net entity-framework provider you are using

1469183
subclassing	superclass
a subclassing can be treated as its superclass but never in the opposite directions

1469187
subclassing	superclass
possibly you were confused about which was which as your question asks why is implicit-conversion allowed from superclass to subclassing

1469187
subclassing	superclass
a subclassing is an instances of the superclass but not the other way around .so that s why the types are not compatible

1469187
subclassing	superclass
however the subclassing is still an instances of the superclass

1469187
superclass	inherited
the superclass on the other hand has almost nothing that the inherited class implements. almost is good enough for the parent to still be an instances of the child class but passing the parent class to a methods expecting the child would most likely not work as hardly anything is available

1469217
revision	svn
you ll tag and labels that versioning maj.min.svn.building where major is the major release numbers min is the minor release numbers svn is the subversioning revision numbers and building is the automated building numbers and merrily go on your way revising the trunk for your next release

1469286
cairo	gtk
that s just some dream code i m fine with some minimal boilerplate but i really don t need anything fancy probably the only feature i would really like would be the ability to embed in some gui that looks good on windows that ruless out tkinter and is not extremely heavyweight that might rules out gtk cairo

build-process	msbuild
in my experience it has just been easier for me to have three files in my project say web-release.config web-debug.config and web-config and then i modify the project file which is just an msbuild scripting to copy the contents of either the -debug or -release file over the web-config during the build-process

1469586
xapian	sphinx
it could be sphinx or xapian or another one but no java lucene is out but something that can be used with php and run on linux

input-field	selected
next output.php has sent an email to one of five email grouping based upon another input-field selected in input.html

1469619

1469681
push	pull
between push pull and commit

arrays	map
what is a good way to map a key to an object without having to have an arrays of 1000 size and a bunch of if x 0 x 99 business

1469690
.net	wcf
assembly-sharing or type-sharing only really started being a feature in wcf .net 3.0

1469696
data-members	instances
a good way to thing of passing complex object via web-services is you re serializing all of the data-members of an instances into xml sending it over a wire and then deserializing it back into real data at the other end

1469704
push	pull
simple-terms to push and pull

1469704
push	pull
between push pull and commit

1469704

administration	account
maybe the process running the code is no longer running with administration authority or the authority associated with your account changed

1469731
contains	elements	contains	sorted
here s what i understood from the question we need one sorted collections that contains all elements from both seta and setb

1469731
duplicates	contains
because seta and setb may contains equals items we should use a list preserve duplicates

1469731
arraylist	treeset
if we don t want duplicates just exchange arraylist by treeset and remove the extra sorting

1469731
contains	elements
i assume that both sets contains the same types of elements - if not we can still use collections.sort but have to push a comparator to the sort methods that is capable of comparing different typess of object

1469756
highlight	selected
this selected random content on the screens highlight it blue

1469764
command-prompt	cmd
is there any way to run command-prompt cmd from within a c# application

dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
a whole different approach would be to create an associativity arrays dictionary table hash of your letters and their value one or two simple loops

1469813
lighttpd	apache
i don t have thorough benchmarking but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel .when it comes to serving python web apps

1469815
contains	set
currently i have a main_window class that will contains the sdl widget menus that i set up and probably other stuff as the project develops

1469829
arguments	default
default templates argumentss of a templates templates arguments are ignore but if the templates templates parameter has default-argumentss they are considered during the initializer of the templates

1469829
arguments	default
.so if the book is to be believe your example where non-standard default-parameters are added to std vector would be legal - since default templates argumentss of a templates templates arguments are ignore

the set operation performed is in this case set-union while for removeemployeeobject and removeemployees it is set-difference of course

1469938
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	set	bag	contains	elements	contains	set
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collections of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contains duplicates elements also known as a bag

1469938
duplicates	elements
core data correctly does not allow repeated elements stored in the same to-many relationship therefore the framework uses a nsset which enforces distinct elements while nscountedset allows duplicates elements

1469958
scala	java
the above java mechanism could probably be used for foo and hello but the scala types don t match one-to-one with that of java

if you want to keep your .net .app in 64bit you could use com to make things work like this recompile your c code as a 32-bit dll use .net to write a 32-bit com wr.apper for that dll then have your 64bit .net .app call the 32-bit com server which would in turn call your 32-bit dll

font-size	height
how can i bring closer the items s texts without reducing the font-size or increasing the windows s height

1472242
font-size	height
p.s - the font-size and the height of the windows must not be changed

1472271
pthreads	fork
on pthreads one of the step involved in daemonization is fork and having the parent exit

1472273

a user could enter just a house numbers or a house named but entering a value in either field marks both of them valid

1472383
contains	any
after looking over the guppy website and not finding any information about how to launchd the .profile browser there i started looking around the guppy source and eventually found guppy heapy prof.py at the end of which i saw a docstring contains this line

1472383
debugging	exit
the pb call blocks until the .profile browser is exited note just closing the windows with the wm destroy button doesn t seem to cause it to return - only the exit menu item seems to .so your server is hung until you dismiss the windows but for debugging purposes that seems like it may be fine

1472404
login-control	loginview
i wanted to add login-control .so i just added loginview as follows

1472419
compact-framework	.net
i need to be able to lookup the types of cpu that my application is running from a .net compact-framework application

1472440
sql-server-express	sql-server
however if i am installing sql-server-express which can only utilise 1gb ram on a box with 2gb ram then i presume memory will not be an issue as sql-server will gobble up the 1gb it can leaving the rest of the memory for iis and other process

1472458
input-field	textarea
since there are some other free custom key i would like to map one of these to backspace .when i m in an input-field or in a textarea

1472470
positioning	slider
the strange part is that the slider works perfectly in ie6 7 with the demo files as does the calendar....but together they dont want to positioning themselves correctly in ie 6 7

1472481
keyboard	mouse
if you are in a web browser you can t fake real input events like keyboard and mouse events for security reasons

1472526
superclass	metaclass
every object has a class in a variables named isa as in â œthis instances is a snowtireâ and every class has a superclass and a metaclass

1472527
hash	md5
connect.registerusers uses i believe merely the normals md5 hash as implements in the .net runtime

1472528
aggregate	grouping
unfortunately since the problem query is a grouping by with an aggregate the service date isn t available

1472572
ip-address	hostname
by using the same login credentials the connection-string is the same for both the prod and the dev environment nothing needs to change as the production platform pick up the sql hostname as the correct production ip-address

1472586
any	set
several versioning back .when one would edit a frame which was set to alclient the frame would resize between edits and any controls which were aligned specific to the right of the frame would change positioning

1472610
authentication	login
i am using a custom authentication filtering on my asp.net-mvc controllers that redirects the user to a url other than the login screens if they fail authentication on a particular action

1472645
internet-explorer	google-chrome
you do not have to force all internet-explorer users to use google-chrome frame

1472648
json	xml	restlet	spring
restlet has an extensive list of extensions for spring wadl xml json as well and many more including an extension for jax-rs api

1472649
required	checked
compared to the network round trip the microseconds required to apply checked to a single insert or upload are probably a trivial overhead

1472668
json	xml	restlet	spring
restlet has an extensive list of extensions for spring wadl xml json as well and many more including an extension for jax-rs api

this works in firefox 3 internet-explorer 8 internet-explorer 8 compatibility mode opera and safari

1472730
.when	ready
i realised that the reason the above code isnt working for me is because the fckeditor instances isnt ready yet .when the document properties is referenced

1472741
display	width
have you display block ed the p elements next to the image and given it a width

1472761
click	mouse
.when you click on left or right side of the slider your mouse events are handled by repeatbuttons and you don t get them

1472766
protected	public
second it is unclear what you mean by links still work do you mean internal links that will or will not work based on the proper functioning of your application or do you mean links to public internet sites that happen to be on a passwd protected site

1472783
value	field
i want to set the value of this field during the page load event and if it is not a postback

1472794
slidedown	slideup
thanks for these application of slideup and slidedown

1472794
hide	show
an important remark it doesn t work under ie7 and ie8 if you don t set a width for the div you want to show or hide

1472802
hashtable	set
set up a hashtable for the original string

1472803
directory	folder	contains	set
basically as part of our build-process we copy over a set of directory that contains a bunch of other nested directory containss various xml and data and .when we move the location for that data our copy and checkin build-process doesn t really work and because we are checked into another source control svn wiping out the directory and copying over isn t really an option either we d be blowing away the .svn folder

1472831
arguments	default
no but you might consider using a set of functions or macros to approximate using default arguments

1472835
any	set
this is intentional .so that callers of remote methodss can get access to any value set by the remote methods

1472842
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari the reported offsettop seems well incorrect

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
and loaded it in firefox and google-chrome

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
both browser report the wrapper span as its offsetparent but for firefox the offsettop is -8 and for google-chrome it is 2

1472846
symlink	unlink
it is not necessary to explicit unlink the old symlink

1472846
filesystems	symlink
on some filesystems the target of the symlink is stored in the inode itself in-place of the block list if it is short enough

1472854
numerical	matrix
anyone using numerical class libs in .net has their matrix stored as arrays underneath

1472862
perl	tcl
expect either with the tcl or perl implementation s would be my first attempt

1472876
double	int
the server receives the pickled int unpickles it double it then pickles it and send it back to the client

1472877
contains	set
contains listview is set to details

1472879
silverlight	xbap
every .net developer particularly asp wfp xbap coders are the main benificiaries of silverlight they can bring rich internet experience to thier users with a very little learning curve by using your familiar choice of language wheter c# or vb or other .net language

1472879
breeze	ria
.net developers can now create ria in a breeze without learning new scripting-language

1472893
sql-server-express	sql-server
i would like to copy a database tables itâ s data stored procedure views from sql-server 2008 database to sql-server-express

1472899
ms-access	mysql
ms-access data going into mysql

1472908
protected	public
in the case of the static methods php has to checked wether the methods can or cannot be called from the calling context public protected private

1472908
required	checked
that s most likely what causes the overhead or at least part of it since the classic function-call doesn t required php to perform that kind of checked

1472910
attributes	properties
i recently plugged the nhibernate validation into my .app i ve decorated the properties of my domain object with the nhibernate attributes as .so .

1472915
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
i already tried isnull coalesce nvl nz

1472939
submitchanges	datacontext
you just need to create two datacontext object retrieve the data in an object in the first data context and copy that data to a new object in the other data context and submitchanges

1472942
variables	boolean
some sql engines have boolean variables and some don t

1472942
boolean	int
the idea that is an operation just like + except that it returns a boolean rather than an int is one of those simple but powerful ideas that have great ramifications .

1472960
expression	evaluation
i tried to write the most compact c code for this bool expression evaluation problem

1472972
constructor	object
however if you are retrieving the ids but want populate object entities then consider using a constructor

1472983
linqdatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource which is tied to a table in my database

1472983
hide	show
in my presentation layer using templatefield in gridview i hide the foreign key-value and make another call to the database to show the named of it s as.sociated named .so it s more readable for the user

1472984
any	set
i figured out asyncrendering properties of my report viewer should be set to true inorder to work without any javascript errors

1472988
value	field
then defined the hidden form field like this .so that it s value is set to the properties value

1473018
.net	wcf
wcf was introduced in .net 3.0

1473018
.net	wcf
inorder to consume a wcf service in .net 2.0 you need to do the following

1473028
.when	ready
if the order of the changes on the branch doesn t matter too much you might be able to merge just those changes back to the trunk and then merge the rest of them .when the feature is ready to reintegrate

1473033
directory	folder
if it is not sufficient to completely clear the target location use defaultexcludes false to ensure the .svn folder are deleted you could try writing a custom ant task to traversal the filesystems below the target deleting empty directory as you move backup from each leaf

1473036
nspopupbutton	nsbutton
it s all entirely custom view code involving nspopupbutton s and nsbutton s and nstextfield s

1473048
selected	button
the user needs to click on browse button to browse his systemd .he then selected a text file click ok.once he click ok all the data in the text file should be display in a text area.how do i do that

1473049
scriptaculous	jquery
the only thing jquery is good for out of the box is pushing some styles attributes around on the dom whereas scriptaculous covers the whole spectrum of what s possible with effects

1473106
display	height
for some reason the subviews which were part of the cell used to calculate the height weren t appearing correctly in the cell that were used for the actual display

1473107
filtering	sorting	qsortfilterproxymodel	qstandarditemmodel
i have a qstandarditemmodel with several 100 000 recording of data and a qsortfilterproxymodel on top of it for filtering and sorting capabilities

1473140
ostream	std
in mingw the simplest solution is to use c++ s std ostream since that uses the gnu libs and does support long-double

1473207
gettext	poedit
there s some tutorials out there for gettext w poedit .

1473209
contains	set
at the very least you can checked that all the characters used are valid the set of all strings contains only displayable unicode characters is a context-free grammar

1473209
required	checked
whitespace-dependent languages like python make your context-free grammar less useful and therefore required more context-sensitive checked later on much of this is done at runtime in python through dynamic-typing

1473213
expression	evaluation
although xslt s templates and variables and the like are lexically scoping xslt is of course all about xml - and the current positioning in the xml tree is dynamically scoping in the sense that the context nodes is global and thus that xpath expression are evaluated not according to xslt s lexical-scope but according to it s dynamic evaluation

1473266
constructor	object
delegation the lineitem or whatever child object to an apilineitem constructor

1473273
dbd	dbi
we are using perl v5.8.5 dbi 1.56 dbd sybase 1.07 and sql-server 2005

1473284
scala	java
i don t think it is quite as functional as scala clojure but it s certainly a lot more functional than java

1473284
groovy	java
in general i can get the same work done in groovy with about 50 of the code it would take me in java

1473284
groovy	java
this is because groovy is syntactically similar to java and provides seamless access to the jdk libs but the addition of a lot of language-features closures meta-programming properties and dynamic-typing eliminates almost all the boilerplate associated with java programming

1473293
function-overloading	default-parameters
this will give you a variant of c with function-overloading and default-parameters and whatever other features you chose to use

1473297
google-chrome	safari
.so the problem is browsers safari google-chrome do not show spaces in ajax-loaded html content after tags like strong em etc

1473300
scientific-notation	digits
the default is 6 digits precision and if the numbers has more than that it s rendering in scientific-notation

1473302
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
it lets you write your code in whatever language you want php ruby python etc and compile it for the platform of choice iphone android windows osx

1473308
value	field
if you can t rely onthe data to be in the correct format or follow the correct rules only three correct value for a field for instances then your dqata becomes less valuable

1473324
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
a pbkdf2 password-hash should contains the salt the numbers of iterator and the hash itself .so it s possible to verify later

1473324
pbkdf2	hash
is there a standards format like rfc2307 s ssha for pbkdf2 passwd hash

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
that s the numbers of iterator in lowercase hexadecimal the urlsafe_base64 encode salt and the urlsafe_base64 encode pbkdf2 output

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
the salt should be 64bit the numbers of iterator should be at least 1000 and the pbkdf2 with hmac-sha1 output can be any length

1473330
anchor	iframe
give your iframe a named and target your anchor to points to it

1473340
ready	live
my goal is to have a semi public dev site s that a grouping of 4 people can work on and push changes to the live site as they are ready

1473347
value	field
there are limitations due to the way the site is set up that won t allow me to order by using another field value

1473349
contains	set
i need to determine if a set of dates contains two different weeks

1473349
contains	set
.when returning a set of recording from a database that contains a date there needs to be something to distinguish between the different weeks

1473366
order	add
to get the rows back in the order you specify in the example you would need to add a second column called a sortkey whose value can be used to sort the rows in the desired sequences

1473388
textbox	button
anytime there s a textbox where a user hits enter the asp.net button tries to submit the form

1473394
filesystems	hardlink
not all filesystems support hardlink and very few support hardlink to directory

1473394
filesystems	fat
in particular usb mass-storage devices are generally formatted as with fat filesystems which do not support links

1473402
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
there is a specifications for the parameters salt and iterator of pbkdf2 but it doesn t include the hash

1473402
pbkdf2	hash
since pbkdf2 is really a key derivation function it doesn t make sense for it to specify a way to bundle the hash which is the really a derived key together with the derivation parameters mdash

1473414
hide	show
is it possible to show and hide 2 different datepicker

1473418
export	csv
there is a numbers of utilities around that allow you to move the data into mysql or just export the access data to csv files

1473422
variables	boolean
it may be clearer though to defined a boolean variables that is assign the conditional in the if-statement then write your code as a negation of that variables

1473423
shell	bash
i am invoking the cmd using a bash shell in linux

1473452
wicket	jsf
tomcat jetty etc are basically webserver that contains servlets and therefore jsp jsf wicket etc etc processor for dynamically generator content

1473462
python	ruby
the fact that some languages tend to promote only one right way to do something like python and others promote many different ways ruby for example from what i hear disclaimer i am not a ruby programmer

1473483
asp.net-mvc	webforms
not looking to mimic webforms in asp.net-mvc

1473483
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as i mentioned i m not trying to mimic webforms just wondering what mechanisms asp.net-mvc offers

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
this only occurs on http pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
why does it only occur on http pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473491
duplicates	elements
i have an xml document that is stored in sql-server 2005 that i want to find all duplicates value from an id attributes within an xml elements

1473496
google-chrome	firefox
similarly .when i try to take over the key for my own purposes it works splendidly in firefox but my event doesn t fire in google-chrome or ie8 and the default action for the tab fires instead

1473549
any	set
if there is any overlap set the dilation output pixels at that location to 1 otherwise set it to 0

1473558
python	php
honestly i feel that php and python have the clearest means of understanding but it all boils down to how smart and clear the programmer wants to be

1473560
any	set
for the mb_internal_encoding - due to some unknown to me bug in php versioning 5.3- haven t tested it on 5.3 passing the encoding as a parameter to the mb_ function doesn t work and the internal encoding needs to be set before any use of mb_ functions

1473584
display	height	display	width
using yui 2 on page load i found all elementss of that given classname that were either set to display none or whose height and width was 0 that s one way of measuring whether an elements exists or a parent is set to display none

1473593
triggers	insert
.when bulk insert into a database if the table has indexes foreign key or triggers they have to be checked row-by-row

1473593
triggers	insert
.so typically you want to drop them perform the insert using copy if possible and then recreate indexes fks and triggers

1473607
display	width
div is a display block elements meaning it fills the whole width - that s why text can be aligned in it

1473609
debugging	trace
what are some techniques in detection debugging memory leak if you don t have trace tools

1473610
hide	show
use z-index to hide elements under non-transparent elements show it and get height

1473613
any	set
well you haven t set up any authentication as far as i can tell

1473613
put	get
i strongly recommend that you try to get this working in a console .app which will be much easier to debugging than a servlet then put it into a servlet environment

1473614
python	perl
javascript perl python and many

1473617
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
the simplest way is to use binding and hierarchicaldatatemplate

1473617
children	nodes
for leaf nodes nodes with no children you can just use a regular datatemplate

1473626
authentication	login
what i want to do is to present a login page for the user that authentication off of ad and then if successful goes to the database server to get their roles by calling xp_logininfo to store in the user s session

1473626
authentication	impersonation
i am authentication and looking at the windowsidentity object that is generator it states my id is mis1 c07884 which is precisely what is needed for impersonation to get to the sql-server

1473634
contains	set
is there a way to set the default editor for a class file contains a datatable derived-class

1473641
innodb	myisam
does innodb support the types of query i have for myisam

1473657
hide	show
to overcome that you can create a special moss page that hide all those elementss and show just the elements you want to expose

1473677
scala	java
scala s tying to java feels more limiting than clojure s integration between scala s and java s static type-systems

1473700
getter	setter
note that there is both a getter and a setter for your compositdict object

1473700
getter	setter
this is why i also changed your registered methods to get_shared instead of get_comp as you will want access to the setter as well as the getter within your consumer class

1473704
display	height
even if you clone the parent object and display it somewhere that can t be seen by the user there s not guarantee that the clone will have the same height as the final size of the hidden object

1473704
display	height
if you must know the height before it s display to the user you ll have to hack it by display it for as short of a time as possible then hiding it again

1473711
margins	padding
look for value in margins and padding for the generator textblock

1473727
stderr	stdout
how are you consuming the child-process stdout and stderr

1473727
buffering	streaming	stderr	stdout
you need to consume the output streaming concurrently otherwise either your stdout or stderr buffering will fill up and your child-process will block

1473733
button	popup
i use the uiimagepickercontroller and added it on a button to the current view after adding how can i identify the touch on this camera view that popup after touch on any button

1473745
scala	java	scala	ocaml	groovy	java	groovy	scala	python	ruby	python	java	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scala	haskell	python	haskell	lisp	ocaml	lisp
besides java there s groovy scala clojure a lisp dialect on the jvm jruby ruby on the jvm jython python on the jvm jaskell haskell on the jvm fan runs on the jvm as well as the .net clr and lots more and there s also an ocaml-java ocaml that runs on the jvm

1473766
contains	any
in my particular case i know that the cars collections will never contains any null entries .so i figured i could just add an assume to the methods to silence the static checker like .so

1473766
contains	any	enumerator	any
clearly that is not very clean or efficient code and i don t actually intend to add such redundant null checked to all of my linq statements -- especially .when i know the enumerator doesn t contains any null entries

1473769
binary	hex
save the binary in a format you are capable or willing to write a program to read intel hex perhaps or elf if they support that

1473769
any	set
by the time you get through the instruction set you will know the instruction set better than most people that use it every day you will know how to write assembler for each of the options for each of the opcodes you may also learn why this instruction can only address n bytes from its location and others can access anything or that instruction can only use an n bit immediate and others can use any value

1473773
svg	vml
just wondering if anybody has come across a tool or anything to make the process easier of converting vml to svg or some other modern format silverlight flash

1473773
svg	vml
would also be helpful if there was a charts to map vml markup to svg in table format as a cheat sheet or something

1473778
svg	vml
vector converter claims to convert between svg and vml among other formats

1473782
scala	java
scala doesn t have the same level or ide support java has -- or for that matter that f# should have with vs10

1473782
jmock	junit	scalatest	jmock	scalatest	junit
scalatest specifications and scalacheck are top quality frameworks compatible between themselves and compatible with other java frameworks and libs such as junit and jmock

1473782
scala	java
at any rate you can write scala code as fast as java code even faster with some upcoming features

1473782
scala	java
and you can write scala code with functional features almost as fast as java code

1473791
perl	tcl
i tis the camel book to steal a perl idiom of tcl tk

1473792
variables	boolean
i would include a boolean variables in the cancel logout function

1473794
frame	width
i did this by setting the contentsize to be the same as the width of the scroll view s frame which is enough information to tell the uiscrollview that it won t be handling horizontal-scrolling

1473817
early-binding	late-binding
you are using the attributes which means that the interface is exposed to both early-binding and late-binding via idispatch

1473828
debugging	exit
in some project we get this behavior if we exit debugging mode by pressing the stop debugging button instead of exiting the program

1473833
procdump	dump
you can try to run procdump which can create dump files on unhandled-exception

1473880
contains	elements
if the text contains the illegal character is text inside an xml nodes you could take the easy way and surround the text with a cdata elements this won t work for attributes though

1473893
value	field
i would set a new session with a named like valueinsession to true or false depending on whether or not you have session value for the field in your user class

1473897
optgroup	selected
in the selected box are multiple optgroup

1473897
optgroup	selected
is there an easy way to selected a whole optgroup at once in javascript

1473899
attributes	properties
you can actually add properties to the attributes to have all kinds of information

1473900
error-code	hresult
hresult error-code 0x80020009

1473910
distutils	buildout
to learn more about buildout you can watch videos from pycon 2009 on setuptools distutils and buildout

1473915
decrement	increment
it is trivial to construct such a histogram and fairly efficient to test whether the input string has the same histogram as the test string you have to increment or decrement counters for twice the length of the input string

1473915
decrement	increment
to restore the histogram traversal the input string back to its start increment rather than decrement

1473915
decrement	increment
at most it required two increment decrement of an arrays for each character in the input

1473925
icollection	ienumerable
judging by the source code it seems that it will bind to a model that is a generics types of ienumerable icollection ilist or idictionary but it won t bind on a model s properties that is of a generics types

1473930
httpwebrequest	webclient
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest

1473931
contains	set
not exactly sure what i did but i think the contains div wasn t auto sizing to the size of the silverlight content .when viewing in ie7 my content was visible .so i set manual height width to the div and now i can view in firefox ie8

1473945
16-bit	x86
on real-mode x86 code data is accessed by segment + offset each a 16-bit quantity

1473945
32-bit	16-bit
near pointers were 16-bit only and used the current segment far pointers were 32-bit and specified the segment and offset

1473968
haskell	python
2 haskell and python approach truncated output to minimum length of your input

1473990
hide	show
how can i make the div show .when hovering over the link and hide .when moving away instead of showing and hiding onclientclick

32-bit	64bit
find that right place and move .libparsley.so.0 as well as .libparsley.so.0.0.0 there i believe on 64bit ubuntu usr .lib32 is the right place if .libparsley.so.0.0.0 is a 32-bit .libs and usr .lib or usr .lib64 if it is a 64bit .libs

1475303
value	field
i have a custom usertype which stores a date time value in a timestamp field and is updates to the current time in utc .when the recording is insert or updates

1475303
value	field
the problem is that this works very nicely but if you need to run a query where this field is one of the criterion .when the prepare statement is built the custom user types nullsafeset is called which sets the value to current time .so the query always has that conditional set to the current time which doesn t produce the desired results

1475607
stdin	pipe
one could almost say stdin is dead especially considering the object pipe present in windows powershell

1475607
stderr	stdout
alternatively you can createprocess api or system.diagnostics.process and provide your own stdin stdout stderr streaming and bypass the windows-console for these streaming but again unless the target application explicit works via stdin stdout stderr it may not help

1475637
python	c++
i m far from a python expert but i hear this one all the time about its c++ binding

1475637
python	java
how does this concept work and how does python and java bind to c-based apis like opengl

1475645
pointers	stack
as that returns a pointers to a chunks of memory that is on stack -- is a local variables -- and upon return that memory will no longer be valid

1475658

a solution is to write a before insert triggers which will enforce the business rules by checked how many students are readily registered for the class etc. and prevent the insert to take place

1475672
return-value	arguments
essentially you add 2 extra arguments to the procedure mindelegate and maxdelegate and return prematurely from the procedure with a -1 return-value in case there are too many delegation

for perl there are two ways to call c++ subroutine

1475673

i tried to use the same procedure bind every radio-button selectedvalue and value attributes with the properties specified in the properties of the associated bean but still facing the problem

1475717
dlopen	dlsym
in particular the dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 call will load a dynamic typically elf libs and lookup the address of a symbols named by a string

1475717

you can get an arrays of all the key with the allkey methods of the dictionary

1475757
margins	padding
there might be some issues with margins padding

1475775
installation	building
you don t exactly need a wpf windows to hosts to the component it s just the most convenient way to introduce one into a wpf .app as a windows is generally the default entry-point defined via .app.xaml likewise you don t need a wpf wr.apper or 3rd party control as the swf component is guaranteed present in any .net installation which also has wpf support since it s part of the .net which all current and future .net versioning building upon. to-date there is no indication from microsoft that swf support will be dropped from the .net any time soon

1475779
value	field
empties endt_no field s value and

1475779
value	field
puts focus on the pol_no field - .so the user can immediately start selected typing a value in this field

based on the logic of this scripting the business-process obviously doesn t allow any value in endt_no field until there s a value in pol_no

1475779

1475789
selected	button
is this problem occurring only for those radio button whose selected state was manually changed by the user

1475789
radio-button	selected
in that case it is because flex resets its selected state based on the value mentioned in the declaration .when a radio-button is reused

1475789
selected	button
.so even if you selected deselected a ratio button in the periode 1 column flex resets it to .when you scroll away and come back

i tried using the audioconverterfillcomplexbuffer methods and its callback to convert the mp3 to caf but the bytes per packets and per frame are read as 0

1478033
environment	building
if you re doing it to a single environment is generally easy to scripting this to happen automatically from your codeigniter server either automatically after each building or nightly or even on demand

1478044
haskell	ocaml	haskell	python
is it possible to use ocaml haskell algorithm of type-inference to suggest better autocompletions for python

1478057
firefox	safari
for example i had an ajax scripting that was running fine in firefox safari but ran like frozen molasses in ie

1478058
python	perl	python	java
the main general concept is known as ffi foreign function interface -- for java it s jni for python it s the python-c-api for perl it s xs etc etc but i think it s important to give you the general term of art to help you research it more thoroughly

1478062
directory	folder
putting a meta-inf folder in a resources directory or in the root of your source directory will destroy the meta-inf content created by maven

1478066
children	nodes
the problem is the following code only seems to work for the root nodes and not the children

1478069
communication	messages
now if a chat messages is written in one of the midlets it s passed along to a client-side thread that manages the socket communication and gets sent to the server

1478069
communication	messages
i thought about making a thread that polls the client-side communication thread to see if there s any new messages

1478074
32-bit	64bit
this should be the sequences of step or something similar that llvm-gcc performs implicit but it looks like in your case it s emitting 64bit assembly for some reason then trying to assemble and link it for 32-bit

1478081
python	perl
easier with perl python or powershell

1478102
configuration	environment
seems like this configuration files are really confusing to clarify as their behavior changes from the dev environment to deployment

1478109
coalesce	isnull
i think you re looking for something similar to sql s coalesce or isnull

1478115
temporary	copy
fyi i know i could in general hack the string and insert temporary 0 to terminate the string except .when it s a like here i d have to copy it instead but it s a pita especially if i m trying to printing two halves of something in the same printingf and i want to know why the precision is being ignore

1478120
google-chrome	firefox
i could access svn via google-chrome firefox and ie fine

1478126
deployment	install
if you required a proprietary install iss etc then make the deployment scripting work with the default install as well as a production tuned systemd

1478149
execute	prepare
and there s no other way besides prepare statements to execute dynamic-sql in mysql 5.x

1478156

i would like to have nexus or artifactory we re not decided yet store a copy of an artifact .when it is downloading from a public repository on the internet like maven-central

1478159
declarative	imperative
ant-contrib is evil because it tries to convert ant from a declarative styles to an imperative styles

1478165
contains	set
one possible approach would be to obtain the set of key and find the ones which contains the prefix which is wanted

1478182
contains	set
i tend to set up a repository grouping contains several remote repositories

1478206
any	set
i tried creating the object with ordermo alloc but the object i get is incomplete and .when i try to set any of its attributes i get an error

1478212
checkstyle	javadoc
that s exactly how the trend charts for pmd and checkstyle and javadoc errors is done

1478219
short	base
from a short email exchange with him i know that the base project is to updates an existing asp.net form mdash

1478299
g++	gcc
because of this i ve mostly been using geany to write up my code then fireftp to send it off to a faraway unix machine then using gcc or g++ to compile my code

1478312
.when	ready
finally i personally prefer operators styles syntax particularly .when you have a ready function instead of an anonymous one to pass to filtering

1478318
linux	unix
edit it supports a cross-platform framework qt on windows and unix linux as well as os x it supports most revision control systemd -- and you can even run it on windows and linux and it ll look and behave the same

1478332
any	set
each dll will have its own set of static instances for any static object

1478341
exception-handling	try-catch
why not just put your service call in a try-catch block and handle the exception-handling if they do actually occur

1478356
order	add	order	join
more likely you have an order table and an orderitems table - just add an extra level of join with appropriate conditional

1478368
perl	awk
i m going to argue perl is a better choice than awk here

1478387
order	add
in a web part for sharepoint i m trying to add a variables numbers order of buttoncolumns to a datagrid dynamically based on an option the user has selected

1478401
directory	folder
right now i m using a symbolic link to map that folder into my webapp directory

1478407
shell	bash
.so .when using a cmd shell like bash one speaks of cmd

1478407
pascal	tcl
tcl as one of the early scripting-languages probably wanted to draw a distinction between itself as an interpreter scripting-language running in a shell wish versus compiled languages like c and pascal

1478407
perl	tcl
however you still often hear people refer to perl scripting rather than perl programs and likewise for tcl

1478408
value	field
what you ll get in a single composite query is repetitive field value for the single end of the one-to-many relationship

1478444
environment	building
in a corporate environment development teams should be able to develop and building their software even .when a public repository is down

1478447
docking	toolbar
there s a codeproject article a simple c# toolbar docking framework that looks to be a more light-weight option than dockpanel-suite

1478490
updating	updates
that is if all you have to updates is a points on the line then updating the points will force the line visual to updates but won t force the rest of the graphing axes gridlines ... to updates .

.when the form is validation and ready to submit it doesn t

1478526
web-inf	liferay	.war	jar
we stuck the dependency jar files in the liferay .war file in web-inf .lib and it seems to be happy with that

1478526
web-inf	liferay
the answer is again in the liferay .war file in web-inf classes

1478526
jndi	jdbc
i believe it uses the default jdbc properties above to reference our jndi database connection

1478535
asp.net-mvc	webforms
a badly implements asp.net-mvc application is going to be a lot worse than a badly implements webforms application

1478540
webserver	upload
at this points you have other things to care about that are well beyond the scoping of a progress-bar such as dealing with large file upload in-process of your webserver out-of-process is much less detrimental to your server.

1478560
spectrum	sine
with a sine input i tried to modify it s frequency cutting some lower frequencies in the spectrum shifting the main frequency towards zero

1478560
spectrum	sine
i also tried to remove the centering part of the spectrum but it wielded a higher frequency sine wave too

1478599
subclassing	superclass
in oo languages i can create and extends an engine superclass to obtain pistonengine and rotaryengine subclassing

1478603
triggers	insert
in insert triggers name_old is set to blank null depending on your preferences and name_new is set from insert

1478603
triggers	insert
in updates triggers name_old is set from deleted and name_new from insert

1478618
cross-compiling	toolchain
my practice .when unit-testing code that is cross-compiling is to compile the unit tests themselves using the native toolchain -- usually some flavor of x86 compiler

1478633
folder	dir
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir cmd and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially .when file named contains spaces comma and the like

1478633
contains	any
creates a variables n contains the file named without any directory information or extension of the file currently process

1478636
value	field
i would like to insert some value into a table which has an auto-incrementing field as a primary key

1478642
account	userid
but i don t want people to be able to just bypass the login or access other users account by transmitting userid straight to the web .app

1478644
directory	folder
i m trying to write a msbuilding-task that deletes the .obj directory and pdbs from my bin folder on my production building scripting and can t seem to get it to work right

firebird	mysql
ps i don t know why you want to migrate from interbase to mysql but you can also take a look to firebird

1478679
switching	router
but router and switching vendors have high-availability solutions which may be more appropriate to address that issue

1478680
http-get	get
i can access using http-get and i get a methods not allowed messages

1478680
jquery	.post
i am using jquery and accessing the webservice via a .post .....

1478692
dictionary	arrays
i am not sure where to use a dictionary types or an arrays types

1478693
malloc	free
.when i initializer a pointers in this function using malloc seg fault occurs possibly because i did not free it before leaving the function

1478693
strncpy	strcpy
how safe is strcpy compared to strncpy

1478699
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
also beware of dangers using dynamic-sql it might lead to sql-injection if a product named contains apostrophe

1478710
defined	declare
you could defined a category that declare that methods

1478719
dictionary	arrays
in general an arrays is a sequences of items each value has a corresponding index used for lookup where a dictionary is an associativity containers each value has a corresponding key used for lookup

1478729
32-bit	64bit
.when a 64bit process tries to load a 32-bit shared object the

1478735
contains	elements
if your repeater is databound to a collections of persons then the dataitem object contains the actual person object of each elements in the repeater but only in events where that concept makes sense

1478751
sql-server	postgresql
not sure about postgresql but i ve found www.sql-server-performance.com to be a wonderful resource on ms sql-server database-tuning

1478784
hash	md5
some token that only myself and the other website operators knows concatenation to something identifying the user like their user named then hash that with a checksum algorithm such as sha256 you can use md5 or sha1 which usually are more available but they are much easier to break

1478805
strncpy	strcpy
you ve added an additional question about strcpy strncpy

1478808
where-clause	sql
but to avoid sql injections you should protect the data use in the where-clause too

1478814
aggregate	grouping
i m selected some aggregate data and grouping on the date and a particular field

1478814
value	field
i want to display all value in that field and a count for those value even if there was no data matching that field on that day

1478817
duplicates	elements
bear in mind that if you re working with a reference-type all that will be in the list itself is a bunch of references - .so the bulk of the memory taken up by a list and all its elements is going to be in the elements themselves unless you have a lot of duplicates references

1478826
button	popup
eventually most browsers will popup a warning saying the scripting isn t playing nice and give the user a button to click to unceremoniously kill it off

1478839
for-loop	arrays
the only wasteful aspects here is that you have to generator an arrays of length n-1 for the for-loop which isn t ideal but it s probably not a giant issue

1478841
contains	elements
i want to selected all tr elements from the one i click and the next 3-4-5-6 rows up to the next row that contains a td.class_name

1478846
32-bit	64bit
i already have abc which returns me variables in 32-bit machine but doesn t work in 64bit

1478859
contains	any
the list doesn t contains any nodes

1478913
entity-framework	ado.net
please shared your opinion about the linq technology and also the ado.net entity-framework

1478923
getter	setter
how does one get a reference the the getter and setter functions in actionscript 3

1478943
subtract	add
thus a shift is just an add subtract of that one index no modification of the data

1478945
highlight	selected
in the selected a windows device dialog box that appears highlight the windows-ce 5.0 device option

1478945
value	field
in the named field types exactly and without the quotes coreconoverridesecurity and set its value to 1

1478968
numeric	digits
it s best to test for decimal numeric digits themselves instead of letters

1478982
imperative-programming	declarative
workflows are a declarative way of writing programs by linking together pre-defined activities rather than an imperative-programming model of writing lines-of-code

1479005
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are actually built around the idea that you shouldn t be able to and they therefore function as a properties

1479005
getter	setter
i was able to do this for the regular methods but i m trying to extends this to getter setter as well

1479005
getter	setter
since getter and setter function as a properties and not a methods it would make sense to test to see if it is a properties and then simply assign it a value directly

1479026
attributes	properties
create static attributes to hold cmd preferably as properties in static-class you create for cmd - but for simple example just using static attributes in windows .cs

1479031
ftp	ssh
how about if you had an ide that looks like vs has an integrated ftp and ssh clients and allows you to setup and environment to do all of the step you mentioned in one click.

1479032
solaris	linux
one possibility could be to compile the code and execute it on a systemd where you can take advantage of built-in tools libumem on solaris or the libc capability on linux

1479071
liferay	gwt
since liferay supports jsr 286 you can arrange a gwt ajax call that would return the portlet id and use that id to distinguish between different portlets

1479073
getter	setter
the getter setter of your object would reference those two vectors to access data in your real matrix and you would have methods like horizontalshift ... and verticalshift ... that only swap value in your two vectors like you suggested

1479099
notepad++	scite
then you can go with notepad++ or scite

1479104
required	checked
this also tends to increase the time required for dependency checked

1479109
union-all	union
use union-all instead of union assuming that your data is unique between the three databases

1479126
default	reset
you might start by using a css-reset there s this widely from meyerweb.com or the yahoo option in yui site this way you ll reset the nasty default from the browsers

1479137
jquery	.post
you might to also .post your markup for the table that you re trying to attach your jquery scripting too

1479161
32-bit	64bit
.so i am in the process of re.solving the ports of a 32-bit .app to 64bit

1479166
cursor	row
should i use a cursor and insert a row at a time

1479168
itextsharp	acrobat
i read somewhere can t find the forum messages right now that if you use encryption in itextsharp you need at least acrobat 7 to read it

1479173
getter	setter
your getter and setter will work on the attr properties only

1479189
32-bit	64bit
however size_t is a different width on 64bit and 32-bit operating systemd

1479198
contains	set
however if i understand your question correctly you have a bunch or recordinging in a table based upon which you would like to generator a result set that contains three copies of each recording but with slight modifications to each copy

1479222
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
ie internet-explorer firefox firefox ch google-chrome

1479222
value	field
note 2 works somewhat in google-chrome - after updates it is unchanged then you click away and click back into the field and the value appears

1479236
lookup	any
in a templates this works the same as any other properties lookup

1479241
cryptography	security
the security of cryptography algorithms is always in their secret input

1479261
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
just ran into this problem myself and tested this solution in ff3.5 ie6 ie7 ie8 safari 4 opera 10 and google-chrome

1479270
databound	gridview
then inside your gridview s databound event you ll need code to fill the ddl

1479275
checkbox	button
i have several checkbox and a fake submit button to make an ajax request

1479277
fortran	ada
building a complete c compiler and other front-ends such as c++ fortran ada whatever if you want them

1479302
arrays	loops
in your edit you are talking about arrays and in your loops about elem

1479307
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479316
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	scrypt	pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	salt
as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

1479320
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479323
arrays	loops
my first thought was to write a loops that goes through the arrays and crafts a regular expression by adding b on the end of each string and then checked if it is found in the input string

1479323
arrays	loops
while this would work it seems sorta inefficient to loops through the entire arrays

1479338
arrays	loops
you can either loops over the arrays and use strpos to see if the index is length input - length test

1479340
fwrite	fclose	fwrite	fopen	fclose	fopen
and file_put_contents is easier that fopen + fwrite + fclose

1479341
private-members	instances
if you want private-members on your singleton instances you can do something like this

1479341
private-members	object
this is has been called the module-pattern it basically allows you to encapsulate private-members on an object by taking advantage of the use of closures

1479357
cryptography	key-pair
public-key cryptography uses two key a key-pair one of which the private-key is kept secret and the other the public key is made available to everyone else

1479366
subtract	modulo	subtract	add	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract
i am writing a small scripting that allows the user to input their two numbers variables then they can either add subtract multiplying divide easy or modulo haven t caught this one yet

1479374
vba	vb6
vba vb6 576 chars

1479384
udp	tcp
erlang otp comes with drivers for tcp and udp sockets only

1479398
division	modulo
modulo division is for int

1479399
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m using jquery .load to fetch content from wordpress post and it works in firefox safari and google-chrome but not any of the ies

1479411
python	perl
i would recommend going with python or perl if you swing that way

1479411
shell	bash
the string handling you describe is unpleasant in any shell bash include unless you are using sed or awk.

1479419
32-bit	64bit
again porting 32-bit .app to 64bit

1479464
json	xml
i ve used ipinfodb which may use the same database as maxmind which has straightforward xml and json formats to their api along with google s clientlocation

1479466
display	width
if text line of indeterminate width had in a file had text line-to-reorder and i only wanted to flip and display the order of the first three tokens i can do

1479480
contains	any
you ll have to search the scripting for the import you don t want them to use and reject the scripting in toto if it contains any of them

1479486
row	col	instances	private
say you are writing a grid types control and inside of this control you would most likely have a bunch of contains classes that are created dynamically rows cols headers etc for example say you want to notify these contains classes that something they care about has happend say a skinning change or something like that something that you don t necesarrily want to expose as an event to the grid users this is where private events are handy simply have one or 2 handler and as you create each instances of your row or col or whatever attach the handler as otherwise you just have to write your own observers mechanism not hard but why .when you dont have to and you can just use multicast events

1479493
environment	execution
a quine is a fixed-point of an execution environment .when the execution environment is viewed as a function

1479497
command-prompt	winexe
the whole points is t winexe sets the subsystem flag in the generator binary to a windows executable .so that the command-prompt is not show .when the .app is execute

1479511
value	field
the contents of profileinfo are not updates i would have assumed field like .lpprofilepath should have good value and getuserprofiledirectory fails to find the path obviously - it doesn t exist - i also checked manually and there is nothing under document settings for the new account

1479525
base-class	inherited
you could create a non-templated base-class that inherited

1479552
getattr	setattr
al.so the rules for naming of python variabless are much stricter than the possible set of animal namedd -- you can t include spaces in a variables named for example .so while setattr will happily store the value you d have to use getattr to retrieve it

1479561
selectedindex	selecteditem
use selectedindex or selecteditem or by changing the value of the properties to which those properties are bound

1479563
binary-search-tree	red-black-tree
module avltree binary-search-tree red-black-tree splaytree

1479572
.net	wcf
i have some experience with web-services and little with wcf but i would investigate these two .net technologies

1479574
python	php
i know some higher level languages all web based php javascript some python

1479584
environment	building
by having your software configure under autoconf you should theoretically be able to be able to building it on any systemd that supports a gnu building environment

1479612
gitorious	redmine
depending on whether you want a feature-for-feature clone of github or just somewhere to view git repositories alongside an issue tracker wiki etc. i d recommend either using gitorious the github clone or redmine

1479614
basic	vb6
i ve inherited a vb6 application that makes use of visual basic user document files .dob

1479630
required	checked
basically it means the work required to complete an atomicity action transferring money between two checked account

1479651
firefox	safari
what s weird is that my front-end validation works fine on firefox ie and safari for windows

1479655
.net	wcf
the best equivalent to jms in .net is probably the combinations of wcf with the msmq binding

1479663
folder	dir
i have a folder with three files and want the equivalent of dir s b in powershell

1479666
cvs	git
scm server svn git cvs - central source repository usually

normally there is a set of environment and building are promoted through each stage as they pass testing

1479668
git-rebase	git-merge
i ve been digging through the git-merge and git-rebase docs and something isn t sinking in

1479673
extends	sealed
i tried extends datetime with an implicit operators conversion but found out it was sealed

1479696
.war	jar
one way to solve this is to have the module building a jar and then use the assembly plugins to building a .war file with the jar in web-inf .lib of that .war

1479696
.war	jar
you d be better off having a jar project and a .war project with a parent project building both modules

1479706
while-loop	cursor
for my part however i tend to see a pattern there seems to be a lot of procedural coders who use cursor because they need to be able to do an operation one elements at a time and miss the old fashion while-loop concept

1479706
while-loop	cursor
still not near as fast effective as something set based but 90 of the time .when someone claims i cant do this set based i have to use cursor i can get them to do it with a while-loop

1479719
versioning	staging
in my experience the only concept idea that should matter is that all the environment servers development staging production should be if not exactly alike similar with regards to os webserver versioning service pack patches hotfix etc

1479719
versioning	staging
personally i think staging is the place to test to avoid versioning changes if developers are making changes to development

1479719
versioning	staging
.when the developers get to a certain milestone checkpoint and want to start testing they promote the versioning of their site to staging environment for testers to hammer away at while developers can continue to work in dev

1479719
versioning	staging
once everyone is content with everything in staging they promote the versioning in staging to prod

1479735
baud-rate	parity
inorder to get two serial devices to communication the baud-rate parity and stop bit settings had to all be correct

1479756
expression-blend	silverlight
i am working on a silverlight 3 site using expression-blend 3 silverlight project + website option in expression-blend

1479757
attributes	properties
i was suspicious that there were some kind of attributes for the width and height properties or even the class itself but could not find anything from reflecting the button control

i came across nservicebus rhinobus and masstransit

1480474
versioning	upgrade
why don t you upgrade your oracle versioning

1480476

keep in mind that your complete duration is double what you set in the duration field because the value you specify applies to the forwarding directions

1480483
pointers	stack
keep in mind that automatic object those that live on stack are destroy .when their scoping is left and that pointers to object that live inside another containers might become invalid after modifying the containers

1480485

value	field
you don t have a join between the field sub-query and mytable .so your resultset will contains a row for every value of myfield for the last thirty days

1480549
python	php
if you are using mysql then regardless of whether you are using php or python you can use phpmyadmin

1480552
pointers	stack
therefore you are taking addresses of two local-variables on stack a pointers to int and an int

1480567
show	next
i believe that your ece and cwr tcp flags are contains in the res2 struct member this tcp header image show that the ece and cwr bits ride next to urg

each set contains

1480631
associations	model
i have a model that has two associations to the same other model

1480653
average	median
taking their average should be ok unless you want to avoid the median not being equals to some data points

1480653
average	median
if you are combining many dataset in one go you can either take the median of the median or take their average

1480653
average	median
if there may be significant systematic difference between different the dataset then taking their average is probably better as taking the median reduces the effect of outliers

1480655
python	c++
how i can do this with python or c++

1480657
contains	any
your master page does not contains any td tags .so the tables do not have any displayable content

.doc	xls
the idea is to convert common formats pdf .doc xls etc. to rtf and just show rtf since that is always available and doesn t required any software to be install on the pc

1480795
enumerator	any
using a streaminging binding configuration on client and server with a messagecontract having only a streaming messagebodymember and any other metadata sent as messageheader s would let you do the whole thing in one call without worrying about paging just use an enumerator on the server side to feed the streaming and process individual entities as they appear on the client but you d have to roll your own framing within the streaming eg serialization deserialization entities manually on the streaming with datacontractserializationr or whatever

1480799
.when	ready
normally only .when a feature is complete and ready for integration-testing

1480814
contains	any
if str doesn t contains any comma substring will be the same as str

1480834
required	checked
instead subsequent loads updates do not required installing again your ad hoc provisioning-.profile on the device since it s already there and probably less tests to checked for the .profile matching or not

1480849
background-color	transparency
currently image is always draw over windows background-color even if windows itself is transparency

the function versioning may be a bit less efficient because the compiler is generally unable to inline the function-call

1480971
linux	osx	gnome	kde
by cross platform i mean windows osx and linux gnome kde

1480978
tinyurl	bit.ly

1480999
virtual-machine	vmware
i have a database in a vmware server 2.0 virtual-machine

1481018
python	c++
and if you write it in c++ you ll need months whereas using python you ll be finished much faster and have lots more fun

1481018
python	c++
using c++ could even make it a lot slower because in python you can very easily building more scalability algorithms by using super powerful primitive like hash sets generator etc try several algorithms in 5 minutes to see which one is the best import a libs which already does 90 of the work etc

1481021
boolean	int
i am using an int field in the db to represent collections of boolean inorder to save some spaces

1481021
boolean	int
the int is used in my business-logic and transformed into collections boolean attributes

1481021
boolean	int
i v now decided to add admin section to the site using dynamic data feature and i am wondering whether there is an option to show the boolean that represent that int

1481025
order	add
i would start putting order by s in your query .so it puts them in an order .when it s showing the recording you want as the first one in the list then add the limit

1481030
margins	padding
basically float the image to the left then push the text to the right using margins padding also works

1481033

1481039
show	next
there are 2 button which show next or previous infowindow for markers

1481059
testng	junit
it is composed of various modules which can be used with testng or junit .

1481062
revision	svn
of course revision and pages needs to be stored in svn

1481068
contains	elements	contains	any
the jquery empty selector would work if your ul elements really were empty and didn t contains any white spaces

1481070
parsing	comma
that trailing comma would be a parsing error - in that documentation i believe it is just showing an option value with no default

1481070
localization	translation
the __ function is a language localization function which takes an english language literals string and returns the a translation string for an application-defined locale

1481070
optional-arguments	arguments
in this case most likely the designer of the function wanted a wide range of optional-arguments coupled with the ability to add new arguments without breaking older code

1481077
export	csv
i need to export the output of this program to csv format.....

1481085
contains	elements
it removes all the elementss under the elements with id jsddm which do not contains child nodes

1481109
value	field
is it that date field in mysql doesn t allow value under any circumstances

1481132
scheme	lisp
the reason this process is associated with lisp is because of the highly lucid paper the art of the interpreter which show several metacircular interpreter based on scheme

1481132
prolog	lisp	prolog	forth	forth	lisp
this is also vastly easier to do in a homoiconic language a language whose code can be manipulated as data at runtime such as lisp prolog and forth

1481132
scheme	prolog
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481133
slidedown	slideup
it does the background-position change but not the slideup or slidedown any idea why

1481137
return-type	arguments
as some of you might know msil allows you to make methods that have the same arguments as long as you have different kinds of return-types what is called return-type overloading

1481140
value	field
however the value of the hidden field is not passed to my mail file

1481146
contains	elements
if that s the case changing to use closest li would be a way of navigating backup through the tree to get the contains list elements

1481158
value	field
al.so you are not correctly escaping those value .so if .someone include a â â or other special characters in one of those field it ll break

1481168
font-size	width
i am using the listfield for drawing the text problem is if the size of the text is more then the screens width the remaining text is not appearing.is there any way where i can reduce the font-size for a particular rows whose text content is more to fit in to the listfield drawing region

1481174
double	int
because 1.0 has types double and compiler really doesn t know what types to choose between int and float .so it asks you to give it a hint

i do have an warning about an xml error being ignore because some xsd coudln t be found but it doesn t seem to affect anything

1481177
shutdown	restart
try to shutdown the ri-discovery bundle and restart it but i get a nullpointerexception

1481218
value	field
you could window.setinterval to checked the field against its previous value every say second

1481231
directory	folder
contains the full path to the application model directory and therefore loading is faster since codeigniter doesn t have to look in different folder global application

1481232
primitive-types	reference-type
because this is such a specific corner case which has to be supported for primitive-types such as int - bool and reference-type conversions otherwise you d get a very pedantic language this is handled but not as a case of method-overloading

1481236
value	field
now i wanna to get recording that their createdate field value are more than for instances 1 hour

1481238
triggers	insert
will show you the timing of all insert triggers

1481244

firefox	safari
but i don t think that is possible to make in moderns browsers such as safari och firefox

1481291
dictionary	arrays
it then takes the deserialized arrays and begins to add each arrays elements to its _arrays dictionary

1481291
arrays	loops
in a loops you ll need to checked if the arrays contains each index before accessing it

1481307
json	xml	contains	elements
it can contains xml json yaml binary elements such as a bloom-filter or whatever works for the problem

1481312
simpletest	phpunit
i have never been able to get the simpletest eclipse-plugin to work with phpunit based tests though it s theoretically possible

1481312

1481350
spring	guice
maybe you should close your factory and consider a dependency-injection solution like spring guice or picocontainer

1481381
icollection	ienumerable
.so many time we have a function that accepts an ienumerable or icollection as a parameter

1481381
icollection	ienumerable
but i wonder is there a more elegant way to create the required ienumerable or icollection

1481381
icollection	ienumerable
anyhow how you would pass o1 o2 and o3 to an ienumerable or icollection parameters

1481401
constructor	private	constructor	object	protected	public
in the most simplistic cases there is very little reason to have a public constructor rather than a public static methods that returns a new object and the object only has private protected constructor

1481401

arrays	loops
it could easily be adapted to sit in a loops where you add each image from your arrays to the page in turn

1481740
display	height	display	width
if you want to avoid this then you probably do want to use javascript load the image into your page detection its natural height and width then either use simple arithmetic to scale to .something that will fit within both the width and height or scale .so that at least one is and display the image inside a div with a fixed width and height and a styles of overflow hidden to crop

1482440
python	java
python is one of the faster ones after java

1482440
python	java
now this page show java vs python from the points of view of python

1482440
python	java
.so the speeds range from python being 2x slower than java to 174x slower python generally beats java in code-size and memory usage though

1482440
python	java
another interesting points here--tests that allocated a lot of memory java actually performed significantly better than python in memory size as well

1483302
touchesbegan	gestures
solved it turned out that there should be also touchesbegan and touchesended implementation in my case having empty methods helped in the tile otherwise the gestures started propagating to parent views and they were intercepting the gestures somehow

1483324
binary-search-tree	nodes
any binary-search-tree can be encode by visiting all nodes pre-order and encode a 1 for every parent and a 0 for every leaf

it .sounds like you are most interested in authentication .so read about access-control mechanisms

1483347
puts	gets
i have made it .so .when the user gets a high score it puts the score they got onto the labels but i would now like to know how i can save it .so that .when the .app is opened again it will still have the high score this is my code for detection .when a high score is made

1483368
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to ports an objective-c application to run on linux ubuntu at the moment

1483425
value	field
the current way you have your code means that whenever the form is submitted triggers which means you can t actually tell which button was pressed further more the hidden field you re passing across all have the same named which means the value just gets overwrite by the other hidden field with the same named

1483434
.when	ready
then use javascript to change the styles of the containers .when you are ready

1483442
e-commerce	product
i have a e-commerce site that has 2 types of product books seminars participations

entitymanager	entities
it uses standards jpa annotations to defined entities but exposes a much simpler api no entitymanager or any of that attached detached entities crap

1483456
children	nodes	children	tree
for general non-search binary tree i can see how this would be possible since .when building up the tree there are three choices the amount of children for every nodes only restrict by having the total reach exactly n

1483456
binary-search-tree	tree
on the other hand since insert into a binary-search-tree is well-defined you can represent an entire tree of n elements by having a list of n numbers in a specific insert order

1483456
division	modulo
the ones that use modulo and division operations

1483467
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
the required ado.net entity-framework model has been generator and the required stored-procedures has been mapped

1483479

1483487
required	checked
this checked is only required for older versioning of webkit

1483494
formatting	printing

1483515
getter	setter
scalas getter and setter may also relate to your magic

1483529
type-safety	generics
if we didn t have generics we would have to either throw away type-safety and use a single list class which just stores object s but then there would be nothing to prevent me from storing an apple in a list of banana s

1483538
lighttpd	apache
assuming that you re building a web-browser i d suggest using your own computer as a server using apache lighttpd whether windows linux or mac

1483549
linked-list	arrays
it construct a linked-list of int arrays which contains the actual data - you can see the use of that linked-list in the code at the end that dump out the table

value	field
have a hidden-field in your form and then set the value of that field to the button named or whatever you want to use to pass the cmd to the server in your boxy callback

1483562
put	get
this means that .when you put something into ets it is copy-paste into it and .when you take it out you get a copy in your process

1483562
put	get
.so .when you look things up in it you get a reference to the exact same value you put in it

1483567

1483581
viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload
.when restoring the scroll positioning using scrollrecttovisible animated i need the table view to already have sufficient data in it or else the scrollrecttovisible animated methods call does nothing which is what happens if you place the call on its own in any of viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1483611
ironpython	ironruby
i would have hoped at this points in time that more work be done on creating such an environment with ironruby ironpython

1483670
value	field
i m trying to randomize the value for a simple datetime data field

1483690
value	field
the data in the tables is such that every field in the table has the value fieldname + rowcount .so column a in row 1 contains the value a1

1483702
php-extension	imagick
another solution might be to call the convert command-line utility it comes with imagick -- independantly of any php-extension using something like execute to call it

1483725
oracle	mysql
which is the correct hint to do a selected for updates as known for oracle db2 mysql

1483727

factors	matrix
you have to consider multiple factors .so decision will be lying in a matrix and you have to feed multiple things and you will get your answer i would enlist .some feature

1483744
getter	setter
getter setter related

1483767
shell	bash
or a bash git shell

1483787
header-only	boost
i would think that _crtdbg_map_alloc should work with header-only libs in boost shared_ptr as they are implements in the headers

1483788
multiplication	addition
it required only a few decisions followed by a multiplication and addition and can approximate any curve

1483792
xmlhttprequest	cors
however cross-domain restrictions still apply if you re doing javascript-based request ajax xmlhttprequest if the originating server doesn t set the appropriate cors headers to allow cross-domain javascript access you ll need to proxy that xml request via your own server

1483792
external	embed
mad s answer uses entity references to cleverly embed external xml in a contains document

1483801
haxe	mxml
haxe will also compile on the server but is much less resource intensive than mxml .

1483802
selected	textbox
a good approuch would to use the master-detail pattern - bind the master the items view combobox to the datasource collections and the detail view textbox to the selected item in the source collections using a binding converter to read write the appropriate properties

1483819
push	pull
i m looking for a cross-platform tool to support performing an operation on multiple repo at the same time tag pull push commit etc... essentially i m looking for the repo scripting that google wrote for android but for hg instead of git

1483828
jython	pypy
cython ironpython jython and pypy can all run django other implementation might also be complete enough for that but i m not certain

1483830
python	java

derived-class	base-class
some tutorials say without the keyword virtual both the derived-class and base-class object invoke the base-class function

1483888
contains	any
do not contains any data-members

1483900
contains	lookup
each c++ class that has at least one virtual function contains a virtual table or vtable which is used to dynamically lookup the address of a function at runtime

1483900
derived-class	base-class	defined	declare
that is .when the function is declare as virtual and another function in a derived-class replace the original function that was defined in the base-class

1483900
derived-class	base-class
that is a function in the derived-class is called instead of the one in the base-class simply because it is closer in scoping but it has not truly replace the function that was defined in the base-class

1483907
internet-explorer	google-chrome
the same does not happen in internet-explorer 7 neither in google-chrome

1483935
value	field
thus just as limits are used in the calculus we can take the value as being the value - the study of chaotics show us finite limits may turn on themselves producing tensor field that provide the illusion of absolute s and which can be run as long as there is time and energy

1483935
synchronous	.when
there is an almost unavoidable blip there .when the body wakes up but it is just like .when the doorbell ring speaking of which bring an interesting area of statistical research to funding availability how many thoughts can one maintain synchronous

1483947
any	set
if the report header looks to be suppressed you need to checked the section expert for the suppress checkedbox associated with the report header section it can be set conditional - kill the button next to the suppress checkedbox to see if there s any code

1483959
triggers	insert
i created a triggers on that table before insert and and it works great

1483990
parsing	comma
is there a way to use the comma as a delimiter to parsing this line into an arrays or something

1483998
callback	methods
this methods registers for callback

1483998
callback	methods
if you do not have callback you don t need to call this methods

1484017
silverlight	wpf
i used wpf briefly and it obviously has the datatrigger which seems to cover this but it is missing in silverlight

1484039
sftp	ftp
it does code autocomplete and works on ftp sftp

1484074
linux	bsd
if yo are fortunate enough to have access to a nix systemd such as linux or one of the bsd s you could take a look at dap an open source statistics package that should be able to run this types of programs

1484080
debian	linux
i m on shared server environment dreamhost.com uses linux debian

1484082
nstextview	nswindow
is there any way i could dim my nswindow basically putting a black transparency layer over top of it that you cannot click through and then layer a custom nstextview on top

1484098
javascript	dom
pure dom javascript solution

1484099
variables	boolean
this is where the setting for telling the generator to use is for the getter on boolean variables

1484153
fogbugz	redmine	fogbugz	trac	fogbugz	svn	redmine	trac
i m the author of bugtracker.net which like many other bug trackers trac redmine fogbugz integrated with svn

1484153
fogbugz	svn
edit i ve taken a look at one attempt at github-fogbugz integration but even the author of that says it s fairly obvious that fogbugz was written for a more traditional cvs svn scm system.in mind

1484156
administration	account
in addition you must run visual-studio in the context of an administration account

1484156
32-bit	64bit
using iis7 vs2008 32-bit vista ultimate 64bit

1484161
session-storage	cookies
now let me move on to what i think you want to be asking what s the difference between ruby-on-rails default session-storage which uses an un-encrypted cookies and phusion s encryptedcookiesstore or any other encrypted-cookies session-storage implementation

1484185
header-only	boost
if you can use the boost libs www.boost.org look at the conversion libs - it s a header-only include

1484223
python	c++
i have been trying p2p communication using python c++ winsock c# but could only succeeded with python only difference i could observe is such types of specific recording with python

1484235
value	field
how do i replace all field from the same column that match a specified value

1484235
value	field
how to delete all field from the same column that match a specified value

1484251
selected	listbox
the idea is that the frame display contact information about the currently selected contact in a listbox

1484254
subclassing	superclass
to retrieve an object from the database the superclass and subclassing tables are joined

1484260
nsinteger	int
numeric typess such as int and float may be intentionally missing inorder to encourage the use of nsinteger or nsnumber but the void types is still used all the time and should really appear in the list of suggestions

1484309
silverlight	wpf
binding errors are written directly to trace.write and the wpf sourceupdated targetupdated events are not available in silverlight

1484311
cosine	sine
sqlite doesn t have math functions like sine cosine etc

1484315
arrays	loops
i m using jquery to parsing an xml file and i m trying to push each elements in the xml file to an arrays using a jquery .each loops

1484315
arrays	loops
strangely if i alert the value of the arrays within loops it comes out as it should but if i try to alert a value in the arrays after loops has finished it results in undefined

1484315
arrays	loops
is there something strange that happens .when you push value to an arrays within this kind of a loops

1484321
transactional	audit-trail
i would continue to log account transactional - it s an audit-trail for both the developer and the client

1484343
python	java
you probably have problems because even though lisp is pass-by-value references to object are passed like in java or python

1484344
synchronous	.when
your code works well only for synchronous mode .when thread wait for server response

1484359
g++	gcc
consider using g++ instead of gcc which automaticaly sets the correct settings .when compiling c++

1484360
json	xml	arguments	default
i think yahoo boss returns the results in json by default unless you explicit pass a format xml arguments to the request

1484373
dictionary	map
there also comes a points where assuming that the map is pre-built mapping types to methods with a dictionary will be faster than traversal a linear list of types which is essentially what using a bunch of if blocks gets you

1484391
contains	any
is just an operators which is just a methods and like any other methods you can either pass in a literals value or a variables contains a value

1484397
maintainability	conventions
what will happen on larger code base is the two will diverge over time and create maintainability issues that yield to java s named of class as types of class typing conventions that forces you to resolve the issue somehow

1484402
instances	self
.when i recieve memory warning i call self deleteobjects which deletes all the instances which are retaning the value for the current controllers

1484410
subtract	add
in other words whenever you add or subtract to it then checked if it s greater than 90 and set it to 90 or if it s less than -90 then set it to -90

1484412
contains	elements
silverlight doesn t contains a datatemplatesselectedor which is used to selected a data templates based on the databound elements and the data object

1484421
double	int
i m thinking of precalculating in milimetres which means the key could be an int the value would be a double

1484438
account	in-app
my iphone application has in-app purchases and those have been tested using the itunes connect test user account

1484443
order	add
with some proper subclassing you can add order to it

1484458
selected	button
my guess is that i have to somehow increment the selected row on tapping the button

1484459
put	get
you get the idea that all you care about is being a and you put less emphasis on the actual implementation

1484462
required	checked
how do i required and checked that an arguments is a certain concept in c++

1484463
value	field
option use two field - username and passwd - but make the user also just a static value like the passwd

1484473
binary-search-tree	binary-tree
the binary-tree here is may not necessarily be a binary-search-tree

1484473
postorder	inorder
the complexity for this algorithm i believe is o n o n for inorder postorder traversal the rest of the step again being o n since they are nothing more than simple iterator in arrays

1484502
bucket-sort	in-place
bucket-sort is definitely not an in-place sorting algorithm

1484515
32-bit	64bit
i am using a 64bit os .so how much you can store on my machine is different than on a 32-bit machine

1484524
show	next
.so all you need after that is to show the next or previous entry

1484544
reflection	runtime
it will suffice you to have runtime typechecking somewhere in your code inorder to enact reflection which in its turn will want to have the full trust

1484557
spring	jsf
i have no running background threads that i have started from the application though i use ehcache which runs cleanup threads in the background spring hibernate and jsf

1484579
debian	linux
as i commented above all your examples are working as you expect on my linux box debian lenny python2.5 process 0.52 see test code below

1484580
any	set
usually you want a list or a set or any other collections types - and you really do not care in your code how exactly this is implements

1484600
.when	ready
.when you are ready in eclipse extraction methods

1484623
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod -r 777 variables www

1484639
contains	elements
you d simply need to push a form on each page with one elements contains all your data that you ll append to each form once it s getting submitted

1484639
value	field
if you wouldn t like to use jquery.metadata you can make as many hidden field with named value pairs on the _settings form and it would still work

1484652
constructor	object
guice will just use the a constructor any time it needs to create or inject an a object

1484665
derived-class	base-class
the problem is that in the derived-class you are hiding the protected methods in the base-class

1484681
priority-queue	queue
you can use a priority-queue to keep tracking of the incoming and outgoing work and instrumentation the systemd to keep tracking of the queue size globally and for each nodes

1484693
stdin	eof
this works but what i m really looking to do is read from stdin until eof is encountered and then pass all the input at once to the function

1484705
implements	abstract
but if it s really a simulation and what you want are the analysis results implements an actual distribute model would be a horribly complex approach that is likely to yield far less data than an abstract simulation would that is the simulation itself doesn t have to be a network of asynchronous actors communication

1484706
stdin	eof
you ll have to do the pre-buffering yourself read stdin until eof is seen and then pass one long string probably constisting of n-separated line to your function

1484708
constructor	private	constructor	object
i have a class with a private constructor and a submit methods to carefully control the object created and every object created is added to a global list

1484723
value	field
with that in mind you could use inherited mapping to create a single table that holds all of the value that are common between item typess as well as a types field seminar product

1484724
textbox	button
my problem is each time i hit the test button only one textbox is created

1484728
value	field
as i said previously the file is loosely defined - aka i don t required all or any of the field and the value don t have to be in any specific order

1484733
stdin	pipe
all this is just the same set of issues that you must deal with for stdin - the only possible difference being that stdin coming from a terminal will give you short reads for each line of input whereas each read from a pipe will give you a short read for the size of the pipe buffering or the atomicity writes smaller than the buffering size and a plain disk file will only usually give you a short read on the last block of a file

1484733
realloc	malloc
since your function cannot tell ahead of time how much spaces is needed certainly not for the pipe or terminal input you have to be prepare to deal with dynamic-memory-allocation - malloc and realloc

1484733
fwrite	fclose
i choose to ignore the possibility that fwrite and fclose might fail

1484759
any	set
is there any way to set the desired quality

1484773
value	field
generally if the value can change or you need other tables to relate to it i would recommend having a designated id field

1484796
temporary	copy
your working copy normally contains a lot of additional temporary files such as object code and precompiled-headers that are not required to be revision controlled

1484801
nagios	cacti
nagios or cacti

1484803
firefox	safari
tested in firefox 3.5.3 safari ie8 chrome.

1484808
value	field
if you want reliability just create an arrays of possible value and iterate through them checked your field against them to see if there s a match

1484813
filtering	sorting
the sample is very basic since it only works for paging but could be easily extended to include sorting and filtering

1484814
sql-server	oracle
can you please give some tips or guidelines best practices for microsoft sql-server to oracle data migration

1484819
getter	setter
b if you do map onto properties getter and setter do not need to be public

1484861
callback	methods
but .when i try to register a callback to an as3 methods in my javascript api i get stuck

1484861
callback	methods
i wrote a little javascript methods which takes the named of the function and creates the callback from the javascript side

1484861
callback	methods
or does anyone have a better idea how to create callback for my as3 methods which can be called by javascript

1484881
defined	declare
really not sure about that but maybe the order that you declare map your servlets defined precedence

1484887
simpletest	phpunit
i haven t worked in php before but from what i ve seen you may want to consider simpletest or phpunit

1484915
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
tested in latest ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1484929
mac-address	ethernet
the mac-address of an ethernet interface typically doesn t change even across formats only if the user changes ethernet interface card

1484930
attributes	properties
that doesn t invoke the retain attributes of the properties

1484932
windows-server	windows
for example they give windows-server 2008 but i found it useless because i asked many hosting companies and they told me that getting hosting with its windows is a must and they don t allow others to install os

1484950
cout	cin
however most of the programs we are writing make use of cin and cout for input output

1484950
cout	cin
cout works fine as output as you can see what it puts out in the application output but there is no way to provide to cin as if it were on a console like visual-studio uses for its c++

1484984
python	php
note that you are closer to the bare-metal here than in python or php .so the usage isn t as simple

1484993
executable	jar
it appears to be a standards java jar executable

1485018
stderr	stdout
you can use glib.io_add_watch to watch for output on the pipe connect to stdout and stderr in the subprocess object

1485023
calayer	uiview
and don t worry about the memory impact of a uiview that s 320x480 pixels it won t consume any significant memory because the calayer doesn t have any meaningful content

1485049
.when	ready
the ide monodevelop is a decent tool but it is not ready for hard-core development .when you roll debugging into the mix

1485049
linux	osx
platform windows seems to have the best experience then linux then osx

1485049
linux	osx
however i don t find windows development on mono .so much better than linux and or osx

1485049
linux	osx
nonetheless i m a huge proponent of seeing robust mono support on other platform including osx for development and linux for deployment

1485051
sqldatasource	gridview
here is the code from my example - nothing tricky here just bound a string arrays to a repeater and bound the gridview to a sqldatasource with the selected and delete cmd specified

1485052
google-chrome	safari
browsers like safari and google-chrome animate this without any glitches

1485058
profiling	trace
updates you could kick off a profiling trace ms sql-server 2008 - how can i log and find the most expensive queries

1485073
any	set
ultimately i would look at it this way a dsl like any programming language is a set of lexical tokens and idioms that you can use to explain how to do something

1485073
cos	sin
i would think of a libs of functions as say the set of math functions that exist in most modern languages sin cos square root and .so forth

1485086
.net	wcf
as long as you re using a versioning of .net that supports it you should be looking at the windows communication foundation wcf

1485905
integration-testing	automated-tests
some people consider this to be integration-testing instead of unit tests but in my book it doesn t matter too much what you call it - the most important thing is that you get value out of your fully automated-tests and you can definitely use a unit-testing framework to drive those tests

a class that doesn t contains any code is definitely a code-smell..

1486171
subclassing	superclass
this is because on the superclass you can t express that subclassing are either leaf or branch

1486182
jvisualvm	jvm
i would adjust your application logging to verboser levels or tweak the jvm as pointed before but if you want more options you can try jvisualvm to watch something weird memory thread gc jmx operations and in the last chance i would search for hs_err_pid .log files

try to building and test on both environment every day

1486404

there s just a slight difference on the behavior if you forget error-handling if you don t catch the exception-handling there s no assignment and the left hand side variables keeps it old value

1486518
exception-handling	try-catch
but in the end he just replace the numberformatexception-handling by an operationnotsupported exception-handling - again you need a try-catch to handle unparsable input

1486524
value	field
the complication in this case is that you ll need a comparison function-object which acts like operators with a stored or referenced value but which only looks at the key field of your struct

1486524
variables	boolean
if you can t put the sort in your apps initialisation you might need an already-sorted boolean static variables to ensure you only sort once

the issue is that the way you re joining most of everything is joining to your left outer-joined table whenever you re joining off of that if the value in the outer joined table is nothing there is nothing for the other field to join to

1487056
unsafe	out
btw i would just go unsafe here and use a for-loop to to zero out the additional memory

1487057
any	set
if you can set the input variables hairpreference to null instead of any then it gets easier

1487060
any	set
in the long run that will be the cheapest because paying someone to learn a new set of tools will be much more expensive than any other costs that might be associated wit ha particular set of software

subclassing	superclass
you could argue that the superclass is not well-designed for subclassing at least not in the way you want to

1487311
subclassing	superclass
it s even worse - this problem can happen to you even if you don t overrides methods in the superclass - see subtyping vs subclassing

1487319

expression-blend	silverlight
.so downloading expression-blend start a new silverlight project place a control on the design surface and start fiddling around with it

1487478
triggers	insert
there is no way to directly cound the numbers of triggers on the insert

1487478
triggers	insert
you could analyse the logfile or you could alter your triggers as the triggers acts on insert to write an entry in a log table with auto_increment id and datetime

1487494
base-class	inherited
its also quite reasonable for code in the inherited base-class to access its count properties and get what it expects

1487504

subprocess	pexpect
pexpect anywhere but windows and wexpect on windows are always my recommendations .when you need to defeat buffering and read a subprocess s output in near real-time as you put it

1487558
gethashcode	equals
you need to overrides equals and gethashcode .so that your types are compared by their value rather then by their references

1487559
gethashcode	equals
but i think you ll need your own gethashcode and equals methods

if the byte string was built as a serialization object via pickle or maybe marshalling etc then you can deserialize it back to an object using pickle.loads and then introspect to your heart s content

1487643
attributes	properties
in python it is easy enough to refactor the class providing the attributes using the special properties function

1487643
attributes	properties
this is transparency to the clients of this class ie. they cannot usually tell and should not care whether the properties reference is handled by providing access to the actual object attributes or by means of magic getter-setter functions and it can be applied later if it turns out to be required that is

1487651
selected	checkbox
for example instead of having a multitude of checkbox for option 1 option 2 option 3 etc in the main gui only show the selected options and give the user a way to open a configuration windows .when they need to change something

1487658
internet-explorer	firefox
i also noticed that the error only occurs in internet-explorer firefox seems to get the event

1487704
quadtree	map
.so far i have implements quadtree that returns the four boundaries of my map and returns whatever coordinates are within the viewable section of the map

1487709

however if you d rather retrieve that value from a constants defined in hibernateaccessor you need to configure fieldretrievingfactorybean properly by specifying the named of field you re retrieving as staticfield properties

1487710
3-tier	n-tier
as a pattern you ll find discussions of this under headings like 3-tier or n-tier design

1487717
instances	self
besides fixing many other bugs in the above which i assume are accidental init must be __init__ you re missing several instances of self misindentation etc etc the key bit is to make the registration in manager.py into

1487724
reflection	runtime
however i still think there s scoping for a complete replacement for built-in serialization without having to write and maintain any custom code - this can t be done at runtime because reflection is needed to query object and access private data

1487733
temporary	copy
this link can be to a permanent downloading which is the to hell with it approach to piracy or it can be a link to a temporary copy of the mp3 that you place on your site which you can remove after a day or two or whenever

1487735
webforms	asp.net
by webforms you mean it s all inside the asp.net form-tag or do you have an asp.net form like formview nested inside

1487756

.so what you might be seeing is that windows is matching the hostname to the ip-address of the main interface

1487762
linux	unix
stlsoft provides among other things thin cross-platform windows and linux unix c++ wrapper around os-specific apis

1487773
mstest	nunit
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

1487773
mstest	nunit
what i basically have to answer to justify using nunit in preferences to mstest is this is there anything that i can do in nunit that i can t do with comparable effort in mstest

1487778
rollback	commit
using composition you can create a temporary and do the assignment with commit rollback logic assuming a correct construction of the object

1487778
derived-class	inherited
but if you use inherited you ll probably do something like inside the of the derived-class

1487784
subclassing	superclass
yes subclassing can break superclass in various ways

1487784
subclassing	superclass
the best you can do is to act at human level - make sure that the human that writes the subclassing understands the superclass

1487785
python	ruby
the way you do parameterized tests in ruby and python is to dynamically create the test methods

1487796
.when	ready
it might checked for foreign key constraints .when it is ready to commit as against column constraints which can be checkeded independently somewhat

1487800
credentials	account
can i configure credentials as command-line arguments to nservicebus.host.exe or run as local systemd account

1487815
malloc	free
i found the issue free -ing malloc -ed memory and delete -ing new -ed memory is not safe in the same program

1487821
hide	show
however the height of the div changes dynamically as pieces of a series of nested-lists show and hide themselves on hover events

1487830
radio-button	selected
the groupingnamed is just an alias for the standards named properties of a radio-button and is used .so .when a user click on a radio-button in a grouping only one radio-button can be selected

1487840
python	c++
i m asking for a c++ versioning of python foostring.find x02 x00 x01 x04

1487850
firefox	safari
is there a reason firefox and safari on my mac are skipping over the elements .when i tab between field in this form

1487852
memcheck	valgrind
however the first thing i do on linux if i suspect it could be a memory error is to run the program through valgrind memcheck and see what it can tell me

1487868
textbox	button
i m writing a very simple application in javafx where there is a single button with a textbox on the stage as one scene.now the behavior i want is that .when i click the button i can load another scene with another button and a textbox on the stage and remove the button i click alongwith the previous textbox

1487958
value	field
where the two tables have no unifiedkey field value in common

1487959
parentheses	braces
unclosed parentheses brackets braces etc would be a problem

1487969
ref	out
i cannot figure out why i keep getting a null ref on filename .when i m clearly calling this singleton and it should be calling the logger to set the filename variables

1487982
getter	setter
this.fubar.bgroup call the getter returns a boolgroup and with .a true you are calling the setter of the a properties of boolgroup

1487998
constructor	private
static initilaizers are execute .when the class definition is first accessed which in your case means they are execute before your private constructor

1488041
servicecontract	datacontract
similarly the servicecontract operationcontract datacontract data-members and other wcf attributes don t make your code become a web service...they simply make it possible to plug your code into wcf which in turn makes it a web service

1488047
launchd	daemons
but once it is run as a in production as a system-level launchd daemons under a different user the growl messages no longer appear

1488052
value	field
i could put a readonly properties that returns a hardcode string to the named of the field on each class but then i d have to create an instances of each one to checked the properties value

1488060
contains	elements
in this requirement i am supposed to create an xml file that in certain places between the elements contains a binary null-character

1488063
triggers	insert
if you wish to persue the two seperate unifiedset tables idea you d need to change the seed value of unifiedsettwomap .when an insert happens on unifiedsetonemap and vice versa using a triggers on each

1488080
binary	hex
a binary null-character is one that s all zero 0x00 in hex

create your user-controls ascx file

1488184
required	checked
.when a new configuration line is required just checked it into the templates and notify the other developers they need to merge it with their local copies

1488184
configuration	environment
or maybe look at abstracting the configuration file into one that changes with each environment db connection etc. and one that doesn t change constants language variables etc. and that can be part of the repo

1488189
execute	prepare
i went ahead and ran a test where one query uses a prepare statement and the other building the entire query then execute that

1488203
postback	ajax
they seem to be suggesting a plain vanilla web .app that doesn t use ajax or rely on .net postback or do anything that might make it break down horribly if your connection goes away for a bit

1488206
social	rating
social coding large collections of community-created programs with rating systemd that kids can use to get new ideas figure out how to solve particular problems or shared their creations with their peer

1488219
memcached	apc
it supports apc memcached file etc as backends a.k.a storage

1488230

anyway .when you are trying to insert at positioning 1 the second elements you get an exception-handling because the list does not contains any elementss

1488245
value	field
the confirm alert will only activate if the file named does not contains a value from one of the other form field

1488269

credentials	account
2. can i configure credentials as command-line arguments to nservicebus.host.exe or run as local systemd account

1488276
kerberos	ldap
i know i need to use kerberos for authentication and ldap for authentication

1488281
contains	lookup
for the second time you lookup for one same typenamed it will cost picking a reference to a global std string contains the named

1488282
debugging	exit
instead the ide instantly exit debugging mode and the test is listed as failed leaving me to consult the test result s stack-trace to find the problem

1488327
digits	base
if you need it to be unique i d suggest creating a counter and converting the int numbers to hex or even better base 36 26 chars + 10 digits

1488337
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s trivial to building the things you mention with webforms although i would go for asp.net-mvc in a larger project

1488343
attributes	properties
i added one test properties and added the themeable false attributes

1488343
attributes	properties
if i add the stylesheettheme attributes to the pages tag in web-config the skins stuff works including getting the error if i try to set the non-themeable properties

1488345
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
.so you shouldn t use argumentexception or argumentnullexception

1488351
mime	rfc
spaces is needful for most users but if you can get away from using it there are parsing issues that improve reliability you can read rfc s on mime multi-part internet mail extensions to get a taste of what is involved

1488384
contextmenu	icons
i would like to use mainmenu and contextmenu in my winforms .app and put icons next to some of the menu items

1488384
contextmenu	icons
what s the best way to get icons on a mainmenu or contextmenu and still play nice with theming

1488390
instances	private
both of these are private and have instances variables properties assignments

1488391
specifications	w3c
nope -- khronos grouping tends to publishing specificationsifications much later in the dev process than w3c or whatwg i d suggest looking at the webkit webgl tests as i believe webkit s implementation currently matches the specifications more closely but neither is perfect yet -

1488406
if-statement	loops
if you want to keep your function add a if-statement around loops checked the types of results with a is_resource for example

1488407
getter	setter	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
.so throw argumentnullexception in the setter on null and argumentexception on the empty string and do nothing in the getter

1488407
value	field
since the setter throw and only you have access to the backing field it s easy to make sure it won t contains an invalid value

1488407
getter	setter
replace the properties by methodss a setter methods that throw .when passed an invalid value and a getter methods that throw invalidoperationexception .when the properties was never assign a valid value

1488432
search-engine	seo
however if you are creating a website where the main content area changes for each of the top-level menu items using ajax this is a bad idea for several reasons first and what i consider to be very important seo search-engine optimization is

1488432
jquery	dojo	mootools	extjs
lastly each browser interpreter javascript differently and with the more javascript you write the more potential there is for losing cross browser compatibility unless you implements a framework that such as jquery dojo extjs or mootools that handles most of that for you

1488434
freebsd	linux	linux	unix
this is basically using the unix selected call although both freebsd and linux provide more optimized alternatives such as kqueue

1488435
any	set
you could use any of the many java ssh client libs such as javassh as long as the linux machine runs an sshd and the firewalls are all set to let ssh traffic through which is likely to be the case

1488435
dsa	rsa	private-key	rsa	private-key	dsa
there are many possible ways to configure ssh authentication basically boiling down to either sending passwd securely on the .net or using public private-key pairs rsa or dsa -- the latter is generally preferable but you ll need to checked with systemd and .network administration about this issue.

1488438
margins	padding
.so you have to let the width default to â autoâ which means â 100 minus any margins padding and borderâ and then use margins or padding on the middle elements of the same size as the left and right elementss

1488440
authentication	login
if the login is incorrect and some text is filled in the username textbox after the login i receive the wrong username or passwd messages which is good but if i fill in the form again no matter wheather it is correct or not i get you are not authentication to access that location. if i try to log for the third time the login works but i am redirected to users post instead of post the value for the redirect page which is stored in a session is still post

1488445
getter	setter
or hit alt + ins inside the surrounding class and you ll get all the options for generator getter and or setter you can think of -

1488449
csv	xml
it s been a while since i ve worked with sql-server but if memory serves be correctly you can use ssis in sql 2005 2008 or dts if you re still on 2000 to delete the data and import from a text csv xml file into the database every hour or whatever scheduling you want

1488453
multi-user	account
we re building a multi-user platform where each registered user has a google .app account with their email and calendar

1488472
getter	setter
.when is it appropriate to throw an exception-handling from within a properties getter or setter

1488474
pointers	stack
.so all your variables are throw away and the function starts fresh but you didn t push a new return pointers onto stack

1488474
execution	exit
.so .when you eventually exit by returning a value rather the doing another test then that return location is popped from stack and execution resumes in your calling function

1488480
directory	folder
let ftp users access a folder outside of your web directory and then provide a mechanism for retrieving the file contents

1488483
javadoc	doxygen
if you are writing internal developer documentation use automated internal source code-documentation javadoc doxygen .net annotations etc for source level documentation and a project wiki for design level documentation

1488488
exception-handling	error-handling
for setter they indicate that exception-handling are an appropriate and acceptable error-handling strategy

1488488
getter	setter
for indexers microsoft indicates that it is acceptable for both getter and setter to throw exception-handling

1488498
getter	setter
it is almost never appropriate on a getter and sometimes appropriate on a setter

1488527
versioning	upgrade
i want to know which dependency i ve got to rebuild with the new versioning of another libs that i upgrade

1488558
value	field
i made the properties setter private to avoid modifying the value after object-construction except for the quantity that might change later it would be even better to use readonly properties but they first come in c# 4.0 and using readonly backing field adds quite a bit of noise to the code

1488570
constructor	object	put	get
but it is also generally considered to be a good idea to design your classes such that it is simply not possible to get an invalid object initially or to put it into invalid state via normals means always ensure full initialization in constructor and try make methods exception-safe with respect to state validity and class invariants

1488584
manpage	bsd
it does say on apple s mac os x manual page for atoi 3 and in the bsd manpage too that atoi has been deprecated

1488584
strtol	atoi
the atoi function has been deprecated by strtol and should not be

1488584
strtol	atoi
i would use the strtol equivalent just for that reason but i doubt you have to worry about atoi being removed

1490185
put	get
it s been a while but istr having to use get and .post for everything .when using these no restful put and delete

1490209
any	bag	contains	any
even using a state monad the return-value contains at least conceptually a bag of all relevant state including any changes the function just made

1490217
expression-blend	silverlight
i m building a prototype using expression-blend 3 and sketchflow a silverlight sketchflow application to be specific and it consists of multiple screens that i want to shared state between

getter	setter
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

1490225
getter	setter
this is simple contrived example to discuss using getter setter vs variables

1490227
put	get
to get backup and put file with status

1490233
populate	row
the listview is populate with every row in the database

1490248
getter	setter
discuss using getter setter vs

1490248
getter	setter
you shouldn t write plain getter setter because they are as bad as exposing the variables them selves

1490250
ruby-on-rails	django
for example if your main job is coding asp.net in c# read stuff about functional-programming f# haskell other web-frameworks like django ruby-on-rails etc

1490253
getter	setter
calling virtual-functions in ctors is a bad idea but setter and getter are unlikely to be virtual

1490253
getter	setter
benefits if the setter getter does something complicated you re not repeat code

1490253
getter	setter
for immutable classes of course you don t have setter and you don t need getter as const members and references can be public as no one can change reseat them

1490263
getter	setter
same with setmystring if the answer is yes you are better off with access methods since you don t have to change your code in zillion places but just modify those getter and setter methods

1490264
javafx	swing
most of the desktop-application development i do is in swing and i m curious to hear people s thoughts on using javafx and or adobe flex for building desktop-applications

1490268
quirks-mode	doctype
and make sure you ve got all this with a valid doctype at the very start of your content to prevent quirks-mode - i generally throw in a reset to make sure it s the first thing

1490274
fadeout	show
have you tried to have it show on hover then fadeout slow on mouseout

1490282
stderr	stdout
i m pretty certain that stdout even if it s not line buffering like stderr will autoflush if you attempt to read from stdin at least in most environment i ve used which is a few

1490282
buffering	streaming
.when a streaming is fully bufferinging characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the hosts environment as a block .when a buffering is filled

1490282
buffering	streaming
.when a streaming is line buffering characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the hosts environment as a block .when a newline character is encountered

1490282
buffering	streaming
as initially opened the standard-error streaming is not fully buffering

1490282
buffering	streaming
the standards input and standards output streaminging are fully buffering if and only if the streaming can be determined not to refer to an interactive device

1490286
data-members	mutators	data-members	private
for example you could have your class your private data-members and then take a minimalist approach by reducing public functions to only accessor and or mutators for your private data-members

1490294
checkbox	button
.so lets say i want to delete item no 1 .so i checked the checkbox then .when i pressed the delete button

1490295
any	set
i can t find any clear instructions on how to set the root path

1490300
click	mouse
once a user has used this form a couple of time they will stop seeing it as a random collections of controls and instead start perceiving it as an interface that lets them see every piece of information that they required at a glance and that lets them do everything they need to do with a few mouse click

1490301
response	timeout
you probably also want to set a timeout to cope with a slow jsonp response

1490304
value	field
value for the enhanced key usage field

1490327
activation	account
required them to register then login to vote on the poll can have email activation for account

1490330
getter	setter
as it s written right now with no qualification of the input or output your getter and setter acces.sor and mutators if you prefer are accomplishing ab.solutely nothing .so you might as well just make the string public and be done with it

1490330
getter	setter
this gives a real improvement over using a setter and getter in a surrounding class

1490330
getter-setter	setter
first and foremost .when you put those in a surrounding class it s easy for code inside that class to bypass the getter-setter losing enforcement of whatever the setter was supposed to enforce

1490330
getter	setter
using a getter and a setter forces you to write code that s just plain ugly and hard to read

1490330
getter	setter
but look what happens if that string is part of a class that forces us to go through a getter and setter

1490331
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
however i m trying to use it now in another .app where i have a secondary windows that pops open and gets initializer with the view and while i get mouse move evets i don t seem to get any mouse click or keyboard for that matter events whatsoever

1490331
click	mouse
.when i click and drag on the view the entire windows move which im guessing has to do why i dont get any mouse events

1490338
postgresql	mysql
you can import or query your data into any of these programs from your db and most of these programs include routines to let you query a lot of dbs directly sql mysql postgresql and therefore enabling you to automate the process of extraction data-mining and visualizing graphing your data with impunity

1490340
getter	setter
an object isn t simply a bag of setter and getter that other code does stuff to

1490340
getter	setter
if you follow this approach to oo then carrying meyers advice to the extreme as you did hurts encapsulation rather than helping it you end up exposing all of the class s internal implementation variables via getter and setter instead of hiding them .so that only the class s methods the code responsible for doing stuff on behalf of the class which is the only rea.son you have a class to begin with can get to it

1490342
cakephp	kohana
that being said you might want to look into kohana and cakephp - they re not overly bloated imo and they will definitely save you time should you decide not to write your own

1490364
textbox	button
one guess mac os by default does not make button focusable with tab-- only textbox and lists

1490364
firefox	safari
maybe firefox and safari are merely respecting this setting

1490383
attributes	properties
.when using properties with the retain attributes you don t use the simple assignment

1490384
filesystems	fat
for performance purposes i want to know if there is a stored hash checksum for each file in ntfs fat filesystems

1490391
type-safety	generics
the disadvantage of option #4 with generics tuples classes is it isn t much better than returning a collections the only gain is type-safety

1490436
repository	entity
for example the website will have linq-to-sql and ado entity frame work classes implements then using the factory-method will use one of these orms using configuration value to load the data in the repository object

1490441
children	nodes
after you ve parsing all your line the only children of the root will be nodes that have appeared in the parent column and not the child column

1490454
debugging	exit
i ve tried a try-catch around the code which seems to stop the debugging windows appearing but i can t seem to get it to exit the scripting with a failed status that will cause the package to fail

1490455
javafx	swing
i would say that javafx can be seen as a kind of extension of swing with a new way of developing a java gui by using a declarative-programming language the javafx scripting

1490455
json	xml
javafx scripting code looks exactly like a json scripting unlike adobe flex or silverlight which uses an xml syntax

1490455
javafx	swing
javafx scripting can interface with java and therefore can call swing components easily

1490455
swing	awt
it s really a new generator of gui api like swing was for awt nice graphical components new easy ways to manage layout really nice features to building dynamic interfaces binding timers to building animation etc

1490455
web-services	api
the api even contains some tools to use easily web-services you can find plenty of samples of gui built-in javafx connect to some public web-services like a weather forecast tool

1490474
beautifulsoup	lxml
i am trying to learn lxml after having used beautifulsoup

1490480
push	pull
let everyone push into the staging repo and let only the buildmaster pull approved changeset from staging into auto-build .when s he is happy with them

1490481
multiplication	exponent
therefore you can use the sum function to add all the logarithm of a column then take the exponent of that sum which gives the aggregate multiplication of that column

1490498
stored-procedures	ado.net
the database access should be through web-services using ado.net to access stored-procedures

1490499
similarity	distance
you might want to look the category of similarity measures or distance measures which is different in data-mining lingo than classification .

1490499
similarity	distance
the difference between a similarity measure and a distance measure is that the former is normalize - it gives you a value between 0 and 1

1490501
launchd	daemons
now i m writing a launchd daemons that needs to store a passwd and will run before any user has logged in

1490501
launchd	daemons
what is the best practice for storing passwd used by launchd daemons

1490509
stored-procedures	ado.net
please see the c# station ado.net tutorial - lesson 07 using stored-procedures

1490547
instances	private
however because value is private the anonymous-class can not access the instances variables of its superclass

1490547
subclassing	superclass
while the instances initializer of the anonymous subclassing at a looks like it assign a one to its own value instances variables that variables is actually only visible in the superclass of the anonymous-class

1490547
subclassing	inherited
the instances variables value is inherited by the anonymous subclassing and it is visible to its instances initializer

1490553
average	max
also the small amounts of various quantities numbers of possible category max average numbers of words in a item etc. should give us room to selected solutions that may be cpu and or spaces intentsive if need be

1490553
assign	add
we could add a tiny bit of importance to the category assign to the preceding or even following in a look-ahead logic item

1490582
fadein	hide
no fadein is done because the #message elements is visible hide it add the content and fade it in

1490597
shell	bash
try doing this first in your shell bash

1490598
xsd	xml
you can put a dtd inline into an xml document you cannot do this with xsd

1490598

for my part it s pretty straightforward to write a validation for some xml if you have an xsd

1490607
macros	vba
try looking into vba macros

1490620
default-value	arguments
for example if you have to add a third arguments to a two arguments methods you will set its default-value to preserve the old behavior and save you a refactor

1490627
unsigned	short
if you really really need to have identical binary information you ll need to create bitfields with bit-masks - you use an unsigned short 16-bit for messages and then make things like versionmask 0xe000 to represent the three topmost bits

1490630
httphandler	httpmodule
you could write an httpmodule ot httphandler that wrap the 7zip compression libs and handle this in code

1490636
document	editing
on the other hand the realtime multi-user editing of a single document that google-docs allows might be a little too ambitious and unncessary

1490644
32-bit	64bit
2012-4-28 updates fixed to work in 64bit python building by making sure all parameters and return types are passed as pointers instead of 32-bit int

in asp c# you can create a selected listbox then populate it with items listitem listbox1.items.add new listitem display named value

1490648
javascript	dom
dumb question but i wanted to make sure i wasn t completely missing something to add javascript variables that are dom elements to jquery selected items

1490649
updating	updates
just make certain you have .some .sort of versioning in a file or registry .so that you can tell if you need to updates as there may be .some extra step in updating between versioning 1.2 and 3.8 if .some people don t updates that often

1490673
firefox	safari
works for me i tested in ie 6 firefox 3 and safari 4

1490709
indexof	equals
linked-list doesn t offer an api to find the first equals elements but you could either use indexof followed by get requiring two passes or write your own findfirst methods like this

1490733

1490818
mootools	extjs
how different is extjs from others like jquery and mootools

1490827
any	set
of course any other implementation of an order set might be used for powers_and_max and if there was knowledge that there would be clustering but no knowledge of where the cluster might be perhaps a self adjusting tree implementation might be best

1490837
attributes	properties
is it possible to modify the attributes of a properties at runtime

1490839
subtract	time
then it suggests subtract the result-of that time 20 from 93 leaving 13 and repeat that for each one

1490841
python	ruby
i have a memory and cpu intensive problem to solve and i need to benchmarking the different solutions in ruby and python on different platform

1490841
python	ruby
to do the benchmarking i need to measure the time taken and the memory occupied by object not the entire program but a selected list of object in both python and ruby

python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
updates yes i know that both python and ruby are not strong in performance and there are better alternatives like c++ java etc

1490841
python	ruby
i am actually more interested in comparing the performance of python and ruby

1490848
profiling	debugging
but they are very scenario specific enc profiling debugging and should not be used in general purpose programs

1490854
division	modulo
you may have to use the modulo which returns the remainder of the division of two numbers for example 93 20 equals 13

1490856
python	perl
its not that other languages like python arent up to the task but perl s popular in this area

1490858
variables	boolean
you can put boolean variables in the class to disable enable the properties instead of disabling it at runtime

1490860
attributes	properties
open project properties selected run and set main-class textfield attributes

1490863
division	modulo
the modulo gives you back the remainder after performing the division

python	java	idiomatic	scoping
splitting python classes into separate files like in java one class per file helps find scoping problems although this is not idiomatic python that is not pythonic

1490948
python	perl
i have been writing python after much perl and found this from tchrist to be useful even though it is old

1490948
python	perl
getting used to doing without perl s most excellent variables scoping has been the second most difficult issue with my perl- python transitions

1490951
javascript	dom
.so javascript gains access to already normalize dom

1491003
filtering	sorting
of filtering searching and sorting

1491004
python	perl
the percentage of people using perl who do quick and dirty hacks with bad styles and worse code quality is probably higher than say python

1491022
temporary	copy
this problem creates a real messages and if you re curious to see what happens you can always try it on a temporary copy of your repositories

1491028
directory	folder
the scripting itself works perfectly on my local apache setup and goes into each directory and downloading every single file and folder

1491054
gethashcode	equals
a base-class for the class you are writing has already provided a equals and gethashcode methods and has marked these .so that you can provide your own implementation if needed

1491054
gethashcode	equals
this tells the compiler that whenever someone call equals or gethashcode you want your implementation to be used instead of the one provided in the base-class

1491093
value	field
because you trying to set value value field which belongs to original test5 class and no instances of this class is available in static context

required	checked
if the folder isn t needed until runtime you can generally just do a directory.exists checked for it in your program startup logic and create the folder s as required

1491217
directory	folder
otherwise a folder added to the solution has to have something in it which has building action of none or content i think and which has the copy to output directory properties set

1491222

1491872
value	field
but if you need to populate the field using the previous solutions you will probably need additional hidden-field added which will pass the value

1491923
arrays	loops
you could optimise this by storing words lengths in an arrays before the loops

1491928
ruby	php
php ruby alternative

1491930
updating	updates
if you are looking to do this via a web service than you would need to make sure your controllers can respond to a request for updating with xml by making sure the updates methods has a format clause with xml specified and then in your code just make a request to the url and set the appropriate http-headers

1491962
directory	folder
while the assembly got copy-paste to the web applicationâ s bin folder as i expected the images were not copy-paste to anywhere besides their own project output directory

environment	building
if you want to deploy the application once you building it i assume that you do then you are much better off having an install websphere server on the environment

1491972
jython	jacl
the reason you want to do this is that you will need to deploy the application using wsadmin jacl jython interface to was and you need the was classes on the box to make this work

1491972
environment	building
on my building environment i have pathed this ant variables .so that it can always be called

1491994
pointers	stack
what might hurt performance is that stack-allocated variables have to be addressed relative to stack or base pointers .so using static might slightly improve performance

1492014

1492037
highlight	selected
true means selected highlight all

1492044
insertion-sort	quicksort

1492050
value	field
i would like to combine a field s value from multiple recording in a single field

1492060
vbscript	vb.net
vbscript is built into windows and the language is fairly similar to vb.net or there are various excellent free languages you can downloading like python

put	get
fortunately there is a simple approach to get around this put links on the page to translation it into the other languages based on a query-string parameter

1492063
url-rewriting	query-string
a more advanced approach may use url-rewriting in combinations with some fancy regular expression to make your single localized page look like it has multiple directory but actually pass a query-string parameter to the page instead

1492067
any	set
then in your mock network object you can set up the methods call to return what ever you required for your testing purposes be it a successful connection or a failure at any points along the way

1492077
order	join
note that the order of join call doesn t matter if you want to wait for all of your threads

1492080
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works perfectly for ie 6 7 and 8 from firefox 2.0 onwards and also in google-chrome

1492103

font-size	display
does anybody know how to get sifr to display a really large font-size

1492120
push	pull
it s possible to have a pull connection open that effectively allows you to push content to the browser but the polling idea is the simplest

1492125
digits	zero
the syntax foo- 03d.jpeg specifies to use a decimal numbers composed of three digits padded with zero to express the sequences numbers

1492137
response	timeout
long-polling browser send ajax request and wait response while not timeout then send another request

1492142
constructor	object
you can also specify the numbers of recording you want in the constructor but this way will create x object for you and then store them which might not be want you want

1492156
rollback	commit
you can use the application language or tsql within a procedure to issue the begin transactional commit and rollback cmd based on return value error trapping or any other logic you wish

1492157
textbox	button
scenario i have a numeric textbox a button and a labels

1492157

1492203
environment	building
as far as i understood the terms of the infragistics license agreement you may use licenses used on dev machines additionally in automated building environment under defined circumstances

1492203
configuration	installation	installation	building
the adminâ s negative attitude towards installation on the server apart from .net sdk totally makes sense to me as the need for reliable and reproducible building across all machines urges the least complex configuration possible without any service-pack-update-ping-pong

1492204
boost-preprocessor	boost-mpl
is there a way to generator all the combinations s_types with boost-mpl or boost-preprocessor

1492219
libcrypto	openssl
you can compile libcrypto openssl for windows but i wouldn t recommend it

1492222
binaries	install
we install the libs on our machines for the visual-studio toolbox support but also copy the binaries to our subversion repository

1492272
constructor	private
could be static initialization order fiasco judging by the fact that you have public static-variables and a private constructor speaking of which how can you have a public and private definition of the constructor

1492276
spring	seam
i m interested into new technologies like ejb3 spring or seam

1492277

1492312
linux	unix
binary distributions for unix and linux are built with this option

1492314
any	set
i do not believe there is any difference in performance to specifying a low numbers or a high numbers mysql will simply stop returning rows at the end of the result set or .when it hits your limit

1492325
triggers	insert
what i am thinking of is to add an instead of triggers for both insert and updates but this required to use cursor as i need to cope with multiple rows

1492326
silverlight	wpf
i work with wpf not silverlight yet

1492326
silverlight	wpf
but it seems like this is core enough it should be applicable in both wpf silverlight scenarios

1492336
deep-copy	object
the easiest way to deep-copy clone an object in java is by serializing deserializing it

1492340
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
then you can hide whichever image is set to visible using jquery and get the next image and show it.

1492343
javascript	dom
i m trying to reduce dom-manipulation during my javascript execution and i thought about lazy-writing dom elements versus writing a large section of the dom hidden and unhiding the needed parts later

1492415
any	set
if .so i suspect you may be looking at a custom set of controls the telerik controls will allow you to templates a radcombobox for example but i don t think there are any standards controls that will allow this

1492419
any	set
this way you leave the original source intact but can set your own html and overrides any methods as needed

1492435
arrays	loops
now i have an arrays of 7 bits bytes or a string i want to take the last bit from the second byte and add it to the right most of the first and .so on which will result in a new 8 bits byte is there any direct way to do that than using loops and arrayss

1492440
version-control	git
i apologize if this is not really addressing the original question but depending on your will to change mindset for which version-control systemd to use i would strongly suggest moving to a distribute one such as mercurial or git

1492440
continuous-integration	teamcity
as to specific features such as vss-style file sharing i suggest setting up a continuous-integration environment like teamcity and configure it appropriately

1492444

1492444
firefox	safari
.when i go to the directory page it prompt me for a username passwd since my account is not within the students grouping it kicks me to the 401 page which it does in safari ie6 firefox but ie7 it does not it just show the default page screenshot here

1492468
versioning	upgrade
this is not my first choice and i generally try to avoid them but the problem is the client has different versioning of their middleware on different boxes and is reluctant to upgrade one of them

1492503
directory	folder
how can one add in visual-studio all the files under a given directory as link that is without visual-studio creating a local copy under current project s directory which is what happens if one adds a folder as existing item

.so we have this project which uses mantis as bug tracker tool and in the company the corporate bug-tracking tool is bugzilla

1492549
bugzilla	mantis
i searched for tools that can be used to migrate from mantis to bugzilla and i only found this m2bz tool which seems to work for mantis 0.17.5 and bugzilla 2.16.3 but seems also kind of dead since 2003.

1492549
bugzilla	mantis
the mantis versioning used is 1.1.8 and the bugzilla one is 3.0.1

1492587
contains	set
.when i step through the code it functions normally and results contains the correct numbers of throw results and they appear to be random .when i leave the code to run and do exactly the same thing it produces a set of identical numberss

1492601
strtok	atof
in c you might use fgets to read one line at a time and strtok or similar to process the line and atof or sscanf to read the numbers

1492602
bash	zsh
if you have absolute control over the user s environment then put a variables in their .profile checked the manual for bash and zsh for a file which is always read at startup

1492602
bash	zsh
that should evaluate to x for zsh and to something else for bash

1492606
freebsd	linux
it supports a lot of systemd windows linux freebsd etc a lot of proces.sor x86 x86-64 ia-64 powerpc and .so on and compilers

1492611
value	field
instead of trying to create a report parameter field that is filtering based on another parameter create a report that produces the list of desired value

1492616
margins	padding
you ll need to learn a couple of div styling attributes to achieve what you want like float margins and padding

1492623
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
2009-09-29 06 17 41.073 smart diagnosis 3897 20b terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - book countbyenumeratingwithstate object count unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x55c110

1492624

underneath it all osx is unix .so you have access to many unix linux libs

1492625
instances	private
create a private instances of random.

1492661
hardware	monitor
for a mac if you have a bunch of hardware lying around like keyboards and monitor then a mac mini is a nice cheap box

fckeditor	wysiwyg
it gets a little easier if you use something like tinymce or fckeditor to provide a wysiwyg editor that output xhtml

1492671
.war	jar
first for application servers such as websphere you can have a single ear which contains one or more .wars and one or more ejb jars and each .war and jar may be deployed to different servers

1492671
ejb-2.x	ejb
ejb 3.0 gives a much simpler programmign model over ejb-2.x .so have much less code xml to write but in terms of the resulting deployment pattern there is no actual change in what is happening in terms of process or bytes flowing across networks

1492671
spring	seam
not being a spring or seam developer i can t be sure that spring or seam would say the same but my guess is that fundamental architectural decisions such as remote or not would be technology agnostic

1492690
xsd	xml
rest is a totally different beast - no more soap no more wsdl and xsd no more creating a client that knows about the data types being shuffled back and forth - you just have url s which represent resources and you get back some xml - not a whole lot of systemd support for describing what that xml will be - you ll have to hope the developer of the rest service provides some documentation about what can be retrieved and what it looks like

1492704
slidedown	slideup
with the speed callback arguments added it s a complete drop-in replacement for slideup and slidedown

1492709
callback	methods
using that methods you can have your silverlight .app complete its logic and then callback in to the page to complete the page postback logic

1492726
boolean	int
the problem is that after saving and retrieving the data back includeinhistory returns what appears to be a standards nsnumber int not typed as boolean

1492729
margins	padding
disable any css not necessary to make this work and see if maybe one of the css rules for your site is accidentally targeting the div holding the image and applying a margins or padding

1492733
selected	button
in older versioning of windows it was just open the control panels selected the systemd applet selected the advanced tab and then hit the environment variables button

1492735
typedef	struct
changing key_state to typedef struct still causes this error and actually causes a lot more

1492738
xlsx	docx
on september 28 2009 the apache-poi project release versioning 3.5 which officially supports the ooxml formats introduced in office 2007 like docx and xlsx

1492740
directory	folder
how do i allow access to images in a folder under modules but still prevent accessing any other files in that same directory path

1492747
typedef	struct
typedef struct key_state key_state

1492748
typedef	struct
if you do not want to write struct all the time you can use a typedef declare key_state similar to device_extension

1492756
autodesk	revit
i have a shared parameter uvalue bound to the wall types with typesbinding in autodesk revit architecture 2010

1492757
any	set
if i know that a table column only really needs to be varchar 100 data will not be longer than 100 characters if i set the column to be varchar 256 will it make any difference

1492766
groovy	java
here s a code sample in groovy will work in java with slight mods

1492767
scala	java
i read some java source code which including scala source code

1492778
google-chrome	firefox
on the first day i thought all was good and well firefox google-chrome showed it precisely as desired then the users came and saw everything was wrong in their explorers centering aligned headers

1492783
typedef	struct
.when you use device_extension you don t have to do use struct because you are doing a struct definition and a typedef in a single compound statement

1492799
windows-xp	windows
it works perfectly .when the application is run on windows-xp but nothing ever appears on windows 7

1492806
scala	java
since and other letters is an illegal letter in java for methods namedd but allowed in scala a strategy is needed to encode it into a legal named

1492825
sql-server	ms-access
as far as i know they have never used ms-access mdw security on the database .so i suspect it s just a symptom of an old access database that s ripe for a .net sql-server migration

1492840
directory	folder
to sum it up without rewriting the document you can allow access to the directory that you wish either through .htaccess files in those folder and .htaccess files can be placed at any level in your directory tree

1492886
subclassing	superclass
the whole points of oop is supposed to be that a subclassinging can redefine some of its superclass methods and then operations done at the superclass level will get the subclassing implementation

1492895
value	field
field with null value are not added to the arrays

1492896
text-editor	editor
since a large part of the core added value of an editor such as textmate is the text editing view if you were making a text-editor you probably should implements the view from scratch jcomponent and overrides drawing and event handling

1492896
notepad++	scite
if instead you want a feature rich text editing component for another project then there s a java-binding for the scintilla editor which is quite nice scite or notepad++ use scintilla

1492901
redirecttoaction	actionlink
i have to redirect from this page using http protocols but by default asp.net-mvc generator all using http actionlink on page or redirecttoaction using

1492908
value	field	document-ready	.when
i m doing this with only 2 levels 1 ajax driven selected and for the second page load i would add .some code to my jquery document-ready function that would initiate the ajax call to load the selected list but al.so send it the id of the field i wanted selecteded .so .when the ajax call completes it will have loaded my selected and al.so set it s necessary value

1492909
contains	elements
that s assuming you want to sort each elements of the result by the roles it contains

1492913
data-visualization	charts
i was excited to find out that adobe release the data-visualization for free .so i can use the fancy charts and all with my project even though i don t have flex builder professional

1492920
compatibility	platform
aye its a bit of a pain to identify and abstract all this but you will need to do this is you want compatibility between the two different platform

1492939
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
and it .so happens that in iphone os 3.0 any uiviewcontroller and subclassing can work in conjunction with a uinavigationcontroller to provide a context aware toolbar

1492939
assign	add
you can also use settoolbaritems animated instead of assign to the toolbaritems properties to add and remove toolbar items in an animated fashion on-the-fly

1492966
python	java
i would rather do it in python than java

1492995
ruby	php
normally the user can quite easily upload a php or ruby file instead .so disabling all mod_evil_script for these directory is a good idea in general

1492998
sql-server	oracle
oracle data provider versioning 10.2.0.3 and higher do support local transactional + distribute transactional same as for sql-server 2005 and higher

1493001
double-quotes	single-quotes
try alternating the double-quotes for your arrays value use single-quotes instead

1493027
contains	set
a string will only ever contains one set of square brackets

1493047
value	field
how can i create a validation that validation if the user inputed the same value in the passwd field and the passwd confirmation field

1493143
sql-server	oracle
this statement works fine in oracle but in sql-server i get an error saying

1493162
arrays	map
i can declare an arrays of maps using generics to specify the map types

1493176
textbox	button
i have a search form within a view .when the user provides the correct details for each textbox and presses the search button it redirects to another view within the same webforms

1493186
hide	show
therefore the points is to show it to the search engines and hide it from real users

1493190
constructor	object
the getinstance methods are your constructor in the sense that it is they that get the object to the state that you want

1493194
value	field
i am using a date selected for the departures field with a prompt for the for default value the first selecteded option for each field with have a value

1493196
entity-framework	data-access
i m trying to present mysql server data in a silverlight client and my current plan of attack is to use entity-framework to mysql with ria service providing the data-access between the silverlight client and entity-framework

1493196
protected	public
however it seems my only option is to change setter on each individual field to either internal private protected or public

1493198
required	checked
i m making a validation in my inno-setup install to checked whether or not a microsoft updates is install on the machine if not i m showing a simple messagesbox telling the user that the updates is required this is the messages code

1493202
keyboard	mouse
i just bought a new keyboard and mouse microsoft natural ergonomic desktop 7000 and it has a neat little zoom lever in the middle of the keyboard

1493215
aggregate	grouping
to aggregate the numbers of sales per week month you can use a grouping by statement in sql

1493230
value	field
the field is display just fine and i can get all the checked value for that elements

1493230
contains	elements
where default is arrays contains elements of types checked_option_field_id true eg

1493230
contains	elements
i have tried to pass just an arrays contains elements of types checked_option_field_id eg

1493233
hide	show
for a more complex solution that allows the user to hide show columns as they wish checkout the table column manager

1493239
revision	svn
branches in svn as opposed to a distribute revision control systemd are more intended for big sweeping changes that are likely to either break your colleagues code or required a lot of work in which case you want to make many incremental commit that may not compile or things like managing release

1493247
bazaar	git
if you are restrict to svn keep reading if not you sound like a primes candidate for dvcs like mercurial git or bazaar

1493254
protected	public
in practice onloginused does exist and .when the identifier is changed to public protected everything works just fine

1493262
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a db from postgresql to mysql

1493262
postgresql	mysql
since i cannot find a tool that does the trick itself i m going to convert all postgresql sequences to autoincrement ids in mysql with autoincrement value

1493267
protected	public
this is why they must be protected or public

1493273
styledtext	swt
probably your best bet is to embed other swt widget in the styledtext

1493276
webserver	upload
does anyone know of a good php or ajax multiple-file-upload scripting to upload to a webserver

1493279
any	set
with this methods the data service will disallow changes to any entity set except commententityset which i include to illustrate the way in which you can can overrides the access rules to individual entity sets after the first line which sets the default access rules for all entity sets to allread

1493292
error-code	hresult
the error-code for that hresult is connect_e_cannotconnect

1493293
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
next i call first show and then hide on the toast

1493307
postback	ajax
.when working with asp.net and faced with the need to communication with the server without a postback how does one make the determination to use a control from the ajax toolkit instead of working with something like jquery

1493308
background-image	transparency
how can i get transparency part of background-image

1493309
textbox	button
and inside the panels users can add combobox s textbox s labels etc and drag them around and stuff and there s a delete button on my form where if they click it it will delete all controls inside that panels

1493316
repository	entity
this means entity object are calling the repository directly from the methods

1493324
text-rendering	gdi
try disabling compatible text-rendering in the entire application or for the labels to force it to use gdi instead

1493328
javascript	dom
jquery seems to be the framework of choice at the moment for dom scripting and ajax it just makes javascript related tasks a lot quicker and easier to implements

1493329
look-and-feel	substance
swing can look good with substance look-and-feel

1493330
silverlight	wpf
the reason the wpf silverlight passwdbox doesn t expose a dp for the passwd properties is security related

1493330
silverlight	wpf
if wpf silverlight were to keep a dp for passwd it would required the framework to keep the passwd itself unencrypted in memory

1493341
mongodb	couchdb
to me it seems that the underlying ideas are technically sound and probably more mature than the newer document-based dbs like couchdb or mongodb

1493341
perl	ruby	perl	c++
it has support for c++ ruby and perl as far as i can determine

1493383
javascript	dom
i ve found the proficiency of the team with javascript and the dom makes a huge difference on the uptake of jquery over ms controls

1493383
javascript	dom
if on the other hand they are consistently trying to work around the toolkit to manipulate a control directly via javascript jquery takes the pain out of manipulating the dom like this

1493389
selected	button
i would like to do a simple test on whether this item is selected .when the user click a button below

1493394
any	set
in ruby i don t believe there are any termcap binding .so you use ncurses rather than hardwiring into your program a set of device-dependent control codes

1493394
readline	ncurses
use ncurses if readline doesn t work out or if you need cursor addressing for some other reason

1493396
python	ruby
i would recommend learning one of the newer scripting languages such as python or ruby

1493396
python	ruby
python and ruby would be nail-guns

1493400
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight wpf instead of hacking together something that mimics user-interface states you could actually create visualstatemanager states

1493410
ruby-on-rails	django
for instances if your team decides to try using django ruby-on-rails etc

1493415
jax-rs	cxf
i wrote my webservice using cxf 2.1.2 and jax-rs

essentially this is strategy-pattern though visitor would also be a possibility if you wanted to get really elaborate

1493592
subclassing	base-class
since these are all different versioning of the same protocols you could probably have common stuff in the base-class and then the difference in the subclassing

1493592

my thought inorder to speed execution-time of the highlight itself by changing a classname is to pre-calculate the offset of all cell - with a colstart and colend rowstart and rowend .when the page loads and store that in an arrays somehow

1495341
virtualbox	vmware
you can find vmware appliances preload with a linux distribution which you can import into vmware or virtualbox

1495341
version-control	git
you should really be moving to svn git or some other version-control systemd

1495344
asp.net-mvc	webforms
unfortunately any 3rd party controls that depend on viewstate which most do will not work using the .net asp.net-mvc framework as viewstate only exists in the webforms paradigms

1495352
strcat	strlen
you should recording the end of newstr rather than using strcat strlen

1495354
restart	exit
i have a long-running process with some child process that must be restart if they exit

1495354
restart	exit
to handle clean restart of these child process i trap the exit signals with

1495373
digits	base
think of i j k as digits base 1000

1495373
digits	zero	digits	base	base	zero
the units digits base 1000 that is k is not zero

1495373
digits	base
for the sum of the numberss i j k are the digits of the numbers base 1000 .so

1495374
strstr	strchr
for what it s worth you could also look into strchr and strstr which are nondestructive ways of searching for single characters or sequences within strings

1495374
strdup	free
your caller will thus be responsible for free ing the strdup d string but since you re only passing that string back implicit inside ret the caller needs to know magically what pointers to pass to free

1495382
sql-server	postgresql
in ms sql-server i would simply declare a variables with the value of the current date and use that but apparently that s not possible in plain sql-in postgresql

1495436
solaris	linux
our shop uses mac linux solaris and windows with the server on a linux machine and we never have any problems with compatibility

1495444
any	set
that s a confusing statement .so allow me to explain nearly every ide ever has the ability to set tab widths to any value you want

1495449
buildpath	libs
afterwards it will show up in the project properties under the buildpath the tab for libs paths

1495461
selected	cell
in the methods cellforrowatindexpath you have to selected or deselected your cell depending your last selectedion

1495480
while-loop	for-loop
i do suggest changing the while-loop to the more idiomatic for-loop and handling exception-handling

1495482
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the absolute fastest way to get bulk data in is to drop all indexes and triggers use the equivalent of mysql s load data and then recreate your indexes triggers

1495486
silverlight	wpf
this is done in silverlight and not in wpf but it should work the same

1495486
implements	extends
the best way that i would implements this is to create a class that inherited from user-controls maybe called draggablecontrol that is built with this code then all draggable controls should extends the draggablecontrol

1495532
radio-button	checkbox
the brackets above represent a radio-button if the question types is multiplechoicesoneanswer or a checkbox for questions of types multiplechoicesmultipleanswers

1495536
buildpath	libs
they reflect the content you add in the libs tab of fdt buildpath in your project s properties

1495536
directory	folder
for the location of those path-variables as far as i know could only be located in your eclipse installation folder or in your eclipse settings folder usually in your user directory

1495554
put	get
there s a limit on the size of a url if you wish to put large amounts of data on the url like with a get but no defined limit for a .post or put

1495582
ostream	std
all i really needed was a way to write to an external buffering using the iostream libs and std ostream is a much better types to address this problem

1495627
meta-tags	meta
they either use the charset from the header or the charset defined in the meta tag or they use an encoding detection which does not care about meta-tags or headers

1495642
machine-code	relocation
some of these sections happen to contains machine-code that can be execute other sections contains program data resources relocation information import information etc.

1495642
contains	any
managed executable contains msil micro.soft intermediate-language and may be compiled .so they can target any cpu that the clr supports

1495651
python	c++	python	java
it would be better if the implementation were in c++ but java python etc

1495656
stderr	stdout
you need to close stdout stderr stdin otherwise you are still bound to that specific tty

1495657
ref	out
action and func specifically do not take out or ref parameters

1495658
ref	out
out and ref are special qualifiers and the delegation has to be setup with them explicit since they are completely different calling styles

1495659
ref	out
chris is correct to points out that the optional code ref versioning would force users to do

1495667
defined	declare
it would have the scoping of the block in which it was defined - likely to be the same as function scoping unless you declare the alias inside a block within a function

1495680
getter	setter
in python you typically don t write getter and setter unless you really have a non-trivial implementation for them at which points you use properties descriptors

1495706
32-bit	64bit
as eclipse s binary parsing has not been updates to recognized the new 64bit mach-o binary format it looks like the only workaround now is to compile code in 32-bit mode

1495709
export	csv
export to text file comma separated value txt csv

1495740
getter	setter
2 if you needed to have getter and setter functions perhaps to checked something in python you can declare special methods functions

1495740
assign	add
in python it is generally considered good practice to simply assign to member variables and simply reference them to fetch them because you can always add in the properties descriptors later should you need them

1495740
arguments	default
this business of using a default arguments value of none then testing that the arguments passed is none qualifies as a python design pattern or at least an idiom you should master

1495746
bar-chart	pie-chart
if all are run 3 separate webpage open up display a pie-chart bar-chart and line graphing

1495753
spaces	output
note that scrolling down on a console .when reading output from more can typically be done with the spaces bar

1495760
selected	button
i think instead of clearing the whole form selected some of them and pressing clear button would be something users would want more

1495783
base-class	inherited
then i have my login page coded to inherited the base-class

1495790
any	set	value	field
what i do instead is any field can be set to 0 but any non-valid data non-numeric less than 0 greater than 16 will revert back to the value last entered which is stored via javascript

1495792
value	field
i am having issues getting the voice browser to repeat my field value as a series of numberss rather than a large multi-digit numbers

1495796
configuration	environment
what is best practice for using subversion svn for managing a project that required a single configuration file that has multiple concurrent versioning for different environment

1495796
configuration	environment
project abc is used for three different environment that use the same code except for a slightly modified configuration file

1495811
configuration	environment
i have several apps and they each have a separate configuration file for their production staging and dev environment

1495811
configuration	environment	environment	building
as part of our nant building and deployment scripting called by cruisecontrol.net depending on the environment being deployed to the appropriate configuration is rename to web-configuration and deployed

1495817
account	userid
i think an attacker could log into their facebook account and guess userid s by calling and .when x corresponded to a suid on my site he would be authentication to see that user s data

1495821
tuples	sorted
if the list of tuples is sorted itertools.groupby as suggested by gnibbler is not a bad alternative to defaultdict but it needs to be used differently than he suggested

1495838
configuration	environment
we use a homebrew configurationuration tool that reads a systemd environment variables and from that reads a matching configuration file and then modifies a shared configurationuration file

1495847
controllers	routes
we re building about 10 asp.net-mvc sites which have a common set of features and corresponding urls routes controllers actions and views

1495874
synchronous	.when
i ve got the following code that show a lightbox please wait box then does a synchronous ajax request which removes the lightbox .when it finishes

1495874
lightbox	jquery	hide	show
updates 2 i just replace the lightbox with a simple div and did a jquery .show on beforesend and hide on complete and it didn t show that either .so it doesn t seem to have anything to do with the lightbox

1495875
any	set
while it keeps freezing it does not give me the option to stop it or show any labels i have set to change during it s running

1495877
exception-handling	try-catch
put your program in a try-catch block and then have any exception-handling throw printing in a messagebox

1495886
factors	primes
the denominator value need to be split into their primes factors for the best result

1495888
dimensionality-reduction	feature-selection
it just occurred to me that as an alternative to feature-selection you can use a dimensionality-reduction technique pca svd factors analysis ica ...

1495903
settimeout	jquery-on
i m still new to jquery-on the way to getting my ajax example to work i got stalled with settimeout

1495905
setinterval	settimeout
i also prefer the shortened block form and rather than calling settimeout within updates you can just use setinterval instead

1495910
versioning	upgrade
the versioning of php used is 4.4.7 and i am not in a positioning to ask them to upgrade

1495910
google-chrome	firefox
edit almost forgot to mention it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome and ie it doesn t work at all

1495915
early-binding	late-binding
this switches it from early-binding to late-binding

1495915
early-binding	late-binding
if you want intellisense to work properly use early-binding the first form while you are coding and then switching it to late-binding the second form .when you are done

1495918
execute	prepare
i ve just started learning aboud pdo and prepare statements which sure seem to beat remembering to use mysql_real_escape_string every time but i m having trouble getting the scripting to execute properly

1495936
order	add
but .when i add new order into context it doesn t show up anywhere

1495937
configuration	environment
pluggable code need for different configuration files for different databases or dev environment

1495954
transparency	frame
the customized glass frame consists of a enlarged title bar area which is reported by my implementation of wm _ nccalcsize to be part of the client area since i would like to rendering transparency controls into it

1495987
arguments	default
does vc++ not support default templates parameters arguments

1496001
restart	exit
one machine has scrollback functionality that survives exit and console restart

1496005
compact-framework	.net
i can t seem to find an answer anywhere as to what types of encryption the ssl tls stack on the .net compact-framework supports

1496012
spawn	exit
on windows if you want a bit more control over the process you can use createprocess to spawn the process waitforsingleobject to wait for it to exit and getexitcodeprocess to get the return code

1496015
portrait	screens
i want to display a photo in a uiscrollview that is centered on the screens the image may be in portrait or landscape orientation

1496049
default	reset
if it does not you can try to run vs from a command-line with resetsettings switching - this will reset all vs settings back to default

1496051
duplicates	contains
these scripting contains a lot of duplicates code

1496060
value	field
a check-constraint is simply a conditional imposed on one or several value of field before they can be added or insert

1496060
required	checked
for example maybe the checked required that all str_member_no be more than 1500 the lower value being used for say administators... or some other odd business rules

1496060
value	field
the problem probably lies there in a field value that is bad

1496072
value	field
if i scroll across the form and selected the blank field the value then show up

1496073
interpreter	runtime
one thing to be very aware of is that the wf rules engine is that it actually implements its own parsing and as a result is somewhat limited in its expressiveness and does have performance considerations since it is pretty much doing string-parsing to interpreter the rules into code executable actions at runtime

1496102
httpd.conf	hosts
what you need to do is to edit the apache2 httpd.conf file and add virtual hosts to it

1496105
acrobat-sdk	acrobat
the acrobat-sdk will allow you to automate acrobat and do what you want to do but it s not for the faint of heart

1496109
value	field
i want the ok button to be enabled only .when both the field contains a value

1496137
any	set
methods - although it seems logical to set this passes the form variables but clears any placed in action

1496141
hash	tie
having basically zero experience with reflection i m curious if this is something that can be accomplished using it or if i should take the same approach as i would in perl and create a hashmap or hashtable of object and tie them to a entry in a hash of jframes

1496150
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve just written a test which puts a string of length 10 million into an attributes and then retrieves it again and it works fine firefox 3.5.2 internet-explorer 7

1496169
png	gif
i want to know is .when i upload the transparency image which is png or gif can i be able to put background in that thumbnail image

1496172
put	get
then you run defaulttablemodel.getcolumnnamed int columnindex to get the named of each change it the way you want and put it in an arrays

1496197
javascript	dom
i suspect that ie doesn t rendering your dom changes until it gets control back from your javascript function and that doesn t happen until after the ajax request and the box is hidden again

1496208
background-image	background-color
background-color background-image

1496211
contains	any
can anyone tell me if there a way to see if an action contains any code

1496218
perl	c++	shell	bash	shell	tcsh	tcsh	bash	pascal	basic
in the last 24 years i ve developed and maintained code professionally in c++ pascal basic java perl objective-c bourne shell bash csh tcsh and assembly for 68k powerpc and x86

1496225
contains	elements	contains	set	background-position	background-image
the anchor elements are fixed size and the background is set to the image contains all of the iconss but the background-position properties is specified to shift the background-image .so that only the desired icons from the image is display

1496257
attributes	properties
the xmlserializationr is using a opt-out process - it will serialization everything all public properties unless you explicit opt-out by using the attributes

1496257
constructor	private
it was a few more advantages doesn t required a parameter-less constructor can serialization internal and private properties too and it can also serialization field instead of properties if needed and it s tuned for speed

1496278
any	set
is there any problem set have elegant solutions with them

1496295
triggers	insert
i am using mysql5.1 and wrote triggers after update.am using same table for insert and updae

1496306
return-type	arguments
the same numbers and types of arguments and the same return-type

1496307
triggers	insert
it insert yet another row which would then required the triggers to be called again and insert yet another row which would result in it being called again..

1496307
triggers	insert
another way would be with a separate table with its own after insert triggers

1496307
triggers	insert
the vote table s triggers would need to test for 10 1 100 value and return doing nothing else in this case and otherwise insert a recording on the other table

1496307
triggers	insert
this other table would have its triggers insert this recording on table vote

1496308
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you find nhibernate a bit daunting to dive into look at standards microsoft solutions such as entity-framework

1496308
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
if .so s#arp-architecture is a nice starting points both for asp.net-mvc and for nhibernate

1496312
subtract	time
what is available is activeelapsed .so i want to subtract that from the end time on import as follows

1496318
delphi	c++
is there a way to use c++ classes exported by a win32 dll in delphi for win32

1496328
put	get
what the static does here many programmers do not like this types of allocation is that the strings get put into the data segment of the program

1496343
executable-jar	jar
hi i have created executable-jar of my java program i want to create shortcut icons for that jar

1496353
malloc	free
another alternative would be to use malloc to allocate the string in the heap and then free on the correct location of your code

1496360
miktex	tex
any tex installation will include it including miktex and texlive the two major windows implementation

1496367
subtract	time
you could split the elapsed time and convert it in fractions of days then you can subtract it from end_time

1496380
callback	methods
activerecord has a few different callback methods used to simplify model logic

1496380
callback	methods	instances	self
if i remove all the self prefixes from the instances-variables or instances methods these 2 callback will be called but it is as if they are local-variables inside these callback methods

1496380
callback	methods
and associations user worked fine outside these 2 callback methods without the self prefix

1496380
callback	methods	instances	self
the sample code in the ruby-on-rails documentation for callback methods instances methods seems to always use the self prefix even though it is calling instances-variables or methods which by right they are accessible without the self prefix normally

1496395
delphi	c++
you can t use c++ classes exported from a dll as far as i know in delphi

1496396
google-chrome	firefox
edit2 ok i got it to work in ie but it s obvious now that the corners are made by a bunch of div s and the background doesn t match up - it looks fine in firefox and google-chrome

1496419
licensing	eula
no good using the product and then the licensing changes and it s going to cost 10 s of 1k which is probably the case if you read any product eula

1496422
traversal	parent
this is clean but not ideal because a there is no logical parent it s a grouping not a hierarchy and b it is potentially a pain for linq-to-sql to traversal a self-referential hierarchy - would need to checked to see if the current object is a parent or a child object etc

1496422
contains	any
this adds constraints but the grouping table doesn t contains any useful information - it exists only to provide a groupingid constraint identity

1496443
repository	entity
they suggest using one repository per entity

1496444
order	add
for option two you can always add additional fields-for discriptions display order and groupparentid for multiple levels of grouping

1496451
conditional	parentheses
but if the extra not-operator and parentheses hurts your eyes use this note the absence of the words or in this conditional not anymore parallels with english sequences

1496470
delphi	c++
windows c++ compilers and delphi have generally the same vmt layout .so if the c++ class can be describe by a list of pure-virtual methods you can create an equivalent delphi declaration do .some type-casting with the object pointers returned by the dll and proceed

1496480
push	pull
we generally found it easier if you have to use pull or push to use patches instead

1496492
atomicity	deadlock
and if you need atomicity of the consumer then you should think about better specifications of the producer-consumer methods because describe deadlock is logical flaw in the synchronized

1496505
stderr	stdout
or should stderr and stdout be combined into one streaming

1496512
selected	checkbox
my datatemplate has a checkbox and this should be the only thing the user can click or selected

1496539
children	nodes
tristate checkbox are standards user-interface idiom for treeview with partially checked children nodes

1496575
switching	screens
use shift + alt + enter to switching to full screens mode this will automatically hide all the windows

1496585
arguments	default
the first arguments to the queryparser constructor is the default search field even if the javadoc doesn t make that obvious

1496592
colorbox	.post
i can put the image from the wordpress loops href d to the permalinks and call it inline for each image .post to be display in the colorbox

1496592
colorbox	.post
then i include the general colorbox class on that link which opens the .post inside of the colorbox as well

1496595
windows-mobile	symbian
symbian and windows-mobile have nothing to do with each other api wise except that it is for both possible to program c against it

1496595
windows-mobile	symbian
windows-mobile also allows .net programs but symbian doesn t without adding the proprietary .net runtime from redfivelabs

1496603
checkbox	listbox	selected	checkbox	selected	listbox
as far as i know there is no way to disable selection because if you did your checkbox will not work but you can overrides focused or selected styles of your listbox items

1496606
publishing	release
1 i have a release scripting that runs the entire clickonce publishing then re-sign the executable and dlls then re-creates the manifest sign it etc

1496613
application-pool	was
the application-pool was suppose to recycle .when maximum virtual-memory reached a certain amount which occured

1496623
factory-method	singleton
the common way to create a singleton is to have a factory-method that handles creation of the one instances

1496635
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but in safari 4 the keyboard selected doesn t work

1496647
minimum	max
this works fine if given a single value of y but if i give it a list or a column from a dataframe then the min and max elements give me the minimum value of the whole list

1496652
any	set
depending on whether or not you re using any apis that are restrict to versioning 3.0 or 3.1 you should set your base sdk as the highest versioning that the latest official sdk supports not beta sdks

1496652
any	set
.so if you re not using any api s that are specific to 3.0 you could compile against the 3.0 sdk and then set your deployment-target to 2.0

1496657
jquery-dialog	jquery
i have .some jquery that popup a jquery-dialog box .when you hover over an image like .so

1496689
textbox	button
m using a mdi child form and want it to display .when a button from its parent form is click at the same time i want that .when the child form appears it should be placed such that some of the attributes of the parent form picturebox is show while others as labels and textbox are hidden

1496695
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
1 use mouseover mouseout or mouseenter mouseleave events

1496710
32-bit	64bit
i ve found this in c++ for 32-bit which could be easily adapted to java 64bit

1496713
administration	account
there are .so many variables that the machine administration that may need to be taken in to account

1496734
selected	textbox
also there are ime properties on textbox selected to have it on otherwise the ime will be in english mode

1496746
toolchain	gcov
on maemo since the toolchain is gcc based i d guess gcov would be a good starting points

1496756
selected	textbox
there is a way to make the ime change automaticall .when a textbox is selected

1496760
value	field
will delete all recordinging in t1 that have a matching recording in t2 based on the three field value

1496785
put	get
net.rim.device.api.system.runtimestore has methods to put and get an object that is identified by an unique id long

1496807
jquery	dojo
i don t remember if that s the best way to get the charcode but javascript libs like prototype jquery dojo will abstract a lot of those browser difference for you if you want to look to one of them

1496810
arrays	loops
i m using file_get_contents to get the source of a page i want to then loops through the source and find all the and extraction all the href value into an arrays

1496925
windows-server	windows
i developed my test on windows 7 against watin 2.0.10.928 but the test was continually getting stuck with a blank browser with about blank in the address bar .when run on windows-server 2008 with latest wus and enhanced security configuration turned off and running the tests elevated run as administration

1496939
dependency-injection	inject
i am using dependency-injection to inject interface into my few views

1496943
jquery	.post
i read a .post about making json call with jquery safer by adding a datafilter to parsing the returned string

1496943
any	set
but with this set the datafiltering isn t called is there any way to filtering the data without editing the internals of jquery

1496951
lightbox	jquery
i m using the jquery lightbox is there a way to show an textfield istead of images or both

1496953
interpreter	runtime
there are another couple of options if you re free to choose the language you could run rhino a javascript interpreter on the java runtime

1496957
selected	checkbox
we have a header checkbox onclientclick of which all the other checkbox in the page gets selected unselected

1496958
buffering	streaming
in your senddata methods you serialization the object to a memory streaming and then read it back into a buffering of 2048 bytes before writing it to the network streaming

1497019
innodb	myisam
autoincrement will use the next available id for both innodb and myisam tables but you can manually change it s next positioning in the following way

1497052
entity-framework	ado.net	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	ado.net	dependency-injection	repository-pattern
i knew than one of the benefits from using repository-pattern make it easy to switching between orm for example will implements data-access code using linq-to-sql and also using ado.net entity-framework then using dependency-injection switching which one to use

1497064
xsd	xml
in recent versioning of the free and open source eclipse ide you can generator xml document from dtd and xsd files

1497066
google-chrome	firefox
looks the same to me tested on firefox ie6 and google-chrome

1497070
rollback	commit
thirdly if you commit in between the insert and selected a deferred constraint may force a rollback of the insert

1497085
value	field
if recording with old field value in dataset not exists in database alert user that recording is changed by another user and user must close dialog refresh recording and start editing again

1497114
postback	ajax
you ll need to postback to the server either full or an ajax call to set the data

1497116
python	c++	python	java
also the idea is to map them very easy to corresponding c++ python java data types

1497135
environment	building
from my understanding it is very easy to building a native flex .app which runs on the intuit environment

1497160
perl	c++
to do this you need powerful and conservative static analysis which perl does not have and is not likely to gain in c++ you need less powerful stuff because the languages are less dynamic but you still need something

1497171
g++	gcc
here s my output with no optimization flags by g++ gcc 4.5.0 20090910 experimental

1497181
any	set
resubmit the query without specifying any hints and without using set forceplan

1497228
value	field
i have a form that as more than a 100 field across 5 category of which only 3 field are necessary and the rest are autofilled or set to default value

1497260
specifications	w3c
the default types for internet-explorer is button while in other browsers and in the w3c specifications it is submit

1497272
firefox	gecko
you can do this in firefox 3.5 gecko 1.9.1 using css3 2d transforms

1497290
build-process	nant	build-process	msbuild	msbuild	nant
i m a solo developer looking into a tool such as msbuild nant to improve my build-process

1497297
jax-rs	cxf
i have a spring application that publishes some restful web-services using cxf using jax-rs

1497309
double	int
i have a family of classes that contains only variables of the following types std string int double

1497311
controllers	routes
i am thinking that you should probably remove generator views that you aren t using remove controllers actions you don t need remove default routes and .so forth

1497328
expression	evaluation
in summary with that expression c does not defined the evaluation order

1497332
cargo	maven
if you are strictly following automated smoke tests with selenium cargo testng and maven please note that the author is not really covering the multi-module project setup i m not saying he s not doing it i m just saying he s not covering that part but only the functional-testing project setup

1497332
cargo	maven
he always launchd maven from the functest directory never as a reactor from the parent-pom and the webapp deployed by cargo in the step 7 is treated like an external dependency

1497344
build-process	msbuild
i m a solo developer running visual-studio 2008 and looking into msbuild to improve my build-process

1497345
telnet	ssh
for the second case you might want to look into teraterm or putty which have support for telnet ssh and serial-port connections

1497355
double	int
now if you want to differentiate a string from a non-string numbers in this case you can prepend every packets item with a byte code say 0x00 for int 0x01 for double 0x02 for string and branch a switching off depending on what the code is

1497355
double	int
this way you can even write the int double as a byte .so you won t lose precision and you ll al.so end up with a smaller easier to read file

1497358
value	field
from the returned value i then suppose that for the containable to works the foreignkey has to be in the field

1497377
output	mode
batch-file mode results in non-tabular output format and escaping of

1497385
build-process	release	build-process	msbuild
a custom msbuild properties would allow you to use normals debugging release configuration and extends it to automate more of your build-process just depends on what you want

1497418
python	c++
just building a c++ wrapper for your webcam and then use swig or sip to access these functions from python

1497450
tokenize	parsing
i was thinking perhaps regex s might do it but probably not as efficiently as an html tokenize parsing might

1497456
entity-framework	ado.net
currently i have a c# silverlight application that uses the domainservice class and the ado.net entity-framework to communication with my database

1497462
ellipse	line
for every cluster compute principal components and detection line from circles or any other shape by looking for clusters showing only 1 significative eigenvalue or 2 if you look for fat segments that could resemble to ellipse

1497478
double	int
if that s the case then int math.log x+0.5 math.log 10 will be more stable - but realize that double s have only 53 bits of precision .so around 10 the 15th double can no longer represent int exactly and this trick won t work then

1497507
textbox	button
but the controls are like button textbox are not chaged

1497518
cakephp	symfony
i suppose you can find the same kind of stuff with other asp.net-mvc frameworks like symfony or cakephp

1497538
server-side-includes	include
not as a direct include because asp.net server-side-includes required the page to be compiled at the server

1497541
short	base
my impression is they write the url to a database then use the int id of the new recording as the short url encode base 36 or 62 letters+digits

1497544
swing	awt
the reason it s ambiguous is people generally don t mix and match the lighting and heavy-weight frameworks put awt components within a swing component

1497545
filtering	grouping
for the life of me i can t figure out how to work with the value returned by the linq query to be able to then filtering all of the grouping that were returned .so that i only have the grouping that have more than one item in them

1497575
selection	cell
i m pretty sure this comes after your step 3 and actions from cell selection will be process first

1497588
syntax-highlighting	textmate
does anyone know where the code textmate uses for syntax-highlighting is burried

1497595
messenger	skype
install messenger such as skype on all remote machines and call it

1497619
jmockit	testng
i assume the combinations testng jmockit with spring 3 isn t bad .so that s what i m doing right now but if i m off course selected the tools for my fresh spring project please tell me right away

1497633
for-loop	arrays
either take the flower initialisation out of the the for-loop to only create the arrays once or do the following

1497648
contains	any
any initializer contains comma like for arrays in the example will need to be expanded from their own macros like arrays_init in the above

1497652
selected	checkbox
i ve three checkbox on selected the checkbox i need to filtering the data

1497656
jquery	.post
.when i .post the data i can submit the attributes easily enough and then modelbind in the action methods using the following jquery

1497673
attributes	properties
to get your class to serialization as it stands you ll have to add the nonserialized attributes to the strformat properties

1497699
exception-handling	try-catch
.so i would only get rid of the try-catch from the dal layer - if you really don t do anything more than retrowning the exception-handling

1497701
javascript	dom
fully javascript dom support

1497705
getter	setter
for obvious-purpose methods like getter and setter it will also generator good enough comments getx gets x etc.

1497705
getter	setter
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructor

1497728
subtract	time
if i was starting over i would subtract the starting-over time in millis from the numeric id prior to encoding then re-add it .when decoding

1497730
buffering	streaming
leave the streaming and buffering to the underlying fstream class

1497740
any	set
is there any vs addins that can take a class and set up all the wiring to generator the test class and methods as well as mocking the dependencies etc

1497792
contains	elements
.so .when a user click on one of these elements we want to replace the div with the text with a tinymce instances contains the text

1497794
keyboard	mouse
what i need is the code needed to send a messages to windows for it to believe the user is in front of the pc mouse or keyboard activity

1497795
constructor	object
after some discussion in the comments for this question and subsequent clarification it sounds to me like since you are creating your own constructor you are not initializing the orderlines properties of the order object

1497795
constructor	object
your new constructor .when called does not appear to be creating the internal object that is exposed via the .orderlines properties

1497795
constructor	object
this seems to explain the nullreferenceexception that your experiencing as your own constructor never call the default-constructor nor does it replicate the initialization of the orderlines object properties

1497795
constructor	object
the best way to achieve this is to chaining your constructor such that your overloaded constructor that takes the reservation object as a parameter first call the default parameterless constructor such that this initialization can take place

1497830
exception-handling	try-catch
a scoping with no transactional is usually used as a try-catch block just to handle exception-handling

1497830
contains	any
it will contains nested transactionalal both atomicity and long running on their own with the outer transactional coordinating through compensations the undoing of any nested transactionalal not automatically rollback

1497848
json	xml
hessian is also much easier to encode and decode compared to xml and json meaning your .app can make call and receive response using less cpu and memory for temporary object

1497871
arguments	default
both statements cast p + 1 to an pointers to an int prior dereference it the default is to cast everything to an int in a va_arg arguments

1497886
extends	sealed
since fontfamily is sealed we can t extends it .so we passed it in as a parameter to the localizedfontfamily classes constructor

1497902
actioncontroller	helpers
if your sidea is tied to your current actioncontroller you can rendering them from the actions view scripting and call the sideb view helpers from the layout

1497906
checkout	payment
checkout paypal instant payment notification

1497922
object-reference	instances
.when i try to set the slider s value properties the .app crash with object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1497928
double-quotes	single-quotes
note the single-quotes with double-quotes the use of x00 causes a parsing error somehow.

1497941
void	main
note that the c standards defined that the main program returns an int not void

1497947
.when	ready
.when this thread reads a messages i want it to notify the windows forms messages loops running in the main thread that a messages is ready

1497950
contains	elements
in vb6 if a listbox contains alphanumeric data has focus and a character key is pressed the first elements in the listbox starting with that character is highlight

1497950
keydown	keyup
.so the behavior is what i want except there is an extra search being done .somewhere between the keydown and keyup events

1497973
checkbox	textbox
checkbox | textbox | textbox | textbox

1497973
checkbox	textbox
checkbox | textbox | textbox | textbox

1497993
vbscript	jscript
you can run jscript .js and vbscript .vbs scripting directly in windows

1498037
linux	unix
for pthreads unix linux look into and friend

1498042
constructor	object
allows for lightweight redo fixme functionality in other words if the object that is construct is very heavy with many complex attributes that are 100 always ok and the only reason it is not valid is because someone entered an incorrect date you can simply do instead of the overhead of re-executing entire constructor again

1498045
updating	updates
you d think that an updates in which you specify the primary key would always cause a row lock but .when sql-server gets a batch-file with a bunch of these and some of them happen to be in the same page depending on this situation this can be quite likely updating all files in a folder files which were created at pretty much the same time you ll see page locks and bad things will happen

1498047
jruby	mri
or ruby 1.8 or 1.9 jruby mri

1498047
python	ruby
ruby and python

1498083
google-apps	gmail
but how do i do the same for a gmail inbox that belongs to a domain that is using google-apps

1498085
boolean	int
in fact most data types string int boolean etc. in python are object .so pretty much every methods works in the way you describe

1498091
contains	any
i have a not-serializable object that contains properties of any types and i want to load data to that object

1498155
python	c++
i m looking at implements a fuzzy-logic controllers based on either pyfuzzy python or ffll c++ libs

1498172
ref	out
eric lippert explains in why do ref and out parameters not allow types variation

1498173
environment	building
having building my own deployer in a corporate environment here are a few use case i needed to address

1498173
access-control	authentication
your customers will probably want to have the deployed binaries available on a webserver and they won t want to manage some sort of authentication or access-control

1498176
python	c++
for .some operations you may see that it is 1000 time slower than c++ .so yes you should investigate into this and do necessary benchmarking before you make time-critical algorithms in python

1498176
python	c++
however you can extends python with modules in c++ code .so that time-critical things are fast while still being able to use python for the main code

1498212
profiling	trace
i m not familiar with your precise problem but can you not run the trace on the sql-server instead using eg profiling assuming mssql

1498214
python	c++
if that s not enough write the most performance-critical functions in c++ and call that from your python code

1498222
row	col
the biggest hack here is that i assume that my row and col variables are contiguous in memory spaces which is true in my case but not in every case

1498227
vbscript	jscript
it s worth taking the time to get used to creating .wsf files which use an xml-based syntax rather than just running .js jscript or .vbs vbscript files - .wsf files offer much finer control over modularity and allow for better in-file documentation and usage explanations and also allow scripting written in several different languages to be combined which is handy if you find a vbscript that does 40 of what you need and don t want the hassle of converting it to use with the 60 you re writing in jscript

1498229
mouseleave	mouseenter
what if you use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

1498229
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter sets it to underlined and mouseleave revert it

1498230
constructor	object
- create a file object that represents the file in question using constructor with full filename

1498235
c++	lua
you can extends your core c++ program using some scripting language for example - lua

1498235
c++	lua
there are several c++ - lua integration tools tolua tolua++ etc.

1498248
duplicates	contains
the project settings for that static libs contains a lot of duplicates settings

1498276
constructor	object	strong-typing	types
this isn t c .so we don t have a strong-typing constraint telling us that our constructor must return an object of this types

1498276
constructor	object
as to standardsization i think that checked whether a constructor returns a defined object is as good a standards as checked a flag variables

1498285
python	lua
if you want users to actually extends your program as opposed to your developer team releasing official plugins you will want to embed a scripting-language like python or lua because they are easier to code in

1498300
textbox	button
i have a button which is having modalpopupextender which is working absolutely fine no problem at all but before the modalpopup appears i want to validation textbox control if it is not valid then modalpopup should not appear other wise it should work as usual.

1498316
mouseleave	mousehover
then in my mousehover and mouseleave events i used a new methods setfonts to change the fonts

1498343
hide	show
something i ve done in the past is manually show hide the modal pop-up

1498360
hide	show
then attach .some javascript to that attributes .so that .when it changes it show hide the extra type-specific field you ve defined

1498368
value	field
each field must have multiple linked languages .so each value must link to the equivalent value for multiple-languages

1498415
versioning	packaging	code-signing	obfuscation
release is where all the magic happens same as they always say in mtv cribs versioning code-signing packaging compression obfuscation documentation etc

1498415
publishing	release	.when	ready
i can imagine another publishing or deployment -build target that does a release and publishing to a test-server where i decide .when the release-version is ready to be pushed to our test-server

1498416
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
al.so this has to run on a numbers of different databases and platform .so triggers or .something similar are not really an option unless they ll run on mysql postgresql sql-server and sqlite

1498418
gridview	listview
hello is it possible to have a listview - listview.view - gridview - gridviewcolumn with two rows per row

1498430
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
if gridview1 containss any rows that do not contains a control named rblresult then rblanswer will be set to null .so you need to checked that rblanswer is not null before using it

1498431
payment	billing
i need to set up billing cycles and process payment

1498440
authentication	login
no login error text for role based authentication in asp.net

1498452
indexof	charat
you can easily put any character from a string into the function using the indexof or charat methods

1498460
value	field
i often have a selected box that has an add new option whereupon the selected field morphs into a textfield to allow users to add new value to the field on-the-fly

1498460
selected	button	put	get
i put a reset button .so they can get the regular selected box back

1498460
selected	button
i ve been exploring a reset button of .some .sort on each selected box that morphs .so they can just reset that one piece

1498466
unique	words
in other words does c have a unique identity and life of its own

1498502
selenium-ide	selenium
i used to recording tests ion selenium-ide for after export in selenium rspec formt to run all them with selenium rc

1498512
any	set
if you don t set any options like .so

1498518
32-bit	64bit
this will cause the 32-bit clr to be used rather than the 64bit clr

1498520
contains	elements
each block will contains mutiple superimpose elements images text for which the relative positioning needs to be specified with respect to the top left corner of the block

1498521
perl	php
i have php and perl support at server-side

1498521
perl	php
javascript can call a php scripting to start listening which will also call a perl scripting which has an endless listener loops and collects the received messages into a sink variables

1498525
e-commerce	product
i m building an e-commerce site with product being in multiple category

1498541
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
remember that the csc c# compiler is free part of the windows sdk as are the visual-studio express editions and al.so sharpdevelop al.so oss .so lots of options for you

1498563
windows-vista	windows-xp
you can think of linux mono as a .net target-platform just like windows-xp with .net 2.0 windows-vista with .net 3.5 etc

1498575
groovy	java
this is probably all a bit messy in java but i ve been in groovy land .so long that it jumped right out at me

1498577
http	ssl
the address it is posting to on my end is an http no ssl address

1498582
entity-framework	nhibernate
al.so note that there are plenty of off-the-shelf dals nhibernate entity-framework .so you don t need to roll your own and the work just as well in client-server architectures

1498587
web-config	app-config
here is an article on using an application configuration app-config web-config file in sql-server clr integration

1498590
contains	any
the difference between an xml schema and a database-schema is that the database-schema exists to represent the data while an xml schema exists to represent a markup structure without regard for any data it may or may not contains

1498593
keyboard	mouse
should trap every mouse and keyboard event but still the windows is raised onclientclick

1498596
xsd	xml
there s a w3c standards for formally describing the schema xml schema definition aka xsd

1498596
relational-database	schema
a relational-database server typically provides a strict schema enforcement

1498599
javascript	dom
the javascript on the target.asp page is not evaluated in the client unless you eval it or push it into the dom or something

1498616
stderr	stdout
this is because ramaze and its logging mechanism are keeping references to stdout and stderr prior win32console replace them

1498627
getter	setter
worse you completely replace the backing store in your derived setter .so your getter is checked a completely different variables than the one you set

1498627
getter	setter
as for the first question .when overridess properties in vb.net you always need to overrides both the getter and the setter even if you just replace it with an identical implementation

1498634
messenger	bots
i m programming a bots for msn messenger in python with the pymsn papyon libs

1498638
abstract	sealed
here is excerpt from 10.6.3 virtual sealed overrides and abstract accessor

1498638
inherited	accessor
if the inherited properties has only a single accessor if the inherited properties is readonly or write-only the overrides properties must include only that accessor

1498638
inherited	accessor
if the inherited properties include both accessor if the inherited properties is read-write the overrides properties can include either a single accessor or both accessor

1498643
perl	awk
i m using csh shell and have awk sed perl install

1498678
conditional	parentheses
try wrapping parentheses around each conditional to see if that works

1498727
authentication	login
.when a user is not authentication to access something they are sent to login which is the login action on my account controllers

1498727
authentication	login
how can i determine that a user has reached the login page because of not being authentication .so that i can show an appropriate error

1498763
value	field
the value for this field are derived from another model

1498765
windows-xp	windows
you can see the source code delphi 2006 of the xn resource editor is a free powerful fully featured resource editor and pe module explorer for windows 98 windows 2000 and windows-xp

1498776
preserve	copying
if you have a struct being used by c code a default copy-constructor needs to be there to preserve c struct copying semantics

1498788
javascript	dom
.when the user closes the pop-up i want to notify the opener page by calling a javascript function on it which does a few things with the dom

1498825
value	field
you can look for the query-string value or you can create your own authentication filtering set a field in tempdata indicating the reason

1498829
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can use asp.net webforms or asp.net-mvc for the user-interface and additional layer for business-logic and data-access

1498829
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms user-interface wcf service

1498830
grails	jsf
granule for jsp jsf grails ant

1498863
exception-handling	try-catch
the problem is that my try-catch doesn t catch the exception-handling

1498871
getter	setter
are you sure you don t have a small error somewhere in the getter or the setter

1498871
getter	setter
do you have both a getter and a setter for the properties

1498928
firefox	opera
i m having issues with it on opera and ie while on firefox it works

1498929
32-bit	64bit
obviously getting 64bit versioning of package install alongside of 32-bit versioning is not a one-liner

1498929
put	get
where would you put them how would you get them there and how would you use them

1498969
perl	ruby	perl	tcl	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	tcl	python	php	python	perl	python	java
i want to generator binding for python java .net php perl tcl ruby and octave automatically

1498977
gnome	kde
i don t think there s a portable way to do this at all but the linux world gnome and kde adhere to the freedesktop thumbnail standards which can be read at

1499010
perl	php
is there a way to do php via cgi .so i don t have to deal with perl or rely on the older code

1499037
malloc	strcat
you are not adding a null terminator to the string which strcat relies on or checked for a null return from malloc

1499047
solaris	linux
especially good to be a job scheduling for linux and solaris

1499083
oracle	mysql
not sure if this works in mysql exactly as written i m using oracle

1499099
push	pull
if i understand your problem correctly and you control the content of all the frame and all the frame content is from the same domain you can triggers an onload event on the bottomright frame to pull the data from topright rather than trying to push it

1499099
push	pull
bottomright can even invoke a function in topright and ask it to push the data which in my mind is still a form of pull

1499118
value	field
ok i have page with something like this i added scrapehere string to make it easier to navigate this page isn t 100 correct html and it has two identical field with different value

1499121
vb.net	vb6
it seems the only solution is to manually generator the idl and then import it back into .net as in this thread using vb.net with vb6

1499148
value	field
if you are using the returned value as a field in another class you should defined your field like this

1499150
dependency-injection	inject
.so an alternative .solution would be to have the model object delegation the responsibility for logging to a logger object and use dependency-injection to inject the model object with a suitable logger object

1499171
puts	gets
i ve noticed that the .aspx that gets rendering puts a tag on the link itself

1499189
hide	show
my methods was to really put everything in one huge index.html file and to hide or show certain content

1499217
children	nodes
planning on abstracting the complexities of the bgl but is this overkill for this kind of thing as i ll only be selected a nodes and recursing over all of its children

1499245
contains	elements
var_dump output an arrays first elements of which contains an input tag which is not display in the browser because it s hidden

1499268
python	c++
i ve already made a wrapper program in c++ that call the scripting since i ve realized that the ownership of running the scripting is decided by the ownership of the python interpreter

1499271
any	set
you can set that up to be whatever the grouping decides upon at any points

1499290
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
another solution is as you said create a listener daemons in whatever language perl python which is also a httpserver takes 10 lines-of-code import the required module and php connect to it via a simple http-request to ask it for the last stuff that happened

1499295
any	set
i know that you can t return a list set collections map or any interface from a webmethods which is stupid imo but i don t know what the design reasons were should i should probably withhold judgment

1499306
protected	public
declare c# code-behind variables either public or protected and then us it in block

1499307
selected	button
then i extended the grid_loaded methods in his class to add an event handler to the button but remember to remove the default selected all cmd first otherwise after running the event handler we have added the cmd gets run

1499308
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i am working on a php scripting that automatically display an image based on certain elements which don t matter for the sake of the question since that part works perfectly fine. out of the browsers i have tested it in the images are correctly display on google-chrome internet-explorer and safari

1499308
firefox	opera
however they do not appear on firefox or opera

1499308
firefox	opera
in firefox nothing is display and in opera the path of the image is which should be

1499322
json	xml
how to add functionality to get any user s post in json xml formats for ajax and maybe api keeping the dry principles and designing the code structure as smart as i can

1499325
contains	any
as you can see in all these cases the json packets contains the notification alert sound badge and any other extra bits you send is handed over to the application
