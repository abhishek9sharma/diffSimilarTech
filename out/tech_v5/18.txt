180016
entity-framework	nhibernate
i highly encourage this model as activerecord nhibernate are much more mature that linq-to-sql or the entity-framework

180039
json	xml
using groovy would you expect better performance in terms of speed and memory overhead to read and query json vs xml

180044
selected	button	selected	cell
upon selected a change settings button the program would change the background-color of the cell white to indicate to the user that the cell text could be changed

180097
double	int
those call will include methods that have arguments that are primitive-types int double etc.

180099
json	xml
json is smaller and simpler than xml

180103
any	set
what is correct way if any to set the title of the document

180112
json	xml
xml has a bit more overhead than json because of the angle brackets and extra information and what not

180112
json	xml
any good parsing should be able to parsing json faster than xml for this reason

180119
base-class	inherited
.so for this i decided to make a base-class which all other object that will need to be rendering will inherited called gameobject

180119
constructor	object
i ll also be removing most of the constructor and will have just one constructor because all of the arguments after modelresource aren t necessary to create the object and they can all be changed later through methods call

180149
capistrano	puppet
a lot of folks have been aggressively using a combinations of puppet and capistrano even non-rails developers for deployment automation tools to pretty good effect

180162
rollback	commit
yes everything that you do between the begin transactional and commit or rollback is part of the transactional

180172
any	set
is there any good reason that an empty set of round brackets parentheses isn t valid for calling the default-constructor in c++

180177
constructor	object
messier creating the object fewer constructor

180196
constructor	object
is a constructor call or a function-prototypes declaring a function named object with return-type myobject and no parameters

180211
contains	elements
if the div contains a clickable elements such as

180218
directory	folder
you can t checkout a single directory of a repository because the entire repository is handled by the single .git folder in the root of the project instead of subversion s myriad of .svn directory

180302
value	field
microsoft access 2000 or later does support the identity properties to retrieve the value of an autonumber field after an insert

180307
hidden-field	checkbox
most of the time this is done by also having an asp hidden-field control alongside each checkbox to hold an identifier to match it backup to the correct entity

180330
button	popup
i ve got a save dialog box which popup .when i press a button

180330
textbox	button
however i dont want to save a file at that points i want to take the named and place it in the textbox next to the button for the named to be used later

180353
macros	let	lisp	let
c++ templates are kind of like lisp macros not c macros in that they operate on the already parsing versioning of the code and they let you generator arbitrary code at compile-time

180358
delphi	vb6
i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api call than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide

180358
delphi	c++
i can handle delphi but i m wondering if c++ builder 2009 might be a better choice for me

180358
delphi	c++
i know very little about c++ builder and c++ but then i know very little about delphi either

180358
delphi	c++
.so for a java programmer that s new to both delphi and c++ builder which would you consider to be a better choice for productive development of win32 executable and dlls and why

180363
mouseleave	mouseenter
this is because there is no mouseenter and mouseleave events on the child control

180368
.when	ready
later .when you re ready to get everything a git-pull will merge in the rest of the commit

180384
google-chrome	firefox
ps you can enable firefox to auto log on via ntlm and it is one of the most requested features for google-chrome too .so don t let browser issues put you off

180411
delphi	c++
of course java syntax is more like c++ than like delphi but i think that the object-model is more similar to delphi

180430
syntax-error	syntax
not that i would normally mix the two but i like to do frequent syntax checked as i m writing code and i kept getting a syntax-error because of this

180440
put	get
while you can put any sql you like in the conditional of a named scoping if you then call find_by_sql then the scoping get throw away

180452
click	mouse
i m looking for behavior similar to the keypreview feature of forms except for mouse click rather than key presses

180466
constructor	object
alternatively you can make a struct or helpers class to hold all the data and have the many constructor in the struct that way you only have to have tons constructor in 1 object rather than in every class that inherited from gameobject

180484
configuration	environment
have environment folder with separate configuration for each environment

180497
delphi	c++
even if you don t use that garbage collecting memory manager i would still recommend delphi over c++

180497
delphi	c++
granted c++ builder has the whole delphi vcl and rtl .so it isn t as bad as visual-c++ but i still think delphi would be a better choice

180497
delphi	c++
for excel add-ins as you mentioned in your comment i would recommend delphi over c++ builder because it has better com support which i believe you need for excel add-ins

180513
spring	jsf
you might impress your friend to have a spring shale jsf struts project using hibernate along with some other framework you developed yourself but it is really just complexity for the sake of complexity

180514
perl	php	perl	c++
saying that you know how to program in c++ is like saying you know how to program in perl php .

180522
virtual-machine	virtualbox
normally virtualbox runs as a desktop .app but it s possible to start vms from the command-line and access the virtual-machine over rdp

180528
python	c++
python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures

180529
any	set
but there are still a good set of gem in there to utilize and try .when the profiling has found something you can t do any other way ie change algorithmically

180543
profiling	trace
they use the built-in jvm mechanism for profiling which can also give you extra information like stack trace execution paths and more comprehensive results if necessary

180557
python	lua	python	java
once you know c you might never drop it java uses jni to call c routines for low-level stuff python lua etc

180564
contains	elements
which creates a recording elements that containss named and value elementss which in turn contains the value of the named and value variables

180584
contains	set
for each set s contains i if it is not already tagged by j then

180600
data-structures	dictionary
dictionary of algorithms and data-structures is a fairly comprehensive list and include complexity big-o in the algorithms descriptions

180601
implements	super
the fact is that super is implements in java as well as in c# where it is called base unless i m wrong

180608
winmerge	svn
if you need at some points to compare some hacked versioning with some official versioning you will just pull out from svn the appropriate hacked versioning numbers unzip-it and compare-it with the official and external stored versioning with winmerge for instances

180623
base-class	inherited
i can t see how it would be built into the language anyway because multiple inherited means there can be many base-classes .so you can typedef it as you see fit for the class you logically feel is the most important base-class

180626
constructor	object
ideally i d like the hosting process to get the connection-string from the configuration file and pass it to a constructor for my service object documentinfoservice which would hold onto it and use it to pass to business-objects as needed

180626
constructor	object
however the servicehost constructor takes a system.type object -- .so instances of documentinfoservice are created via the default-constructor

180626
constructor	object
i did note that there is another constructor methods for servicehost that takes an object instances -- but the docs indicate that is for use with singleton

180630
unix	bsd
it isn t quite irrelevant - some versioning 6 unix stuff escaped into bsd but these days you d be extremely hard pressed to find anything that ancient in current use

180630
double-quotes	spaces
indeed if there s a chance that file named might contains spaces macos x and windows both encourage that to some extent and unix has always supported it though tools like xargs make it harder then you should enclose file named in double-quotes every time you use them too

180634
subclassing	inherited
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem .when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it

180636
testng	junit
there are 2 main unit test frameworks -- junit and testng

180647
selected	textbox
i find it difficult to get a selected elements and a textbox to be the same width even .when using the width styles attributes and it is even more difficult across browsers

180656
selected	cell
i know of the width i want then set the selected and input styles width to 100 .so they fill the div cell they are in

180659
margins	padding
it may be useful to turn padding and margins off on all elements

180674
llvm	gcc
in particular i don t know if it works with the clang frontend from the llvm project though it should work with llvm-gcc llvm using the gcc frontend

180685
superclass	inherited
one additional reason to use a typedef for the superclass is .when you are using complex templates in the object s inherited

180687
savepoints	rollback
.when googling for more info i came across this - you can set savepoints which can be rollback to without rollback the whole transactional

180695
selection	cell
inorder to trap repeated click on the same cell you need to move the focus to a different cell .so that each time you click you are in fact moving the selection

180695
selected	cell
the code below will selected the top left cell visible on the screens .when you click on any cell

180695
selected	cell
obviously it has the flaw that it won t trap a click on the top left cell but that can be managed eg by selected the top right cell if the activecell is the top left

180698
printf	scanf
this is portable but nowhere near as inefficient as using printf scanf

180700
sql-server	oracle
maybe you could borrow the data from oracle s time zone file and building your own sql-server function

180724
delphi	c++
i haven t used the c++ builder ide but i d be really surprised if it has a gui builder that s as nice as delphi

180724
delphi	c++
although superficially the syntax of c++ looks more like that of java delphi s object-model is actually closer to that of java

180739
constructor	object
what you could do is add code to your service object constructor to read the relevant configuration value itself through the configurationmanager class

180777
display	height
i have a listbox which display items of variables height

180782
pascal	basic
i did though have a background in basic pascal logo and lisp

180784
groovy	java	python	java
i ve had success with python win32 extensions and groovy s scriptom libs on other project but need to do this is pure java this time if possible

180814
webforms	asp.net
i have a button on my asp.net webforms

180826
radio-button	checkbox
i assume selection of excel file or html report is done in some html control like a radio-button or a checkbox

180832
nsstring	nsdata
i replace it with a tiny ultra compact base64 encoder written entirely as one c function i copy-paste the function body into the methods body methods took nsdata as input and returned nsstring as output however inside the function everything was c

180832
arrays	loops
we replace all nsarrays s with normals c arrayss object with struct after all graphing coordinate information is nothing you must have in object enumerator access with simple for loops and started moving data between the arrayss with memcpy instead of taking data from one arrays to the other one index for index

180833
vbscript	jscript
you can use your choice of languages to write scripting jscript vbscript even python

180839
shipping	tax
your parameters or cmd would be base price local tax city tax state tax ground shipping and coupon discount

180849
contains	any
by the way if the pop-up doesn t contains any useful output what you may want to do is submit your form into a small iframe within the page

180856
contains	any
edit i realized that if the string does not contains any quotes it will match all double dashes in the string

180878
getter	setter
the biggest pointers that you are doing oo wrong is lots of setter and getter the desire to use a switching statement and a large inherited tree but there are many others your question wasn t oo but close enough

180885
versioning	upgrade
the main issue with it is that .when new versioning are release the api can change drastically making it very difficult to manage upgrade

180898
any	set
markup returned from an ajax call isn t present .when you set up the page .so it doesn t have any onclientclick handler as.sociated with it

180906
dictionary	map
it s not identical but vbscript has a dictionary object which behaves like java s map or hashtable

180925
performance-monitor	perfmon
if you want to monitor the numbers of orchestrations being execute per second bu an application or the numbers of messages going through a ports you can use performance-monitor perfmon

180974
python	java
in languages like java and python exception-handling are very common especially in certain situations

180996
jndi	jms
java ee can be a bit daunting with the acronym soup of technologies available but concentrate on the basic ejb3 jndi jms data-access like hibernate jdo and containers basic

181006
attributes	properties
be changed using the webservice attributes s namespace properties

181056
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari

181070
binaries	install
add your ruby bin directory to your path environment variables go to control panels - systemd - advanced systemd settings then go to the advanced tab environment variabless then edit your path variables and append the path to the ruby binaries install

181081
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i m not sure what the support is for google-chrome but i ve had good luck with it for ie and firefox and allegedly it works with safari

181084
32-bit	64bit
i suspect the same applies for linux gcc - 32-bit does not allow you whereas 64bit allows you

181085
webforms	asp.net
if you re trying to do something which is not a crud web .app like twitter which is actually a messaging systemd or if you are insane and want to use a model like asp.net webforms then you will also encounter problems

181091
value	field
they were the result-of parsing json that had multiple field some of which the value were hash as well

181093
value	field
use a after_save filtering to recalculate the field on anything that can modify that value

181132
contains	elements
via mootools i get these anchor elements by id .so that once they re click a flashy div will pop-up below them that contains the login or signup form with methods to stop the propagation of events of course

181153
firefox	safari
edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -

181158
databound	gridview
i have a databound gridview in asp.net 2.0 with a row-selection link

181170
hash	md5
will cause its md5 hash to also

181170
hash	md5
change the md5 hash is commonly used

181170
linux	unix
in most unix linux and unix-like

181213
environment	building
is there anyway to building a solution to target 64bit environment in vs2003

181222
shell	bash
btw i run it from a bash shell like .so

181224
32-bit	64bit
the sdk as well as having libs for 32-bit programming has 64bit versioning for amd64 and ia64 intel development

181224
32-bit	64bit
i wanted the choice of developing 32-bit or 64bit project

181224
any	set
while the platform sdk comes with cmd files to set up the correct paths they wipe out any other paths

181226
authentication	login
i am using an authentication attributes on some of my actions in an asp.net-mvc page to refer people to a login screens if they have not authentication

181237
configuration	environment	environment	building
it is messy and every now and then we d building the wrong project configuration for the environment which always took a while to sort out

181245
shell	bash
it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available .when this code is run at the appointed time

181252
perl	ksh	bash	zsh
if you wish to get around that messages have at run a scripting that call a specified environment be it ksh bash csh zsh perl etc

181291
mime	rfc
accept attributes was introduced in the rfc 1867 intending to enable file-types filtering based on mime types for the file-select control

181293
sctp	tcp
sctp is an alternative to tcp which attempts to address these shortcomings among others

181308
signals	sigpipe
before you start socket handling you need to have a signals handler in-place that will alert you .when you get sigpipe

181313
shell	bash
is there a cmd within the bash shell of fedora that will give me the currently assign ip-address

181315
rad-controls	telerik
i ve used telerik rad-controls for asp.net and it is a very comprehensive suite of controls that are easily converted to ajax

181341
http	ssl
dag tunnel ssh over http s has been pointed out to me but it doesn t help at the end of the article they mention bug 29744 - connect does not work over existing ssl connection preventing tunnel over http exactly the problem i was running into

181346
switching	router
some of these reasons include the time to live ttl field being decrement to zero often meaning that the packets got stuck in a router loops or the packets getting dropped due to switching contention causing buffering overruns

181348
constructor	object
i d like to initializer a date object using the following standards constructor

181374
value	field
in some cases every field on the form textbox labels picturebox etc has its value changed

181388
activerecord	datamapper
have you refactored from an activerecord to a datamapper pattern

181394
contains	any
edit the fundamental difference between the c and objective-c runtime is as i understand it .when libs are loaded the functions in those libs contains pointers to any symbols they reference whereas in objective-c they contains string representations of the named of thsoe symbols

181395
telnet	ftp
what about mail 25 110 143 telnet 23 ftp 21 dns 53 or even whois 43

181400
plugins	add-on
any numbers of things could be interfering with the events actually firing plugins add-on keypresses etc

181401
arguments	default
go into windows - preferences then selected java - install jres clone the jre used by tomcat and add the following to the default viewmodel arguments

181401
selected	button
after that open server - runtime environment in the preferences and selected your apache tomcat environment then click the edit... button

181413
command-line	cmd
before i begin i want to clarify that this is not a command-line tool but an application that accepts cmd through it s own command-line interface

181413
command-line	cmd
i am building a command-line interface application that accepts cmd from a user

181450
coalesce	isnull
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contains nulls

181477
activerecord	datamapper
i initially used activerecord but i needed nonblocking thread-safe access to the database .so i switched to using datamapper

181487
return-value	return-type
this is why for events the return-type is void - there is no single return-value - .so to feed back information you would have properties on the eventargs which the event handler would alter

181492
python	perl
lots of engineers turn to pre and .post process in python or perl

181492
python	perl
granted for saving money i d either use octave or skimp on ease and learn to work with sparse-matrix in perl or python

181505
push	pull
is there any way i can push a new recording to sqldatareader after i pull a table down

181523
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	internet-explorer	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i tested this out in internet-explorer 7 firefox 3 and safari google-chrome

181523
google-chrome	safari
the only one that differs is safari google-chrome and it appears to be 1 or 2 pixels wider than all the other browsers

181563
runas	cmd
you can ease the pain to login as another user by making use of the runas cmd

181563
credentials	account
.so it s possible to just create a shortcut on the desktop that opens a browser making use of another account s credentials

181576
moss	wss
but in wss session state is not used by default in moss it is used by infopath form service

181579
python	ruby	haskell	python
list-comprehension is a very useful code mechanism that is found in several languages such as haskell python and ruby just to named a few off the top of my head

181579
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i find myself working on an openoffice.org spreadsheet and i need to do something fairly common i want to count all of the value in a range of cell that fall between a high and low bounds

181597
textbox	button
i am talking about our good friend labels textbox button etc

181636
put	get
to get help on cmd this .bat file will put all cmd help into a nice html page

181692
order	join
you can join both t1 and t2 in either order then run task3 after the join

181696
key-value	key
if you don t have key-value pairs but simply key use std set

181698
selected	cell
selected certain cell

181698
selected	cell
then the easiest way seems to be to move the focus off the selecteded cell .so that click it will triggers a selected event

181698
selected	cell
another option is to extends the selectedion by one cell left right up down because this permits editing of the original cell but will triggers a selected event if that cell is click again on its own

181698
selection	cell
if you only wanted to trap selection of a single column of cell you could insert a hidden column to the right extends the selection to include the hidden cell to the right .when the user click and this gives you an editable cell which can be trapped every time it is click

181736
contains	elements
edit perhaps from what you say it could be that web-config is screwed up contains invalid xml no closing tag for some elements etc

181754
silverlight	wpf
and forget wpf as there is no support at this time and there may never be although they are working on moonlight aka silverlight for linux

181774
contains	any
and i haven t done anything with the query-string yet my routes don t contains any query-string

181792
database-table	mysql
i once had a mysql database-table contains 25 million recording which made even a simple query takes minute to execute

181801
innodb	myisam
with regards to mysql in particular there are even slight indexing difference between innodb and myisam tables which are the two most commonly used table types

181814
google-chrome	safari
safari uses its own rendering engine for everything including the windows google-chrome which is why it doesn t look like a normals windowss .app and why your localized title are working

181829
strict	let
the code used a string as parameter and option strict was off and the developers mainly let vb do its own conversion thing

181839
oracle	mysql
this isn t going to be fast using mysql innodb it s not going to be fast in oracle or anything else

181852
subtract	time
you got your time subtract

181861
export	report
is there .some way to caching a generator report in the report service .so that i could later export it to .some other format

181861
export	report
.so the question is whether report service support .some .sort of caching mechanism for the generator data and a later export to a specified format

181861
export	report
i m currious how is the export button implements in the report viewer control - does it actually regenerate the report or does it somehow export it

181863
callback	methods
you can use the callback methods to mock side-effects

181898
lighttpd	apache
inorder to lighten apache s load people often suggest using lighttpd to serve up static-content

181898
lighttpd	apache
in this setup apache passes request for static-content back to lighttpd via mod_proxy while serving dynamic request itself

181898
lighttpd	apache
from what i can see the size of the apache process proxy its request through lighttpd is as large as it would be if it were serving the file itself

181912
constructor	private	constructor	object
there is a long running habit here where i work that the connection-string lives in the web-config a sql connection object is initializer in a using block with that connection-string and passed to the dataobjects constructor via a createinstance methods as the constructor is private

181919
lighttpd	apache
you don t have an apache process spawned for each request - static files images and the like are fetched directly by lighttpd

181920
moss	wss
there s windows sharepoint service wss and then there is microsoft office sharepoint server moss

181920
moss	wss
moss considerably more expensive than wss which ships as part of microsoft server licensing

181920
moss	wss
edit the feature comparision page is helpful in illustrating the numerous features that moss has and wss does not

181920
moss	wss
how would you describe the difference or additional benefits of moss over wss in a couple of sequences

181920
moss	wss
in essence what are the big ticket items in moss and not in wss

181936
yield-keyword	yield
yield prolog uses yield-keyword in c# and python and javascript and custom variables class to simulate prolog machine

181938
sql-server	oracle
toad for oracle can do it .so i suspect toad for sql-server will be able to too

181939
getter	setter
getter and setter

181954
runas	cmd
there s al.so the runas cmd-line executable which you could look at .so you could create a shortcut that contains the runas cmd the credentials and the path to query analyser

181955
lighttpd	apache
maybe it does reduce the load of apache because it doesn t have to do io to the disk but it will increase the load of lighttpd on the same machine and thus reducing the available load to apache .

181955
lighttpd	apache
maybe lighttpd io access is lighter than that of apache 1.3 but why not just switching to apache 2 or lighttpd completely

181957
moss	wss
there is a lot built-in to wss but moss has a ton of extra stuff as referenced in the other answer

181963
authentication	login
and once you are doing that it may be worth considering mixed-mode authentication and use sql login passwd for this specific situation

181966
template-engine	velocity
i want to use a template-engine in a struts application and would like to know if using tile can be recommended instead of freemarker or velocity

181973
sql-server	mysql	sql-server-express	sql-server
if you don t have an access front end then there are few arguments in favour of a ace jet back end .when considering the much more scalability and capable alternatives sql-server-express or sql-server compact edition for ms shops mysql etc

181973
rollback	commit
happily you can use sql dcl begin transactional commit transactional rollback transactional etc to acomplish things not possible with dao nested transactionalal

181978
triggers	insert
triggers if they re supported which handles sql updates and insert and writes event information to some table

181988
system.web	.net
although the methods could change in a future versioning of the .net it doesn t seem likelyâ asp.net heavily depends on it though it s possible they could move it from mscorlib to system.web which is the only assembly that i know of from where the methods is referred to

attributes	properties
you can use the castle.core.donotwireattributes attributes to stop a properties from being wired up by the inversion-of-control containers this is in the castle.core assembly which means your libs only needs to take a dependency on the lightweight castle.core assembly - if for example you want to use the code without an inversion-of-control containers altogether or in a different inversion-of-control containers

182002
attributes	properties
introduce some kind of attributes on the properties declaration in the xml myprop wire false

182002
attributes	properties
inherited from propertiesdependenciesmodelinspector overrides the inspectproperties methods to apply some additional logic to identifying which properties should be added as dependencies to the components model inspector the model.configuration for the wire false attributes value pair

182008
lighttpd	apache
yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi

182018
any	set
can you tell me is there any algorithm for writing result set rows in a file .so the content would be .sorted in the end and can i gain in performance with this

182022
selected	checkbox
once you install it go to tools ddevextensions - options and in the compiler enhancements section selected the active checkbox and treat warnings as errors

182023
python	java	python	c++
in short you write some descriptions about your structures and it compiles to a specialized oop libs in java c++ or python that you include in your client and server

182035
optgroup	selected
internet-explorer 6 seems totally ignore css classes or rules on selected option or optgroup tags

182057
turbogears	django
most web development frameworks django turbogears etc come with a built-in webserver cmd that runs on the local computer without apache

182059
inno-setup	nsis
you could building your own wrapper if using nsis or inno-setup wasn t an option

182082

182089
distinct-values	contains
.when this process has finished the hashtable will contains distinct-values anyway

182092
boolean	int

182153
javascript	dom
do you need to use canvas what you re describing could be done with just javascript and the dom

182180
python	php
i would prefer a python or php solution but anything will work

182184
webrequest	webclient
one other option might be to get the data yourself webclient webrequest etc and simply push that html into the webbrowser - but this will mess up external links etc

182185
webserver	nginx
personally while lighttpd is ok i would go with nginx + fastcgi if you end up going with a lightweight webserver + fastcgi solution

182185
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
fastcgi the issue here and it doesn t matter if your webserver is apache lighttpd or nginx is figuring out how many fastcgi child process you let each user leave running because each process eats memory equals to the size of the php interpreter in linux not all of it is wired of course but i digress

182185
lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	suexec
i do sympathize with the desire to do something interesting like lighttpd + fastcgi instead of the standards apache + cgi + suexec but i deep down i really can t recommend it

182199
postgresql	mysql
native drivers for most proprietary and open-source databases such as mysql and postgresql also exist

182246
enterprise	platform
it is .when you start using sharepoint for enterprise level applications and as a primary platform for development that you should consider moss

182253
ubuntu	linux
i have always been using happily the os.path module to deal with filepath but recently i ended up with unexpected results on python 2.5 under ubuntu linux while dealing with string that represent windows filepaths

182318
xlsx	docx
the new office formats docx xlsx etc are zip files that contains a collections of xml files

182324
protected	public
if you want to access protected methods you could create a subclassing of the class you want to use that exposes the methods you want to use as public or internal to the namespace to be safer and have an instances of that class in your class use it as a proxy

182333
traffic	wan
it also had the feature to drop the link occasionally as wan links were less reliable for us than local traffic

182344
moss	wss
about wss vs moss

182344
moss	wss
moss allows you to use user profils not wss

182344
moss	wss
search functionalities are cheap in wss compare to moss but you can extends them using search server express

182344
sql-server	oracle
the bdc business data catalog allows you to view an external business datasource such as a sql database not necessarily sql-server it can be oracle mysql.... or web-services

use edt debugging techniques and a smart look-and-feel like substance which checked for edt violation

182436
any	set
are there any tools available for validation a database-schema against a set of design rules naming-conventions etc

182436
value	field
- field with a constraint limiting it it certain value it should have a default

182440
exception-handling	try-catch
i d instinctively assume that the first example is more correct you know exactly which exception-handling happened but couldn t the try-catch be too expensive

182447
configuration	environment
additionally if your .app is used either at multiple sites with different server and component configuration or has a changing configuration on the live environment you can use the later stages of testing to verify that the .app will handle those changes

182447
configuration	environment
as a developer you don t and should not have control of the production-environment in particular .when your .app is being distribute to multiple customers or seperate sites this to me is the real benefit of using both an inversion-of-control and external configuration as it is up to the infrastructure production support to tweak and adjust the live environment without having to go back to developers and through test higher cost .when all they want to do is move a component

182447
configuration	environment
in practice i ve found that even .when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration

182454
bazaar	git
the likes of monotone git and bazaar have really raised the bar in terms of productivity

182456
toolchain	cmake
or use cmake and a toolchain file to manage the building

182475

directory	folder
i would like tortoisesvn 1.5.3 to ignore certain folder their contents and certain other files wherever they might appear in my directory hierarchy but i cannot get the global ignore string right

182525
stderr	stdout
now if you want to just not see it you can use at time 2 dev-null to send it off to oblivion but unfortunately the at prompt are printed to stderr for .some rea.son a bug imo - they really should go to stdout .so they re al.so hidden by this

182527
order	add
it s certainly easier effort-wise to add the order by to the query

182527
treeset	treemap
the easiest way is to chunks the data in a sorted collections treeset treemap using a comparator to sort on the column you need

182533
vb.net	vb6
the short answer is that vb6 and vb.net and consequently c# are separate language but related languages

182533
vb.net	vb6
how to switching a large .app from vb6 to vb.net

182534
sql-server	oracle
most recently x was oracle and y was sql-server

182544
filtering	grouping
we need to filtering all the entries of these grouping

182555
linux	unix
i don t know sql-server but i can imagine a microsoft program with its nice gui management would be vastly different to managing db2 z for example although you can use the fancy db2 luw linux unix windows tools if you re that way inclined

182563
any	set
you al.so may want to set the id properties of each textbox .so you can access any specific on you may be looking for down the road

182572
quicksort	in-place
it might need quite a lot of memory for sorting it s not in-place but the performance is much better on sorted arrays and almost identical on random ones the initial sort took almost the same time for both quicksort was only slightly faster

182572
quicksort	heapsort
if merge sort is no option and quicksort is no option for sure the best alternative is probably heapsort

182591
python	java	apache-fop	docbook
my own docbook pipeline include python java xerces xalan apache-fop and pdf-sam

182594
java-3d	jogl
i am using java java-3d jogl

182621
python	perl
best way is just to install python or perl

182637
ubuntu	linux
i want to be able to have both linux probably ubuntu and windows-vista on my home computer

182637
32-bit	64bit
also i assume there would be no problem if i were to use windows 32-bit along with ubuntu 64bit

182638
rescue	throw
an aexception throw from a basecontroller should use the rescue

182649
javascript	dom
you can pass in javascript that registers events on controls after the page has loaded .when the html controls on the page are all present in the dom

182654
glfw	sdl
in c++ i have used sdl and glfw

182654
python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
as far as languages are concerned if you use c++ then i would definitely recommend looking into using something like squirrel lua or python for scripting though writing the entire game in something like python would also be good and should performance start becoming an issue later you can write just the modules that are causing problems in c++ - after profiling of course

182656
virtualbox	vmware
i ve had problems with virtual-pc on some linux distros fedora core comes to mind but no problems with vmware or virtualbox

182678
ubuntu	linux
it s well supported in linux especially ubuntu

182687
web-services	security
if it s just to go to the latest technology for the sake of the latest technology i d say stick with asmx web-services if your requirements for messages and protocols security aren t that high and you re working with mostly microsoft technologies

182703
sql-server	oracle
i went from sql-server to oracle in 2001 where i went from working on a vb6 sql-server project as a developer to working as an oracle development dba for a large j2ee project

182703
sql-server	oracle
most competent programmers should be able to make the jump by just tinkering around and getting some good sql-server books such as the guru s guide or oracle books such as expert one-on-one oracle depending on which way you re going

182724
http	ssl
not even ssl http

182724
registration	login
faster easier registration and login

182744
delete-row	rows
imagine you have 1 million rows in your table and you delete-row 1 that s 999999 rows you now have to updates to subtract 1 from the id

182763
virtualbox	vmware
i ve tried both vmware and virtualbox both free and i like virtualbox a little better because you can use it with the .iso straight

182771
click	mouse
how can i get a uielement to ignore mouse click on it and pass it through to the control behind it

182771
click	mouse
.when i attempt to click on the background elements the mouse click is capture by the foreground semi-transparent uielements

182776

182784
sql-server	mysql
i want to import data from ms sql-server run it through some sort of regexp to filtering out stuff and import it into mysql

182792
value	field
i saw a rather good advice that i try and apply avoid to initializer class field to default value

182793
sql-server	oracle
i ve gone the other way oracle first then sql-server

182822
rounding	currency
however if you are multiplying your currency numbers by floating-point types or dividing your currency value the rounding does need to be worked out one way or the other

182876
websphere	ibm
often i found out-of-memory on ibm websphere application-server

182887
sql-server	oracle
i ve done sql-server for 10 years but started working with oracle about a year and a half ago

182887
data-access	ado.net
programming-wise the oracle data-access classes are modeled on ado.net we use oledb actually - one of the side benefits is that you don t have to futz around with the oracleblob class inorder to access blob data .so not much learning to be done there

182893
turbogears	django
it s really a nice python web framework if you don t required everything django and turbogears offers

182899
cursor	row
1 if you are dealing with small data on the client side use a result set implementation that lets you set the cursor to the end of the set get its row offset then reset the cursor to before first

182904
export	report
open up the report you want to export click on export in the file menu and at least in cr 10 xml is at the very bottom

182955
mapper	dozer
dozer is a bean mapper you can use it to convert say a personejb to an object of the same class

182960
updating	updates
you can see what will updates without actually updating by issuing

182983
show	next
the design review gives a good opportunity to show them how to improve the design .so hopefully they will do a better job the next time

182999
vb.net	vb6
you can use the vb6 to vb.net tool as stated in this answer and then use either reflector or sharpdevelop to convert to c#

183007
virtual-machine	vmware
one other great thing about using a virtual-machine is that you only have to worry about getting your network settings sorted on your main os because vmware etc will borrow those

183026
default-value	default
yes the with value modifiers to a default constraint applies the default-value to existing rows eliminating all the hard work describe in the question

183033
python	perl	python	java
this has previously been asked for python perl and java

183038
build-system	scons
scons is a nice build-system that runs on every machine that has python

183047
32-bit	64bit
i dual boot vista ultimate 32-bit and ubuntu 8.10 beta 64bit with no problems

183056
dump	temp
basically this will dump a backup of the specified source svn repo to a file create a new repo load the backup into it checkout the files get a list of files that contains the string to search for perform a regex on each of those files storing the new versioning in a temp location and then moving the temp file back to the original location and finally checked the changes back into the new repo

183091
packaging	building
i ve looked at ant and maven and they don t seem to be well geared towards remote administration the way capistrano is - they seem much more focused on simply building and packaging applications

183121
attributes	properties
i m not sure what the tag properties did in vb6 but maybe you re looking for the attributes properties of web-controls

183156
directory	folder
another way to do it is to remove all the .svn directory in all the folder

183173
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
specific performance tuning methods vary by database but in general avoid returning more recording or field than you actually need make sure all join field are indexed as well as common where-clause field avoid cursor although i think this is less true in oracle than sql-server i don t know about mysql

183179
updatepanel	datalist
the datalist is in an updatepanel .so the item smoothly disappears after a half of a second or maybe a little more but what i d really like is for the row to slider out up as .soon as they hit the delete button and then have it delete the item on the postback

183205
margins	padding
rules like margins and padding float and clear and .so on can all have unexpected consequences on other elements

183209
managed-code	unmanaged
i need to be able to properly handle this exception-handling in my unmanaged c++ to ensure things like pointers cleanup and potentially rethrow the exception-handling up into more managed-code

183209
managed-code	unmanaged
managed-code - unmanaged c++ - callback to managed-code via delegation exception-handling can be throw here

183209
pointers	stack
anyone have pointers for properly handling this situation .so that the re.sources in unmanaged-code can be cleaned up and a usable exception-handling can be throw out to the managed-code which initiated the whole call stack

183235
member-functions	class-template
virtual member-functions are initializer .when a class-template is initializer but non-virtual member-functions are initializer only if they are called

183242
moss	wss
a numbers of my clients run sharepoint both moss and wss in virtual environment sql-server is also virtualised and backed up both with sql tools and with volume shadow-copy

183245
hide	show
warning double-click here to show hide compiler links

183263
checkbox	button
most of the time any asp control will cause a postback button link click but some don t unless you tell them to checkbox combobox

183271
backslash	regex
pipe character should be escaped with a single backslash in a perl regex

183279
dialog	pop-up
what i want to do is pop-up a please wait dialog

183280
multiplying	subtract
but .when loops variables equals the limit rather than multiplying by the fractions i subtract the subtotal variables from the total cost and put that in the last department

183290
put	get
but if you required additional step fabric has worked very well for me .so far and i assume that capistrano al.so offers generics shell-command put and get operations

183307
lookup	any
any programmer worth his or her salt should know the difference between a multiplying and a bit-shift or be able to read the ternary-operator where it is used appropriately be able to lookup and understand a complex algorithm you are commenting your code right

183309
any	set
you can set a given form to .post to any url you want to

183338
groovy	java	perl	ruby
available languages being ruby groovy java perl or powershell since i d be writing it

183363
multiplication	bit-shift
the bit-shift versus the multiplication is a trivial optimization that gains next to nothing

183369
firefox	opera
i m looking for a xpath libs to query over xml document in firefox ie opera and safari.

183401
annotations	mapping
i haven t used jpa annotations .so i don t know how good they are but i would argue that leaving the mapping of beans to the database in xml is al.so good as the object shouldn t care where its information came from it should just care what it can do with its information

183422
display	height	display	width	margins	padding
for example i usually list margins padding height width border fonts display float other in that order allowing for easier reliability in my next tip

183450
contains	any
ones that don t contains any native-code

183462
groovy	java
while groovy is pretty straight-forward since it s basically java i can t say i grok grails

183462
ruby-on-rails	grails
i read that groovy is to grails as ruby is to ruby-on-rails but what does that mean

183473
compact-framework	.net
the libs that i have found that allow me to parsing json in c# litjson and jayrock don t work on windows-mobile they required classes that are not present in the .net compact-framework

183481
postback	ajax
technologies like ajax and asp.net-mvc have changed the way postback work

183506
environment	building
a better option again imo is to have warnings throw at compile-time or .something similar .so long as your building environment supports this

183527
variables	boolean
however .when i try to run the package from the command-line and pass in a value for my variables it errors out claiming the expression does not evaluate to a boolean

183539
arrays	loops
in the former the runtime can t guarantee that i wasn t modified prior to loops and forces bounds checked on the arrays for every index lookup

183565
contains	elements
as an inline elements may only contains other inline elementss

183575
exception-handling	try-catch
only one try-catch is needed and all exception-handling can be safely handled

183579
spring	seam
i m working on a seam project which also uses spring and i usually deploy it to different development and test servers

183584
ruby-on-rails	grails
groovy is to grails as ruby is to ruby-on-rails but what does that mean

183587
.when	ready
.when you ready to save use the oniteminserting event

183587
.when	ready
.when you ready to save use the oniteminserting event

183621
hide	show
it is generally ok to read the session from your views to hide and show data links

183626
exception-handling	try-catch
you don t need to wrap everything in a try-catch but you do need to ensure that exception-handling are always caught eventually

183629
getter	setter
yet it is possible to call getter setter on those object in the context of building up a transactional

183634
document	editing
.so you end up editing svg document and export them to pngs

183635
exception-handling	try-catch
add a try-catch around the code if the .net interface you are calling throw an exception-handling

183635
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch doesn t have a performance hit as such the hit comes in .when the exception-handling is throw and the code might have to walk up several levels of the call stack before something handles it

183644
fadein	hide
you ll have to hide it before you can use fadein

183657
sql-server	oracle
i ll state my bias upfront - oracle is far more complex than sql-server

183657
positioning	fluid
you say that this is not for a dba positioning but that definition is pretty fluid

183660
keyboard	mouse
the only reliable devices are the video the mouse and keyboard

183667
checked-exceptions	runtimeexception
similarly error should throw further than runtimeexception and runtimeexception further than checked-exceptions

183675
value	field
my goal is to write a stored proc that can collect all field value from multiple rows into one single output variables maybe varchar some_length

183685
hashtable	set
i know that you can somewhat mimic a set using a dictionary or a hashtable by populating but ignoring the value but that s not a very elegant way

183691
duplicates	elements	duplicates	contains	contains	elements	contains	set
a set is a collections that contains no duplicates elements and whose elements are in no particular order.

183691
hashtable	set
the hashset ofâ t class is based on the model of mathematical sets and provides high-performance set operations similar to accessing the key of the dictionary ofâ tkey â tvalue or hashtable collections

183691
duplicates	sorted	duplicates	contains	contains	sorted
a hashset ofâ t collections is not sorted and cannot contains duplicates elements.

183692
arrays	map
hash.to_a creates an arrays of key-value arrayss .so the first map gets you

183712
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch should be for exception-handling things you can not control

183715
set	bag	ordereddictionary	bag
apart from set and orderedset it has a few other usefull collections types such as deque multidictionary bag orderedbag ordereddictionary and orderedmultidictionary

183741
.when	ready
you re other unappealing option is to create a custom channel that is capable of manipluating the messagess and putting them in a seperate vip line and a corresponding operation behavior that can pull from the vip line .when the service operation is ready to recieve a messages

183750
nsmutablearray	nsarray
look at the documentation for nsarray nsmutablearray and uiimage for more information

183772
contains	any
author would contains author id as well as other information such as first named last named that you need to collect about any given author

183774
perl	awk	python	perl
i would probably just knock something up in python or perl or awk

183779
bufferedwriter	filewriter
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated streaming first .so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself

183786
value	field
a commercial tool would be nice but given the variety of problems that i ve encountered in csv files missing delimiters bad separator value embedded cr linefeed in the middle of field etc. it was worth writing my own

183831
png	gif
jpeg gif and png can be display with the img tag and will work in all browsers the object elements can be use for display images specifying its mime types but what other graphic formats are supported by img or object-tag in most browsers without installing plugins

183851
png	gif
the file types you listed jpg gif and png seem to be the main formats supported by nearly every browser albeit with certain caveats

183881
32-bit	64bit
64bit and 32-bit windows-vista and

183892
delphi	c++
i usually spend some time with delphi programming on vacation and most of the other time i use only c++ and masm

183892
delphi	c++
and one thing s odd .when i m on delphi i don t like case sensitivity but .when i m on c++ - i do

183901
directory	folder
it s really annoying to have to change directory to my project folder the first time i run msbuild every day

183902
show	next
show only the next link

183957
innodb	myisam
while testing mysql try both myisam and innodb

183983
mips	x86
using a simple backend machine not an x86 rather selected some simple machine like a bare-bones mips

184020
keyboard	mouse
allow users to use either the keyboard or mouse flexible

184036
bison	yacc
about midway through the semester we flipped to parsing scanner generator like lex yacc or flex bison

184049
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
at this points the choices for language are php cake symfony zend python django ruby merb

184056
packaging	building
using maven you can then run the unit tests without packaging it to a jar and you can building a jar that contains just your application

184059
linux	bsd
in operating systemd theory and afaik this applies to operating systemdd such as windows linux bsd ... a process is defined as a thread with its own page table its own virtual-memory spaces

184060
configuration	installation
i ve got a stand-alone application that consists of several files jar files data files etc and would need to do some pretty standards installation tasks like asking the user for target directory have them locate some parts of their systemd - choose some of the per-machine or per-user configuration options and possibly try to detection some of the machine settings for them

184060
linux	osx
it would be ideal if it were cross-platform capable linux mac osx and windows

184067
constructor	object
pass the object as a parameter to the second form constructor which can populate the instances field and return that instances to the calling form

184104
arrays	loops
_post is just a normals as.sociativity arrays .so you can al.so loops over the entire thing like this

184111
code-coverage	partcover
i m using partcover to get basic information on code-coverage from my nunit tests

184122
value	field
an easy way to give tab controls different labels depending on a field value is to change the caption itself

184127
environment	execution
you can fake it somewhat by doing something like you have suggested basically creating a closure object that maintains the execution environment state

184151
margins	padding
even the margins and padding information is saved in clear ascii

184157
ftp	scp
i see that you want some administration tools scp ftp-client and ruby has it .net-sftp and .net ftp libs

184167
decimal-point	digits
take each numbers and make sure that the numbers of digits to the right of the decimal-point are the same

exception-handling	try-catch
there are many cases in which the exception-handling is well exception-handlingal enough that it s perfectly fine to wrap the code in a try-catch block

184216
swing	awt
although we ve done some console stuff this is the first time we ve worked with a gui and swing or awt

184237

184282
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve been using django for some time after starting with ruby ruby-on-rails

184282
ruby-on-rails	django
i m sure there are probably ways to be just as flexible with ruby-on-rails or some such but i highly encourage you to take a long look at the django introductions etc at

184285
put	get
but that s not how object destructor works in .net .when an object goes out of scoping it gets put in the finalize s queue and its destructor doesn t get called until the finalize gets around to it

184297
version-control	git
several version-control systemd svn git etc. will create a patch file for you based on a changeset

184317
versioning	upgrade
if you re running versioning n of your application and want to upgrade to versioning n+1 you can do .so using object serialization

184323
linux	unix
you can easily generator them using the diff cmd and you can apply them using the patch cmd on linux unix systemd these cmd are standards

184344

184358
environment	execution
.net is a platform consisting of an execution environment the clr virtual-machine and a set of libs

184358
python	perl	python	java
it s exactly analogous to java or perl or python none of which are ever referred to as frameworks

184358
environment	execution
in most cases the words framework is used for project like spring or struts or qt which sit on top of a platform ie providing no execution environment of their own like a libs

184360
rollback	commit
if you are using enterprise libs in your data-access-layer you can create the transactional in .net iterate through your procedure call then commit rollback all from .net

184364
python	c++
look into helping the shed skins project which compiles python to c++

184364

with all of that said i m a freelance php symfony and ruby ruby-on-rails developer

184377
google-chrome	safari
i think i would suggest safari google-chrome s webkit engine which was derived from khtml the konqueror rendering engine

184456
sql-server	mysql
converting a couple stored-procedures from mysql to microsoft sql-server

184466
interpreter	runtime
i would expect linq to be marginally faster in practice because xpath is interpreter at runtime while linq is interpreter at compile-time

184512
http-get	put	communication	messages
it uses http-get .post put delete messages to communication arbitrary document

184514
bluetooth	usb
there are a lot of weird serial ports these days usb serial cables bluetooth cell phone modems with gps .

184522
selected	listbox
i have a listbox that .when in focus and .when i have an item selected returns a valid selectedindex

184537
malloc	free
i see in c++ there are multiple ways to allocate and free data and i understand that .when you call malloc you should call free and .when you use the new-operator you should pair with delete and it is a mistake to mix the two calling free on something that was created with the new-operator but i m not clear on .when i should use malloc free and .when i should use new delete in my real world programs

184540
malloc	free
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

184548
malloc	free
use malloc and free only for allocation memory that is going to be managed by c-centric libs and apis

184552
value	field
ages ago i wanted to do the same and istr that it simply wasn t possible from ddl sql - but you can do it from vba by locating the field table.fields and setting allowzerolength to the required value

184554
listbox	textbox
i tested it on a blank project with one listbox one textbox and one labels used to display the listbox s selectedindex

184554
listbox	textbox	textchanged	textbox	selectedindexchanged	selectedindex
under both the listbox s selectedindexchanged and the textbox s textchanged events i updates the labels with the listbox s selectedindex

184569
innodb	myisam
note your mysql tables assuming mysql must be of a types that supports transactional innodb does myisam does not

184652
change-management	maintenance
now that i ve been here almost a week i m tasked with creating a change-management plan for the maintenance of the application and preparation for phase 2 which will commence someday. we re a microsoft shop but open-minded

184661
any	set
and not the fact that they are slower any ideas on how to make them faster are much appreciated but the fact that the environment must be set up which is much slower atm 1000 sec

184663
contains	elements
elements can only contains bar .when attributes foo

184663
contains	elements
elements can only contains world .when attributes hello

184695
put	get
then we take long running tests and put them in a nightlycategory .so that they only get run during nightly building and not in the continuous building that we want to run fast

what s about mp3 or ogg vorbis audio files

184710
shallow-copy	deep-copy
what is the difference between a deep-copy and a shallow-copy

184717
subroutine	scoping
all do use and required import but scoping code that is within them except named subroutine cause they can t be hidden

184722
deep-copy	object
in deep-copy all things in object a s memory location get copy-paste to object b s memory location

184729
stubs	tdd
after reading martin fowler s mocks aren t stubs i ve discovered i ve been practicing tdd in the mockist fashion

184729
mocking	tdd
but i m wondering if even in mockist tdd if one can take mocking too far

184730
deep-copy	object
deep-copy copies the member value from one object into another

184736
mocking	stubs	mocking	tdd	stubs	tdd
i try to use classical tdd whenever possible although i often use a mocking framework to set up the stubs quickly

184740
any	set
i always enable all warnings and then set my project to stop building if there are any warnings

184745
duplicates	elements
a deep-copy of a collections is two collectionss with all of the elements in the original collections duplicates

184756
installation	building
it can deal with all those things installation web-applications service etc and it s very flexible free and it s what microsoft uses to building their install

184756
versioning	upgrade
then subsequent upgrade install will use the same product code and upgrade code but change the versioning

184762
void	main
public static void main string arguments

184769
deep-copy	object
with a deep-copy any object pointed to by the .source is copy-paste and the copy is pointed to by the destination .so there will now be 2 of each referenced object

184798
malloc	free
the new and delete operators can operate on classes and structures whereas malloc and free only work with blocks of memory that need to be cast

184818
pdf-viewer	acrobat
the issue that may come up there i ve never worked with acrobat s com pdf-viewer is that the pdf object expects to be on the ui-thread

184827
text-editor	editor
then you could look at it in a nice text-editor run it through your test class or look at it in a hex editor to make sure that it s just normals text

184848
value	field
i d probably do this with a fairly standards listview - allow multiple selection - and .when you change a field in any selected recording drop down with more than one item selected it updates all of the items to the same value

184861
value	field
these field may be stored either by value or by reference a pointers to a value

184861
deep-copy	object	value	field
in a deep-copy the field that are stored by value are copy-paste as before but the pointers to object stored by reference are not copy-paste

184861
deep-copy	object
instead a deep-copy is made of the referenced object and a pointers to the new object is stored

184862
communication	messages
messages would work as long as the communication is very simple and the overhead in setting it up is minimal

184862
communication	messages
if you can boil the communication down to one or two int per messages this would probably be a good place to start

184881
contains	any
join the temp table to my list of wordss and if any rows are returned i know the passwd contains a dictionary words and i know what substring matched

184905
stderr	stdout
tee for recording a stdout stderr of a single cmd

haskell	perl
.when i had a boring job maintaining some crufty old perl building scripting any time i wasn t doing work i was learning more advanced perl looking up new algorithms writing prototype in haskell etc

184932
implements	abstract
in my understanding factory-method defnies the abstract types of class with which to work with but delegation the creation of the concrete types to the succeeding implements classes

184957
highlight	cell
highlight the field while typing is one nice way to do it or you can go the ms-access route and wait until moving out of the cell notify the user and bring them back into the cell until it s fixed or give the option to hit esc or something to undo all changes in that cell and leave edit mode

184991
defined	declare
elements defined in a namespace cannot be explicit declare as private protected or protected internal

185041
decompression	on-the-fly
however you can still use the mp3frame and acmmp3framedecompressionor classes in naudio to decompression streamed mp3 on-the-fly

185051
mta	sta
that means that .when the mta thread creates the component it s put into the main sta if one already exists which for asp.net worker process it won t or a new thread is created specifically for the sta

185051
mta	sta
it doesn t matter which mta thread creates the component the same sta is always used for the components that can t handle the mta model

185052
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to set ie as my default browser for running silverlight applications from expression-blend but i don t want to change my windows default from mozilla

185055
defined	declare
.when these partial-classes are defined alone inside a namespace the private keyword causes the building to fail with elements defined in a namespace cannot be explicit declare as private protected or protected internal .

185073
perl	c++
i m trying to call into a c++ libs from perl on an aix 5.1 machine

185073
perl	c++
i can create a standalone c++ executable that uses the stl without any issues it s only .when called in my shared object .when loaded from perl that i get into trouble

185082
stderr	stdout
i would like to be able to spawn a linux process that would only have access to stdin stdout and stderr nothing more and nothing less

185123
attributes	properties
jason jackson - the designer does let you add properties by hand however you need to specify the attributes for that properties but you do this once it might take 3 minutes longer than the initial dragging of the table into the designer however it is only necessary once per change in the database itself

185129
aspose.words	aspose.pdf
from their website aspose.words enables .net and java applications to read modify and write wordâ document without utilizing microsoft word. utilizing aspose.words with aspose.pdf permits you to output to pdf

185139
quicksort	in-place
basically linq is designed to work over sequences which intrinsically don t allow you to work in-place or in a duplicates spaces in the way that quicksort tends to

185182
.when	ready
it s possible that making webbrowser call .when the document isn t quite ready may also cause this

185195
configuration	installation
i used a standards installation of the editor below without any further configuration

185212
environment	building
depending on your building environment there is probably a mechanism to process the resource-files and replace variables with the desired value

185243
communication	messages
it s quite similar in that regard to any application that allows account recovery by email but whereas your email messages are transmitted in cleartext you may choose to communication with openid providers only over verified http connections

185263
.when	ready
another approach is to hand the data off to a worker thread and return immediately with a messages stating that the report will be emailed or made available in the report section of the site .when it is ready

185281
response	timeout
if you do the above properly your read operations will complete before the connection is closed or a timeout happens and you will have read exactly the response the server sent

185294
wordpress	mediawiki	authentication	login
from there we modified the login into various product we use mediawiki wordpress sugarcrm etc. .so that if the user is authentication in the intranet they are automatically logged into these other product as well

185319
linux	unix
it has some nice features like web accessibility with delegation scheduling operation with retry propagation to other things using account service com+ apps etc. systemd account discovery linux unix account management etc

185329
macros	basic
they have a very basic text-format file that you can send to a translator and some preprocessor macros to retrieve the value from the files

185363
web-services	security
it potentially exposes your database server to a security attack web-services for example

185365
http	ssl
to determine whether it s an http request or an ssh request you need to try to read some data with a small timeout this is because tls ssl handshake start with the client sending some data whereas the ssh handshake starts with the server sending some data

185389
base-class	inherited
should inherited from base-class common to all model classes to shared functionality database persistent methods parameter validation code etc.

185422
value	field
.when a class is initializer all static field in that class are first initializer to their default value and then the static field initializer are execute in textual order

185422
value	field
likewise .when an instances of a class is created all instances field in that instances are first initializer to their default value and then the instances field initializer are execute in textual order

185429
constructor	object
in fact i am unable to modify the constructor of the actual object that i need to create instances of

185429
constructor	object
updates using some of the suggestions below i was able to figure out a way to create an object that inherited from the original and accept json in it s constructor

185448
instances	private
imagine in the global.asax.cs file i had an instances class as a private field

185474
combinations	permutation
we are not necessarily building this connection-string .so we cannot rely on a format the string is written in to determine its types and i would prefer not to have to code up all combinations and permutation of possible connection-strings

185504
sql-server	oracle
i know microsoft sql-server and oracle really push using stored-procedures for everything which helps to encapsulate the relational architecture and creates a more procedural interface for the software developers who typically aren t as facile writing sql queries

185506
where-clause	sql
from your sql it seems that you could get restuls from tablec that contains key in tablea and tableb as you are union-ing the restuls of a simple selected on tablec of which there is no where-clause

185506
any	set
where you after an exclusive set of key that do not exist in any of the other tables

185518
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a numbers of days

185518
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a numbers of weeks

185518
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a numbers of days

185518
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a numbers of weeks

185518
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a numbers of months

185518
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a numbers of years

185526
low-level	hardware
writing low-level software that interacts with hardware

185526
glib	gtk
i personally like the glib and gtk libs a lot since they use a very dynamic object-oriented model a lot like python without preventing you from using the low-level features of c

185534
libusb	sysfs
i haven t used libusb in quite .some time -- but the sysfs error indicates that this is likely to be a kernel problem rather than a libusb one .so i d start by trying to tracking that one down

185536
user-interface	drawing
i am drawing a 2-d user-interface object and would like to create it back to front

185541
show	next
you can recording the time taken for the task and next time your dialog can show a decent estimate

185553
any	set
there was never any need for anymore than 2 images at a time as all request were gainst those images i only allowed 1 session per image set at a time

185563
void	main
public static void main string arguments

185574
locale	hebrew
in .some locale like hebrew there are leap months dependant upon the year .so to avoid errors in such locale you might consider the following .solution

185584
python	ruby
i m not aware of anything in python or ruby although a compiler compiler might very well be effective in such a language.

185594
linked-list	arrays	contains	elements
i think it should declare an arrays where each elements is a list a linked-list or an arrayslist and required that each list contains arrayslist object

185594
linked-list	arrays	contains	elements
after running some tests i determined that it accepts an arrays where each elements is an linked-list object and does not specify what the linked-list object contains

185624
defined	declare
i have a function that is declare and defined in a header file

185624
inlining	inline
i fixed that by making the function inline but i m afraid that this is a fragile solution because as far as i know the compiler doesn t guarantee inlining even .when you specify the inline keyword

185631
lighttpd	apache
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me

185631
lighttpd	apache
apache still has to unpack the http packets and parsing the request through its parsing tree send proxy request and then lighttpd has to re-unpack hit the filesystems and send the files back through apache

185631
webserver	nginx
what you will see is people using a lightweight webserver like nginx as a frontend server to serve static files and proxy dynamic urls to apache

185631
reverse-proxy	varnish
or you can run varnish or squid as a caching reverse-proxy frontend .so that all your high-traffic static files images css etc

185631
lighttpd	apache
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxy those request to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd .so it wouldn t really be fair

185640
inlining	inline
inlining means that executable code instructions is inline into the calling function s code

185642
protected	public
thus you can call any public protected instances methods on templatecontrol

185662
haskell	scheme
i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task

185672
gridview	listview
is it possible for you to overrides an existing control such as a listview or gridview

185673
put	get
i could use webdav or http to get put data to a server but it makes the application more complicated

185687
any	set
i suppose the most difficult part i m concerned with is being able to templates any numbers of a given set of user-controls inside my user-controls

185693
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
i just verified that both smartsvn and rapidsvn mentioned previously required administration access to insatll on windows just like tortoisesvn

185701
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch exception-handling ex

185702
swing	swt	gtk	swt
this is true for windows swing swt gtk and probably others

185703
xcopy	cmd
the xcopy cmd should help here

185703
xcopy	cmd
or if you don t want any of the files in srcdir just the subdirectories you can use xcopy in conjunction with the for cmd

185740
put	get
i can see how one could argue that the robot is in the abstract just a data repository -- put left turn put travel 100 meters get outside temperature

185770
getelementsbyclassname	classname
using indexof to support getelementsbyclassname in ie can really make a difference because there are no faster alternatives and the classname properties s underlying getter-setter conveniently replace tabs and linefeed with spaces

185775
tracking	robot
a safe and idempotent methods like get though is good for tracking the state of the robot and polling its sensor data

185775
any	set
the absolute state of any resources can be set using something like put where multiple messagess will not change things any more than just a single messages points to north pole or dim front lighting to 10 brightness

185781
perl	c++	python	perl	python	c++
i m most familiar with python c++ and perl but any language you prefer is welcome

185812
void	main
public static void main string arguments

185823
factors	primes
the lcm of one or more numbers is the product of all of the distinct primes factors in all of the numbers each primes to the power of the max of all the powers to which that primes appears in the numbers one is taking the lcm of

185824
average	min
if you run both algorithms side by side you will get what i m pretty sure is an asymptotically optimal o min m n lg k algorithm but mine should be faster on average because it doesn t involve hashing or sorting

185825
protected	public
in flex and many other languages a function methods of a class can be declare private or protected or public

185829
protected	public
thus visibility increases as you go from private to protected to public

185829
protected	public	classname	inherited
in c++ you can control how the visibility of members should be inherited to the descendants by prepend the base classname with the private protected or public keyword meaning you want the visibility of the base class-members to be at most at that level

185829
protected	public
in each of the cases above the descendant classes are of course able to introduce their own private protected and public members

185844
data-members	private
what is the best way to initializer a private static data-members in c++

185862
perl	c++
if i don t write it in perl i will write it in c++

185862
perl	c++
speed and compilation aside why should i use c++ over perl

185864
put	get
you have to have a line int foo i some where in your code to tell the compiler where to put it otherwise you get a link error

185892
constructor	object
your constructor can accept the object you want but call their constructor in an unaffected fashion

185913
perl	lua	perl	c++	python	perl	python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
i d suggest a lua c++ or a python c++ combo i m not sure how well a perl c++ combo works but that may be a good option too

185913
c++	lua
personally i ve done a bunch with the lua c++ combo and it s pretty fantastic

185930
value	field
you have to test for null value .when concatenation here is an example for two field and a separator between them

185943
perl	c++
if you re at least as experienced in perl as in c++ development in perl should be faster

185954
nsautoreleasepool	nsoperation
yes you need to create an nsautoreleasepool in your methods unless you are creating a concurrent slightly unfortunate nomenclature nsoperation subclassing and your overrides methods creates the nsautoreleasepool before calling nsoperation main

185978
javascript	dom
3 use javascript ajax call to manipulate the dom if you need to change the title after the load event

185997
hardlink	symlink
any symlink to the file in bin would be broken by this but a hardlink being a link directly to the inode for the file wouldn t care

185997
filesystems	hardlink
speaking of which recovering a file that is open in process a but unlinked on the filesystems revolves around using hardlink to recreate the inode links .so the file doesn t go away .when the process which has it open closes it or goes away

186008
deep-copy	object
this achieves deep-copy with a heavy cost depending on the complexity of the object

186035
slidedown	slideup
.when a h3 is click the div directly below after is revealed with jquery s slidedown function while all other divs are hidden with the slideup function

186076
python	perl
i personally recommend the python option though it may not be relevant if you know perl but not python

186090
configuration	environment
as part of the construction of the instances you then read in a configuration file which can be specific to the environment

186107
vb.net	vb6	basic	vb6	delphi	vb6	delphi	vb.net	delphi	basic	delphi	c++
easily add email support to your visual basic 6 vb6 asp asp.net vb.net c++ c# foxpro access powerbuilder or delphi application

186109
emacs	vim
many decent text editor have the option as well vim emacs editplus and .so on

186128
versioning	migrate
even if i migrate everything to .net without releasing a new vb6 versioning i would like to be able to open the project and see it compile and run to better understand it

186134
callback	methods
callback is your void parameterless methods that you want called at each interval

186140
theorem	proof
one of the most classic ones is the comment made by pierre de fermat about his well-known last theorem the margins of this page is a bit too small to write down the proof

186175
perl	awk
others have mentioned sed and awk and it s no surprise that perl was inspired by them

186193
any	set
the new backup will not take up any extra spaces apart from any changes you ve made since all the incremental backup will points to the same set of inode for files which haven t changed

186208
latex	tex
creating your own styles is often not really an option because it required you to dig quite deep into the very advanced features of tex latex and fighting your way against possible incompatibilities with document classes package whatnot

186237
debugging	trace
through caveman debugging ie nasty printf messages all over the place i have determined the test methods where the code is crash though unfortunately the actual crash seems to happen in some destructor since the last trace messages i see are in other destructor which execute cleanly

186245
basic	vb6
visual basic 5 control creation edition might be suitable to tide you over until you can get hold of a full versioning of vb6

186253
contains	set
i just checkout the project which contains only source and no dependencies and if i want to import it into eclipse all i have to do is run mvn eclipse eclipse and all is set up for me

186254
perl	c++
i m both a c++ and perl programmer

186254
perl	c++
c++ is a nice language but whenever i have the choice i go with perl since development simply proceeds .so much more quickly

186254
perl	c++
more .so in c++ than in perl but it really always comes down to discipline and being able to test on many platform

186265
virtualbox	vmware
first both virtualbox and vmware server are great product and since both are free each is worth evaluation

186265
sftp	ssh
also there is a viewmodelware scripting interface called vix which one can use to directly install files to the viewmodel without needing to install ssh or sftp which is a big advantage

186266
google-account	google-groups
i also integrated nabble for the forums i think google-groups can be an obstacle to people not having a google-account

186278
izpack	ant
the next time i would probably try izpack because it seems to support ant as well but has nicer guis

186279
constructor	object
having this member allows the constructor mechanism by which object are construct from functions to work

186294
bugzilla	testlink	bugzilla	mantis	testlink	mantis
you could use combinations of a bug tracker jira mantis bugzilla and test case management tool like testlink

186297
virtualbox	vmware
just like vmware gives support for vmware server sun gives support for virtualbox

186313
droppable	draggable
once it is put in there it gets replace with a new div which is both draggable because you can junk it by moving it back to the palette and droppable because you can add ingredients to it

186313
order	add
you can then add ingredients from your ingredients palette to any of the pizzas you have sitting in the grouping of order

186369
sql-server	ms-access	identity-column	sql-server
while designing a table my colleague here says that i should avoid identity-column as it is specific to sql-server and ms-access but i differ with his views as it makes my coding simpler

186376
for-loop	arrays
in some cases though the compiler will replace foreach with a for-loop i believe .when iterator over arrays

186378
postgresql	mysql
is your application meant to be portable are you planning to migrate it to mysql postgresql whatever

186380
contains	elements
relative positioning on the other hand is .something i ve never used except for animation on elementss which are statically positioning until javascript gets involved establishing a contains block for ab.solute positioning .so the elements itself isn t move at all and very very rarely a one or two pixels nudge of an elements

186399
debian	rpm
if you building your web .app into a rpm debian pkg etc then it can drop the files into etc cron.d and have the jobs run

186428
constructor	object
i didn t find out how to export a constructor .so i went with using a factory-method static which will return new instances of an object

186455
terminate	timeout
.when the timeout event occurs you can terminate the thread that does the actual process clean up and end the process

186473
put	get
assuming the request goes through jquery put a debugging statement in the jquery source get function that kicks in if the url is

186476
enterprise-architect	visio
on another project i used visio - the versioning that comes with visual-studio enterprise-architect will forwarding engineer a database

186489
export	csv
while evaluation some of the web control suites for a decent grid i noticed some of them had export to xls csv pdf built-in

186521
protected	public
also keep in mind that what you need to test is the public api of an object not it s protected private methods

186521
protected	public
.so as long as the public methods fulfill tests the protected methods will be covered too

186534
selected	button	selected	cell	click	mouse
.when i use the scroll button on my mouse and then click a cell and click the escape button or selected another cell the grid will reposition it self

186553

versioning	upgrade
will users who do not have admin rights on their computers be able to upgrade to new flash player versioning by themselves

186569
linux	unix
unix linux

186574
httpmodule	isapi
ii6 uses what iis7 call the classic pipeline where a httpmodule can only get involved once the earlier isapi based pipeline determines that the scripting mapping required the request to handed over to asp.net

186583
basic	vba
vba is quite different from python .so you should read at least the micro.soft visual basic help as provided by the application you are going to use excel accessâ

186596
zend-debugger	xdebug
xdebug or zend-debugger if you have some difficulty to install xdebug

186641
vba	vb6
there s something about vb6 vba that makes them feel unnatural to me

186652
.when	ready
usually near the end .when almost all backend functionality is ready and tested we often do a user-interface overhaul

186668
firefox	safari
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standards or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder

186687
textmate	emacs
i ve found it extremely easy to use and there are tips for integration it with vi m emacs and even textmate if you use that

186690
googletest	cppunit
then assuming you are using an xunit-style test libs cppunit googletest unittest++ or whatever you can add various testxxx functions to a single class to test out associated grouping of functionality

186712
access-vba	vba
you have to be a bit careful here as using vba date-format masks may not work entirely as you d expect on non-us locale helpfully interpreting mm dd yyyy as the localized short date-format .so please test carefully using your particular access-vba versioning

186788
put	get
if all you want to do is put a bullet points on your resume to get past the agents just add it that will get you past the agents and give you a chance to get your foot in the doors

186788
oracle-xe	oracle
if you are an honest types grab oracle-xe read the appropriate guide at the documentation libs and spend a day or 5 throw together a blog address book flickr clone etc in your favorite language against oracle

186788
sql-server	oracle
as others have suggested there is some significant difference in things you would do compared to sql-server if you just apply what you know from sql-server to oracle you ll likely kill performance

186811
oracle	mysql
i ve only used it in oracle 9i against mysql and found that in our cases it didn t work very well as it ended up using up massive amounts of ram we still use it but now just use it for syncing to a local table rather than doing live queries against it

186819
web-config	app-config
to get a specific versioning apparently you have to edit web-config or app-config

186819
versioning	upgrade
.when you add references using visual-studio you will get a assembly reference with both versioning numbers and public key and this can give you some trouble .when you upgrade a vendor assembly to a newer versioning. br

186824
debugging	trace
debugging - actual trace value

186842
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are still addressed as they are under ipv4

186845
icmp	dhcp
the only thing that changed between the two versioning is the addressing scheme dhcp dhcpv6 and icmp icmpv6

186845
udp	tcp
.so basically anything tcp udp related including the ports range 0-65535 remains unchanged

186846
udp	tcp
i m pretty certain that ports only have a part in tcp and udp

186850
udp	tcp
the tcp and udp layer is the same structure

186850
udp	tcp
ipv6 as the named implies is about the ip layer being enhanced not the tcp or udp layer

186853
sql-server	oracle
but actually building package writing multi-table multi step join bulk updates and insert use of the rich and powerful oracle feature set is very different from sql-server

186865
json	xml
i find the xml markup very easily readable therefore i don t think that advantages of json or yaml make a difference here

186868
swing	awt
as you already required java 1.4 you should consider some small changes to take into use swing gui instead it solved our applet refresh issues with awt

186871
content-disposition	content-type
use a content-disposition attachment header but stick with the correct content-type

186879
exception-handling	try-catch
if you control the way your delegation is run encapsulate it in a try-catch block and figure a way to pass the exception-handling information back to your main thread using endinvoke if you explicit called begininvoke or by updating some shared state somewhere

186883
.when	ready
.when deploying a ready to use erlang application i don t want the user to

186907
primitive	int
but .when the parameter types is a primitive value int then if this parameter is assign to within the methods the value of the arguments that was passed in will be changed after the methods returns

186911
ref	out
in many ways it s the same as using the out keyword but with the minor difference that there s no guarantee that the methods will actually assign anything to the ref ed parameter

186922
scp	ssh
i m looking for a log viewer with similar capablilties as chainsaw in which i can tail glassfish log files over for instances ssh scp

186926
attributes	properties
if they were runat server you could use the attributes properties

186945
web-services	webserver
i have a webserver built-in delphi and i m trying to consume its web-services on java i m using eclipse ide by creating a web service client through the eclipse wizard

186950
debugging	trace
debugging tends to be for developer use where i output messages to help trace the flow through the code with value of variables as well

186956
pointers	stack
if you have a buffering overflow in a buffering on stack a static arrays as a local variables but written beyond its end and overwrite an exception-handling recording then you can overwrite the next pointers which points at the next exception-handling recording on stack

186975
value	field
for me a combinations of uml diagram for a quick refresher on field named types and constraints and an external document tex but could be any format with extended description of everything database-related - special value field comments access notes whatever - works best

186990
configparser	configobj
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

187003
text-editor	editor
i prefer to do as much work as possible in my text-editor e text-editor .so it is more natural to me to stay in the editor and not switching back and forth to programs like excel plus this way i retain portable and open data

187003
json	xml
a json or yaml seems to have a cleaner syntax than creating something with xml

187006
business-objects	data-access
a base layer which is a class-library that contains all my business-objects logic data-access etc

187009
controllers	routes
i have routes like x path where the path parameter is used by the controllers to navigate a tree to end up with a resource which is served to the client

187009
controllers	routes
i could use a constraint to only match my additional routes if the path parameter ends in y for example but then the controllers would have to be aware of the extension added to be able to remove it .when parsing the path - this is not acceptable

187024
delphi	c++
i think if you go with delphi you will find it more easier after few time of using also it has more third party support and some of the features introduced in delphi before c++ builder

187032
http	ssl
the only impact on your php would be in the self-facing links you re publishing which you d want to switching from to there s a _server http variables you could use to triggers this change if you ll be accepting both ssl and non-ssl connections

187043
sftp	scp
more complicated scenario .when security is a concerm would required the use of scp or sftp over and ssl connection

187059
radio-button	textbox	listbox	textbox
in total there are 10 tabs and about 150 controls in a page controls like dropdownlistfor textbox radio-button listbox only

187061
extends	super
all the compiler knows about t is its bounds which it probably doesn t have other than explicit extends object and a super of the null types

187079
.net	wcf
it seems that you are expecting internal classes used in the wcf service which you have marked as datacontract to be exported as .net object to your client code the silverlight user-interface

187083
updating	updates
if not you could do far fewer updates but only updating the most recent rows moving them into gaps

187169
installation	upgrade
usually in regards to installation customization upgrade paths etc

187185
put	get
then you can just put and get whichever files you like between the current directory on the linux box and your windows-server

187198
children	nodes
the idea is that every nodes would have n children and upon receiving a cmd it might lead you to one of his children or if no children was available to such cmd lead you back to the beggining

187206
binary	octal
perhaps using octal or binary to store your format types as a bitmask

187227
solaris	linux
from memory solaris kept the mtoolkit as the default longer than on linux

187241

expression-blend	wpf
what are some recommendations for finding expression-blend wpf designers to perform contract work

187279
google-chrome	firefox
this rendering fine in firefox and google-chrome

187299
order	join
if you have a lot of joined tables where there is one row per join .so you re joining customer information based on an id in your order table and you re doing it readonly .so you don t want to updates any information through the zend_db_table adaptor you create your normalize tables then a single view across the top

187305
sqldatasource	formview
the rows from the sqldatasource display fine in the formview and i can edit them

187305
revision	updates
.when i click updates i get the itemupdating event but not the itemupdatesd event and the revision are not written to the database

187310
contains	elements
keep in mind also that absolute positioning is not only used for positioning things relative to the browser windows - it s also used for positioning things accurately within a contains elements

187384
value	field
i changed the base types for the custom field control from spfieldtext to spmultilinetext along with changing the fld_typess field definition value from

187384
value	field
.so i changed the field control base types to spfieldmultichoice and the fld_typess to multichoice and still get the same result which is only the first value that s selected writing to the sharepoint-list

187391
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

187391
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
i have logged on to the build-server with remote-desktop using the same user account that cruisecontrol.net runs under and run mbunit manually and the tests pass

187414
python	ruby
while they ve been around since the days of algol i didn t start hearing about them until fairly recently .when python and ruby became very popular

187418
contains	set
before calling rendering set the for a tag that contains a large chunks of the page you don t need the layout manager to manage

187466
oracle-adf	jsf
long story short it maps sql into view object which are basically smart datagrid that have very tunable behavior which can be bound directly to jsf components of the oracle-adf faces giving really good seamless rad

187478
version-control	git
this was one of the big factors that prompt us to evaluate other version-control systemd and ultimately decide to transitions to git

187537
contains	elements
is there a case-insensitive versioning of the contains jquery selector or should i do the work manually by looping over all elements and comparing their .text to my string

187587
logfile	tail
i m looking for the equivalent of the unix tail cmd that will allow me to watch the output of a logfile while it is being written to

187601
cygwin	gnu
if you want to use win32 ports of some unix utilities rather than installing cygwin i recommend gnu utilities for win32

187617
versioning	migrate
we had the need to versioning our sql database after we migrate to an x64 platform and our old versioning broke with the migration

187620
64bit	x86
can a winforms .app compiled for any cpu be configure to run as x86 on a 64bit server without recompiling the .app

187623
exception-handling	try-catch
it won t work because the unhandled exception-handling are not running inside a try-catch of any kind

187627
library-project	libs
if i create the client project in the same solution as the library-project and then add a reference to the library-projects it works but i m not going to implements everything like this but rather to add external libs to my projects.

187628
find-replace	paste
one advantage of yaml is that you could use it to export your existing hardcode data out to a file to create the initial versioning rather than cut paste plus a bunch of find-replace to get the data into the right format

187642
32-bit	64bit
code to use 32-bit process in 64bit

187705
32-bit	64bit
in the .net world the int data types is always 32-bit even on a 64bit machine

187707
perl	c++
there are similar issues in perl and c++ in getting a dropdown in the right place filling it with the right value making the proper change in the program state from user-input

187707
perl	c++
if perl isn t getting it done on certain platform transform the code to c++

187714
default-value	arguments
personnaly i tend to use multiple overloaded constructor or methods except if only the last arguments needs a default-value

187717
http	ssl
http http over ssl send all http content over a ssl tunel .so http content and headers are encrypted as well

187736
linux	unix
the scripting will run on a unix like systemd linux or mac

187741
continuous-integration	nant
what is the best way to perform continuous-integration .when using nant for the building and test tasks

187742
any	set
how can i determine if there s a public set not just any set

187747
32-bit	64bit
1 since you re moving from 64bit to 32-bit some of the package might not be compatible

187780
delphi	c++
write your core functionality in c++ then write the front-end for your application in the tool for the platform in question cocoa for mac os x .net delphi mfc for windows etc

187795
hide	show
my page actually looks like this where query advancedsearchfields is basically including a flex form into the page and i want it to show hide the custom view below after the search is complete

187811
pointers	stack
the pointers t is on stack

187816
decimal-point	digits
perhaps try a scaled-int approach use a 32 or 64bit int and programmatically allocate the last say 6 digits to what s on the right hand side of the decimal-point

187842
callback	methods
this methods does not support progress callback

187873
ip-address	hostname
selected another computer and types the hostname ip-address of the remote machine

187891
value	field
.so i am understanding your response as it s not possible to set the collections explicitly. i was hoping there was a way to add namedd and value to the namedvaluedictionary but i guess i ll need to just determine which field i need to set and use the properties to access specific named value-objects

187909
gzip	zip
however before you embark on creating classes that look like your data i wonder if you couldn t simply use gzip or pk zip to compress the data and transfer it as is

187917
put	get
if you have permission to read but not write a file the buffering you get .when you visit the file c-x c-f or find-file will be put in readonly mode automatically

187939
default-arguments	arguments
if creating constructor with arguments is bad as many would argue then making them with default-arguments is even worse

187939
contains	any	default-arguments	arguments	arguments	default
.when other programmers see that the majority of the call don t contains any arguments they will do the same remaining blissfully unaware of the default behavior your default-arguments impose on them

187939
default-arguments	arguments
also it s worth noting that the google c++ styles guide shuns both ctor arguments unless absolutely necessary and default-arguments to functions or methods

187946
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
you can see it in action at works in ie firefox safari opera

187990
llvm	gcc
i m not a c++ developer but i ve always been interested in compilers and i m interested in tinkering with some of the gcc stuff particularly llvm

188006
default-value	default
the bad thing is that you must declare your default in the header .so you have an hidden dependancy like .when you change the code of an inline function if you change the default-value in your header you ll need to recompile all .sources using this header to be sure they will use the new default

188016
implicit-conversion	default-arguments
matter of styles but as matt said definitely consider marking constructor with default-arguments which would allow implicit-conversion as explicit to avoid unintended automatic conversion

188084
selected	textbox
i this example i did two-way binding with textbox es on each nodes but .when it comes to editing just one nodes at a time in a separate single textbox or other control you would be binding it to the currently selected item of the treeview

188084
selected	textbox
you would also change the above textbox es to textblock s as click in the textbox does not actually selected the corresponding treeviewitem

188084
contains	elements
therefore if the strings we store in the data elements contains xml-entities have been escaped and we need to undo that simply by retrieving innertext before adding a cdata section as the nodes s child.

188107
expression	evaluation
pl sql performs short-circuiting evaluation of logical expression from left to right

188145
decimal-point	digits
with decimal you can set how many digits you want to use before and after the decimal-point

188172
decimal	hex
plus add in any conversions from hex to decimal etc

188174
pointers	stack
its members a.i and a.m including any members of a.m and a.p the pointers not the object it points to are part of it and .so al.so on stack

188189
contains	any
common object - these would be the data-structures marked up with wcf attributes and would also contains any common interfaces such as my data-layer interface

188191
selected	checkbox
as a visitor browses the data i d like for them to be able to selected a checkbox in the gridview row to flag sequences for later downloading as a zipped text file

188208
stderr	stdout
there seem to be two bash idioms for redirecting stdout and stderr to a file

188227
vbscript	vb6
it was nice for vb6 vbscript which were loosely typed but .net is strongly typed making the warts well wart-ugly

188230
stderr	stdout
might be useful for cases where you aren t redirecting stdout to somewhere else but rather you just want stderr to be sent to the same place such as the console as stdout perhaps if the cmd you are running is already sending stderr somewhere else other than the console

188236
checkbox	button
click those 2 checkbox hit the get button on that dialog

188242
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql and .so forth

188276
contains	any
i ve also found the j.ucs journal of universal computer science contains some interesting articles but i ve not really used any of the info i found there

188278
stderr	stdout
where send both stdout and stderr to wherever 2 1 send stderr to where stdout is currently going at that points in the command-line

188278
stderr	stdout
where the former is redirecting both stdout and stderr to file the latter redirects stderr to where stdout is going before it is redirected to the file in this case probably the terminal. this is useful if you wanted to do something like

188278
stderr	stdout
where you want to use less to page through the output of stderr and store the output of stdout to a file

188281
delphi	basic
i m wondering if this is a bug but at the same time i think it s rather likely that i m simply not understanding something very basic about how you re supposed to work with tthreads in delphi

188320
stderr	stdout
.so with you can write .something like and get stdout and stderr output append to the logfile

188331
exception-handling	error-handling
but if it is i recommend you to take a look at implements error-handling correctly a very clarifiyng .post about exception-handling in delphi

188345
contains	elements
two sets are equals if they contains the same elements but it s possible for the underlying data-structures of two equals sets to differ if those elements are stored in a different order

188351
click	mouse
now .when the user release control and click and holds down the left mouse button to start a drag operation the selection changes

188365
svnadmin	dump
however svn svnadmin provides hot copy and dump cmd that are as easy to run as your copy cmd and they are guaranteed safe

188380
average	minimum
to get the average of the minimum value for each incnum you could write this sql

188402
user-controls	ascx
i think the problem is that you re attempting to inherited the calendar control which is a server control from a user-controls based on your ascx extension

188415
shell	bash
the situation where the two line have different behavior is .when your scripting is not running in bash but some simpler shell in the sh family dash which i believe is used as bin sh in some linux distros because it is more lightweight than bash

188463
ruby	php
is it possible to direct subdomains to either php or ruby in the individual v-host definitions

188473
fflush	gets
i have a c# object with a critical resource that needs to be fflush very specific points in time making it a bad candidate to leave around for the garbage collector to take care of whenever it gets around to it how should i handle this

188507
look-and-feel	nimbus
it include a new look-and-feel called nimbus which supports high dpi display by way of using vector-graphics to draw all of the interface components

188532
return-value	arguments	defined	declare
ideally i would be able to defined a new types that describe the return-value and arguments of a function and then declare my set of functions using this new types

188532
arguments	default
additionally is there a way to specify default value for the arguments to this function typedef

188536
web-config	app-config
instead store the passwd in a configuration file such as web-config app-config etc or the windows registry or a file in etc or any other place which developers don t have access to on the production-environment but you do

188555
version-control	sync
keeping the project files in version-control makes keeping them in sync much easier

188559
arguments	default
as for your new question added 20 oct 08 additionally is there a way to specify default value for the arguments to this function typedef

188560
external	root
login to the ws as a regular user no root allowed all external ports locked down printing a document with 24blank line - which rotated the paper feed knob and the ruler pressed over the reset on the super special hardware

188562
python	perl
i will throw up the perl and python code i have as well as soon as i find it

188563
jtable	jlist
i believe you need to replace the jlist with a single column jtable

188563
selected	cell
iirc there might be a problem losing the first click which gets used to selected that cell edited

188579
authentication	login
well if the user isn t authentication they will automatically be redirected to the loginurl -- once you login you should be redirected to welcome.aspx and it will be the default page as long as the credentials are valid

188595
unsigned	short
assume you only want functions of the signature unsigned short id_for_allowed_functions int x char y

188604
credentials	account
provide each deployment of the .software with a preferably unique .so you can detection credentials sharing and disable the compromised account copy of the private-key certificate required to login

188617
authentication	login
1. the user is not authentication therefore they must login first

188639
build-system	toolchain
i normally don t work on windows development and am completely unfamiliar with the toolchain and build-system

188658
directory	folder
is it a folder which exists outside of website directory

188660
javascript	dom
on your local development machine perhaps everything gets loaded .so quickly that the dom tree is complete by the types your javascript is called but on the production server perhaps things are not yet complete

188685
entity-framework	ado.net
we re using ado.net entity-framework on a fairly active site 10 000 visits per day

188696
expression	evaluation
in the documentation it states that short-circuiting evaluation applies to if case and case expression i d bet that it al.so applies in the example that you quote but it s technically not documented that it does .so

188708
simplemodal	jquery	simplemodal	jqmodal	jqmodal	jquery
a couple i found for jquery are jqmodal and simplemodal

188712
implements	sealed
you are implements idisposable in a class which isn t sealed

188728
constructor	object
if the constructor doesn t finish execution the object doesn t exist .so there s nothing to destruct

188734
jqmodal	jquery
i ve had good results using jqmodal a plugins for the jquery framework that lets you defined modal dialog but it s by no means the only option

188761
private-members	private
just remember that .when calling private-members or referencing private variables to reference them as self.funcname

188761
private	self
you can defined them outside of the self object but then you get a mismash everywhere in your object where you re trying to figure out if size_of is a private methods or definedd globally somewhere else

188770
localization	translation
rick strahl has a good explanation and example code for a database-driven localization provider here - there s a nice built-in localization editor too with interface to google translation and babelfish

188785
sftp	ftps
u ll need sftp or ftps to avoid transmitting clear text

188831
direct3d	directx
this is because system.drawing.bitmap is a gdi+ bitmap while classes like bitmapimage in system.windows.media.imaging are direct3d directx

188834
double-quotes	single-quotes
now i know for a fact there will be attributes contains single-quotes and attributes contains double-quotes

188843
put	get
.so much can get done quickly .when you put the right people in a room and hammer out things on a whiteboard

188845
swing	awt
this ability or the lack of it is built into the various testrunners console awt swing ant maven or the one built into eclipse etc

188864
.when	ready
what tests should i use .when checked if an object is conceptually not ready for primes time

188871
contains	any
it generator random words sequences using determinated rules you choose the site contains very funny things but in italian only the ruless can be written in any language.

188882
constructor	object
while an object destructor won t be called if its constructor throw the object never existed the destructor of its internal object could be called

188882
boost	stl
thus you ll have to write this this way using stl or even boost

188882
constructor	object
if you want need to create those object inside the constructor

188896
put	get
this happened with the previous versioning of perl 5.8 and windows 2003 and iis 5. anyway basically i put in a carp or a warn and i get an error messages and then some garbage text

188917
firefox	safari
now it s also supported in firefox 3 and safari i m not sure which versioning but at least 3.1 and highter but not the iphone

188932
value	field
default foo will return null .when foo is a class types zero where foo is a value-types such as int and an instances of foo with all field initializer to their respective default value where foo is a struct

188932
reference-type	generics
it was added to the language .so that generics could support both value and reference-type - more info at msdn

188932
reference-type	generics
use null if you know you re working with reference-type classes there s no generics involved and you re explicit testing for uninitialized references

188947
document	editing
if there is anything you can do to avoid creating or editing pdf document directly i strongly advise that you do .so

188947
any	set
somebody mentioned adobe distiller server -- checked your docs for acrobat i know it comes with basic distiller and you may be able to set up distiller to run in a similar mode where it watches directory a and spits out pdf versioning of any files that show up in directory b

188963
sql-server	oracle
but if you use visual-web-developer 2008 express you can connect to a regular sql-server oracle odbc etc

188986
credentials	security
you project then only needs to pass the users credentials through as it does anyway and you can then let sql-server security handle the issue

188996
triggers	insert
you could use a triggers on insert and updates statements which would ensure the integrity

188999
macros	vba
macross we do not have any macros to compare as we only have the autoexec macros with one line launchd the main vba procedure

189003
websphere	ibm
we are using ibm websphere transformation extender which has lots of other problems too and the mapping tool of biztalk is a joke in comparison to wtx

189004
haskell	ocaml
as a trivial example compare quicksort implementation in java and ocaml or better still haskell on this page

189010
triggers	insert
you could use an instead of insert triggers to emulate that behavior

189012
perl	php
disclaimer once a php coldfusion and perl developer

189031
any	set
is there any way to set the same icons to all my forms without having to change one by one

189058
sql-server	ms-access
an in-process db like sql-server compact or ms-access is much more appropriate

189071
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
each comparator has a case-sensitive as well as a case-insensitive versioning

189107
savepoints	rollback
set up a savepoints before testing and rollback to savepoints after test

189111
show	next
edit dzinx s timings actually show that the impact of the extra checked for b_item isn t really significant next to the performance penalty of re-looking up by index .so the above using izip seems to be fastest

189111
arrays	loops
here are my timings for 10 loops using a 1000x1000 arrays with various proportions of iswhatever being true are

189116
python	perl
perl developers are learning python

189128
.net	wcf
i have an .app that currently has about 7000 machines calling a .net web service using wcf

189154
getter	setter
he also advocates not using the else keyword nor any getter or setter but i think that s a bit overboard

189162
inlining	inline
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent

189162
function-call	inline
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the points of call is to be preferred to the usual function-call mechanism

189164
difference	zero
my guess is that most of the messages classes have about zero difference

189170
python	ruby	python	java
implementation of the html5 parsing algorithm html5lib python ruby validator.nu html parsing java javascript

189188
ruby	php
my experience with various soap stack on different platform java .net ruby php is that in this case you re probably looking at an order of magnitude difference in process such a simple messages

189189
entity-framework	ado.net
for anything that uses complex semantics like voting or statistics basically any domain-object that needs to be display or operated on differently than it s represented in the database the ado.net entity-framework gives you some advantages

189189
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework overview

189190
perl	awk
no sed awk grep perl whatever

189228
put	get
however it starts to get messy .when you have two put methodss because although the methods returns void you seemingly have to cast it to a strongly typed delegation to end the invocation

189228
return-type	arguments
i m hoping there is a cleaner way to do this because the only thing i care about the delegation is the return-type in this case void and not the arguments that were supplied to it

189228
any	set
any ideas on how to end the invocation without a cascading set of is checked

189236
sproutcore	extjs
consider technologies like sproutcore gwt or extjs which put the layout code fully on the client making the server responsible only for data marshalling and process and easily replace

189244
silverlight	wpf
the recommendations should have some sort of direct relationship with either xaml or silverlight wpf and not the common .net utilities

189248
python	ruby
the architecture of smalltalk is somewhat insular whereas python and ruby were built from the ground up to facilitate integration

189248
python	ruby
smalltalk never really gained a body of hybrid application support in the way that python and ruby have .so the concept of smalltalk as embedded scripting-language never caught on

189248
python	ruby
ruby and python are much easier to learn and to bring new programmers up to speed with

189248
python	ruby
ruby and python work in a more conventional toolchain and are not tightly coupled to a specific development-environment

189248
python	ruby
testing code with highlight and show it is still a very nice feature that i have never seen in a python ide although i can t speak for ruby

189252
32-bit	64bit
i ve been using vista 32-bit up until now but i m considering moving to 64bit to squeeze that little extra ram out of the box

189259
contains	any
in your initial in query the notation would be valid whether or not othertable contains a column nameid and indeed whether otherdesc exists as a column in table or othertable - which is not clear in any of your examples but presumably is a column of othertable

189261
teamcity	ncover
i think the best we can hope for is to break open the nunit jar file that comes with teamcity and writing a custom task that integrated nunit2 and ncover

189262
32-bit	64bit
i have recently switched from a vista 32-bit development machine to a vista 64bit development machine with a quad-core intel processor and 6gb of ram

189272
32-bit	64bit
i have a fully-loaded thinkpad w500 with vista 64 and it runs flawlessly especially since vmware-workstation now supports both 32-bit and 64bit hosts workstations

189272
32-bit	64bit
i simply could not get a 64bit versioning working and ended up using the 32-bit versioning under wow

189277
constructor	object
since in c++ .when an exception-handling is throw in a constructor the destructor does not get called but destructor for the object s members that have been construct do get called this is a primary reason to use smart pointers object over raw pointerss - they are a good way to prevent memory-leaks in a situation like this

189308
required	checked
therefore our current poor man s checked required a periodic page-refresh on a browser to see if our website is still there

189308
required	checked
we are all programmers here and this is killing me that any manual checked is required

189315
stata	spss
stata and spss tend to be the most commonly used package in clinical studies

189331
32-bit	64bit
my only complain is ie has to run in 32-bit because of the missing 64bit flash plugins

189341
authentication	login
the issue was that i couldn t authentication to access the report parameters because of the hardcode and less-than-script-friendly way i was required to login to the site

189341
any	set
if not you may need to incorporate the actual login procedure into your scripting or application downloading and capture any cookies that may be set and incorporate them into your data request

189349
python	java
for example to find a java or python program that flips an image you could do this

189384
keyword	synonym
i need lucene to search for synonym as well as the actual keyword

189384
keyword	synonym
at the moment i search for keyword i have the synonym for and replace them with the or-ed versioning but i suspect there should be a better way to do this

189396
http	ssl
http versioning 1.1 added a special http-method connect - intended to create the ssl tunnel including the necessary protocols handshake and cryptography setup

189399
execute	prepare
prepare execute it for each value and union the results client-side

189399
execute	prepare
prepare and execute it

189400
linux	unix
you can call a systemd cmd if you re under linux unix file if you like

189403
assign	add
edit alternatively you can assign a weight like function points or story points to each story as a measure of complexity then add up the points for each completed feature and compute velocity in points iterator

189439
double-quotes	single-quotes
perhaps you re using double-quotes in a oneline instead of single-quotes

189457
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if the browser is not able to connect to a local area network lan or a router it is offline

189457
internet-explorer	firefox
in firefox and internet-explorer switching the browser to offline mode send a false value

189486
hide	show
you may want to set up a global ajax event to show hide the loading icons

189509
filesystems	fat
on windows the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with dos and fat filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot

189513
selected	button
right click on your project and selected properties. from there selected the compile tab and click the advanced compile options button down at the bottom left

189526
linux	osx
if you do i would recommend mono which is a .net free implementation or java both platform work well in windows osx linux

189526
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
of course there are many other alternatives remember osx is a unix operative systemd you could easily develop with python perl ruby and many other scripting languages and development technologies just be sure to know what platform are you going to target

189534
rollback	commit
i am using the transactionscope class to guarantee all the stored-procedures can commit or rollback as a single unit of work

189534
rollback	commit
my question is i am required to also use commit tran and rollback tran is each of my stored-procedures if i am using the transactionscope class in my .net class-library

189570
formatting	printing
perhaps this is due to its history while basic and fortran had basic but serviceable printing cmd c generally required a bit more work to format various data types printingf was and often still is by far the most convenient means to this end providing many built-in formatting options

189578
firefox	safari
safari nightlies and is already supported in firefox 3

189584
gentoo	linux
well back in 2005 i used gentoo linux and i used a lot a small program called genlop to show me the history of what i ve emerged install on my gentoo box

189604
inner-classes	nested-class
as an alternative you don t have to use anonymous inner-classes but you can use a simple nested-class instead

189607
ruby-on-rails	rspec
we re using rspec in our ruby-on-rails 2.1 project and we can do this sort of thing

189627
associations	model
if you have built your model in a way that follows those conventions of ruby-on-rails you can take advantage of ruby-on-rails associations by saying that the grouping model has_many people and that the person model belongs_to grouping

189634
assign	add
important declaration will add weight to the rules but dynamically assign a styles attributes will often take precedence because it is usually more-highly specified

189635
bug-tracking	trac
for bug-tracking you may try trac with tracmercurial

189654
textbox	button
my asp.net web .app needs to support the ability for users to create their own forms complete with textbox dropdowns radio button with some logic required field etc.

189661
safari	opera
gizmo s comment states that safari and opera support

189668
ubuntu	debian
i also suggest you reading the section emacs startup strategy in usr shared .doc emacsen-common debian-emacs-policy.gz for more ubuntu debian specific information

189679
bugzilla	trac
it has excellent support for both bugzilla and trac

189712
versioning	upgrade
my home basic laptop came with a cd that had all the necessary stuff for upgrading to a different versioning of windows i upgrade to linux

189713
getter	setter
upon being forced to write unit tests for anemic domain object that are nothing but bags of getter and setter which i was forced to write as well

189771
value	field
the user may enter value for any of the field

189778
vxworks	rtos
if you refer to classic vxworks rtos kernel they defined three mechanisms

189785
database-design	business-logic
this way you can seperate the data-access and business-logic which means if you change database-design the upper layer algorithms do not need to be changed

189815
contains	any
business object shouldn t contains any persistent logic

189817
environment	building
a distribute agent model would be one where developers building agents that are dispatcher to a framework and the framework execute the agent somewhere in the distribute environment

189817
persistent	transient
specifically i m looking for a framework that support dynamic distribution across the grid cloud but replace the transient agent with a more persistent service

189830
export	csv
.when trying to do export of csv file using the following codes

189835
push	pull
in your example you could simply pull merge your change into the integration upstream repository and push it directly up to the remote-server

189842
filehandle	stdin
.when you use a null filehandle it actually reads from the magical argv filehandle which has special semantics it reads from all the files named in argv or stdin if argv is-empty

189854
hide	show
then you could use that code to show or hide a textbox to display a messages

189855
children	nodes	children	tree
particulary i want to implements an n-ary tree not self-ballancing with an unbound numbers of children in each nodes in which each nodes holds an already defined struct like this for example

189856
32-bit	64bit
we ve just upgrade our production database server from 32-bit to 64bit

189883
multiple-files	eof
here s an example pretty much directly from perldoc -f eof that show how you can use it to reset the file named and the current line numbers easily across multiple-files loaded up at the command-line

189887
updating	updates
.when i am updating a table recording i want to only updates certain columns if they have a value to be updatess

189887
updating	updates
if you are updating volunteer table only updates these columns if mailing_list then updates these

189887
updating	updates
i know this can by done using an if-statement w two query statements based on what table you re updating but i am wondering is it possible to use only one query statement w the conditional in it to updates the appropriate columns in the table

189888
lighttpd	thin	lighttpd	apache
setup up server combinations of your choice apache lighttpd nginx thin etc.

189892
arrays	loops
arrays types 1 since it is a fixed size based on a defined i just use that defined in all my loops referencing it

189900
linked-list	arrays
this set could either be an arrays if n is fixed or a linked-list if n is variables

189900
linked-list	tree
the linked-list would required you to declare an additional struct let s called it listnode with a treenode pointers to the actual child part of the tree and a pointers to the next listnode in the list null if at the end of the list

189918
default	reset
if you want to reset to the default simply right click the properties and selected reset

189967
euclidean-distance	threshold
i think you could simply compute the euclidean-distance sqrt sum of squares of difference pixels by pixels between the luminance of the two images and consider them equals if this falls under some empirical threshold

189987
sql-server	mysql
sure you might have some customers that might prefer mysql to sql-server

189987
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
you will be tempted to try and write some magic dal that can support oracle mysql vistadb sql-server etc

189988
python	ruby
an idiom commonly used in oo languages like python and ruby is initializer an object and chaining methods that return a reference to the object itself such as

189993
http	ssl
.when i use apachebench to test http the error is returned ssl handshake failed

189996
value	field
often you can find at least one field which is never 0 null for normals elements and if not you can use some other special end value

189999
unmanaged	c++-cli
i wish i knew more about your specific situation but as general piece of advice you might look into c++-cli for issues involving unmanaged managed interoperability

189999
unmanaged	c++-cli	managed-code	unmanaged	managed-code	c++-cli
i know from experience that i can lift unmanaged-code into a c++-cli project where i can use it from any c# .net managed-code but it sounds like you want to do the opposite lift managed-code into a c++-cli project and then link that with some unmanaged-code and expose that as a traditional unmanaged or install binary
