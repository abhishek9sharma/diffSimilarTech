160017
constructor	object
in the constructor the self object is actually called a

160018
nsdocumentdirectory	nsfilemanager
you can get the path to your resources folder via nsbundle s pathforresource oftype methods then grab the path to your document folder via nssearchpathfordirectoriesindomains for the nsdocumentdirectory folder in the nsuserdomainmask then copy the file via nsfilemanager s methodss

160021
perforce	cvs
svn gives you atomicity commit which while not quite up to the standards of perforce is miles in front of cvs

160021
versioning	upgrade
i got all the right python scripting to upgrade all the versioning history and we have been using svn happily for nearly 4 years

160025
service-discovery	ssdp
seems like what you need is the simple service-discovery protocols or ssdp

160027
constructor	object
there is a way to create an object without calling any instances constructor

160027
constructor	object
call it in-place of the object s constructor

160029
implements	abstract
similarly one can use abstract declarations to force implements classes to provide their own implementation

160034
derived-class	base-class
new tells the compiler that you are adding a methods to a derived-class with the same named as a methods in the base-class but they have no relationship to each other

160044
visualstatemanager	contentcontrol
put a border around your contentcontrol and make your visualstatemanager works for that border control

160082
32-bit	64bit
and because of that even though i am running 64bit vista i have to run 32-bit ie

160085
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
most of the commonly used engines ms sql-server oracle db2 mysql etc. would not experience noticeable issues using a surrogate key systemd

160085
key-value	key	updating	updates
in the natural key case if two users are concurrently working with the same information set such as a customer row and one of the users modifies the natural key-value then an updates by the second user will fail because the customer code they are updating no longer exists in the database

160085
updating	updates
however it is not always desirable to allow the second updates â if the customer code changed it is possible that the second user should not be allowed to proceed with their change because the actual â œidentityâ of the row has changed â the second user may be updating the wrong row

160085
enterprise	platform
in other scenarios databases are enterprise information resources accessed concurrently by multiple platform applications report systemd and devices and therefore do not function as well .when designed with a focus on any particular libs or framework

160105
design-time	designer
how do you change controls z-order in mfc at design-time - i can t use setwindowpos or do this at runtime - i want to see the changed z-order in the designer even if i have to resort to direct-editing the .rc code

160117
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms pages .aspx files

160123
sequences	unique
then we have an index on that link table for accountid and sequences to ensure that the combinations of accountid and sequences is unique thereby ensuring that no two customers can be the primary one on an account

160162
binaries	install
i have install svn 1.5.2 with binaries downloading from collabnet here

160165
required	checked
i checked the ..xoml.wfconfig.xml file and set the properties for required to true i set the content-type to required and i used shared points design to mark them as required

160165
any	set
any ideas on what else to checked set

160169
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

160169
getter	setter
i have never been able to write anything remotely complicated without getter and setter but it is a nice guideline

160169
getter	setter
if you have a lot of getter and setter it probably means you are doing it wrong

160173
cakephp	symfony
cakephp and zend look more popular but symfony seems interesting.

160192
32-bit	64bit
remember that windows will not even allow an application whether 32-bit or 64bit to handle pointserss that have an address above 0x7fffffff 2gb or above unless they have been specially marked as large_address_aware because .so many applications will treat the pointsers as a negative value at .some points and fall over

160227
instances	self
the language was built such that self is a reserved keyword that returns the current instances wherever you are

160227
instances	self
if you re inside an instances methods of one of your class self is a reference to said instances

160241
.when	ready
keep all the data in a session object and write that to the database .when you are ready

160260
solaris	linux	solaris	bsd	linux	bsd
my two reasons are i already know how to do this and i need my scripting to be portable across linux bsd solaris

160267
directory	folder
i ve tried all the tricks i can find on google and the obvious of removing the directory and folder manually

160284
systemd	sysv
python can t help you with that and though i ve seen occasional mention of third-party libs that try to do this they usually only work on a few systemd like strictly sysv styles strictly bsd styles or just systemd with proc.

160288
assign	deep
if i have to move this updates function to service-layer which only takes person in the request what would be the best way to assign my person request object into the datacontext without doing the deep copying again

160306
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
you can only call free 3 on pointers allocated on the heap with malloc 3 calloc 3 or realloc 3

160322
value	field
if its related to the maximum value you can try using the max function on that field

160323
hash	tie
note that you can not predict in what order the hash elements will be traversal unless you tie the hash via tie ixhash or similar â again if you re going to go through that much work i recommend a tree module

160330
actionscript	mxml
putting actionscript in mxml is the same as putting css or javascript in html really bad

160334
.when	ready
you can use the ip-up scripting functionality of pppd to have it execute a program .when the ip interface is up and ready

160353
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
windows has wow64 windows on windows 64bit and linux can have the 32-bit libs available alongside the 64bit

160353
32-bit	64bit
both of these allow us to run 32-bit applications in 64bit environment

160353
32-bit	64bit
exception-handling to this are things such as device drivers as they are tied in deeper with the operating systemd and cannot run in the 32-bit layer that the x86-64 amd64 based 64bit operating systemd offer ia64 is unable to do this from what i understand

160353
32-bit	64bit
as you have pointed out it does not work properly in 64bit requiring you to run the 32-bit versioning of internet-explorer

160370
revision	svn
in svn i have a branch which was created say at revision 22334

160371
32-bit	64bit
also since you can t load a 32-bit dll into your 64bit process you get burnt again trying to load things dynamically

160383
contains	elements
in your case one way of accomplishing this would be to building a variables that contains a list of all of the source elementss that could be transformed into the output elements that you want to emit only once

160404
daemons	systemd
our embedded systemd doesn t have syslog .so the daemons i write do debugging to a file using the a open mode similar to how you ve describe it

160404
logfile	tail
however i also had to write code to handle log rotation as other commenters have mentioned which consists of tail -c 65536 logfile logfiletmp mv logfiletmp logfile

160441
upnp	ssdp
i ve looked at both ssdp and upnp for this types of functionality but i d recommend going with a custom udp multicast solution

160441
upnp	ssdp
imho ssdp and upnp and bloated and overly complicated for resource discovery.

160442
python	java
this ec2 stuff had me befuddled with most documentation oriented toward businessy applications and using c# or java but this slideshow clarified much for me especially for using python

160455
triggers	insert
if you need to have it or you die for insert updates delete you can use some triggers logic with db variabless and time by time you do sql to retrieve variables data and display some progress to user

160459
linux	bsd
it s available for mac pcs and linux bsd

160463
contains	any
i ve always created a separate assembly that contains the enumerations and any interfaces the client-server need to shared

160477
sql-server	mysql
it s true both for sql-server 2005 and mysql 5

160482
perl	php	python	perl	python	php	python	java
although we support the odd java php or python installation we re using perl for nearly all of our web-applications and systemd data marshalling tasks

160589
csla	wcf
has anyone used csla in an application that has a wpf front end and a wcf wire for entities

160592
groovy	java
if you d be allowed to move to something java compatible yet has a syntax that s at least closer to perl than java checkout groovy

160592
groovy	java
groovy is a dynamic-languages that compiles to java byte-code

160592
perl	ruby
you can code in either java-ish class and functions or perl ruby s dynamic scripting .

160631
cryptography	security
the reason is simple security cryptography in particular is very very complicated and pretty much impossible to get right

160645
selected	textbox
it s sort of a hybrid control...what i do though is add a combobox right before the textbox with options the user then selected invoices and then enter the invoices number...more a user friendly user-interface but some of my peer says it s an extra click

160655
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	perl	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
they ve got java .net perl ruby javascript php and python

160659
emacs	vim
most of the file-based tools that we have vim emacs eclipse vs.net unix tools will have to be abandoned in favor of smalltalk s own tools

160676
csla	wcf	viewmodel	csla
i don t know much about csla but i have built application with wpf + linq + wcf this combinations works well for one way databinding to wpf but we need to have an intermediate object class viewmodel for wpf to get the two-way working

160689
javascript	dom
a javascript function called selectedvalidity could then use dom to selected the value

160736
.net	wcf
i don t believe it uses wcf but it certainly uses .net and has an sdk available that should allow you to create a p2p application with ease

160791
virtual-machine	parallels
i am running on windows-xp inside a parallels virtual-machine hosted on os x

160793
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
is there a place where i can upload my code and have it tested across a bunch of different systemd like other linux flavors and things like solaris freebsd and other operating systemd

160832
selected	button
from the open button dropdownlistfor selected add as link

160834
python	ruby	python	java
that then does what zc.buildout virtualenv does copy symlink the python interpreter provide a clean spaces to install eggs then install all required eggs including installing any native shared libs dependencies install the ruby project the java project etc

160841
perl	php	python	perl	python	php
there are binding for c perl python php etc.

160871
base	zero
note that you said base 10 .so you might actually want to disallow extra leading zero since 014 might be meant to be octal

160872
environment	building
an alternative might be specifying the list of package that need to be install via the os-specific package-management systemd such as fink or darwinports for mac os x and having a scripting that sets up the building environment for the in-house code

160876
ubuntu	linux
i have a from what i can tell perfectly working linux setup ubuntu 8.04 where all tools nslookup libcurl wget firefox etc are able to resolve addresses

160881
environment	building
.so this is a question for anyone who has had to integrated the buildinging compilation of legacy project code in a team building msbuilding environment - specifically visual basic 6 applications project

160889
python	perl
i was wondering if perl python can in some way do the same thing

160889
python	perl
apart from perl or python can any language functional also do this

160896
parser-generator	antlr
antlr - a recursive decent parser-generator that can generator python code

160901
contains	set
i ll just add this usability idea provide an and | or radio-button set in the interface default to and then if a user s query results in zero 0 matches and contains at least two words respond with an option to the effect

160904
sql-server	oracle
i have to write a component that re-creates sql-server tables structure and data in an oracle

160904
sql-server	oracle
this component also has to take new data entered into the oracle and copy it back into sql-server

160904
sql-server	oracle
translating the data types from sql-server to oracle is not a problem

160904
sql-server	oracle
however a critical difference between oracle and sql-server is causing a major headache

160904
sql-server	oracle
because oracle doesn t allow in a not null column my component could intercept any such value coming from sql-server and replace it with just for example

160904
sql-server	oracle
.when i add a new recording to my oracle table my code has to write if i really want to insert a and .when my code copies the new row back to sql-server it has to intercept the and instead write

160933
value	field
maybe you can store your value as one or more blanks which aren t nulls in oracle or keep tracking of this special case through extra field tables and an adaptor layer

160942
division	modulo
this is faster than using division or modulo

160954
postgresql	oracle
i have a ruby-on-rails project which has a postgresql database for the actual application but which needs to pull a heck of a lot of data out of an oracle

160971
gw-basic	basic
visual basic it bugs me that dim is used to declare variables since i remember the good ol days of gw-basic .when it was only used to dimension arrays

160971
shell	bash	qbasic	forth
perl c qbasic javascript assembly bash shell forth

161018
perl	php
i only know very basic perl and the server i use does not have php .so i m .somewhat at a loss for .solutions

161024
boost	stl
using good libs like boost stl

161030
debugging	trace
i know while running under the debuggingger it gives you a nice messages like loaded assembly x but i want to get a log of the assembly loads of my running application outside the debuggingger preferably intermingled with my debugging trace log messagess

161064
shell	bash
how to force shell to be bin bash for autoconf

161064
linux	osx
i m trying to get this running on osx it s working on linux

161064
shell	bash
linux is using shell bin bash

161098
required	checked
it also allows you to labels versioning in your source control repository get latest code checked in checkedout all the normals requirements compile the updates setup programs copy the files to required location and send email of the results

161115
ubuntu	debian
quick start guide - slightly ubuntu debian specific

161120
solaris	linux
may be something you can take advantage of though i don t see what oses are in the compile farm contains at least linux and solaris based on the page notes

161120
execution	jobs
hudson monitor execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by crontab

161121
put	get
once you get the 3 line segments converted into series of points you can put all points into a bucket and grouping all points by y

161127
keyboard	mouse
we can fudge it by deliberately swallowing mouse and keyboard events but am i missing some fundamental properties like setting isenabled to false without affecting its visual styles that gives us what we want

161132
processor	cpu
processor do 1b things a second one if a frame is irrelevant pretty much the only relevant cpu operations are n 2 where n 100 and blowing your l2 caching and of course busy waiting for disk access

161159
solaris	aix
be aware that most of the options discussed in other answers are not standards on platform that do not use the gnu utilities solaris aix hp-ux for instances

161182
firefox	safari
tested the font-size with ab.solute measurements in firefox safari and ie6 .so it should be pretty portable

161193
keyboard	mouse
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161227
tuples	sorted
a quick fix is to cast them to sorted tuples there could be a better solution but i cannot think of it now

161258
web-applications	scalability
scalability web-applications in java

161271
constructor	private
the closest that you can come is make the default-constructor private and then provide a constructor that has parameters

161279
verilog	vhdl
and if we look at the experience of people like the fpga designers we see that programming exclusively graphically just doesn t work - hence languages like verilog and vhdl

161283
reflection	runtime
and if you really want to force downstream implementers of your classes to have constructor signature you can always add rules runtime checked in the base-class constructor using reflection

161292
cvs	git
one aspects of git has not been discussed .when it has been brought to your attention in all these other answers git provides a cvs server emulation .so that you might migrate to git-svn to git is easy and well supported and later use a cvs server interface for accessing the repository in a centralized manner

161302
contains	elements
then depending on the value of o you can selected which arrays elements contains the pixels you want to draw at that moment based on this information and paint the pixels based on the value in the elements

161325
interpreter	runtime
c# and java are compiled to an intermediate-language which is then interpreter at runtime

161325
interpreter	runtime
most decent interpreter compile this to actual machine-code at runtime to speed up just in time compiling

161358
persistent	transient
the important thing here is the difference between transient detached and persistent entities

161372
web-scraping	scraper
if your problem has anything at all to do with web-scraping i recommend looking at web scraper which provides easy elements selection via xpath respectively css selectors

161381
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind that you don t need to upgrade the .net versioning

161399
put	get
this works fine locally and on some developmentservers however .when i put it live it stopped working because i don t get asp.foo_bar_aspx but _asp.foo_bar_aspx

161433
google-chrome	safari
i just tested with ff3 ff2 safari ie7 and google-chrome

161439
linked-list	arrays
or use a concrete arrays types with getat member function losing genericism and the ability to use linked-list containers typess

161443
codeigniter	kohana
in kohana codeigniter i can have a url in this form

161445
gethashcode	equals
in addition to jon skeet s comment make your account struct a class and overrides the equals and gethashcode methods to get nice equality checked

161455
persistent	transient
save persistent both work on transient instances ie instances which have no identifier assign yet and as such are not saved in the db

161459
.war	jar
however if you still need to have scripting for other tasks generator of code etc then be weary of maven s ability to generator code and not include it in the compiled binaries jar .war though this may well be fixed for newer versioning of maven

161473
buffering	capture
i ve developed .software for limited re.source devices for 9 years or .so and the only time i ve ever seen the need to use __forceinline was in a tight loops where a camera drivers needed to copy pixels data from a capture buffering to the device screens

161477
eventhandler	behavior
perhaps typedefing the eventhandler instead of needing to redefine it to get similar behavior

161528
puts	gets
it gets x out of the conditional clause scoping of the while and puts it in a reference y which is available in the higher scoping

161529
skype4java	skype
i ve been reading skype4java java-api for skype and noticed they use jni to access the skype client

161559
cvs	git
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

161564
value	field	default	reset
the above three are the most likely causes especially if all field are reset to their default initializer value

161568
bazaar	git
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this systemd i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now

161572
git-repo	repo
svn is designed to be more central where git is based on each user having their own git-repo and those repo push changes backup into a central one

161572
version-control	git
for that reason git gives individuals better local version-control

161591
checkbox	button
for example in the wizard you may have multiple controls button checkbox multiple line controls and they all have a different behavior on actions from the enter key

161617
python	java
for completeness i think i m going to try one of the python implementation through jython to get it running in java and start replacing pieces as and .when needed

161631
contains	any
i haven t added any error-handling beyond the custom 500.html in public though the response doesn t contains that html and i have no idea where this bit of html is coming from

161631
webrick	apache
i suspect it s apache because i get the appropriate http 1.1 500 header at the top .when i use webrick

161660
any	set
now set a breakpoints in the constructor and page load events and also any custom paint events that you may have in the form in the second instances and try to open the designer in the first instances the breakpointss should get hit and you should be able to see what s going on

161664
arrays	loops
i just tried to run a test to compare a simple iterator the optimization i introduced and the reverse do-while where the elements in an arrays was tested in every loops

161675
subtract	add
rather than lots of tests i simply add the squares of all three then subtract the square of the smallest one

161676
gnome-terminal	zsh
i m running zsh as the default shell on a ubuntu box and everything works fine using gnome-terminal which as far as i know emulates xterm

161678
click	mouse
if you take google for example i seem to remember that if you tend to systematically types your search term in and then click the search button with the mouse a messages is display at the top of the search results that kindly hints to you that you can also just press enter

161689
ruby	php
the status header is how ruby-on-rails php or whatever tells apache there was an error please return this code instead of 200 ok. the fact there is a blank line means something extra is going on and ruby is outputting a blank line before the error output for whatever reason

161731
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried with google-chrome and firefox 3 and although the navigation is not as smooth as i like the problem seems fixed

161733
keyboard	mouse
they are as plug and play as a mouse keyboard or flash drive

161746
filtering	sorting
here is a table supporting sorting and filtering

161746
filtering	sorting
look at this example in the incubator which supports multi-column sorting and fixed header but unfortunately no filtering

161763
web-config	app-config
however the console and web-applications now have an app-config and web-config that are mostly the same

161772
display	width
even though you may have widescreens laptops you might not always have windows full screens or in your ide you may have a lot of other panels around the main coding area that reduce the available width for display code

161778
oracle	mysql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
sql mysql mssql 2000 mssql 7 ingres interbase 6 oracle sybase

161812
python	php
this will give you the capability to write and debugging any ajax work you do as well as provide you some documentation and access to other dynamic-languages like php ruby-on-rails python as well as a basic html-editor

161821
push	pull
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from inorder to collaborate with at least one other developer

161822
required	checked
for calculatelistofpoints which returns a generic-list i could return an empty list and required the caller to checked this

161849
ref	out
out or ref points calculatedvalue

161849
ref	out
out or ref list calculatedvalues

161860
png	gif
another way around this is to use 2 separate images e.g a gif and a transparency png and target your css accordingly

161900
windows-xp	windows
windows 2003 active-directory windows-xp or 2003 clients .net 3.0

161913
contains	elements	populate	row
the foreground contains a table elements that is dynamically populate with text hence the row height might alter depending on the amount of text going into a cell

161947
margins	padding
this will recursively add up the rendering height not just the styled height for each child elements and any associated margins and padding and return an accurate figure for elements height

161953
bazaar	git
i d recommend trying or reading the documentation of at least mercurial git and bazaar

161974
while-loop	loops
typically you want to use for loops for iterator a known numbers of time otherwise cosider a while-loop

161985
perl	awk	fortran	perl
you can make perl behave more like awk or fortran if you really want to

161994
apache	squid
assuming i have an open source webserver or proxy i can enhance let s say apache or squid

162002
void	main
int main void

162014
apache	squid
with apache or squid you hardly can detection the time a user spends on your page

162083
python	ruby	python	java
there s openc ruby py60 python web programming and of course the various flavours of java

162107
perl	ruby	selenium-ide	selenium
first off the selenium-ide is rather limited you should consider switching to selenium rc which can be driven by java or perl or ruby or some other languages

162108
linux	unix	32-bit	16-bit
but if you are concerned about portability of the application wfstream wchar_t is maybe not the best solution because there is no standards how wide wchar_t is on windows wchar_t is 16-bit on many unix linux systemd it is 32-bit

162131
priority-queue	queue
this way you can just take the smallest elements from the priority-queue insert it into your resulting queue and insert its next elements into the priority-queue

162133
priority-queue	heap
edit konrad s use of a priority-queue a heap is a far more elegant and scalability .solution but maybe 256 input lists are .so few that a simple compare could be faster

162149
hotmail	webmail
anybody has experience with hotmail yahoo web.de gmx.net and similar webmail companies blocking your email because too many from the same source in a period of time have been sent to them

162154
textarea	textbox
example if i am here typing in this textarea i would like to be able to get the text same way if i were in the subject textbox in my outlook

162165
sql-server	mysql
i can t speak for mysql but if ms sql-server is anything to go by you may find the performance of all three solutions equivalent

162181
javascript	dom
the result i expect is a dom object where the javascript that execute on-load is already execute

162181
javascript	dom
also in some forums i ve seen instructions not to use the webkit interface for web-crawler but directly the dom and javascript inner package

162182
push	pull
maybe it would be a good idea to look at pull media instead of push media for your application

162206
perl	awk
they come from awk but work differently in perl because it is not record-based

162211
javascript-debugger	inspector
of note it has a fantastic http inspector javascript-debugger and regular expression toolkit

162211
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
oh and if you don t always hack just on php it s designed as a multi-language editor and rocks for ruby and python too

162225
contains	elements
i ve got an xml document contains news stories and the body elements of a news story contains p tags amongst the plain text

162227
video-streaming	streaming
i used fopen to open video files for streaming using a php scripting as a video-streaming server and i had no problem with files of size more than 50 60 mb

162234
updatepanel	gridview
you can use an asp updatepanel and insert the gridview in there

162253
ruby-on-rails	django
are there any frameworks similar to django ruby-on-rails which i could use to simplify things

162295
export	report
this behavior is universal - it is seen using the development studio preview the report viewing control and while export it to all available formats

162298
value	field
the requirement is that at least one of the field must have a value

162304
shutdown	restart
i ve been using remote-desktop connection to get into a workstation but i m not able to use the shutdown restart function in the start menu while doing this

162305
shutdown	restart
shutdown -r â restart

162305
shutdown	restart
shutdown -t xx â where xx is numbers of seconds to wait till shutdown restart logoff

162309
32-bit	64bit
.so is there any way to launchd a 64bit .app programmatically from a 32-bit .app and not have it run using the wow64 subsystem like its parent 32-bit process a suffix in the task manager

162311
constructor	object
whenever an object depends on another it will receive an instances of it only through its constructor no new keyword in your class

162315
z-index	overlay
by default yui manages the z-index of anything that extends yahoo.widget.overlay and uses an overlay panels

162319
python	ruby
you can also use other languages python ruby etc on the jvm for that matter

162319
tapestry	wicket
for some of the java-only technologies investigate jsp servlets struts struts2 which is the updates versioning of webwork spring-mvc tapestry web4j wicket

162358
keyboard	mouse
i use a single mouse and keyboard through synergy

162360
32-bit	64bit
whether a 32-bit or 64bit native unmanaged program is run depends solely on the executable

162360
32-bit	64bit
there are two copies of reg.exe in c windows system32 64bit and c windows syswow64 32-bit

162376
python	php	python	java	python	c++
the ws are used in heterogeneous environment with .net java php python c++ clients both web .app or desktop .app

162398
windows-vista	windows
rundll32 is a leftover from windows 95 and it has been deprecated since at least windows-vista because it violates a lot of modern engineering guidelines

162403
windows-vista	windows
i am not sure about target windows-vista although shutdown on the start menu is replace by disconnect session or something like that there should be one called windows security which also does the same thing as ctrl + alt + end as pointed to by owen

162406
aggregate	grouping
using where an aggregate .when grouping by solved by using having

162458
markup	xhtml
on an aspx page this takes care of properly indentation all of your markup and ensures that everything is xhtml compliant adds quotes to attributes corrects capitalization closes self-closing tags

162534
iprincipal	iidentity
.so can you advice me how to deal with iprincipal and iidentity

162560
ruby	php
if asp.net is not an option i d go with php or ruby

162564
value	field
i need a way to updates the month value on a datetime field in my db

162577
linux	unix
windows cmd line differently from unix mac os x and gnu linux

162579
show	next
for example if they enter an invalid email-address and move to the next field you can show an error messages immediately

162587
theorem	proof
theres a mathematical proof of this well this is a special case of a more general theorem

162603
show	next
i would get a trustworthy developer off the floor and have them bring a laptop to the next interview and show a little of the code

162628
fogbugz	svn	revision	svn
we use fogbugz for our project-management which keeps tracking of .when things were committed to our svn repository by revision numbers

162629
sql-server	oracle
this will work well on oracle but can be problematic on other databases eg sql-server will either show you uncommitted data or block on an external uncommitted updates depending on your isolation-level whereas oracle supports an isolation-level that gives you a transactionally consistent view of the data without blocking on external updatess

162664
wicket	jsf
on java the popular component frameworks are jsf a standards and wicket

162667
iprincipal	iidentity
just substitute the correct types iprincipal iidentity if needed

162777
python	java	python	c++
you might assume c and c++ are being phased out and that java .net python whatever is an advance or the next stop

162793
firefox	gecko
the last versioning is based on gecko 1.7.12 and i believe gecko is currently up to 1.9.x used in firefox 3

162797
firefox	safari
it must work in ie6 ie7 firefox for windows macosx linux and safari

162798
instances	private
i know this seems to go against the general idea of private and public but usually the class i am trying to subclassing is one of my own which i am quite happy to expose the members from to a subclassing but not to an instances of that class

162801
contains	set
inorder to do this set a tns_admin systemd variables systemd properties- advanced- environment variabless on xp to the directory contains your tnsnames files

162842
python	perl
before perl 5.10 perl didn t have a pretty-print say like python

162864
xsd	xml
you can use the xsd tool built into visual-studio to create a datatable out of the xml data and it easily serialization back into the file .when needed

162874
.war	jar
the problem is that my custom jar is being excluded from the .war file

162894
python	ruby
ruby python dynamic-c# .

162901
autotools	gnu
if you happen to be using gnu autotools or perl s makemaker systemd i think this exists for you automatically

162904
protected	public
it process an entire project or a specific file and show various unused dead-code methodss as well as suggesting visibility changes a public methods that could be protected or private

162907
keyboard	mouse
enter the keyboard mouse preferences panels

162915
triggers	insert
i need it to work as a triggers .so that any insert done to the credit-card column automatically encrypts it

162923
factors	primes
--capture the primes factors for each taskid

162962
selected	button
before even after i click on the close button the debugger was still running the stop button was not selected .so it must have been because the thread was still active

162974
linked-list	heap
if you want to do dynamic storage allocation such as for a linked-list you must use pointers because they re the only way to grab memory from the heap

162986
arrays	loops	attributes	properties
i could add an index properties to somechildclass with the xml-attributes attributes but then i would have to remember to loops through the arrays and set that value before i serialization my object

162988
arrays	loops
this allows you to write loops that increment a pointers that slider down the arrays without having an explicit counter for use in accessing the arrays

162991
swing	swt
once created those widget will be integrated with swt swing or qt-jambi framework

162991
swing	swt
i will probably choose swt swing or qt-jambi for the user-interface controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

162996
version-control	git	perforce	git
pretty much any modern version-control systemd will allow this subversion perforce vault git mercurial tfs etc.

163024
http-redirect	request
assuming you mean javascript running on the client - you cause an http-redirect to be made to the server and have your servlet react to the request for the given url

163029
pdfbox	itext
checkout pdfbox or itext

163034
artifactory	nexus
i would suggest using a maven proxy like archiva artifactory or nexus and defining your repo list on the server side

163034
blacklist	whitelist
the order matters only to the extent that the proxy-server tries the proxy repo one by one and specifying a fringe repoitory as first will slow down the resolution of uncached artifacts artifactory allows you to specify whitelist and blacklist expression for each proxy repo which solves this problem

163045
contains	set
assuming you are using .net you can set up a .settings file to store your configurationuration data - the data contains there will be stored as default value for those configuration entries .so even if there is no app-configuration file your application will run with those default

163051
aggregate	grouping
mysql lets you to have columns not include in grouping or aggregate in which case they ve got random value

163072
swing	swt	jogl	swt
you can use an swt canvas or swing canvas or opengl canvas via jogl ... and set it up as an observers of your simulation and whenever the simulation state changes you can redraw the new state

163092
ruby	php
php equivalent of a ruby assignment idiom

163149
fxcop	nant
you could use a tool similar to fxcop to review code and general warnings or errors in a nant scripting

163164
sql-server	oracle
my 300 website connect to probably 100+ databases spread out between oracle sql-server and outliers .so i cannot watch the connections from the database end either

163185
json	xml
haven t had time to get to my computer and clean up the code for posting but my current solution has been to use yahoo-pipes to get my query results from google data as directly to the browser as json instead of xml through a server

163188
subtract	division	multiplication	subtract	multiplication	division
first do the division and the multiplication then subtract the result from the original numbers

163188
subtraction	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	division
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code

163201
silverlight	wpf
it covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on wpf silverlight

163234
mergetool	meld
i like opendiff -- git also supports vimdiff gvimdiff kdiff3 tkdiff meld xxdiff emerge out of the box and you can install others git-config merge.tool your.tool will set your chosen tool and then git mergetool after a failed merge will show you the diff in context

163235
pointers	stack
it s .so tightly coupled to a standards von neumann cpu-architecture that no standards-library or runtime is required to implements most of its features pointers character strings automatic variables on stack integer-arithmetic etc

163272
32-bit	16-bit
yes you should definitely use a 32-bit int on a 32-bit cpu otherwise it may end up masking off the unused bits it will always do the maths in 32-bit then convert the answer to 16-bit

163292
eclemma	emma
emma and eclemma will give you nice report of what percentage of what classes are run for any given run of the code

163302
directory	folder
how do i get mod-rewrite to entirely ignore the vip directory .so that all request pass directly to the folder

163302
directory	folder
the folder are within a wordpress directory

163317
32-bit	16-bit
it will be more efficient to work with an arrays of 16-bit shorts than 32-bit int since you get twice the caching density

163317
32-bit	16-bit
the cost of any sign extension the cpu has to do to work with 16-bit value in 32-bit registers is trivially negligible compared to the cost of a caching miss

163321
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function same isnull function

163330
archive	backup
shutting down and restart oracle would result in the redo logs all being written to the archive logs and being fresh and ready to go after you start backup

163336
arrays	loops
my questions is does there exist a way to get this arrays named without using a loops

163341
32-bit	16-bit
if you are cpu bound 32-bit operations on a 32-bit cpu will be faster than 16-bit

163365
macros	let
let s say that for some reason you need to write a macros macros x y

163365
macros	let
let s assume there s a good reason you can t use an inline function. you want this macros to emulate a call to a function with no return-value

163365
curly-braces	macros
now the way i most often see macros written is to enclose them in curly-braces like this

163395
google-chrome	firefox
i no longer have a windows pc available to me .so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

163395
google-chrome	firefox
my results work 100 consistently on google-chrome and let s say somewhere around 70 - 80 on firefox but i don t imagine it would be incredibly difficult to find the inconsistencies

163395
arrays	loops
we split the line into an arrays to mimic the words wrap and now we want to loops through those line and go all the way down until the points where our current selection ends

163395
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
it s not perfect and it s most definitely a hack but i got it to work pretty well on winxp ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera

163395
safari	opera
.when you don t set a fonts mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single-quotes

163395
safari	opera
.when you do set the fonts to monospace mozilla and ie take what you give them safari comes out as -webkit-monospace and opera stays with courier new

163395
font-size	height
char height is just font-size

163395
punctuation	words
punctuation count as a part of the words

163395
arrays	loops
once we have an arrays of line positioning we loops through and try to find which line the cursor is on

163411
value	field
each series has both a named field and a value field that is specific to that series

163411
selected	cell
this icons allows you to selected cell in the workbook to pull the data from

163411
selected	button
you can selected the series just as you could in excel 2003 but you must use the add and edit button to defined custom series

163456
cardinality	unique-key
this brings to mind the way duplicates rows can be eliminated by adding a cardinality column while it theoretically solves the problem of not having a unique-key in practice that is sometimes impossible - for instances in large scale data

163460
value	field
there is no value that makes sense for that field

163460
value	field
an error has occurred causing the field to have a null value .when it really shouldn t

163461
value	field
.so yes if you need to allow for the possibility of a field not having any value at all then allowing nulls on the column is perfectly acceptable

163492
children	nodes	children	tree
think of it like a tree where the nodess with no children are final outcomes and every branch between a nodes and it s parent or children is a state each one keyed differently

163492
children	tree
.so while there are only 8 leaves or final outcomes of the process there could be many states depending on how deep the logic goes down the tree before running out of children

163518
msbuild	nant
don t know what the nant equivalent would be although you could run an msbuild scripting before your nant scripting that changed it

163523
contains	any
if you don t use coalesce if any column contains a null value you get null returned

163524
any	set
is htxtbox.text a properties that does any computation on a set that could be throw the nullreferenceexception

163528
data-structures	tree
not only does it give a pretty indepth explanation of graphing tree basic data-structures it gives a handful of programming challenges involving each types

163534
sql-server-express	sql-server
is there a way to take a backup file from sql-server-express edition and restore it into a standards sql-server database

163537
msbuild-task	msbuild
i m trying to debugging an msbuild-task and i know there is some way to write to the msbuild log from within a custom task but i forget how

163544
calloc	malloc
using malloc calloc or similar

163551
put	get
now .when i try to refer to an image from the list directly before i get the named of the image put inside imagelocation

163582
expression-blend	wpf
i also think that playing around in expression-blend and taking a look at the xaml that gets spit out is an excellent way to learn the wpf api .

163584
value	field
it is the definition of the date object to use value 0-11 for the month field

163611
default-value	default
i simply want to change the default-value of dropdownstyle properties to another value comboboxstyle.dropdownlist besides the default one specified in the base-class comboboxstyle.dropdown

163616
business-objects	crystal-reports
for user-interface report look into crystal-reports and business-objects

163620
strncpy	strcpy
.so i changed strcpy to strncpy and it got rid of the garbage

163647
binaries	install
i frequently need to debugging .net binaries on test machines by test-machine i mean that the machine doesn t have visual-studio install on it it s frequently re-imaged it s not the same machine that i do my development on etc

163654
lgpl	gpl
lgpl types code is ok but i can t use anything that is straight gpl

163659
p4merge	meld
you can install one of the following tools to use it instead meld opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse ecmerge p4merge araxis vimdiff emerge

163689
arrays	loops	constructor	object
just loops through each of the arrayss in that you ve created and create a new listviewitem object there is a constructor that takes an arrays of strings i believe

163707
revision	svn
in cvs i would just go to the attic to find it how do i find a file in svn without having to go back to a revision where it existed especially annoying since i have no idea really .when i deleted -- one week ago two weeks ago...

163711
perl	php	perl	ruby	perl	c++	ruby	php
i ve read thrift files which can then be compiled down to language-specific interfaces for a wide variety of different programming platform java php c++ cocoa perl c# ruby etc. .

163722
jprofiler	yourkit
as of writing this question 2008-10-02 jprofiler was at 5.1.4 and yourkit was 7.5

163725
environment	building
with the safe module you can building your own sandbox-style environment using nothing but perl

163726
revision	svn
browse the svn log of the directory it was in find the revision where you deleted it

163727
.war	jar
i use the maven-buildnumbers-plugin to generator my versioning numbers for jar .war ear package

163730
hash	md5
you could write a scripting that checked the crc or md5 hash of each file from the source and target folder and only perform the overwrite if the file has changed

163737
revision	svn
i don t think there s an easy way to query for the most recent revision where a file existed but you should be able to find it easily enough using svn ls -r rev

163738
duplicates	elements	duplicates	contains	contains	elements	contains	set
a set is a collections that contains no duplicates elements and whose elements are in no particular order.

163738
hashtable	set
the class is based on the model of mathematical sets and provides high-performance set operations similar to accessing the key of the or hashtable collections

163738
duplicates	sorted	duplicates	contains	contains	sorted
a collections is not sorted and cannot contains duplicates elements.

163754
ubuntu	debian
it is include in the standards emacs distribution and in emacs21-common or emacs22-common on ubuntu and debian at least

163765
llvm	gcc
if i wanted to publishing the results as a doctoral thesis i would make a bigger deal about this and i would probably compare gcc tendra ten15 llvm watcom borland visual-c++ digital mars icc and other compilers

163765
defined	declare
take the address of e inside loops and maybe assign it to a variables that is declare extern and defined in another file

163765
pointers	stack
of course variables allocated on stack are automatically deallocated at the end of their scoping .so not calling delete would 1 skew the numbers stack deallocation is include in the numbers about stack allocation .so it s only fair to measure heap deallocation and 2 cause a pretty bad memory leak unless we keep a reference to the new pointers and call delete after we ve got our time measurement

163777
databound	formview
findcontrol might not be able to see the textbox - is it in a databound control listview formview etc.

163805
constructor	private
the constructor is private or protected .so that it cannot be used just anywhere

163870
file-descriptor	pipe
the pipe is a low-level os concept .so it ab.solutely required a file object that is represented by an os-level file-descriptor

163962
unicode	wstring
for the next project i am considering to switching from std string to std wstring for unicode support

163998
any	set
is there any built-in functionality for classical set operations on the java.util.collection class

163998
any	set
in the event that nobody knows of any built-in functionality perhaps we could use this as a repository for standards practice java set operation code

164002
buffering	streaming
at the end bytesread 10624 ftell streaming 28726 and the buffering contains 28726 value

164002
fread	eof
i expect fread to read 30 000 bytes and the file positioning to be 30054 .when eof is reached

164004
cvs	git
you will undoubtedly hear about git and cvs as well and there are good reasons to look at them

164044
design-view	designer
visual-studio 2008 also has the split view option which allows you to see the designer while you are editing the html no more switching between source and design-view and it taking a couple of minutes to catch up with you

164047
csv	xml
csv - csv2xml - xslt - xml

164066
buffering	streaming
if you re not clearing the streaming buffering correctly you could lose the last few entries .when that .app crash and you need them most

164072
bugzilla	fogbugz
a reference to bz1722 vs fb3101 would tell you what tracking tool to checked bugzilla or fogbugz for example

164073
innodb	myisam
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def updates time but thats not .so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of .when the definition might have been modified..

164099
packaging	building
from a database standpoint i assume you are checked in your database scripting then have .some automated building packaging and running them or maybe just a dev or dba running them manually every .so often

164112
parentheses	macros
a practical but unlikely motive is if you put parentheses around the value you can defined return as a macros and then insert some logging code to watch all your returns

164117
any	set
you could set up an odbc datasource for the fixed format file and then access it as any other database-table

164126
reserved-words	operators
terminology to cover variables operators loops iterator methods reserved-words data types class

164126
while-loop	for-loop
syntax to cover assignment operation if then else for-loop while-loop selected input output

164136
any	set
one points that people sometimes seem to forget is that callers should be able to set properties in any order

164138
32-bit	64bit
if know you ll never have to load 64bit saves on a 32-bit platform then don t bother

164173
value	field
from a learning perspective it s important to note the only reason count works on the finished field is because of the case-statement that made the value 1 or null depending on the evaluation of the case-statement

164197
contains	elements
right now i m doing some tests with absolute positioning - setting only the top and left coordinate of a contains block elements

164198
unicode	wstring
std wstring is a good choice for holding unicode strings on windows but not on most other platform and ceirtanly not for a portable code

164224
put	get
and i put 7 rows with score 23 to get a large numbers of decimal places and then changed one row with score 43 to generator a second numbers with a large numbers of decimal places

164233
literals	hardcode
the above sets str to points to the literals value string which is hardcode in the program s binary-image which is probably flagged as readonly in memory

164253
value	field
a third option i thought of recent which would be really nice if a database supported it natively would be to store the value for all locals in the same field

164272
environment	building
if you re not willing to building a binary with py2exe i m not sure what the licensing issues would be surrounding distribution of the python runtime environment not to mention the technical ones

164293
any	set
in addition the tcptimedwaitdelay is usually set to 240 seconds .so any .sockets that are used cannot be reused for four minutes

164296
void	main
we ll discuss what all this crap at the top of the file is for later but for now concentrate on the line between int main void and the return statement which is where all the useful work is accomplished

164296
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	tree	data-structures	dictionary
once you re past that points basic concepts to cover include the basic data-structures arrays linked lists tree and dictionary and the basic algorithms sorting searching etc

164297
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade the code to the recent versioning of powerbuilder but there are some intermediate versioninging of powerbuilder that have binary dependencies to an old microsoft java dll that microsoft no longer can distribute due to some court case

164320
scheduled-tasks	quartz.net
i ve had good results using quartz.net to perform scheduled-tasks inside a windows service

164322
triggers	insert
you can either set up a triggers to initializer the field .when you insert the recording or else do a bulk updates afterwards to fill in the two extra columns

164329
aggregate-functions	sum
grouping by lets you use aggregate-functions like avg max min sum and count

164337
aggregate	grouping
but of course if you add any aggregate columns then you ll have to use grouping by

164350
subnet	ping
.when ipv6 is uninstaller ping the same dns named returns an ip-address on some distant subnet 24.28.193.9

164352
aggregate	grouping
grouping by is used in aggregate operations -- like .when you want to get a count of bs broken down by column c

164377
exception-handling	error-handling
the error-handling code is probably going to be significantly more expensive than the exception-handling-handling code to transport the exception-handling to the catch site

164378
getter	setter
basically i need to take a .class-file or a collections of them parsing the bytecode to determine all of the data-members and perhaps getter setter and then write something that can output code in a different language to create a class with the same structure

164388
methodology	legacy
my advice is to find a project that s small enough to not be completely burdened by legacy code and selected a methodology you believe will help clean your systemd and just do it

164400
authentication	login
i will try the login with sql authentication

164407
jprofiler	yourkit
intellij seems to switching their recommendation back and forth between yourkit and jprofiler .so i would guess their feature sets are similar

164414
python	php
edit i ll write the program that uses this regex i don t know yet if in python or php i m doing this thing first to learn some regex there are different typess of line i wanted to use regex to selected the types i m interested in

164416
protected	public
you can add public members are runtime with no additional code and can affect protected private-members using the magical overloading methods __get __set

164417
csc	vbc
you can actually go into the microsoft.csharp.targets or microsoft.visualbasic.targets file located in the framework directory usually c windows microsoft.net framework v3.5 and modify the csc or vbc task parameters to include additional reference dependencies

164423
exception-handling	try-catch
if there is no try-catch present i believe no minimal performance hit will be incurred unless an exception-handling is raised by your own classes

164437
jprofiler	yourkit
i ve used both jprofiler 4 and yourkit 7.5 and yourkit wins hands down

164437
jprofiler	yourkit
it s .so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent install which i would never do with jprofiler

164443
linux	unix
linux unix were ascii based .so it just made makes sense

164460
pygtk	gtk
if it makes any difference it looks like flashplayer is a gtk application and i have python with pygtk install

164500
double	int
use const .when you have a variables of a types you can know at runtime string literals int double enums ... that you want all instances or consumers of a class to have access to where the value should not change

164509
perl	c++
i am a c++ and java developer and had never touch perl until my current job

164509
contains	elements
and seeing the forest for the tree anything contains #+ d elements

164525
powerpc	arm
some arm variants have tcms tightly-coupled memories that work instead of caching but i am not aware of any powerpc variant with that facility

164534
critical-section	thread-safety
the usual problem encountered with this is that the mutex required to provide thread-safety is often initializer in the singleton itself which just pushes the thread-safety issue to initialization of the mutex critical-section

164538
windows-mobile	symbian
specifically not symbian windows-mobile linux etc

164542
safari	opera
if you are using firebug and need to support ie safari or opera as well firebug lite adds console.log support to these browsers

164553
any	set
note that a types s properties should be able to be set and retrieved in any order

164553
arrays	loops
as a result 2n+1 copies of the arrays will be created in the following loops

164565
callback	methods
no way around that .so if there is no explicit callback it s definitely not asynch well internally there could be an asynchronous call but the caller of the methods would perceive it as synchronous .so it is irrelevant if the methods internally for example invokes a web service asynchronously

164566
shell	bash	bash	zsh
i could see these being potential enhancements to the extension but for now i can work around them with a bash zsh shell function in my starup file

164582
export	csv
many export options pdf html csv etc br

164595
contains	set
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assign tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine

164597
chown	sudo
i recursively set permissions on the server directory to richard developers using sudo chown -r richard developers server

164614
attributes	properties
according to the documentation you can either leave the types attributes of the properties in your mapping file blank or you defined it and specify the classname of the enumerator

164652
exception-handling	error-handling
i m guessing your consultant is suggesting use a status variables instead of exception-handling for error-handling is a better practice

164659
exception-handling	try-catch
you shouldn t avoid try-catch blocks as that generally means you aren t properly handling exception-handling that might occur

164670
any	set
if the users work in a directory with the setgid attributes set then any files created in the directory by any of the users will have the permission of the grouping

164691
python	java	getter	setter
the endless getter and setter that java required aren t as often used in python

164691
getattr	setattr
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attributes value and you have first-class-functions like getattr and setattr

164691
attributes	properties	getter	setter
further you have the properties function which is often used to bind getter and setter to a single named that behaves like a simple attributes but is actually well-defined methods function-calls

164692
32-bit	64bit
no matter whether you re using the 32-bit versioning or 64bit versioning of the clr in c# an int will always mean system.int32 and long will always mean system.int64

164719
inno-setup	nsis	installshield	nsis	installshield	inno-setup
there are lots of tools for creating install on windows installshield inno-setup nsis just to named a few

164724
pointers	stack
every try needs to recording a lot of information stack pointers value of cpu register etc

164734
.when	ready
.when you resume with accepts you ll quickly dequeue the backlog and be ready for more connections

164752
hide	show
the two functional states of show and hide along with the meta data of publishing draft and archive are intermixed in the same column of status

164774
python	perl	python	java
it will also have extremely low-level operations more similar to java s than the medium-level ops of perl and python and the like

164794
selected	checkbox
under advanced settings selected the show hidden-files and folder checkbox

164798
solaris	linux
sun studio include a full ide plus a very high performance compiler and is available for red hat or centos and suse linux platform as well as solaris

164819
hide	show
at the points that you decide your business-logic needs additional data to make the decision whether to show or hide an article perhaps an isapproved flag then you can store that data

164830
contains	elements
assuming that contains a sequences of document nodes that you want to scan you want to create one line for each elements that appears in the document

164830
minimum	max	average	minimum	average	max	average	min
average minimum and maximum can be calculated with the avg min and max functions

164830
contains	elements
the percentage is simply the numbers of document that contains the elements divided by the total numbers of document formatted

164854
put	get
in my experience you need to put your link inside a onrelease handler or mouseevent.click in as3 for it to not get blocked

164855
.when	ready
.when i display the form i want the yahoo editor to have focus .so that the cur.sor is ready to accept input without the user having to click on it or tab into it

164862
instances	private
candy has object in its lookup chaining which in turn has a private instances methods homer .so methods re.solution succeeds

164865
perl	awk
if you have sugestions on a more efficient awk scripting then i would be glad to hear those too but my main focus is the perl scripting

164865
perl	awk
the awk pipe foo bar.com|reason for bounce to the perl scripting

164892
perl	awk
that said if you re going to pipe it into perl why bother with the grep and awk in the first place

164893
perl	awk
why not forgo the grep and awk and go straight to perl

164899
decrement	increment
.when someone gives a positive comparison increment the count .when someone gives a negative comparison decrement the count

164909
pipe	tail
this will generator more than two entries in list if you have extra pipe symbols in the tail of the line

164921
contains	any
.so standards cstring functions will choke on any utf-16 character contains a byte equivalent to an ascii null 0x00

164962
linux	bsd
an option if you re stuck on windows is to have virtual servers running linux bsd what-have-you

164990
external	root
i now have a external directory in the root of my project tree

164990
directory	folder
should i simply reference the dll in the building artifacts directory or should i implements another nant task that copies these to a thirdparty libs folder

165022
versioning	upgrade
the reason is your core framework assemblies in .net 2 are upgrade and have new versioning numbers which the .app wasn t compiled against

165025
margins	padding
maybe i need to add some styling or something to stripes out padding or margins

165031
return-type	lvalue
this is even more of an issue .when the desired return-type is not void especially .when used as an lvalue

165082
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i would like to automatically make every text in a td with class case a link to that case in our bug-tracking systemd which incidentally is fogbugz

165090
data-access	nhibernate
a good example of this would be the use of an object relation mapper hibernate nhibernate behind a set of repositories or data-access object or factory being implements with an dependency-injection framework

165093
simulink	labview
labview and simulink are two graphical programming environment

165105
oracle-xe	oracle
after installing oracle-xe something in oracle is listening on ports 8080

165113
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve been using these uml stencils for diagramming object model and entity-relationship diagram

165150
aggregate	grouping
however that break down a bit .when you realise how complicated it can be to write a query with an outer-join with aggregate with grouping at least .when you first approach it

165167
ubuntu	linux
if you can t get away from windows use vmware and run some form of linux ubuntu is popular

165170
short	zero
i want to display dates in the format short day of week short month day of month without leading zero but including th st nd or rd suffix

165172

normals value-type boolean int longs float double enum and struct are not nullable

165174
kate	kde
i really enjoy kate part of kde

165174
command-line	cmd
rather it has a built-in command-line .so you can issue the building cmd yourself

165174
scons	bjam
on a project with make or scons or bjam or something else set up very easy to write a short bjam file for your project you can just issue the building cmd directly

165188
solaris	linux
this needs to be portable to both linux and solaris

165188
solaris	linux
on linux we use ju but there does not appear to be any equivalent on solaris

165209
swing	swt
i get the impression swing swt seem to more like winforms

165216
sql-server	mysql
i d like a tool that manipulates grouping of related service in windows .so i could turn on my mysql tomcat apache set and turn off my iis asp.net sql-server set all at once

165238
printf	scanf
where pri is for the printf family scn is for the scanf family d and i for signed integral types

165238
octal	hex	decimal	hex	decimal	octal
o u x x are for unsigned integral types as octal decimal hex and hex

165291
hide	show
and hide show it using the step above

165310
firefox	safari
that actually sounds like a bug in the browser -- you could file at if it s in safari or for firefox

165331
any	set
i set the remember-me properties to true but it doesnt seem to triger any events where i could read the cookies and auto login the user

165342
credentials	account
the issue is that i can t find any way to attempt to validation credentials without doing something querying wmi with impersonation which isn t useful as the account may or may not have the ability to connect via wmi in the first place

165348
double-precision	taylor-series
see any calculus book for details on power series taylor-series and maclaurin series expansions of functions. please note that it s been a while since i did any of this .so i couldn t tell you for example exactly how to calculate the numbers of terms in the series you need to include guarantee an error that small enough to be negligible in a double-precision calculation

165349
authentication	login
in that login page you tell forms-authentication to create the authentication ticket for you once you authentication them

165349
authentication	login
the points is once authentication asp.net will only redirect the user to the login page if the authentication ticket has expired and the user is on a protected page

165351
mta	sta
either an sta or the mta that thread

165357
mta	sta
a probably-oversimplified versioning is that com object tagged as sta must be run on an stathread and com object marked mta must be run on an mta thread

165391
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
that is including the boost headers in stdafx.h or whatever header file you use for precompiled-headers

165425
methodology	waterfall
in other words it doesn t matter what methodology is being used - scrum xp agile rational waterfall home-grown or whatever - if the project is properly planned and execute then you should already know what everyone is doing because it was planned in advance

165426
netmsmqbinding	was
the rea.son i ask is that netmsmqbinding was really created to support the scenario in which both the sending and receiving endpoints are both wcf applications .so at that points you might as well just stick any out-of-band data you need in the messages headers.

165433
business-objects	crystal-reports
fyi the registry setting hkcu business-objects suite 11.5 crystal-reports crystal datasource history gives the location of the history files

165448
defined	declare
if you are only changing a couple of variables and you know ahead of time which variables are going to be defined in the include declare them as global in the doinclude function

165474
function-prototypes	member-functions
i have seen member-functions programed both inside of the class they belong to and outside of the class with a function-prototypes inside of the class

165495
click	mouse
how can i detection mouse click regardless of the windows the mouse is in

165525
attributes	properties
an editor attributes that i can apply at the properties declaration that will make the

165575
getter	setter
another example which may be more meaningful is that i need to call some methods .when a setter or getter is used

165588
getter	setter
.when using automatic properties you don t get direct access to the underlying backing variables and you don t get access to the actual logic that gets implements in the properties getter and setter

165592
getter	setter
and later on if you want to implements getter and setter for the properties only then you create a explicit private member for it and add the logic

165611
web-inspector	webkit
the webkit web-inspector also supports firebug s console api just a minor addition to dan s answer

165613
uniform	points
i should points out that based on the stated intent of the problem to do analysis on visitor traffic - i wrote this statement to summarize the count in uniform grouping

165641
affinity	cpu
if you could call a function that returns a numbers indicating what cpu the thread is running on without using affinity the answer would often be wrong as soon as the function returned

165659
any	set
it is possible for any sql-server to be set with implicit transactional

165659
rollback	commit
either way if this was the case you would still need to execute an explicit commit rollback regardless of interrupt of the query execution

165662
stdin	pipe
stdin pipe

165688
versioning	migrate
firstly you don t need to use intermediate versioninging of powerbuilder to migrate up to a current versioning .so even if this java dll dependency .sounds questionable to me at least it doesn t ring a bell it s irrelevant unless it affects the target versioning of powerbuilder

165689
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
example concurrenthashmap over hashmap

165700
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
passenger makes some of this moot as it handles all of this internally and can also be run on a custom building of ruby ruby-enterprise-edition that changes the way memory is handled

165713
required	checked
it only need work for the numbers 1 through 31 no error checked required and english

165742
python	ruby	python	java
c# java python ruby all have finally or an equivalent

165747
handler	service
would this be better implements as web service handler

165748
hide	show
which will show mybox hide the specified children and then blink the box

165760
constructor	object
in c++ an object is not construct until its constructor completes

165760
constructor	object
this is usually done by covering for the exception-handling within the constructor or by forwarding this hassle to other object

165764
constructor	object
it required constructor destructor exception-handling and object that have a defined lifetime

165764
pointers	stack
in c++ controlled lifetime is achieved by stack variables or smart pointers

165767
duplicates	elements	duplicates	contains	contains	elements	contains	any
i need something like this a collections of elementss which contains no duplicates of any elements

165783
javascript	dom
it seems pretty common to want to let your javascript know a particular dom nodes corresponds to a recording in the database

165814
code-coverage	ncover
is there a way of using ncover or another code-coverage tool with mono

165817
emacs	vim
question and i m not interested in text editor no matter how awesome they may be and i don t consider either vim or emacs to be an ide so.

165817
zend-studio	eclipse-pdt
i ve extensively used zend-studio and eclipse-pdt and am currently trying out netbeans

165818
duplicates	elements
if you put duplicates ids on the page you ll basically loose the ability to be sure about what you re getting .when you try to access an elements by its id

165828
sql-server	oracle
we could use the database sql-server 2005+ oracle 9+ and achieve easier transactional support but the queuing part becomes uglier

165831
environment	building
how do you go about doing a daily building and striving for a zero-defect environment

165835
job-scheduling	quartz.net
quartz.net is an open source job-scheduling systemd

165843
msbuild	nant
most people in .net land use nant or msbuild scripting to have automated building that they can later hook up to their codeigniter server

165846
artifactory	nexus
.some of the other questions and answers here on .so extol the virtues of using an enterprise repository tool like archiva artifactory or nexus

165853
directory	folder
the source code directory is unfortunately hardcode into the pdb s however if you know the folder required you can use windows concept of symbolic links junctions

165863
environment	building
ofcourse that required that you have a codeigniter environment that building more often than the nightly as often as possible really is the best option there

165896
attributes	properties
python does not need to defined accessor right from the beginning since converting attributes into properties is quick and painless

165911
getter	setter
if you do find yourself needing to be able to write getter and setter then what you want to look for is python class properties and ryan tomayko s article on

165911
getter	setter
getter setter fuxors is a great place to start albeit a little long

165922
subtract	time
subtract numbers of weeks time 2

165923
rollback	commit
they required always an explicit commit rollback

165925
getter	setter
there is no real points of doing getter setter in python you can t protect stuff anyway and if you need to execute some extra code .when getting setting the properties look at the properties built-in python -c help properties

165938
order	add
the thing is i have a building scripting which call a lot of other scriptinging and i would like to see what is the order in which they are called .so that i may know where exactly i have to go about and add my modifications

165943
put	get
also if you put a date t and time-t in the beginning and in the end of that batch-file you will get the time it was at that points and you can map your scripting running time and order

165951
stderr	stdout
i was kind of sure that there was an easy way to do this - a generics service wrapper that can be configure with a logfile for stdout and stderr

165957
expression	evaluation
the .post is centered around writing a dsl for runtime expression evaluation but the tools are all the same

165958
perl	php	perl	ruby	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	perl	python	ruby	python	php	python	java	python	c++	haskell	ocaml	haskell	erlang	haskell	python	haskell	c++	haskell	perl	erlang	ocaml	erlang	python	erlang	perl	ocaml	perl	smalltalk	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code-generation engine to building service that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

165972
stderr	stdout
.when you got that running you can use the process class to start the application and configure it .so that you can handle stdout stderr yourself processstartinfo is your friend

166044
windows-xp	windows-nt	windows-xp	windows
in the meantime for those of us still using windows-xp windows 2000 or sadly windows-nt is there a better way

166044
arguments	default
i modified the sleep.py scripting in the accepted answer .so that it default to one second if no arguments are passed on the command-line

166046
space-complexity	time-complexity
time-complexity is o n 2 space-complexity has an overhead of copy of n log n bits an iterator variables log n bits keeping tracking of n-i log n bits copy of current value log n bits copy of p n log n bits creation of next value log n bits and a bitset of used value n bits

166048
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double
however java knows only a few primitive-types among them int double boolean and char along with enums which behave in this manner

166058
windows-server	windows-xp
sleep.exe is include in most resource kits the windows-server 2003 resource kit which can be install on windows-xp too

166101
keyvaluepair	key
the fact that you cannot change the key of an entry can of course be rectified by simply replacing the entire entry by a new instances of keyvaluepair

166113
temporary	copy
if i want to call bar instead of foo does bar return me a copy additional overhead of what foo returns or it returns the same object which foo places on the temporary stack

166135
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
maybe this is a good time to learn python ruby perl windows scripting hosts

166138
vb.net	vb6
the .app is currently written in vb6 and while its going to go to vb.net c# in the future i need to find a way to pick up vb6 now

166140
filesystems	fat
i ve learned a lot by looking at a specific subject like the fat drivers implementation and filesystems abstraction

166158
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	safari	opera
according to wikipedia xmlhttprequest first appeared in internet-explorer 5 as an activex object but has since been made into a standards and has been include for use in javascript in the mozilla family since 1.0 apple safari 1.2 opera 8.0 and ie 7.0

166158
put	get
the open methods on the object takes the http-methods as an arguments - and is specified as taking any valid http-methods see the item numbers 5 of the link - including get .post head put and delete as specified by rfc 2616

166158
put	get
as a side note ie 7â 8 only permit the following http methods get .post head put delete move propfind proppatch mkcol copy lock unlock and options

166159
difference	count
might have been the rowcount count properties for which i read this. the difference is one of them disregards datarow.rowstate and the other respects uses it

166190
put	get
using datatable.clear will fail if there are any constraints applied that would be violated but using datatable.reset will get rid of anything and everything that has been put in-place since the datatable was created

166194
aggregate	grouping
i think this grouping by is for aggregate is the wrong emphasis

166196
aes	des
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption methods

166197
python	java
you could look at java s velocity or python mako to generator source for your assert conditional

166213
python	c++
it s a c++ example but you can surely translation to python easily

166218
instances	private	protected	public
in progamming there s something to be said for case sensitivity for instances having a public properties foo and a corresponding private protected field foo

166226
required	checked
how can i checked if i have the required permission to overwrite the undo disk

166231
widget	button
can anyone give a nice example with a button and a text widget

166231
widget	button
.when the button is pressed should a shell cmd be execute and the output pipe to the text widget

166284
perl	php
php plain fails but you can use perl or apache modifications to get around it

166299
positioning	slider
.when i triggers the slider the content is gradually revealed but is located to the right by about 100 pixels until the end of the animation .when it suddenly jumps to the correct positioning

166299
google-chrome	firefox
occurs on ie7 8 firefox google-chrome

166307
solaris	sunos
look at the three different numbering scheme for sunos solaris or the two numbering scheme for java

166313
parentheses	braces
if the scoping is too large for the editor it display the first line heading of the scoping .when the cursor stays on the closing curly braces parentheses

166314
embedded-fonts	fonts
note this mainly applies for embedded-fonts especially curvy ones like asian fonts as such fonts are rendering as vector shapes

166334
capistrano	puppet
currently i m deploying the package with capistrano installing the package into a virtualenv with bash and configuring the servers with puppet but i would like to go for a more python based solution

166336
common-lisp	scheme
apart from the multiple- single-namespace issue and guaranteed tail-call elimination which some cl implementation support as well depending on the compiler settings there isn t much that makes scheme as a language more suited to functional-programming than common-lisp and still most lispers wouldn t call cl a functional language

166336
haskell	scheme
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell

166337
protected	public
public surface visible from an external assembly public protected and internal protected

166360
implements	abstract
having some abstract question on matrix-multiplication i have quickly implements a matrix for int then tested my assumptions

166360
double	int
and here i noticed that just int matrix is not good if i occasionally want to use it with decimal or double

166364
authentication	login
this is because they are too behind the authentication middleware .so they will randomly put up a login image

166452
streamreader	streamwriter
.when i checked the msdn page of system.io.file class in the sample code ms is using streamreader streamwriter for file operations

166465
web-config	app-config
my understanding is that a wrapper class for log4net would be a static-class which takes care of initializing the logging object from app-config web-config or by code integration with nunit

166479
streamreader	writer
the file.readalltext and similar methods use streamreader writer internally .so performance should be comparable to whatever you do yourself

166479
contains	any
i d say go with the file.xxx methods whenever possible it makes your code a easier to read b less likely to contains bugs in any impl you write yourself

166501
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera	put	get
however get .post put and delete are supported by the implementation of xmlhttprequest ajax call in all the major web browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

166512
ubuntu	linux
actually there is also a linux versioning of wtk from sun and i am using it every day on ubuntu

166522
streamreader	streamwriter
in other words for an editor which you intend to remain usable .when editing gigabyte size files you want .some design with streamreader streamwriter and seeking .so you load only the part of the file that is visible

166522
streamreader	writer
they just use the same streamreader writer pattern internally as you d code by hand anyway as aku show

166534
floor	ceil
you may wish to use ceil or round instead of floor

166536
for-loop	arrays
clarification if you are doing a readall followed by a strsplit r to get an arrays of all the line in the file and the using a for-loop to process each line that s code which will generally result in worse performance than reading the file line by line and performing your process on each line

166553
value	field
a computed column can only be derived from the value of other field on the same row

166562
decimal	hex
1 i like a statusline with the filename ascii value decimal hex value and the standards line cols and

166567
entity-relationship	diagram
if you mean for drawing entity-relationship diagram then i suggest visio

166572
children	nodes
scene nodess might need to be organized in a hierarchy this one can be easy - just add parent children pointers to the nodes

166572
any	set
before any nodes is rendering matrix would need to be set

166574
entity-relationship	diagram
staruml has a module that allows for the creation of entity-relationship diagram

166600
iso	rfc
which is based on the iso 8601 whereas java date is based on the rfc 822 standards

166608
entity-relationship	diagram
pentity-relationship.sonally i always liked dia it s ubiquitous portable easy to use and supports a whole bunch of othentity-relationship diagram othentity-relationship than just entity-relationship uml .so i can use it to make diagram for non-techies

166619
browser-extension	firebug
you could also use a browser-extension which lets you view server headers such as live http-headers or firebug for firefox or fiddler for ie

166619
command-prompt	cmd
if you re on windows and have nothing else at your disposal open a command-prompt start menu- run types cmd and press return and then types this

166623
arrays	loops
what i do is use the isnorwegianchar and loops through the line until i find a char that is not in the arrays

166626
python	java
if you tend to develop in classes and object with vb you probably will find python c# or java are good alternatives

166653
parentheses	operators
parentheses changing the semantics of operators

166664
constructor	private	constructor	object
the biz object have a private constructor to force the use of factory methods and an internal constructor which looks like this

166673
inlining	inline
the size methods from std vector should be inline by the compiler meaning that every call to size is replace by its actual body see the question why should i ever use inline-code for more information about inlining

166693
visio	dia
then you can translation it into visio or dia or a uml tool that generator both the sql schema and your object model.

166703

editor e text-editor

166705
environment	building
i can building a seperate environment for different hosts

166729
erlang	python
.so c# and .net are really too narrow here the clr is a cool piece of technology but could they please release it for linux hosts .so that it would be as prevalent as say the jvm python erlang or any other portable language

166750
value	field
let s say a particular table has a named field for which no two rows will be allowed to have the same value

166754
ubuntu	linux
if you are a linux beginner i would start with ubuntu linux server

166754
gentoo	linux
i install mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompile asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net

166760
ubuntu	linux
but also works great on ubuntu and ubuntu seems to appeal more to linux newcomers

166766
abstract	sealed
sealed won t work because it s abstract for a reason other classes in that assembly do inherited from it

166768
nyromodal	lightbox
i m using sifr in a page that s being popped up in a nyromodal lightbox but .when the page is display the sifr object aren t being show

166793
reliability	scalability
scalability isn t a big problem for us but reliability and availability is

166810
contains	elements
this jquery will append a paragraph contains the content of the currently selected item from the drop-down and hide the form elements before printing the page

166811
updating	updates
also if field named is updates often if it were a primary key the database would be put under stress for updating the index on that field much more often

166817
python	ruby
i got introduced to dramatis at oscon 2008 it is an agent based framework for ruby and python

166820
asp.net-mvc	webforms
have to do probably something with cleaning bin folder and system.web.router abstraction because it crash even on webforms project with asp.net-mvc router in it

166823
derived-class	base-class
suppose i have a base-class b and a derived-class d

166835
environment	building
the alternative was very messy and we could not guarantee consistent building or environment between developers

166835
environment	building
the developers environment could still become misaligned but it showed up .when they tried to building things themselves

166842
web-applications	web-services
this was partly inspired by some parts of restful web-services wherein the author show that the line between web-services and web-applications may not need to be as solid and strict as is usually assumed

166843
contains	set
currently a new function is created for each set of calculations and a recording contains the appropriate function named is added to a systemd table

166843
vb.net	vb6
this is a vb6 access .app that i inherited and am currently re-writing in vb.net and sql-server

166865
basic	vb6
despite the title hardcore visual basic is the best and the fastest way to learn vb6 if you are coming from another programming language

166874
reflection	runtime
use reflection to load and examine these assemblies at runtime and present the user with functions

166876
windows-vista	windows-xp
this is considering both windows-xp and windows-vista and i expect that change in any file of above path does not triggers uac

166884
linked-list	arrays
why would someone want to use a linked-list over an arrays

166884
linked-list	arrays
coding a linked-list is no doubt a bit more work than using an arrays and one may wonder what would justify the additional effort

166884
linked-list	arrays
i think insert of new elements is trivial in a linked-list but it s a major chore in an arrays

166884
linked-list	arrays
are there other advantages to using a linked-list to store a set of data versus storing it in an arrays

166901
linked-list	arrays
besides insert into the middle of the list being easier - it s also much easier to delete from the middle of a linked-list than an arrays

166918
profiling	debugging
it can also interface with the zend platform if you have that for online profiling and debugging

166944
python	php
i don t want to go through the minor trouble of installing mod_python or mod_wsgi on my mac .so i was just going to do a systemd or popen from php to call the python scripting

166945
.net	wcf
i m developing a pos application that is used in about 200 location as of right now using .net 2.0 wcf and syncfusion components for the gui

166945
hardware	monitor
the computer at that location has a slightly different hardware setup including a splitter on the lpt out that is meant to be used for both printing to the pos printer and display the output on a video monitor

166945
debugging	trace
i ve tried to open windbg and attach to the process but here s the weird thing in the area where there s the debugging output i see the trace messages that my application produces but there s also a nonstop streaming of characters specifically b0 that repeat itself

166949
static-class	inherited
in your question you are using static-class methods b.foo d.foo this cannot be accomplished using inherited because the static-methods do not have a dynamic nature they do not take part in the lookup systemd

166956
virtualization	virtualbox
also avoid running it on real hardware - virtualbox is a great and free virtualization solution and can really take the hassle out of testing software if you don t care about dual boot master boot recording and hardware failures

166978
linked-list	arrays
therefore choosing a linked-list vs an arrays is entirely about weighing the different characteristics of each structure relative to the needs of your .app

166980
linked-list	arrays
it s really a matter of efficiency the overhead to insert remove or move where you are not simply swapping elements inside a linked-list is minimal the operation itself is o 1 verses o n for an arrays

166985
inlining	inline
inlining is about as hidden as these things get and 3rd party containers may have virtual function tables - which means you may not get inline

166990
linked-list	arrays
coding a linked-list is no doubt a bit more work than using an arrays and he wondered what would justify the additional effort

166990
linked-list	arrays
as for the actual difference between an arrays and a linked-list the big thing for me is how you plan on using the structure

167004
any	set
any nmake gurus out there that can set me straight

167007
show	next
how do i make next annotations then show tooltip description a macros bound to a single keystroke

167018
processor	cpu
i like that it tends to use my cpu to its fullest 2 cores and would theoretically scale to any numbers of processor available

167022
contains	elements
even if your code contains a logical error causing you to access an invalid elements at in this place would be useless because you don t expect the resulting exception-handling and hence you don t treat it or do you enclose all of your loops by try blocks

167035
contains	any
just checked to see if the output of p4 sync -n contains any informaiton

167042
mstest	nunit
i tend to use it with team coverage which lets me see the coverage directly in the editor even though the tests are nunit not mstest based

167043
firefox	safari
this will allow entry to be right-justified and at least in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari will even appear to flow from the right

167049
sftp	ftp
our rebex file transfer pack include both sftp and ftp ssl

167057
extends	sealed
here s an out of date copy of the source code for mono s pagebuildprovider you ll need to checked the latest implementation for asp.net from ms s shared source copy it and extends it with your custom assembly reference because the class is unfortunately sealed but it doesn t look terribly complex

167075
json	xml
you could come up with some way to serialization your structure whether with xml yaml json etc

167100
rhino-mocks	moq
also automatic mocking frameworks like rhino-mocks or moq might help mock existing classes here

167120
arrays	loops
this methods is annoying because it required two loops and an extra arrays

167131
contains	any
i should also mention that the domain model all of the entities doesn t contains much if any real business-logic

167159
linux	unix
this question looks close to what i m looking for but i need an os x linux unix solution

167197
arrays	loops
any loops accessing an arrays is a danger points because there s no stopping going beyond the end of arrays

167200
python	php
use popen if you want to write data to the python scripting s standards input or read data from the python scripting s standards output in php

167247
subclassing	superclass
how do i stop a function procedure in a superclass from been overrides in a subclassing in delphi 2007

167249
display	height
this is just a shot in the dark but if the function is manipulating the height css properties of your elements s according to this site you have to separate the padding and display none in your css to keep it from jumping

167262
python	ruby	python	java	ruby-on-rails	django
if i have to do it with python ruby i know where to go django or ruby-on-rails but if i want to make a web application in clojure not because i m forced to live in a java world but because i like the language and i want to give it a try what libs and frameworks should i use

167276
triggers	insert
i ve got some triggers set up for the table insert delete updates and those triggers increment a counter in another table

167278
shell	tcsh	shell	bash	tcsh	bash	tab-completion	tcsh
slightly longer answer the usual shell sh ksh csh tcsh bash do not have any hooks for you to hang actions on ok .so bash2 has context sensitive tab-completion

167284
contains	elements	contains	set
a .profile elements contains both an optional activation a .profile triggers and the set of changes to be made to the pom if that .profile has been activated

167288
margins	padding
you could try resetting the margins padding and borders to see if that helps

167307
binary-compatibility	shared-libraries
although there are no guarantees the const is unlikely to break binary-compatibility in the case of an arrays .so shared-libraries should end up with the same layout

167341
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out

167350
subtract	formula
.so all we do is subtract 3 milliseconds from any of those end-of-period formula given above

167367
rollback	commit
which locks all the rows returned by the selected until either a commit or rollback are issued

167367
oracle	mysql
mysql innodb and oracle are two databases that support this

167368
windows-mobile	windows-ce
if you need to do this on windows-mobile windows-ce checkout entrek s code snitch

167413
revision	svn
we are migrationg from cvs to svn and embracing some kind of revision management inorder to enforce order to development testing release cycle

167423
push	pull
databases are typically pull .sources and not push .so you ll still need to programmatically probe for changes no matter what

167429
click	mouse
this thread is the one that process windows-messages like hey the mouse click on this pixel.

167434
boost	stl
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167435
processor	cpu
as kaboing mentioned maxdop n actually controls the numbers of cpu cores that are being used in the query processor

167435
order	join
this might have the same effect as using option force order which forces the query optimizer to use the order of join that you have specified

167439
shell	bash
in a normals bash shell pressing shift-3 types a â œâ â as expected

167470
updating	updates
have a stored procedure retrieve the value add 1 then updates the keyid then return this to the stored procedure which is updating your two tables which needs the new unique-key

167471
any	set
if this is the best way is there any way around having to set each parameter twice in jdbc

167475
filesystems	fat
you still have the rename call on windows though i imagine the guarantees you want cannot be made without knowing the filesystems you re using - no guarantees if you re using fat for instances

167477
required	checked
if you use an issue tracker then required all checked-ins to have a valid issue id include in the commit messages add a pre-hook to checked this

167484
cvs	git
subversion makes it easier to branch than cvs in git branches are even cheaper

167492
triggers	insert
you could then call that function in an insert triggers on both tables

167509
contains	set
i set sortexpression to the named of the properties and sorting works perfectly as long as all rows contains a value

167509
contains	any
if any rows contains null however i get an exception-handling

167509
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

167539
subtract	add
value is the integere value you want to add or subtract if you provide a negative-number

167539
getdate	dateadd
selected dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167577
account	api
thanks to lou franco bloglines sync api - besides the problem of needing an account and being designed more as an aggregator it does not have a way to add feed to the account

167582
contains	any
you are right in that 3.5 runs on the 2.0 clr but 3.5 contains libs and if you have used any of those you re out of luck unless you install 3.5 on that server

167583
windows-xp	windows
i was doing some work with visual-studio recently with a windows-xp viewmodel on linux and somehow the guys who made the viewmodel viewmodelware made the windows machine actually run faster

167605
any	set
it sounds like there shouldn t be any issues with doing this but rick wasn t clear on why the default is set that way

167628
mediawiki	bugzilla
we are managing our development with subversion over http bugzilla and mediawiki

167628
bugzilla	trac
for both the wiki and bugzilla we would need to either migrate the existing data into trac or a way to integrated with trac

167630
configuration	environment
you can construct the ssis package .so they pick up all of their configuration from an xml file and the location can be supplied exernally in an environment variables

167630
stored-procedures	ssis
the production staff can be handed the package to deploy along with the stored-procedures and can mainain the configuration files on a per-environment basis without having to manually fiddle configurationuration in the ssis package

167681
bugzilla	trac
for bugzilla trac has a scripting bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of import bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you

167686
google-webmaster-tools	sitemap
then submit the geo sitemap separately in google-webmaster-tools marking it as a geo sitemap .so they will notice

167730
docking	toolbar
i have no good reason other then imoho are difficult to get to do what you want - if what you want if something other than a docking toolbar

167748
web-config	app-config
i use app-config for all of those settings and as dylan says above the syntax is exactly the same between that and web-config which means i can also just hand the content of my app-config over to the other dev and he can put them directly in his web-config

167764
hash-function	prng
seems like you re asking for a hash-function rather than a prng

167791
keyboard	mouse	input-devices	keyboard
as a programmer i found it very hard to use my laptop and workstation with two different input-devices can anyone suggest a good solution to use single mouse and keyboard to control my two machines

167793
keyboard	mouse
synergy lets you easily shared a single mouse and keyboard between

167793
keyboard	mouse
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is

167807
scriptaculous	sortable
scriptaculous sortable seems like the way to go since it s built-in

167810
perl	c++	python	perl	python	c++
there s no direct idiomatic way to repeat strings in c++ equivalent to the operators in python or the x operators in perl

167811
keyboard	mouse
synergy is great but also give something like vnc a try it consolidates not only the keyboard and mouse but also the screens

167813
keyboard	mouse
what you want is a small gadget called a kvm switching keyboard video and mouse switching

167835
administration	account
should administration be on the lookout for these account

167841
postback	ajax
a page-refresh would not affect your ajax call but .when the button is outside the panels it s doing a regular postback .so you would be sending the add request again

167871
carbon	cocoa
the next release of eclipse should be based on cocoa rather than carbon which is the current but that won t be until next june

167871
installation	environment
i can start with a downloading and get a fully-functional jdt cdt mylyn environment up and running within five minutes of installation assuming a reliable internet-connection

167905
scriptaculous	sortable
mootools sortable are actually better than scriptaculous because they are dynamic

167905
scriptaculous	sortable
.when a new item is added to a scriptaculous sortable you have to destroy recreate the sortable to make the new item sortable

167907
macros	vba
you might need to put the vba macros in a separate workbook to avoid file in use types of errors but if you reopen the file as readonly and save it with a different filename you should be ok keeping everything in one workbook

167909
kinematics	particle
i m interested in command-line applications even those that i can just execute and have spit out an answer without needing input for things like kinematics planar motion newton s laws gravitation work energy momentum and impulse systemd of particle rotational kinematics and dynamic angularjs momentum static equilibrium oscillatory motion wave motion sound physical optics electrostatics gauss law electric field and potential capacitance resistance dc circuit magnetic field ampere s law and inductance

167922
put	get
usb interfaces will also get put to sleep randomly

167922
keyboard	mouse
the .net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switching and the switching would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

167922
keyboard	mouse
these have two dvi input and i used one of my older belkin ps 2 switchinges to switching the keyboard and mouse

167922
keyboard	mouse
the keyboard and mouse are switchinged off the kvm switching

167931
account	api
bloglines has an api to sync account

167979
sql-server	oracle
say you got a guy who is building a database in sql-server cuz that s his strongest db but your corporate standards is oracle

168002
perl	php
i m not fluent enough in php to give an answer in that but here s a perl solution

168012
oracle	mysql
for example mysql and oracle allow multiple nulls in a unique column or set of columns because null is not a value and cannot be considered unique null

168023
hide	show
quick experiment with visual-studio 2005 show that you can enclose those headers in your own named namespace and then use what you need from this namespace but don t use the whole namespace as it will introduces the namespace you want to hide

168046
solaris	linux	32-bit	64bit
sometimes the executable has been compiled for solaris sometimes as a 32-bit linux application sometimes its a 64bit linux application

168056
cglib	bcel
many libs use cglib bcel javasist or janino to generator bytecode for new classes at runtime and then load them from controlled classloader

168059
arrays	loops
i added in his suggestion of a dynamic start points in the arrays instead of passing the arrays by value and changing its value for future recursions which brought me to the same stats he gets 209 recursions 571 combinations price checked loops iterator and then improved on that by assuming that the arrays will be sorted by cost -- because it is -- and breaking as soon as we go over the target price

168060
enumerator	any
it is possible to defined an enumerator that has value not definedd by any of its enumerators.

168086
order	add
use strtotime to convert the all dates to a timestamp before you add them to the arrays then you can sort the arrays into ascending also chronological order

168091
arrays	loops
a simple answer is to have an arrays or vector loops once through it and for each positioning visited pick an elements at random from the remainder of the list and swap it with the current elements

168115
transaction-log	bulk-load
transaction-log only trace logged operations insert delete updates and never trace read operation or bulk copy-paste insertt using bcp or other bulk cmd actually i do not remember if the t-sql cmd to bulk-load data is availabe on sql2000 or not

168129
racket	scheme
updates plt scheme is now called racket

168139
.when	ready
.when ready to resume do another socket juggle to one with a normals backlog

168186
configuration	installation
these are configuration options that are provided to the extconf.rb ruby file during the installation of the gem

168202
deployment	install
i just learned this lesson about deployment project the .msi file delivers the application to the target machine but that setup.exe is the bootstrapper that install prerequisites such as the .net mdac or windows-installer

168208
value	field
now you can change the properties s implementation maybe fetching the value from a database instead of storing it in a field

168224
binaries	install
it seems .when installing bazaar via the setup it also install tbazaar binaries

168232
xsd	xml
xsd cxx xml initializer void

168232
xsd	xml
initializer xml cxx xsd yaxxz

168283
emacs	vim
i know that some people swear against using a language-specific ide ever vim emacs or die

168284
schema	rdbms
you didn t mention which rdmbs you re using if the information schema views are available in your rdbms and if you can reference both schema from the same hosts you can query the information schema views to identify difference in

168317
shutdown	restart
any ideas for getting the smartclient .app to recognize the shutdown restart event from windows and gracefully kill itself

168326
session-cookies	cookies
unfortunately session-cookies are still by default regular cookies

168349
value	field
each test is just a list of messagess associativity arrays mapping messages field named to value

168355
perl	c++	python	perl	python	java	python	c++	vbscript	perl
as a programmer working in c++ and especially in c is good experience for helping you understand something just a tad closer to the machine than say .net java or a scripting-language like vbscript python perl etc

168356
implements	abstract
however those low-level mechanics implements in c++ could be very annoying if you re used to more abstract approaches to oop

168358
value	field
this versioning uses doubled quotes to escape -- hence a a b generator a field value a b which ain t perfect but could be fixed afterwards easily enough

168361
python	c++
it has a great python binding too .so you can easily prototype in python and .when if you need extra performance porting to c++ is a mostly 1 1 translation

168366
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
i have a form that submit just fine in firefox safari google-chrome - but does absolutely nothing in ie or opera

168366
firefox	opera
.so ie and opera were ignoring the nested form correctly i assume but firefox et al were being more forgiving and allowing the form to submit

168371
notepad++	vim
i use notepad++ or vim for anything in the lamp stack - i ve never found anything particularly useful in the ides for those technologies unless you could the mysql client tools as an ide which i use .when i am able to

168371
perl	php
i work in php in the lamp stack .so i don t have to handle bunches of external libs the way i probably would if i was using perl and the project i develop on lamp are usually simpler than my windows development

168398
binary-compatibility	compatibility
i ve written more thoughts on this including the various ways in which changing from a variables to a properties break not just binary-compatibility but also source compatibility in an article on the topic

168408
implements	abstract
bringing me to the topic of question at the most abstract i imagine that i could have a containers pure-virtual interface that has something akin to push void data and pop void data for the recording i am not actually trying to implements a stack

168413
motif	gtk
you still have to use a windows framework specific to the os you run on mfc win32 motif gtk qt etc.

168431
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
but if you keep in mind that you probably had a reason for wanting to go to the definition the ctrl click workflow saves you an instances of moving between the keyboard and mouse

168436
contains	any
it also integrated well with the main editor you can right-click on any selected java string contains sql and send to sqlplugin to stripes out all of the quotes and non-sql syntax

168441
switching	screens
it takes 20 seconds to startup you have to wait a second or .so for it to switching between screens

168462
virtual-functions	base-class
the base-class derived classes can have as many virtual-functions as you need in both directions

168463
boost	stl
what about the stl or boost data-structures specifically pointers containter doesn t work for you

168466
decimal-point	digits
the numbers specified by the value attributes of the facets will restrict the total numbers of digits that are allowed in the numbers on both sides of the decimal-point

168480
shell	bash
i also use cygwin s bash in 3 shell windows for execution ant tasks searching etc

168485
perl	php	notepad++	scite
php perl javascript bash or most other languages notepad++ on windows scite on linux

168488
internet-explorer	doctype	internet-explorer	quirks-mode	quirks-mode	doctype
i have verified this behavior as working with xhtml 1 strict xhtml 1 transitional html 4 strict and in quirks-mode with no doctype specified and it works in all cases using internet-explorer 7.0.5730.13

168509
contains	elements
can you not have a root containers class that contains elements

168509
contains	elements
if you want to add constraints to the types of elements that can be contains you can do something like this

168522
value	field
i m not certain i ve understood the problem but i think you re asking to insert a value in the field that is draw from a different table based on some runtime information such as the user named

168522
value	field
in that case you could use the domain lookup dlookup and you d pass it the named of the field you want returned the named of the table or query you re looking it up from and the criterion for limiting the result to one row which would i assume depend on value you can gather at runtime

168524
double	int
you cannot add a new interface for int or double

168525
getter	setter
this contract is enforced with an interface and fulfilled by the getter and setter of your class that inherited this interface

168525
getter	setter
later on should you create additional classes from that interface you have flexibility of adhering to the contract with the use of the properties but since you are providing the data via the getter and setter the implementation or process of assembling data can anything you want as along as it returns the types that the contract expects

168539
vba	vb6
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications

168539
vb.net	vba	vb.net	vb6	vba	vb6
this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6

169602
shell	bash
since i ve never read the whole manpage for bash like i ve done with the korn shell ksh manpage and that was a long time ago i missed that

169604

if it isn t ok you need to subtract the amount of time it took to ran

169758
getter	setter
there are some decent implementation for binding at the field level stuff like getter and setter see jgoodies binding and jsr 295 for examples

169758
value	field
jsr 295 doesn t have the synchronizer instead they have a binding strategy specified as an enum - plus jsr 295 works only with properties- properties binding trying to bind a field value of one object to that object s list membership in another object is not even on the table for them

169994
icollection	ienumerable
on the api level usage both of them are pretty much the same since both implements same set of interfaces such as icollection ienumerable etc

169994
linked-list	arrays
since linked-list can do it in o 1 time but list may need to expand the size of underlying arrays

169994
linked-list	arrays	data-structures	linked-list
for more information detail you might want to read up on the algorithmic difference between linked-list and arrays data-structures

169996
margins	padding
i generally shy away from using iframes because of padding margins and sizing issues between browsers
