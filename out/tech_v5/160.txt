1600033
updatepanel	gridview
and even i need to put a gridview in an updatepanel

1600035
versioning	upgrade
this may not really be the answer you are looking for but it sounds like you are overcomplicating the problem by trying to manage this as an upgrade where you aren t going to continue to support the old versioning

1600035
versioning	upgrade
.when the user upgrade to the new versioning the age is still stored .so .when you access the dateofbirth field you just checked if a dateofbirth exists and if it doesn t you calculate it from the age and save it .so .when you next access it it already has a date of birth and the age field can be ignore

1600044

if you have multiple .calltoaction elements each with possibly multiple .callright elements contains within then this might be what you re after

1600106
value	field
i want to highlight some of the field those that have a value differing from a global templates with a-star symbols using css and background-image

1600106
value	field
a javascript field iterates through each field compares its value and sets a css class for it if necessary

as a .net developer you tend to use a standards ide visual-studio a few standards databases sql-server oracle etc. and a particular way in which to styles your web 2.0 application xhtml css silverlight etc.

1600280
groovy	scala
thanks to the community edition you can test this ide for free inorder to develop javase applications or scala or groovy

1600314
formatting	import
i can t assume much about my import in terms of formatting case and embedded spaces

1600327
hide	show
easiest way is to add a uiactivityindicatorview on top of your navigation bar and show hide it as needed

1600338
contains	set
you can only achieve this effect by either writing your own application to set the data location to the one you want or by using a stored procedure contains dynamic-sql and the table named as a parameter

1600344
ruby	php
php or ruby based

1600372
oracle	mysql
as _nt said may be mysql supports this but not oracle

1600421
contains	elements
you don t need to cast your elements to t .when you call contains since it is defined as boolean contains object o

1600421
implements	extends
and by the way extends abstractlist takes away most of the boring work of implements a list

1600423
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
if you know how to use basic sql and you get on alright with sql-server and oracle you ll be able to get on fine with mysql though no question

1600426
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have an existing webforms project to which i m adding asp.net-mvc pages

1600432
value	field
primary key value are value of types field of project table

1600441
google-chrome	safari
this is different from non-ie browsers where external request from xmlhttprequest -loaded document are allowed or don t exist like in safari and google-chrome

1600442
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	rdbms
mysql is probably the rdbms most used with ruby-on-rails and hence the most supported but i use postgresql which is also very well supported and have had no issues with using it

1600448
webforms	asp.net
server controls have been the main selling points for asp.net webforms

1600450
lgpl	gpl
as far as i can see partimage is gpl the others probably mit or bsd and lgpl

1600455
exception-handling	error-handling
the handleerror attributes allows you to specify error pages for unhandled exception-handling in your controllers classes as opposed to the default custom error-handling provided by asp.net

1600458
sequences	unique
the problem of generator unique ids can be broken down as uniqueness over spaces and uniqueness over time which .when combined aim to produce a globally unique sequences

1600458
perl	php	perl	c++
ossp uuid is an api for iso c iso c++ perl and php and a corresponding cli for the generator of dce 1.1 iso iec 11578 1996 and rfc4122 compliant universally unique identifier uuids

lgpl	gpl
lgpl any derivative which uses directly your sourcecode must be published under the lgpl or gpl or agpl

1600484
put	get
the error messages says only get put and delete request are allowed

1600485
malloc	free
if you are using low-level malloc free brk etc to implements new and delete you may reserve an overhead area and return the followed right usable area to the user too just as gnu c++

1600495
any	set
full table scans are not necessarily bad - it appears that you re not limiting the result set in any way and this might be the most efficient way to execute the query

1600508
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
by the way firefox google-chrome and opera all opens blank targets in tabs by default.

1600514
safari	opera
it also has improved css load detection which is disabled by default but helps in making sifr replace elements faster in safari and opera

1600520
firefox	gecko
the following is exposed in the firefox gecko 3.5 code

1600531
textmate	scite
most ruby-on-rails developers use a simple text-editor textmate on macos scite on windows - mostly because most features refactoring code-completion of ides designed for languages like java c# can t be applied that easily on a dynmic language like ruby

1600531
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql might be the best choices since they are the most used ones .so you can hope for continuous support

1600558
dictionary	arrays
if there is not then a dictionary might be a better choice of data structure instead of an arrays

1600558
data-structures	dictionary
since dictionary are inherently key-value data-structures the colorclass could probably be eliminated altogether but i ll assume here that there s some other reason to keep it around beyond what we know from the question

1600558
dictionary	arrays
and if duplicates are allowed but the need exists to fetch all of the object with a common id quickly then a dictionary of either arrays or sets could work

1600558
dictionary	arrays
time tradeoff comes in use just an arrays or maintain both that arrays and a dictionary like this

1600561
required	checked
that typesdef defining barbar is one that required a typesname inorder for the compiler to be able to checked the templates for blatant syntactic errors before it is initializer with a concrete types

1600565
javascript	dom
the problem is that the scoping of the javascript inside the iframe is not exposed through the dom elements for the iframe

1600581
deprecated	javadoc
the best example of course is the deprecated javadoc tag and the deprecated annotations which both indicate the same thing

1600582
value	field
move the character in question to the character field and then your un-signed int field will have the ebcdic value you need

1600582
value	field
in the above example you loops through the size of the character field and do something with each ebcdic value

1600585
any	set
the problem comes .when developing on a 64bit systemd and both project are set to generator code for any cpu which results in them running in 64bit mode

1600586
multiplication	division
if your division instruction is not fast enough but the multiplication instruction is you can use the following technique and it sounds as if this is the technique you re after

1600586
32-bit	64bit
on most architectures multiplying a 32-bit numbers by another 32-bit numbers results in a 64bit result

1600586
multiplying	division
you can exploit this by realizing that division by a numbers n is the same as multiplying by 2 32 n then taking the more significant 32-bit of the result

1600593
multiplication	division
a division of an int by an int constants can be replace with a combinations of a shift and a multiplication

1600612
protected	public
as a user of the class you usually just need the public interface if you derive you need also the protected interface only if you are changing the class itself you need to look at the private stuff

1600629
arrays	loops
hello i want to create a arrays in javascript withing 2 for loops

1600631
directory	folder
i m currently trying to write a small service to delete one directory and all the files contains within it there is one issue which i don t know how to re.solve which is that the users don t have persmissions to access the folder or updates it .so i m trying to run the delete as an administration from within ad

1600664
autoscroll	panels
i have a panels on my form with autoscroll set to true .so a scrollbar appears automatically

1600681
subclassing	base-class
because every instances of the subclassing still needs to be a valid instances of the base-class see liskov substitution principles

1600681
subclassing	base-class
if the subclassing suddenly has lost one properties of the base-class namely a public methods for example then it would no longer be a valid substitute for the base-class

1600691
32-bit	64bit
i am trying to ports 32-bit code to 64bit linux machine

1600693
while-loop	arrays
it lets you change the parsing tokens dynamically .so you can break the string apart manually in a while-loop pushing each split off words into an arrays

1600703
contains	any
theoretically this shouldn t have any limit on how much text it contains or you can paste into it as far as i know

1600707
interpolation	splines
a simple way of doing extrapolations is to use interpolation polynomials or splines there are many routines for this in scipy.interpolate and there are quite easy to use just give the x y points and you get a function a callable precisely

1600707
interpolation	splines
however i encourage you to play with the polynomials or splines interpolation from scipy.interpolate to see whether the results you obtain suit you

1600749
contains	set
i can achieve this by making multiple filesets with set each one contains a single file but this feels clunky

1600759
constructor	object
i can t seem to figure out how to defined a object as a singleton and defined two arguments for the constructor

1600760
strncpy	strcpy
look into strcpy or strncpy or you can copy using for loops

1600770
selected	listbox
how can i get the selected item of a listbox

1600784
contains	elements
feedback will be an associativity arrays contains elements timestamp length and devtoken

1600803
contains	elements
feedback will be an associativity arrays contains elements timestamp length and devtoken

1600811
value	field
it is very important performance-wise for me to be able to query the data based on those custom field selected the rows where this attributes has that value that attributes is that value etc.

1600833
contains	elements
this function will checked that the given selected elements contains fewer than

1600836
contains	elements
col1 contains table1 elements

1600836
contains	elements
col2 contains a list of all elementss from table3 already associated with this elements from table1

1600836
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
there are 2 ways of doing this - either add a checkbox to every row in your table and have one button labeled add relationships to selected rows wording needs improvement

1600836
selected	button
.when add button link is click you display a filterable multi-select list of elements from table3 with add selected button

1600840
implements	extends
login.html should be mapped to your logincontroller.java which extends basecontroller and implements a login methods which takes at least a httpservletrequest and model as parameters

1600842
dreamweaver	notepad++
dreamweaver notepad++

1600844
ienumerator	ienumerable
why do we need custom collections and custom enumerator by implementss ienumerable and ienumerator i know what ienumerable and ienumerator does and how to implements them

1600867
configuration	environment
this leaves me with out the option to switching configuration based on environment

1600895
any	set
my conclusion is it can t set any properties of .pagesetup

1600922
implements	abstract
you might implements ienumerator if the object you re enumerating aren t coming from a simple in-memory collections but you want to be able to abstract away the code that actually creates the object and consume them just as though they were a simple arrays

1600926
ienumerator	ienumerable
generics are quite powerful .so i haven t had the need to write a branding new class that implements ienumerable and ienumerator in a long time

1600930
keyboard	mouse
without it you wouldn t get mouse keyboard or other systemd events

1600940
protected	public
don t create a private protected public member variables of these types instead create the formatter parsing in the methods where you need them

1600951
enumerator	any
i d be hard pressed to come up with a reason to write a customer enumerator any more

1600951
implements	extends
that s a very handy way to extends a class without having to defined and implements whole new classes

1600953
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this bug is not present on the mac which runs java 1.5 but on windows running 1.6 - including ie firefox google-chrome safari but not opera strangely

1600970
.net	wcf
we are creating a wcf service with a companion client dll .net that we will be delivering to a user s gac via a webpage

1600976
constructor	object
this is called a virtual constructor you can construct copies of object at runtime

1600978
export	csv
20k recording should be very fast to export to a csv file

1600988
ienumerator	ienumerable
of built-in collections class options that you can derive from you should very very rarely have to implements ienumerator or ienumerable yourself anymore

1600988
ienumerator	ienumerable
.so in the great majority of cases a custom collections class should not implements ienumerable and ienumerator itself it should derive from one of the existing built-in collections classes that already do that for you

1601015
initializer	setter
best working .solution .so far - use the normals initializer and derive the class in the setter

1601017
swing	swt
everything from swing to swt to j2me to blackberry to iphone include this concept

1601023
export	csv
you can export directly to csv like this

1601034
wamp	php
the problem that still exists is that to execute the mysqldump i have to access the php file from the actual machine that is being used to hosts the wamp server

1601039
attributes	properties
.when rendering i am seeing in the html source that the first child control of my custom control gets two id attributes - the first being the id of the custom control itself and the second being the id properties i assign to the first child control

1601041
alt	src
the problem i am trying to solve is i have a utility methods to loops through a site s pages but if i am passing html image as the value of t i get the src properties as i need the paths to identify which images have no alt tags and the src properties can never be null

1601049
debugging	trace
in release-mode no debugging statements will be visible you can use trace instead of debugging if you want these statements to be visible in release-mode

1601051
contains	set
you need to set the z-index on the orange box since that s the one contains the yellow box

1601055
temporary	copy
i believe qt s foreach takes a temporary copy of the original collections before iterator over it therefore it wouldn t make any sense to have a non-const reference as modifying the temporary copy it would have no effect

1601057
contains	any
then the grep cmd is run repeatedly with each list of 100 files and it printing any filenames contains macroname and the line of code that uses it

1601080
constructor	private
at first i thought i could declare a private event called oncommit and have the commit methods raise that event and have the code for each properties add an event handler for the event and do the writing to the settings there but i don t know how to do that without adding the event handler in the constructor anyway which doesn t help the situation

1601098
arrays	map
i don t want to have to manually create a new arrays and map each form field to the correct types by named - it

1601101
click	mouse
i want to take only numbers in it even if user right click text and use mouse to paste

1601124
interlocked	atomicity	decrement	increment
you need to understand the reason to avoid cargo-cult programming. marking strings as const makes a performance difference because you no longer need to use an interlocked increment and decrement of the refcount on the string an operation that actually becomes more expensive not less as time goes by because more cores means more work that has to be done to keep atomicity operations in sync

1601126
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i do not have a mac to test on but this css seems to do the trick in safari google-chrome firefox opera and internet-explorer on windows

1601203
duplicates	contains	contains	set
a closer look revealed that the resultset contains a duplicates set of all the columns every column was returned twice

1601205
constructor	object
.when developing applications in java i normally pass around a model and controllers object to every view object in the constructor

1601209
ienumerator	ienumerable
if it is the latter derive from a built-in collections class that already has ienumerable in it like than rename it .so that it s classname communication that it is a collections order or ordercollections and delete the ienumerable and ienumerator implementation they come for free by deriving from .

1601220
emacs	vim
it took me ages to figure discover that the versioning of ctags that is preinstalled on my systemd was the emacs one and didn t have the --recurse option but now that i ve run ctags-exuberant on my copy of the openjdk sources to attempt to get some kind of code-completion going vim hang whenever i try to invoke it with c-n or c-p

1601249
value	field
it s not really labeled statements but a way to give initial value to the named field in the struct

1601255
blacklist	whitelist
if you can take anything they can throw at you for a url you re going to have to have a heck of a blacklist or whitelist

1601263
javascript	dom
that methods returns back an object corresponding to a new windows .so your javascript code can now access new windows s dom object using that object

1601275
administration	account
for example a login account is automatically created in most sql-server installation for the windows administration account .when the database is install

1601277
updatepanel	gridview
i don t think you d want to put an updatepanel and a gridview in an asp.net-mvc application

1601277
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc works very differently than classic webforms

1601314
contains	elements
you d have to have two elements one contains the background-image which you can fade and another contains the non-fading content

1601322
constructor	object
this should be done by handing it a repository object in the constructor of your class

1601330
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms	postback	ajax
al.so keep in mind that the ajax framework that micro.soft bolted on to asp.net webforms requiredd a full viewstate postback .so that kills one of the benefits of the asp.net-mvc framework which is to not required viewstate for control persistent

1601339
webserver	nginx
using a more efficient webserver like nginx to handle static file serving and then reverse-proxy .app request to a separate apache instances

1601340
any	set
however the tricky part is proving that it s impossible to find any set of five points that can be shattered

1601344
asp.net-mvc	webforms
why are you trying to integrated webforms controls in asp.net-mvc

1601353
click	mouse
.when page load i use mouse to right click inputbox and choose paste from contextmenu

1601372
exception-handling	try-catch
i d like to put a try-catch around the whole thing to trap any uncaught exception-handling

1601375
logout	login
i am maintaining a static bool in login form which is set to true .when user presses the logout button

1601398
authentication	login	registration	login
i need to be able to replace the current registration login functionality with openid authentication

1601419
tcp-ip	tcp	tcp-ip	udp	udp	tcp
for best efficiency you can design your own protocols on top of tcp-ip using tcp or even udp and maybe even compress the data on-the-fly if network load is a big issue

1601430
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
specificity is calculated by concatenation the count of a id attributes b class and pseudo-class attributes and c types named and pseudo-element in the selector

1601438
nmock	moq
i m sorry but i ve never used nunit.mocks - but i do have some experience with nmock and moq which by the way i highly recommend

1601469
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp s and codeigniter s communities are among the most helpful

1601476
protected	public
for example make methods and field public protected and remove final

1601525
licensing	gpl
there s nothing to stop you providing different licensing for the different modules in your application obviously that precludes using gpl 3 as that would immediately cover everything

1601590
any	set
i set up the event and the keypreview is set to true on the form however the event is never fired on any hardware button i press on the device while debugging

1601591
updating	updates
if i checkout the code then make a change to a backend class i will run the code and make sure that it works on my machine updates whatever tests needs updating and commit my changes

1601610
firefox	opera
in this case it works in opera but not firefox

1601621
packets	subnet	mac-address	packets	mac-address	subnet
if they are on different physical subnet what mac-address would you send the packets to

1601621
tcp-ip	arp	mac-address	ethernet	mac-address	packets	ethernet	packets
in that case you can send an arp request and then send the packets to the mac-address you get the reply from and it will arrive at hosts 2 - the same way tcp-ip packetss are usually sent over ethernet to hostss on the same network

1601648
bmp	png
the scanned image is saved locally on the user s computer as a bmp jpg tif png file

1601649
subtract	time
.so maybe it would be best to keep the exact story date including time preferably utc and checked if less than 24 hours or whatever have passed which is simple dates can be subtract which gives you a timespan with a totalhours or totaldays properties

1601656
python	c++	python	java
are there any current project for compiling .proto files into objective-c all the google-docs simply refer to java c++ or python

1601661
double	int
double x will convert x from an int to a double

1601661
double	int
.so int double x converts form an int to a double and then back

1601661
double	int
essentially the code is checked that the conversion to double is reversible and therefore that the double can store the exact value of the int

1601681
updating	updates
just have each project put the versioning they want into their own part of the depot and the project would periodically updates their own separate versioning of the resource .when it needs updating

1601685
expression	evaluation
given condexp thenexp and elseexp are arbitrary expression as it avoids wrong results if thenexp evaluates to boolean false while maintaining short-circuiting evaluation

1601696
double-quotes	single-quotes
this text has double-quotes as well as single-quotes for ex

1601703
post-increment	pre-increment
lessons.end gets called once and also note ++i instead of i++ which is faster the post-increment operators involves creation of a temporary object while the pre-increment doesn t

1601707
licensing	gpl
one downside of the gpl relicensing trick is it is more difficult to take contributions - since normally you cannot relicense code someone else wrote under the gpl for your commercial licensing scheme

1601727
sql-server	mysql
can anyone advise how i would use any of the sql-server 2008 tools to divine the source data types in mysql 2000 database

1601770
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but on ie tried it on 6 7 and 8 it works only the first time after that it won t show the messages

1601774
dictionary	arrays
numpy arrays dictionary or user classes you may need to alter this

1601777
sql-server	oracle
i m introducing a dao layer in our application currently working on sql-server because i need to ports it to oracle

1601780
contains	set
what would a regular expression be to find sets of 2 unescaped double-quotes that are contains in columns set off by double-quotes in a csv file

1601783
double	int
ieee 754 double has 52 bits for mantissa and you are converting from to int long .so it quite easy to test

1601783
double	int
if your int consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double

1601783
32-bit	64bit
i assume i know for sure in case of java but not c# and lazy-evaluation to checked that int is 32-bit and long is 64bit

1601783
double	int
.so for sure int can fit in double without any problem both sign and unsign

1601791
strncpy	strcpy
i am trying to understand the difference disadvantages of strcpy and strncpy

1601792
.when	ready
it is our pratice to usualy make a new branche in the repository for new developpments and then merge them in the trunk to be tagged .when ready to be deployed in production

1601792
environment	building
the code tested in the dev and acceptance environment is building by luntbuild ant and delpoyed in our application-server via jythons scripting

1601792
environment	building
we never deploy or building manualy outside of the local environment

1601796
schema	rdbms
the flexible schema allows you to directly support certain types of dynamic user data in ways that can be cumbersome with an rdbms

1601796
value	field
for instances user defined .profile field or arbitrarily long lists if value like email addresses

1601796
sql-server	mysql
and i don t know about shared sql-server hosting but i have had bad experiences with shared mysql hosting in terms of consistency of performance and availability problems

1601796
required	checked
constraints you want to checked must be done in code and join you want to do will required follow up queries to simulate

1601804
stderr	stdout
this option must be set to true to allow the parent to specify stdin stdout and stderr handles for the child in the startupinfo parameter

1601804
stdin	pipe
create stdin out err pipe and dup the correct ends of those to the intermediate process

1601813

however you will certainly need to supply different a hibernate configuration value hibernate.cfg.xml as you will need to change hibernate s dialect from sql-server to oracle

1601835
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
a typical scenerio is my appdelegate will go out to the network grab some data - nsmutabledata and then pass a reference to a root viewcontroller - typically a tableviewcontroller - that is pushed on the viewcontroller stack of an navigationcontroller

1601835
selected	cell
.when a cell is selected an secondviewcontroller is alloc init ed and a subset of the data is passed to it

1601842

1601842
selected	button
a vertical spaces in the middle with a single link button allowing the user to link the currently selected employee with the currently selected project

1601842
selected	button
at the head of the list is a toggle button which filtering the employees list to only those associated with the currently selected project

1601842
button	popup
you might even add a button on the details panels to open a more detailed popup windows or you might do away with the details panels altogether if you re mainly interested in managing the links

1601888
order	join
but what is the general order of execution while execution a join query especially if there are lot of join outer inner natural if many outer

1601896

1601915
mips	x86
i don t have a mips systemd lying around but on my x86 loonix box i tried #include and discovered that # is the comment character .so i tried include and that worked as .soon as i quoted the file named include .something.i

1601930
actionscript	mxml
what the question says i want to use compc either command-line or ant to building a .swc from some actionscript and mxml code

.when i set up the flexunit cairngorm mock-as3 and hamcrest-as3 libs as rsl libs with the .swf location set to something that exists i get a runtime failure

1601938
ubuntu	debian
if you did go with debian you could most likely do all your development on ubuntu and then push to your embedded systemd

1601959
triggers	insert
then either create pl sql procedure callable by client or if client expects to work with table create a updatable view + instead of insert updates delete triggers

1601970

1602076
command-line	cmd
is there a way to ab use the tcl c-api to parsing a string doing all the replacement including sub cmd in square brackets but stopping before actually evaluation the resulting command-line

1602078
google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 google-chrome firefox work fine

1602079
boost-asio	boost
i m trying to migrate a project which uses boost particularly boost-thread and boost-asio to vxworks

1602079
cross-compiling	toolchain	toolchain	gnu
i figured that this wasn t going to be an issue as i d seen patches on the boost trac that purport to make this possible and since the vxworks compiler is part of the gnu toolchain i should be able to follow the directions in the boost docs for cross-compiling

1602099
object-reference	instances
--- system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object. the allkeys properties for appsettings is an arrays of zero length where i am expecting length of 1

1602124
buffering	capture
they are what perl call named capture buffering which i have never used but the original code fragment does

1602141
order	join
join are not done in an order based on inner vs outer but rather based on what the optimizer thinks will result in the query being execute most quickly

1602151
type-conversion	int
a type-conversion is done through int o where the object o is converted into an int actually an int object is construct out of o

1602152
contains	elements
with the first catch block you know that single throw an invalidoperationexception because the sequences contains more than one elements or is-empty

1602164
any	set
given a set of points on a plane find the shortest line segment formed by any two of these points

1602165
temporary	copy
the copy ctor must take a reference to a const object to be able to make copies of temporary object

1602172
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in that regard a viewmodel is very doable with asp.net-mvc and i m sure it could be leveraged in webforms as well

1602182
cross-compiling	autotools	autotools	gnu
# gnu autotools inorder to cross-compiling thirdparty libs

1602190
windows-xp	windows
server 2003 windows-xp and windows

1602212
python	java
the backend heavy lifting is done in java but has a python interface .so you can write python scripting create and send the input as well as process the results

1602216
python	java
what is typically called casting in c or java is referred to as conversion in python though it often gets referred to as casting because of its similarities to those other languages

1602226
any	set
i did this for a client a while back -- at deployment depending on a properties set in a production.properties file i changed out the hibernate.dialect in the cfg file using ant you can use any xml transformer

1602229
getter	setter
100 test coverage gui-testing testing getter setter or other no-logic code etc

1602230
32-bit	64bit
what are the guidelines for porting a 32-bit program to a 64bit versioning

1602231
order	join
join order is irrelevant in almost all cases

1602231
order	join
for complex queries the optimiser will not go through every permutation .so the join order can matter it depends .when the optimiser decides it s had enough.

1602240
telnet	ssh
and if you want to auto execute something on remote machine better alternative to telnet is ssh as in

1602254
click	mouse
you can add additional listener for mouse click and insert event and some useful data in db

1602257
selected	button
this view has two button or other controls that allow the user to selected where they would like to go

1602263
value	field
providing that is a value that semantics equivalent to the month_from and month_to field

1602284
solaris	linux
implementation of the api are currently available for solaris sparc solaris x86 and linux x86

1602307
32-bit	x86
for example 32-bit apps get install in program files x86

1602321
push	pull
2 - .when i want to work on the code at work i m confused how do i go about making commit to the local repo on my work desktop and then at the end of the day push my changes to the bare repo on my vps .so that i can pull the updates to my home desktop

1602337
datapager	gridview
also know that if you are running asp.net 3.5 project you can use datapager control with extends gridview there is an example which matt berseth developed here

1602348
output	mode
just run it twice with newer mode -u or --update flag plus -t to copy file modified time -r for recursive folder and -v for verbose output to see what it is doing

1602378
scheme	let
but for the caching mechanism to work the renaming scheme needs to implements one url one named if a given url can have multiple namedd the caching does not work ie if i simply numbers the files in the order they are found i won t let wget identify which urls have already been downloading

1602378
hash	md5
the simplest renaming scheme would be to calculate an md5 hash of the filename and not of the file itself which is what md5sum does

1602384
unix	bsd
like mach and most bsd unix systemd

1602386
environment	execution
simple execution environment

1602390
google-chrome	firefox
if the page is served as text html then firefox and google-chrome the only two i ve checked in won t recognise the xml namespaces necessary for the svg to work

1602400
json	xml
adding support for json and xml views

1602420
.when	ready
there are time .when i just want to throw diagram around possibly of half-finished designs and refine them with others until we re ready to initializer the real database

1602422
linux	unix
at least on linux and probably on at least some other unix systemd if the libs is dynamically opened a global function named _init if it exists will be called by the dynamic linker

1602423
interface-builder	iboutlet
if you created the uiimageview in interface-builder make sure you connect it up to your iboutlet or it won t respond to you setting the .center properties

1602426
push	pull
you can then push to and pull from it on each computer .when necessary simply using git push and git-pull

1602427
python	java
i currntly use m2e for the majority of my java development and pydev for python jython development within eclipse

1602438
uitableview	uiview
guys please note that i am not dealing a uiview and adding a tableview as its subviews but i am dealing with a uitableview

1602449
versioning	upgrade
that is to say if you upgrade the file to a new versioning it will not work with the old deserializer

1602467
subclassing	ivar
if you re subclassing uitableviewcontroller you get a tableview for free no ivar or nib required however since you re using a background i would stick with ib

1602477
drawimage	draw
and then in paint graphics maybe use the drawimage ... methods of the passed in graphics-object to draw the image

1602478
directory	folder
i just added two new directory registration and openauthid in the main templates folder

1602492
selected	button	click	mouse
i cannot get it to work without first selected the row which is annoying i d like to get a similar behavior the windows-explorer has if i single click on an item and start moving the mouse while holding the left button it drag my row if i single click elsewhere and start moving the mouse while holding the left button it does a multiple selection of the rows

1602519
cursor	row
you probably need to add a mouselistener that listens for mousepressed events and then cause the selection of the row to be the row the mouse cursor is currently over

1602531
sql-server	mysql
here is what i have done in running my own game server had users on sql-server and on mysql and wanted to integrated them both

1602576
.when	ready
you could use swfobject to embed the flash dynamically or you could just put the flash object in a 1px by 1px containers and show it .when you re ready

1602583
stderr	stdout
the most likely culprit is that unison is sending some output to stderr instead of just stdout

1602583
stderr	stdout
popen takes an additional stderr arguments .so you can try capturing that instead of or in addition to stdout

1602648
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
for the primitive data types boolean byte short char int float long-double the shape is the size in bytes it uses or in bits here 1 byte 8 bits

1602648
32-bit	64bit
.so you can assign an int to a long you can thing 32-bit fits into 64bit a short 16 into a int 32 etc

1602648
32-bit	16-bit
now you might assign an int 32-bit to a char 16-bit or to a short 16-bit the problem would be that if the value holds than 16-bit 131 071 for instances

1602651
subclassing	superclass
you should use the proper constructor based on the subclassing you want to create instead of calling the superclass constructor and assign types manually

1602651
callback	methods
this gives you the benefits of defining different behavior in your subclassing initializer methods or callback

1602657
project-management	project
take the following examples provided by hugh woodward pmp in expert project-management - project success looking beyond traditional project metrics

1602657
project-management	project
project orion this massive effort to develop kodak s new advantix photographic systemd was reputedly very well managed from a project-management perspective

1602663
.net	wcf
also the standards wcf datacontractserializationr will happily serialization anything you ve marked with a data-members attributes - the .net visibility setting has no bearing on the soa view of your data really

1602666
boost	stl
the basic stl boost data-structures should work but threading with boost could be a problem

1602680
32-bit	16-bit
will also give an error because c + i will result in an int 32-bit and assign it to a char 16-bit may cause loss of precision

1602685
ruby-on-rails	django
i know that django and ruby-on-rails are popular for recreational development but not sure about them in a corporate setting

1602692
any	set
it appears that the actual address is not changing entirely randomly it just selected one value from a fixed more-or-less stable set of value but in any case it makes it much more difficult to do this types of memory watching

1602719
protected	public
if using a helpers to expose protected members you have to declare the helpers in the same unit that you use it unless you expose a public methods which exposes the required protected members

1602731
sse	avx
this is an interesting development given that their 4-way simd sse instruction set is about to be joined by 8-way avx and 16-way larrabee instructions and in the interests of portability it ll likely be much better to code with an abstraction like valarray than say intrinsics

1602741
object-reference	instances
i have tried yahoo and myspace but i always get object-reference not set to an instances of an object. i ran the sample that came with the building ajaxlogin.aspx and loginprogrammatic.aspx they both give me the same error messages

1602748
contains	sorted
if it s just float strings i d rather suggest to create a table with two columns first row contains the original string second row is filled with the string converted to float sort this by the float column and then output use the sorted string column

1602774
sql-server	oracle
an other solution is to create a database link from oracle to sql-server and to do selected

1602788
stripes	wicket
struts stripes wicket spring-mvc

1602797
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i ve worked on an .app that supports a lot of databases oracle informix sql-server mysql

1602797
sql-server	oracle
this way every database can use the same strategy rather than sequences in oracle native for sql-server etc

1602797
oracle	mysql
you have to be aware of the keyword for each database don t try to have a user table in oracle users will work or a translation table in mysql

1602819
hide	show
you can also add some effects in the show hide through jquery s effects

1602824
hash	md5
md5 hash for the words

1602833
contains	any
now the team is stuck with a repository that contains code that doesn t even compile let alone passes any test

1602855
nested	assign	assign	deep
this allows the dot accesses to be nested arbitrarily deep until the final assignment at which points a real value is assign

1602855
instances	self
called .when an attributes lookup has not found the attributes in the usual places it is not an instances attributes nor is it found in the class tree for self

1602855
instances	self
for new-style classes rather than accessing the instances dictionary it should call the base-class methods with the same named for example object.__setattr__ self named value

1602927
value	field
bear in mind that sometimes you need to differentiate between unknown and not relevant - for example a datetime field in one of my databases can either be the sql-server minimum date not applicable null unknown or any other date known value

1602927
value	field
for field which don t really have business rules depending on them - i m talking about comments description notes columns here - then i set them to default to empty strings as a it saves dealing with nulls and b they are never unknown - they just aren t filled in which logically is a known empty value

1602974
private-members	object
also note that myclass is a friend of itself and thus can access the private-members of another object of the same class

1602980
solaris	linux
but i assume modern oss like linux solaris 10 os x and vista should have schedulers that know this information

1602980
solaris	linux
i m particularly interested in the answer for solaris and linux

1602981
hash	md5
a hash-function can be as simple as add 13 to the input or complex like a cryptography hash such as md5 or sha1

1602999
silverlight	wpf
it might be along the line of what you are looking for but it isn t specifically a wpf or silverlight best practices guide

1603004
value	field
also checked the types of numeric field and make sure you don t exceed a maximum value

1603030
carbon	cocoa
i m using some carbon code in my cocoa project for handling global key-events shortcuts from other applications

1603031
handler	service
you can use wtsenumeratesessions to list all sessions on the machine or handle session change notifications in your service handler

1603055
valarray	std
the section on std valarray s in the c++ programming language mentions this unusual api and the fact that since std valarray s are expected to be highly optimized any error messages you get while using them will probably be non-intuitive

1603055
valarray	std
out of curiosity about a year ago i pitted std valarray against std vector

1603055
valarray	std
using gcc i did get a little performance benefit .when using std valarray for simple math but not for my implementation to calculate standards deviation and of course standards deviation isn t that complex as far as math goes

1603055
valarray	std
i suspect that operations on each item in a large std vector play better with caching than operations on std valarray s

1603055
valarray	std
both std vector and std valarray store the data in a contiguous block

1603055
valarray	std
however they access that data using different patterns and more importantly the api for std valarray encourages different access patterns than the api for std vector

1603055
valarray	std
for the std valarray i did something like

1603055
valarray	std
for one the std vector example doesn t make an intermediate collections like the std valarray example does

1603055
valarray	std
however i think it s fair to compare them because the difference are tied to the difference between std vector and std valarray

1603055
valarray	std
.when i wrote this answer i suspected that subtract the value of elements from two std valarray s last line in the std valarray example would be less cache-friendly than the corresponding line in the std vector example which happens to also be the last line

1603059
any	set
i don t know of any existing ones but it should be too hard to catch most of these with a set of regular expression in a custom validation

1603067
rhino-mocks	typemock
i switching to rhino-mocks because with typemock i didn t have to be discipline enough to write loosely coupled code

1603082
linux	unix
my guess is that this would only be a potential problem on linux unix systemd where the filesystemd is case-sensitive

1603082
ubuntu	linux
dillo 2.1.1 for ubuntu linux didn t like either line maybe that systemd lacked both courier new and courier

1603085
square-bracket	backslash
there are 11 characters with special meanings the opening square-bracket the backslash the caret the dollar-sign the period or dot

1603085
perl	php
in perl and php there is a special function quotemeta that will escape all these for you

1603088
postgresql	mysql
the advantage of mysql and postgresql is of course the starting price of 0 which is pretty nice in a usual self-funded startup

1603103
rdbms	acid
rdbms acid transactional belong always to short atomicity and local operations

1603108
data-members	private
private object modules cannot be used in public object modules as parameters or return types for public procedure this is what i need as public data-members or as field of public user defined types.

1603119
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to bind handler for mouseenter and mouseleave to a set of elements grabbed using the jquery selector

1603119
firefox	safari
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first elements grabbed by the selector display the desired behavior

1603120
versioning	upgrade
you can start with the free sql-server-express edition and later if you need you can upgrade to the full versioning which supports clustering etc

1603127
postgresql	mysql
mysql i postgresql

1603130
processor	cpu
kernel are constantly being updates based on new processor technology single cpu per socket to hyper threading to multiple cores per sockets

1603130
any	set
any attempt by you to set hard affinity may backfire on future platform

1603138
launchd	daemons
crontab is a common named for a gnu linux daemons that periodically launchd scripting according to a scheduling you set

1603138
launchd	daemons
you add your scripting into a crontab or place a symlink to it into a special directory and the daemons handles the job of launchd it in the background

1603138
daemons	systemd
there is a variety of different crontab daemons but your gnu linux systemd should have it already install

1603140
affinity	cpu
for general-purpose applications there is no reason to set the cpu affinity

1603140
affinity	cpu
however there are instances where it is necessary to set the cpu affinity

1603140
any	set	affinity	cpu
for example in real-time systemd where the cost of migrating a thread from one core to another which can happen at any time if the cpu affinity has not been set can introduce unpredictable delay that can cause tasks to miss their deadlines and which preclude real-time guarantees

1603140
affinity	cpu
you can take a look at this article about a multi-core aware implementation of real-time corba that among other things had to set the cpu affinity .so that cpu migration could not result in missed deadlines

1603146
daemons	systemd
a mail alias will do this inside the mail systemd without you having to fool around with daemons or service or anything of the sort

1603148
constructor	object
the logsite object has a bunch of convenient overloads for the constructor such as methodsbase .so you can just use methodsbase.getcurrentmethods and use reflection to get the actual named of the methods and parameters instead of a hardcode strings

1603155
python	c++
edit addition in c++ you can use std priority_queue in much the same way as python heapq module is used here

1603155
python	c++
other than that the algorithm translation quite cleanly from python to c++

1603157
oracle	mysql
i ve had no problems handling tables as large as 36 000 000 rows on mysql and oracle

1603178
default	reset
3 use a before_filter to reset the default scoping of the model on each request

1603179
contains	any
i like the whisterblue and bureaublue themes a lot but neither contains any styles for the new controls include in the wpf toolkit datagrid datepicker and calendar

1603179
silverlight	wpf
i should also mention that i ve been trying to ports a silverlight versioning of the bureaublue datagrid themes to wpf see how do you ports a themes from silverlight to wpf

1603183
base-class	inherited
i wanted to have the two classes inherited from a common base-class but the problem is that for a console .app i have to have a static main function

1603183
derived-class	inherited
it seems like a design problem for me to both inherited from consolebase as well as have an instances of it as a static variables within each derived-class

1603183
base-class	inherited
is it bad to both inherited from a class as well as keep an instances of that base-class around for working with

1603194
configuration	logging
i would like to building a test versioning of the rpm that install in a different location with a different configuration for apache crontab and logging

1603206
put	get
use something like this - create an iframe from gwt maybe put it in lightbox or something similar populate it the way you want using the current state of the .app and .when the user is finished he ll just close the lightbox frame and get back to the main .application

1603212
postgresql	firebird
postgresql and firebird are free

1603231
affinity	cpu
regarding cpu affinity

1603231
processor	affinity
so-called ideal processor affinity in

1603231
affinity	cpu
the article also warns that cpu affinity shouldn t be manipulated without a deep understanding of the problem

1603232
sql-server	oracle
both oracle and sql-server have free versioning but the limitations is resources - 4 gb database ram single cpu utilization

1603232
sql-server	oracle
i saw the ops comment about not liking ms software - that s your prerogative but using the free versioning of either oracle or sql-server do benefit from seamless transitions to upscale versioning of the respective database

1603232
sql-server	oracle
personally my choice would be either oracle or sql-server because of imho real feature considerations like hierarchical query support subquery factors cte package long before i get concerned with functions procedure full text searching xml support etc

1603238
uinavigationitem	uinavigationbar
here s another way to insert a custom uiview directly into the uinavigationbar with uinavigationitem s properties

1603238
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
and where navcontroller is the uinavigationcontroller that your view managed by uinavigationbar is in.

1603251
constructor	private
postscript as you d suspect the real implementation is a bit more complicated than this example having several arguments in the constructor and doing more interesting things with _str -- and properly keeping it private

1603266
arguments	default
you could default the string arguments

1603267
webserver	security
i ve used it many time to help to find security configuration problems especially on webserver

1603304
perl	awk
the only tool i have now is grep awk perl but i am just being reactive once someone complains

1603312
scala	java
probably you re better of with a type-conversion new mystring string .reverse unfortunately java does not have c# s extension methods or scala s implicit type-conversions

1603336
click	mouse
but for example you can use the netbeans create delegations... feature and you get all delegation methods with some mouse click

1603347
stripes	wicket	stripes	seam	stripes	jsf	stripes	grails	wicket	seam	wicket	flex	wicket	jsf	wicket	grails	spring-mvc	gwt	seam	jsf	grails	jsf	grails	seam	flex	jsf
struts2 spring-mvc stripes wicket grails jsf seam gwt flex etc stripes and grails being my favorite

1603365
data-structures	tree
if you are going to use nested data-structures tree for example using yield return will be allocation far more memory because a different state machine will be created in every sub structure

1603375
selected	button
do i need to have three separate gridview in my page and just show the one for which the user selected based on the click to the link button while hiding all the others

1603375
updatepanel	gridview
right now the entire gridview is contains in an ajax updatepanel with the code below

1603391
verilog	vhdl
without even know the answers to these questions i would not use an fpga unless you are building a real-time systemd and have electrical computer engineers on your team that have knowledge of hardware description languages such as vhdl and verilog

1603399
insertion-sort	quicksort
insertion-sort is better than quicksort on short lists

1603399
insertion-sort	quicksort
in fact an optimal quicksort has a size threshold that it stops at and then the entire arrays is sorted by insertion-sort over the threshold limits

1603414

i don t know c# but if there isn t a standards queue types a linked-list or mutable arrays types thing would work just as well

1604173
hide	show
my recommendation is to always just have 1 frame and have layer which you hide and show as necessary

1604174

.so in the example above if you remove the canvas or change the canvas to .some other panels and leave the rectangle s horizontalalignment set to stretch it will take up all of the available width effectively the width of the grid

1604670
perl	c++
the example is in c++ not perl

1604702
calayer	uiview
if you want to test this yourself i highly recommend picking up the image editor opacity which can generator quartz code for a drawing including a full uiview or calayer subclassing as well as output a png of that same drawing

value	field
the reason i ask this is that i have an application where there are some field that the user may specify value to search on

my problem is that .when i go to save the object i have no datacontext to execute submitchanges against

1604757
http	ssl
the best way to do this that i m aware of is via http via tsl ssl

1604758
gridview	listview
per.sonally i wouldn t use a datagrid control since it restrict your control over your output and they ve been replace by the newer gridview listview controls although datagrid is not ob.solete .so feel free to use it if you want

1604820
sql-server	oracle
there is a table mapping the difference between oracle and sql-server here

1604820
sql-server	oracle
2 key generator - oracle and sql-server use different mechanics and if you try to avoid the native generator altogether by having your own key table - well you just completely serialization all your insert

1604820
sql-server	oracle
4 oracle is case-sensitive sql-server is not

1604826

1604916
union-all	union
you re using union rather than union-all you won t have entirely duplicates rows between the two subtables in the union but you may still very well have several value of time for one value of the id and you give no hint of what you want to do - min max avg sum or what

1604916
sql-server	mysql
the sql engine should give an error because of that though some such as mysql just pick a random-ish value out of the several i believe sql-server is better than that

but if you then try to declare a subclassing of your singleton class the subclassinging constructor wont be able to see the constructor of the superclass .

1605125
constructor	private
you could increase the visibility of the private constructor but then there is nothing apart from good sense stopping someone from creating multiple-instances of it

1605132
constructor	object
if you want to initializer members inner foo and inner bar from x and y you have to pass a concrete object of enclosing types into the inner s constructor

1605132
class-members	inner-classes
however this situation was classified as a defect in c++98 and it was decided that inner-classes should have full access to outer class-members even private ones

selected	button
radio button use them .when there are a few options only 10 and you only selected one

1607025
selected	checkbox
checkbox list a few options 10 and you need to selected many

1607025
selected	button
double lists selected a single elements from one long list and then click a button selected to transfer selecteded item into the second list

1607031
realloc	malloc
if pointers is a null-pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

1607031
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the spaces has been deallocated by a call

1607031
realloc	free
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

1607033
selected	button
to answer your specific ideas the established wisdom is that for few data elements use a full list with radio button for single selected

1607033
selected	checkbox
checkbox for multiple selecteded .when there are few elements and multi-selected lists .when there are more than a few elements it s easier to selected in multi-selected list

1607062
selection	highlight
if it is the latter try this - and perhaps also remove the highlight selection colour too else perhaps the code-behind route is correct in terms of preselecting your first item as that may be an option

1607074
selected	listbox
the selectedion in the listbox has a weird behavior it selected 2-3 elements instead of the only the one on which i click

1607074
listboxitem	selected
moreover .when i click to another listboxitem it doesn t unfocus the previous selected one

1607096
derived-class	abc
however given that its not possible to initializer an object of an abc how does the compiler handle this data for cases where we have a numbers of derived-class object that

1607115
interpreter	runtime
therefore you need to have the .net runtime install .so your code can be interpreter at runtime

1607122
administration	account
using an administration account the query is successful

1607122
windows-server	windows-xp
but it is only failing in windows-server 2003 and not in windows-xp

1607122
runas	cmd	administration	account
i used the runas cmd to run the application using both the administration and non-administration account

1607140
visio	dia
dia - best freeware flowcharting visio tool

1607143
double	int
my mistake the time is stored as an unsigned double instead of an int

1607154
contains	set
well if you have a result set contains mysql datetime value you could use the convertall methods along with a delegation using datetime.parse to create a collections of system.datetime value

1607156
rollback	commit
.when i use session.update and commit or rollback my transactional i get an objectdisposedexception

1607163
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
attempting to prevent people doing things at a technology level will only lead to the dedicated working around your effort to stop them by means of reverse-engineering to which obfuscation code will never stop them it will only slow them down clean room design and .so forth

1607169
visio	dia
there s an open-source program with features similar to visio called dia

1607179
void	main
void main void

1607217
value	field
h commandbutton link is used for submission forms .so the value are in form field

1607260
.when	ready
and finally make sure this code is execute .when the dom is ready inside

1607274
terminate	timeout
however i want the process task to terminate with success after 5 minutes .so i set the timeout to 300 seconds but it still terminate with a failure

1607282
markup	xhtml
declare the mobile doctype with your xhtml document and make sure your markup and styleheets are valid

1607302
revision	cvsnt
however it only works partially with my cvsnt installation possibly because cvsnt treats the reserved head symbols not as the single revision at the tip of the default branch but instead uses it to identify the entire trunk branch

1607302
revision	cvsnt
you might want to try it with the vanilla cvs instead of cvsnt anyway as i seem to remember that treating head as a branch rather than as a revision is a cvsnt-specific idiosyncrasy.

1607316
selected	textbox
i added a comparevalidator to perform a data typechecking on the textbox and this causes an error after selected a date with the datepicker

1607319
double-quotes	spaces
if the path has a spaces in it you need to escape it with double-quotes such as

1607398
wordpress	blogs
for some reason my wordpress blogs changes the custom field of my .post

1607408
contains	any
how can i selected any row that contains any windows-1252 punctuation in this column

1607422
any	set
.so my question is is there any way to make this hack work with the debugging level set to zero

1607423
http	ssl
however .when setting up the webserver to support ssl it should not be any difference in how you deploy it as far as i know you just tell the webserver to respond to http instead of http

1607435
order	add
inorder to add a file or folder the parent folder of that item must already have been added .so the order in which items are process is very important

1607437
web-config	app-config
one more thing i dont have in my web-config at server or app-config in client

1607475
continuous-integration	nant
we use nant cruisecontrol.net and subversion for continuous-integration and automated deployment to the dev servers

1607475
any	set
the set up can get pretty complex i have used it with vss as well email me if you have any questions or need scripting help

1607478
processor	cpu
if several processor can each write to different places in the caching line then the caching line can ping-pong between cpus and that s a lot more expensive than if it the caching line goes to a single cpu and stays there

1607479
oracle	mysql
there are many databases available now like mssql server mysql server oracle db2 etc

1607479
capacity	storage
data storage capacity

1607488
execute	prepare
passing a query to an execute methods of a prepare statement or something guessing my oracle drivers is deprecated

1607493
identity-column	sql-server
anyway a table with identity-column only is normally used to overcome some sql-server obstacle that s either harder to do otherwise or to slow using other ie

1607503
triggers	insert
the best alternative if you need to transform the key in some way is to use an insert triggers on table1 .when you insert rows there the triggers will fire and you can insert data into table2

1607518
webserver	upload
after upload the site on webserver i found that autosuggest not working

1607526
order	add
now whenever they want to add a new contact or customer or order etc

1607528
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
css error unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element gt

1607533
postgresql	mysql
my 2 cents stick with mysql or postgresql simple sql and try not to make any stored-procedures or use proprietary sql

1607538
profiling	debugging
if your code makes extensive use of templates you might be interested in templight a tool developed by a hungarian research team for debugging and profiling c++ templates metaprograms paper

1607541
any	set
that variables will be set .when the page loads and any javascript modifications to it will not be preserve in the session

1607546
authentication	login
but doing that will cause the current authentication module to execute its default unauthorized handler for forms-authentication this means redirecting to login page

1607551
json	xml
rest has the added benefit of allowing either xml or json is there any other major difference between the two

1607558
compression	streaming
to test it i am serializing a dataset to a memory streaming compression it and uncompression it and comparing the results

1607558
buffering	streaming
with a buffering of size 65536 the decompression streaming always returns one byte less than it was uncompressed

1607578
put	get
i use linq to query to get the results from the dataset and put them into another variables

1607589
order	join
the automatic id numbers in a primary key will often strongly influence the order of data in tables that join to the pk - you have to consider whether there is a good way around that

1607589
python	perl
at this points i d probably drop into perl but python or other scripting languages would do fine taking the difference recording for a table along with a table named and the column list .so that the field in the data can be as.sociated with columns in the database and then arrange for it to generator the appropriate statements

1607593
shutdown	exit
note that daemons threads will continue to run during the shutdown sequences as will non-daemons threads if shutdown was initiated by invoking the exit methods .

1607604
compression	streaming
my psychic powers tells me that you do in fact have a working decompression implementation but have forgotten to fflush the compression streaming before

1607612
subclassing	superclass
in python how do you make a subclassing from a superclass

1607621
crossover	mutation
i need to be able to test differing crossover methods and differing mutation methods to compare their results part of the paper i have to write for the course

1607638
compression	streaming
you should always call close on compression streaming

1607653
while-loop	loops
my while-loop is looking for the oldest date in the table to determine .when loops is completed

1607668
teamcity	nant	teamcity	ncover	code-coverage	ncover	ncover	nant
i personally use ncover in nant for my code-coverage report which integrated quite nicely with teamcity

1607683
value	field
do i have to explicit generator value for these field

1607755
json	xml
the problem is that the wcf service libs appears to be expecting xml and falls over .when it receives json

1607793
directory	folder
the default data location of mysql.data folder after creating 32 000 database on that location i want to change the data directory to other location

1607816
py2exe	exe
i ve never had a problem getting py2exe to put my icons right into the exe

1607824
filtering	grouping
it must come before the grouping by in the query and acts as a filtering before things are sum med which is how most of the answers here work

1607824
filtering	grouping
this can be used to filtering on the resulting properties of groupinging after grouping ing - for instances

1607830
perl	php
hi need to generator a vnc passwd using any scripting php preferably but any perl will do

1607832
value	field
or a different approach for validation one field compared to the value of another

1607839
duplicates	elements
using id for styling makes sense if it s an elements that doesn t have duplicates especially if it s something that show up in all most pages - richn

1607840
unsigned	short
also early versioning of the windows sdk didnt use wchar_t for wchar but unsigned short

1607840
32-bit	16-bit	unsigned	short
the windows sdk on gcc gets interesting as - im led to belive that gcc 32-bit has a 32-bit wchar_t - on compilers with 32-bit wchar_t wchar would be defined as an unsigned short or some other types thats 16-bit on that compiler

1607841
textbox	button
i need to be able to drag it .when click on some of the controls but not others - drag by labels but don t by button and textbox

1607872
linux	osx
linux and osx probably have an snmp daemons already running

1607880
windows-messages	spy++
use spy++ to analyse what controls are receiving what windows-messages you ll then know what you need to be capturing

1607887
javascript	dom
the difference is negligible but in applications with huge amounts of dom elements or intensive javascript application it makes a difference

1607943
centering	fixed
at that points i d like the content to lock into place and not continue to centering itself staying a fixed amount from the left edges

1607961
duplicates	elements
using id for styling makes sense if it s an elements that doesn t have duplicates especially if it s something that show up in all most pages

1607993
order	add
also you may want to add some more field to your order by

1607995
dictionary	map
what i would do is maintain these conditional variables in a dictionary or map or hashtable whatever your language call it

1608002
return-value	arguments
+3 with no spaces means positive 3 which gets passed to the today methods as an arguments while + 3 means plus three .so the return-value of the today methods gets added to 3

1608008
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1608042
double-quotes	spaces
also you seem to have spaces between the single and double-quotes which will make the query like this and state az which is probably not what you want

1608050
python	java
while i personally shared some of your doubts and would rather code javascript directly i have to admit that it is indeed an extremely practical as well as popular tool entirely production-ready i observe that internally many web apps that are rich and complex enough to warrant a front-end back-end split are more and more often ending up as a python back-end and a java front-end -- the latter specifically to allow gwt of course there are also plenty of python front-ends and plenty of python back-ends but i think this is a trend

1608060
revision	svn
is performing an svn log -q -v across all revision against the repository root and then filtering by the desired path really the best only

1608077
ruby-on-rails	django
if nobody knows ruby-on-rails or django you have to factors in the learning curve during the migration

1608080
revision	svn
as far as svn is concerned if the file in question does not exist in the current revision you would also need to specify a peg revision

1608080
revision	svn
also note that if the file has been deleted and subsequently resurrected without history connecting it to the older file which believe it or not i have seen this technique applied with good reason .when a deep refactoring or technology shift is applied the svn log will only show the changes associated with that particular peg revision

1608085
boolean	int
as some have pointed out this works fine because boolean are int a subclassing specifically

1608096
python	java
cross-platform apps would make you choose a platform-neutral language such as java or python as jldupont suggested

1608116
put	get
once you ve done that you can just put the following code after your dial statement has returned callduration execute_agi get variables answeredtime

1608133
required	checked
this required all usage of these methods to checked for null results or risk exposing a bug

1608146
.when	ready
the object that was supposed to be display in xtragrid was created in c++ layer the grid was display asynchronously with object-construction deconstruction that s why at the moment .when the grid was ready to display it the object itself didn t exist

1608172
openvz	xen
is there a way to export a openvz viewmodel from proxmox to xen

1608200
attributes	properties
i don t see any properties or attributes in parameterinfo and types that may help me distinguish this intptr instances as a function pointers -- are there any

1608202
jquery	.post
how do you use .post with jquery autocomplete

1608203
gethashcode	equals
surprisingly nobody advised to overrides equals and gethashcode

1608217
deployment	install
all the files are install by the deployment package into c documemts and settings all users application data provision manager this is too avoid windows-vista not allowing write access to the program files directory

1608229
revision	svn
i would like the ability to pass a specific revision to the svn task in ccnet-config that i want the building-server to checkout from svn and building

1608241
bazaar	git
take a look at bazaar git or mercurial already mentioned above

1608254
shuffle	unique
in your example choose 10 unique random numberss between 1 and 100 you could create a list with the numberss 1 to 100 use the random numbers generator to shuffle the list and then take the first 10 value from the list

1608265
reflection	runtime
3 sounds good but if by swapped out you mean using some fancy reflection to load the dll during runtime i m not sure if performance will become an issue

1608276
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
in addition to mysql postgresql and ms sql-server you might also want to look at derby aka ibm cloudscape aka javadb

1608280
.war	jar
i assume because you explicit say jar that your web-services are ejb endpoint and not jax-rpc servlet based web-services because those would be packaged in a .war

1608280
directory	folder
unlike servlets who are somewhat capable of finding files inside the project as long as you can express their location as an offset to the web folder you can determine theire real location with servletcontext s getrealpath ejb s don t have any automatic notion of directory

1608288
directory	folder
.so would there be a better way to grab the latest folder directory

1608296
http	ssl
it is possible to use iis or similar to handle the ssl side of http communication

1608302
callback	methods
rather than use this methods which generator a dynamic callback named because of this parameter

1608309
subtraction	addition	subtraction	time
many time libs already represent time as seconds since epoch .so this makes addition and subtraction of time trivial

1608322
exception-handling	try-catch
you can catch exception-handling with the usual try or try-catch functions

1608329
configuration	logging
the idea is that a logging subsystem should not throw exception-handling causing your application to crash simply because of a bug or configuration error within the logging subsystem

1608334
callback	methods
which should execute whatever methods you have defined in your callback

1608358
any	set
assuming you d like the specialized versioning to be picked for any integral types and not just int in particular one thing you could do is provide that as a template-function and use boost.enableif to remove those overloads from the available overload set if the operands is not an integral types

1608366
callback	methods
one can still specify an anonymous callback in the parameters of the .getscript methods which will be execute after the callback named in the request url parameters fixed_callback in this case

1608368
double	int
_bool is a keyword in c99 it specifies a types just like int or double

1608387
python	ruby	python	java
if you have a primarily java team and you want to completely move to ruby or python it s gonna be hard if not impossible

1608392
triggers	insert
i have a table that has a triggers associated with it for updates insert and delete

1608392
triggers	insert
depending on the stored procedure it will insert updates delete data in a table that has the triggers

1608413
directory	folder
a web install project gets the files from the deployed folder and creates a virtual directory on iis with all the needed files

1608422
value	field
the last and most badass option that we discussed was providing a eav table where rows are entity named field named field value

1608426
arrays	map
is there a way to perform the same function as the find all with map collect .so that it creates a new arrays that doesn t affect the original

1608432
directory	folder
the root directory copy will then appropriately link to that folder

1608442
python	perl	forth	lisp
it can be in python perl lisp forth or whatever

1608445
error-logging	logging
for deployment i d wrap your error-logging code into an assembly - your users then just need to reference the assembly and make a call setting the url of the logging service and passing the error details

1608456
variables	boolean
a member variables a boolean flag to represent whether you are drawing or not starting with not

1608456
click	mouse
the mouse click event to initializer a points and add it to your containers

1608458
sql-server	mysql
if you tell us what database platform you re using ms sql-server mysql etc. people may be able to provide more specific solutions

1608465
any	set
however even if i have exclusivetouch set to yes the moment the y value changes by any amount scolling starts even if i m in the middle of handling the touch-events

1608473
awk	ksh
i am starting an awk scripting from a shell scripting ksh if it matters like this

1608516
bazaar	git	version-control	bazaar	version-control	git
distribute version-control systemd mercurial bazaar git are nice in that they can be completely self-contained in a single directory .hg .bzr .git in the top of the working copy where subversion uses a separate repository directory in addition to .svn directory in every directory of your working copy

1608516
command-line	cmd
if you like the command-line easy git seems to be a bit nicer to use than the standards git cmd

1608516
revision	svn
you can use external see the chapter in the svn book but to associate versioning of a project with versioning of a libs you need to pin the libs revision in the external definition which is itself versioned as a properties of the directory

1608528
updatepanel	gridview
i have an updatepanel in a cell for each row within a gridview

1608554
value	field
even though it seems you are getting this value from selected elements someone might fake an http-request and .post whatever they want inside certain field

1608567
children	nodes
the only way you could achieve what you are asking is to pull all of the form tag s immediate children and append them to some other nodes in the dom to keep them from disappearing from the page

1608568
capacity	storage
data storage capacity you can checked this blog

1608584
defined	declare
you can defined an unconstrained types but you still have to initializer the size in the declare block before your program starts

1608594
getter	setter
getter and setter for the base properties of the object

1608611
keydown	keyup
i m working on a small program and i m having a problem where it seems that some of the controls on it inside groupbox are not triggers the keydown event on my form .when i press and release any arrow key just the keyup event

1608645
integrated-security	connection-string
don t know how but the connection-string for the data backend configuration database is defined using integrated-security which is a bad thing

1608649
subclassing	base-class
however you can constraint the types of t to be either a class reference value or struct value or subclassing of a certain base-class like .so

1608658
pygtk	pyqt
if you like the python language or it s very significant standard-library you can use the python binding pyqt or pygtk

1608658
chromium-embedded	chromium
it uses chromium s content module just like node-webkit and chromium-embedded framework and publishes it as a standalone .lib

1608658
communication	messages
one major difference from nodes-webkit is that instead of merging nodes s event-loop with chromium s event-loop atom-editor launchd them both in separate process and uses a mixture of sync and async interprocess messages to communication between them

1608660
contentcontrol	itemtemplate
instead of adding contentcontrol directly inside the combobox use a datatemplate itemtemplate or itemcontainerstyle

1608670
value	field
this simply compares the value of the field to test for equality

1608686
contains	any
it looks like on mouseup events they checked to see if any text is selected and if it is then they insert an invisible div contains the citation inside of the selection

1608692
key-value	key
this allows you to remove by the key-value instead of having to deal with the list not being indexed by the key

1608707
constructor	object
we put a messagebox in the constructor of our com object and the vb6 .app loads and pops the box but it crash as soon as it makes the first methods call on the object

1608714
value	field
named and age aren t validation before their value are set as field of person

1608722
declarative	imperative
ultimately you still need to put the rules that govern arguments value somewhere - it just a matter of deciding whether you prefer an imperative styles string.isnullorempty or a declarative one

1608738
digits	zero
i never store access digits the zero s double zero pluses etc. they don t belong to to the telephone numbers per se but are part of what i may call dialing rules

1608738
contains	lookup	country-codes	iso
it s also easy to prefill parts of the structure from country city lookup tables contains iso country-codes iata city codes and their corresponding prefixes

1608742
jquery-animate	setinterval
jquery-animate uses the javascript function setinterval to updates the obects every few milliseconds

1608744
databound	gridview
i have a gridview that is databound to an arrays of object with a ton of properties attached to them

1608744
hide	show
should i just bind all the data and then on the postback event for a tab press show and hide only the columns i need for that tab

1608748
bing-maps	arcgis
i haven t tried arcgis but used bing-maps and a silverlight component from thinkgeo leadsource google adgroup silverlight+general adtype search keyword silverlight+map gclid ciu976aw0z0cfz1h4wodwgsdsa

1608757
credentials	account
i have a .net client .app that intermittently loses connection to a unc shared where the user is either on a domain or has a local account with the same credentials on the server

1608825
environment	building
for information about how they suggest configuring your building environment see

1608828
primitive	int
namely it can convert from any primitive types to a int most notably parsing a string

1608836
updating	updates
.when updating my checked out directory with tortoisesvn some subfolders are listed as skipped even though i know there are updates

1608837
webforms	asp.net
but at my work we have worked only with asp.net webforms and we use stored-procedures only

1608837
ruby-on-rails	django
as most of the asp.net-mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails django have built-in orms is it any harm to use our own data-access-layer with asp.net-asp.net-mvc

1608839
assign	add
my first approach was to add a rectangle filled with the same dark color as the border immediately above the statusbar and to assign a border with rounded corners to its opacitymask similar to the solution proposed by chris cavanagh

1608858
xsd	xml
once i get the xml snippets defined above i was planning on using trang to generator the xsd

1608874
parentheses	operators
c# language-level casting uses parentheses - int - and conversion support for it is limited relying on implicit compatibility between the types or explicit defined instructions by the developer via conversion operators

1608886
hashmap	arrays
if your problem is that you need to move those items from the passed in hashmap to an arrays it s not going to get too much more efficient although you probably want to start with an arrays like this new string added_sugars_free_flag egg_free_flag ... and iterate over it .so you don t have all those duplicates line

1608886
hashmap	arrays
why are you storing them in an arrays couldn t you just copy the user hashmap in part or in whole

1608898
defined	declare
what you need to do is declare and defined it as

1608932
unsafe	out
right now today httputility.htmlencode may successfully block every attack out there simply by removing encoding and plus a few other known potentially unsafe characters but someone is always trying to think of new ways of breaking in

1608933
triggers	insert
if i ve understood your problem right you can put the triggers on insert to the bids table

1608934
typedef	struct
an alternative fix is to do typedef struct acct .

1608965
buffering	streaming
fflush is used to tell the streaming to write anything that it has in its write buffering to the underlying os file handle

1608972
administration	account
i add asp.net windows account to administration grouping but still this problem accures..

1608981
configuration	installation
i ve tried adding as a parameter to rake to force it to run in in the production-environment but got the same error there are two separate ruby-on-rails installation for the production and development versioning of the site and i ve set the development and production credentials in development s db configuration file to be identical

1609005
directory	folder
the e folder sounds like it is a mapped directory from another machine

1609009
amazon-web-services	amazon-s3
found this mentioned in this thread in the amazon-web-services discussion forums class-library for generator signed urls in amazon-s3

1609043
cvs	git
tools like cvs git clearcase subversion and .so on let you maintain a database of code and changes to it

1609068
arrays	loops
i d probably get the contents split on the newline character to create an arrays of strings one string per line then loops through the arrays outputting only the ones i wanted

delta	diff
monotone uses xdelta to only save the diff and zlib to compress the delta and the first versioning of each file for which of course there is no delta

1609182

if you have systemd configuration access don t over-do it and set up some iptables pf etc to load-balance connections across n daemons instances process as this will work out of the box

1609412
daemons	systemd
depending on how blocking the nature of the daemons n should be from the numbers of cores on the systemd or several time higher

1609412
daemons	systemd
if you don t have systemd access or ops can t be bothered you can use load balancer daemons there are plenty of open source ones instead of iptables pf etc and use also n service daemonss like above

1609412
external	root
if the external service needs to service on a low ports 1024 you only need the load balancer running privileged or admin root or kernel.

1609485
jax-ws	cxf
both metro and cxf are jax-ws compliant web service stack and from a runtime perspective there s very little pick between them

1609485
jax-ws	cxf
however cxf has vastly better documentation and much more flexibility and additional functionality if you re willing to go beyond the jax-ws specifications

1609513
duplicates	contains
an invocation list can contains duplicates methods

calloc	malloc
i have a strongly recursive function that creates a very small std guava locally for each function instances using new which recurses to malloc calloc in the std .lib

1609674
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
i would also add that this is not vulnerable to sql-injection whereas dynamic-sql relies on your whitelist blacklisting techniques to ensure it isn t vulnerable

1609675
exception-handling	try-catch
it would be inconvenient to wrap a try-catch block around each call to system.out.printingln sun decided to have printingstream and later printingwriter catch and eat any exception-handling throw inside a printing or printingln methods

1609677
callback	methods
.when an error occurs the handleerror methods will send back a viewresult which will be retrived in the callback in javascript

1609772
void	main
public static void main string arguments throw ioexception classnotfoundexception

1609789
delayed-job	worker
this is probably just as well since ruby-on-rails development reload is good but not perfect and attempting to auto-reload a delayed-job would potentially run into all sort subtle issues that would be pretty opaque to debugging inside a worker process

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 1 2 is 2 subtract a add d

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 2 3 is 2 subtract b add e

1609854
connection-pooling	pool
james alexander s answer is spot on you have to pool connections yourself but i figured i d .post a link to a blog entry that discusses an implementation that adds connection-pooling on top of clientbase

1609860
initializer	getter
it sounds like you re trying to use lazy-evaluation - just make the getter lazily initializer the information from the db

1609868
linux	bsd	linux	unix	unix	bsd
and something like c#+monodevelop or equally a scripting-language like perl and glade gtk on linux bsd other unix s while on mac os then xcode and interface-builder are the obvious choice

1609869
python	java
the user is entering a python scripting in a java gui python-editor and can run it from the editor

1609871
execution	exit
you also need to call exit after your header or scripting execution will not stop and the cookies will be sete

1609878
any	set
in my configuration i see cp1252 probably set after my os current setup and have no problem with any french character

1609885
selected	button
3 user selected que back button

1609903
vb.net	vb6
if you have the source code for the original component apparently vbmigration partner can upgrade a vb6 com component to a vb.net component that has binary-compatibility with the original vb6 component

1609913
silverlight	wpf
even now i would imagine that the bulk of the lob apps written with silverlight or wpf will use default colors and styles for exactly the same reasons

1609914
vb.net	vb6
apparently vbmigration partner can automatically upgrade a vb6 com component to a vb.net component that has binary-compatibility with the original vb6 component

1609916
order	join
you order the data once and join once

1609931
jsonp	ajax
working example thanks go to jquery ajax jsonp ignore a timeout and doesn #39

1609939
any	set
the problem is that the store set methods are all public .so any other class can overwrite this data and break the whole application

1609939
contains	set
what is a good way for me to protect the data make the set store methods invisible to all object except for those contains with the executable itself

1609939
defined	declare
right now i m toying with an interface that defined only the public getter and then having a singleton class implements that interface and then the instances properties will return the interface types .so they will only be able to use the get methods declare in the interface

1609945
comma	words
now consists of multiple french words in this case and the ellipsis gets added right before the comma and behind the closing quote

1609959
put	get
.when you get to the part where you re setting the text you can take out the reference to this.text and put in your own string

1609967

you can use a triggers which on insert checked if the insert value is datetime.minvalue 01.01.0001 and replace it with the calculated value you desire

1609989
32-bit	64bit
32-bit systemd won t prevent you from reading 64bit as a binary value

1609994
switching	router
note that your switching router isp s swithcgear..

1609994
udp	rtp
take a look at rtp which runs over udp for a more network -survivable approach

1609996
compact-framework	.net
however the performancecounter class is not include in the .net compact-framework 3.5

1610013
value	field
normally i d go through in my code adding tons of if-statement checked for empty field and setting value to 0 if .so

1610013
default-value	arguments
the default-value on the input is 0 but if the user deletes one of those 0 s leaving the field empty then submit the form an exception-handling will be throw at convert.todecimal moneyfield.text in the arguments list of the methods that submit all this to the database

1610026
order	add
you can tweak a bit the classloader see filtering and loading order but there is nothing allowing to add dependencies at the application level a la oas

1610029
getter	setter
i have always preferred to just use function-overloading to give you the same named for both getter and setter

1610034
temporary	copy
process #3 also wait for process #2 to release its mutex and then removes the temporary copy of the exe - the one that was used by process #2

1610037
value	field
it seems unusual that you would have that many field that are truly nullable but if you need to describe no value separately to any magic domain value of for example an int then yes may help

1610062
for-loop	arrays
the following for-loop creates the inner arrays which are of types int using the jni function newintarray

1610069
webforms	asp.net
asp.net 4.0 webforms are going to make using jquery much easier in the past because you will have more control of how controls get named .when they are rendering to html

1610076
getter	setter
while ed s comment is true i do prefer actual properties over the setter getter anti-patterns

1610081
double	int
that way it d be easier to see that it was in fact a double and not an int i guess

1610082
contains	any
if a nib file contains the table view is loaded the datasource and delegation become those object defined in the nib file if any

1610088
getter	setter
more recently a doubt began to make its way because that makes taking the address of a getter or setter ambiguous

1610092
udp	tcp
however note that tcp provides guarantee of delivery and order whereas udp provides none

1610095
processor	cpu
on the pc you have a nice processor register that gives you easy cheap access to the cpu usage

1610100
ubuntu	linux
i m under the impression that you d sudo install gem because if you as user bob install the gem inside bob s directory then a user like www-data used by passenger apache on ubuntu linux .when serving files to use them - is this the only reason you d use them like this

1610121
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this page works in ie google-chrome and firefox but not in safari or opera

1610125
getter	setter
personally i think getter and setter found in pairs are a code-smell carried over from visual languages and their properties

1610125
getter	setter
i think the most common cause of getter and setter is not carrying the object-model deep enough

1610125
put	get
etc. it just seems there wasn t enough thought put into how the class should be used and rather the author made the class easy to get at the data .so he wouldn t have to consider how the class should be used

1610126
average	minimum
therefore the startup cost is negligible and what you want to measure and optimize for is request throughput given a minimum average response time

1610138
ref	out
as most other answers have pointed out if you want to pass in an initializer object ref is the stronger choice

1610140
32-bit	64bit
otherwise - .when running your application as a 32-bit process on a 64bit windows platform - you will get an setupapi error inwow64 error_in_wow64

1610153
getter	setter
from my understanding it is a shortcut for having to write each member s getter and setter

1610155
directory	folder
all files are loaded in to a directory with in the application folder of the project layout

1610164
versioning	upgrade
i did something similar to upgrade to a newer versioning of the jasper report libs in the jasper-plugin and it worked for me

1610180
getter	setter
second yes adding magic setter and getter is like adding setter and getter

1610183
instances	private
arguably in this instances the generator of private methods could be view as a good practice forcing the developer to explicit raise the visibility level of said methods with the adequate javadoc saying why this methods could be subclassing or is even a public one

1610231
contains	set
on the website it exposes all set value in an arrays contains 5 value session_id ip user_agent last_activity and userid

1610233
updating	updates
you are only updating data rdbms i assume mysql doesn t caching updates queries

1610253
compact-framework	.net
however it is not compatible with the .net compact-framework

1610296
callback	methods
i would have your main thread pass a callback methods to your first thread and .when it s done it will invoke the callback methods on the mainthread which can launchd the second thread

1610311
getter	setter
as a matter of fact here is where the getter and setter practice originated

1610311
getter	setter
.so the magic getter and setter in php can be useful on many circumstances

1610311
getter	setter
now if you want to keep private variables and still use magic getter and setter

1610334
oledbdatareader	oledb
oledb s jet drivers locks flat files while there s an open oledbdatareader to them

1610337
windows-xp	windows
both on windows-xp and on windows 7

1610347

1610374
postgresql	mysql
use mysql or postgresql for production if they aren t

1610383
arrays	loops
i ve two for loops that basically lookup in two different arrayss each having a size around 2-4k at peak and set a value in a 3rd arrays based on these value

1610383
difference	factors
for some weird reason there is a factors two difference between the performance of this piece of code depending on in which order i put the two for loops

1610385
python	php	python	java
it has implementation in javascript python php and java

1610387
windows-xp	windows
don t know if this still works on windows 7 but it does in windows-xp

1610400
arrays	loops
that s how things are actually arranged on disk as far as the computer is concerned. .so .when creating multi-dimension arrayss .when you change loops order you change how the arrays is traversal

1610406
arrays	loops
linear data-structures locality often occurs because code contains loops that tend to reference arrays or other data-structures by indic

1610415
arrays	loops
fastest way to loops through a 2d arrays

1610436
internet-explorer	firefox
to me it looks like the issue is probably related to the fact that internet-explorer aggressively caching things it shouldn t and firefox caching only things it has to

1610440
lgpl	gpl
there are some libs which do this google for minibidi which is bsd licensed imho or fribidi which is gpl or lgpl

1610454

on one particular systemd with one particular compiler the return-value is the result-of last expression evaluation stored in the eax register of that systemd s processor

1610475
httpd.conf	.htaccess
apache configuration in httpd.conf or .htaccess

1610500
python	perl
if you want to map variabless arbitrarily then you either need to deal with the whole environment instead of the fixed list of variables named use the output from env appropriately edited or use perl or python instead

1610500
value	field
note that if the value of an environment variables contains a slash in your versioning you d run into problems using the slash as the field separator in the s notation

1610534
jquery	.post
this looks similar though obviously not identical to the issue .posted here jquery syntax-error on .post in opera

1610538
sql-server	oracle
for example if we use an in-memory solution like sqlite all of our specifications may pass at development time but may actually fail once we deploy to production because of 1 difference in how each nhibernate data provider is implements and 2 difference in how each product sqlite vs ms ms sql-server vs oracle implements data types t-sql etc

1610544
nested	order
but to put them in the right order would i just have a nested loops to reverse the grouping of value

1610556
interpreter	runtime
to put for the obvious and broad points compiled languages tend to have higher performance than interpreter ones since compiling precludes the need for a runtime interpreter

1610560
selected	button
and then i tried it on my own i created a styles created a templates simply selected a button - but i cannot make those default styless like mouseover pressed etc

1610613
32-bit	64bit
i ve been working on a project where i need to transfer large volumes of binary-data some are struct enums lists etc and some are pure binary-data i m trying to develop a strategy for dealing with the issues .when transferring the data between a 64bit compile and a 32-bit compile

1610613
32-bit	64bit
presently i mark the assembly to just target 32-bit to avoid the issue but i want to open up and use the 64bit 32-bit by targetting any

1610620
compact-framework	.net
if you go with the normals edition of windows-mobile 5 and .net compact-framework 2.0 there s every likelihood that your application would work with mono which means it would work on the iphone in addition to any winmo 5+ device

1610622
data-access	massive
for example say you are developing a massive data-access package for a bank that must implements database access and caching

1610622
subclassing	inherited
protected methods in the data-access assembly with subclassing in the caching assembly could get around some cases but often time it s an abuse of inherited

1610638
scalability	saas
it is simply a question of the cost-efficiency and scalability of a production-environment for a saas .app inorder to regularly report back to the development department on their most memory hogging pages to return that memory pressure where it belongs .so to speak

1610652
administration	account
i am attempting to install from an administration account on both machines and the msi itself execute as expected

1610664
postgresql	mysql
the established player in the free rbdms arena are mysql and postgresql

1610668
exception-handling	try-catch
cons does not look cool adds noticeable try-catch clatter - practically around every insert and push_back up to the extent of writing exception-handling safe wrapper around stl containers there are opinions that there is runtime performance penalty for try blocks and there are opinions that there is no penalty at all

1610690
contains	elements
the only real way to do this is to insert a scripting elements into the document dynamically using javascripting with a link to a scripting file contains your function causing the scripting to be loaded

1610696
checkbox	textbox
the text for the checkbox show fine but the textbox labels does not

1610698
hide	show
click to show or hide the elements as

1610720
exception-handling	error-handling
but if the code is a hacked together mess it will be easier to catch your exception-handling low and rely on existing error-handling

1610737
exception-handling	error-handling
else chaining can be not very readable - especially .so .when dealing with .some external api that s written to return error codes rather than throw exception-handling on failures say win32 api or .some com component .so you really need that error-handling code

1610745
.when	ready
inversion-of-control inject the dependency bar into foo .so that .when you get a foo object from the context you know it s ready to use

1610746
arrays	loops
we will loops over our arrays .so we only have to write it once

1610747

1614816
svnadmin	dump
you can do this using svnadmin dump then manually editing the dump file and svnadmin load it again but itâ s not recommended to do this because itâ s error-prone and somewhat defeats the purpose of version-control

1614870
jax-ws	cxf
i don t have cxf specific knowledge but the jax-ws way to add the xml-declaration seems to be to make a handler and use soapmessage.setproperty to turn that feature on

1614871
scheme	lisp
many people feel that structure and interpretation of computer programs which uses the scheme dialect of lisp is a book that should be on every programmers shelf

1614872
getter	setter
and you might take it even further by defining even smaller methods -- getter setter and .so forth

1614877
svnadmin	dump
what you can easily do is drop files and paths from a repository with a svnadmin dump coupled with a svndumpfilter

1614882
common-lisp	scheme
i ll stick to common-lisp here though scheme is also a superb language that has a lot to recommend it

1614882
common-lisp	lisp
in common-lisp you have a largish multi-paradigm language that provides some things that either don t exist widely outside the lisp family of languages or are limited to cl and even more obscure niche languages

c-preprocessor	macros
i say real because the systemd is much more complete flexible and reliable than say c-preprocessor macros

it s width will change between 0 and 100 and background-color will change based on the classes denoted in the scripting

1614896
puts	gets

1614978
common-lisp	scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme	lisp
the general lisp idea is the same for common-lisp or scheme or emacs lisp or clojure but the specifics will be different - .so keep that in mind if reading graham s book which focuses mostly on common-lisp with .some mentions of scheme specifics. on lisp is probably not the best beginner book but it s worth going through it and just skimming over specifics you re not ready to follow in detail yet to see what is there particularly with regard to macros which on lisp really explores

you most likely added the reference from the gac global-assembly-cache

1615216

1615218
value	field
if you make the field non-final or assign a non-compile time constants the value is not inline

1615235

temporary	copy
otherwise a temporary of types â œcv1 t1â is created and initializer from the initializer expression using the rules for a non-reference copy initialization 8.5

1615812
temporary	copy
i was previously thinking of the possibility of having to copy the temporary but that s not the source of the problem

1615812
temporary	copy
to create the temporary using non-reference copy initialization as specified in â 8.5 it needs the copy ctor

1615812
temporary	copy
it s required to create a temporary then copy the temporary to the object being initializer which in this case is also a temporary

1616127
any	set
i ve confirmed that the registry value are indeed set although i m not 100 sure how to handle the msxml2 registry key since it doesn t have any real value only a default-value

1616132
margins	padding
you can use styles on each treeviewitem to set the margins and padding to avoid the empty spaces

1616136
classname	inherited
and you re exactly right they ll inherited the styles assign to the elements types but id classname variables will take precedence if they are set

1616181
button	popup
i was wondering if there is a jquery animation that can be applied to a popup windows .when a button is pressed

1616197
updating	updates
my initial thought was to add a timestamp to each row and have my application remember the time it last got an updates however i am worried of the server clock changing backwards .when going from summer to winter time or a client updating while a transactional is in progress on the server - example

1616217
contains	set
i have an interface libs that i wrote in c++ and it contains the socket communication and interface protocols to set get parameters in my application

software transactionalal-memory stm aka optimistic-concurrency where a transactional is rollback during a commit if it discovers that shared state has changed and the transactional can later be retried

1616280
python	java
google-app-engine java - allows you to write java or python applications that will be distribute amongst cloud servers where you distribute what server handles a transactional and you use bigtable to store your persistent data not sure how you transactionalal that access shared data or handle lock contentions to be able to scale effectively

1616291
triggers	insert
since there is no native change-data-capture in mysql you can implements insert and updates and delete triggers to capture what you need in an audit table and pull the data from there

1616303
children	nodes	contains	elements

what is the best way to visit all the nodess of a linked tree all nodess have references to parent and all children root nodess have null as parent .so that no nodes is visited before any of its ancestry

1616348
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i get the utility .when used with nsmutablestring i just didn t see the utility with the nsstring class

1616350
user-controls	treeview
i have a panels which is hosting a treeview and a user-controls

1616352
children	nodes
building up a list of nodess at the root level 0 iterate over each nodes in turn and look for direct children whose parent nodes is the nodes we are currently looking from level 1 .when finished with level 0 move on to iterator level 1 and .so on until you have no remaining unvisited nodess

1616357
children	nodes
then in a loops pull a nodes out of the set visit it then put its children in the set

1616367
children	nodes	children	tree	traversal	parent
if you start at the root nodes and only visit the parent children of nodess you have already visited there is no way to traversal the tree such that you visit a nodes before visiting its ancestry

1616374

1616406
processor	cpu
because the sleep is basically telling the processor to switching contexts and let some other programs get more cpu time

1616409
required	checked
since 1 ms is far greater than the amount of time required to checked true and the processor knows it can do other things during this wait you free up a lot of power

1616423
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also if you have a pointers to an nsstring it may actually be a subclassing of nsstring like nsmutablestring

1616429
nsmutablestring	nsstring

during your fetch results loops i would create an arrays or an object based on blog id

1617900
contains	elements
each elements of that arrays would contains all the common field of the blog entry plus an additional arrays to store all the comments

1617900
arrays	loops
now during your presentation loops you iterate through your arrays to get the blog post .so functions such as count will al.so give you the numbers of blog entries and .when you display each entry you just iterate through the comments elements

first broadcasting over the subnet ip-address with a icmp ping request

1617988
hide	show
i had to use javascript to hide the dropdownlistfor s and .when the user hover out of the menu i ll show the dropdownlistfor s again

1617989
processor	cpu
i wonder if your fundamental problem is simply that your worker threads are very cpu intensive and hence rarely reach a points where they would naturally let go of the processor for example by doing some io or sleeping. if such is the case then you might include some call to yield in those worker hence giving other threads more of a chance

1618013
value	field
ig you are not sure if the field is available a simple test will be sufficiant if the list contains the value

1618014

1618023
eager-loading	eager
include is a hint to eager load it does not force eager-loading

1618024

1618025
cvs	git	tortoisegit	svn
this is the first time im trying to use github and i just install tortoisegit im used to svn and cvs where you could just take a folder you wanted to checkout but it seems git only got a .git file in the root folder .so im not sure what to do

python	c++	linux	unix	.when	ready
i found python worked well as my first language as i m more interested in network and web programming on linux unix platform but for someone mainly interested in windows game programming i was thinking c# might be a better choice as he could learn using visual c# express edition and xna then switching over to visual-c++ .when he s ready to start learning c++ and therefore already be in a familiar environment

1618076
scala	java
a feature i am interested in for my programming language a simple object-oriented programming similar to java scala actionscript and c# are generator-expression

1618076
scala	java

1618096
python	c++
panda3d c++ and python

1618096
python	c++
crystalspace c++ and python

1618096
python	c++
if you do not want any of those engines there are still very good libs like qt for c++ that allows scripting - though not directly python you would have to embed it yourself - and others for c# but the listing could get quite lengthy

1618109
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit os would give you more address spaces even for a 32-bit process

1618113
webrequest	webclient
also consider using webclient instead of webrequest - it does make it incredibly easy .when you don t need to do anything sophisticated

1618118

i wished we would have some kind of a subroutine in vb6 were i can input the mysql sql query and get a string out contains the appropriate postgresql query

1618200
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	quirks-mode
only internet-explorer and opera in quirks-mode support colouring browser scrollbar .so you ll need to try a javascript .solution

to my knowledge if the elements is set to true and any of the specified checked fails then cobertura will cause the building to fail which is what you re asking for

1618218
ubuntu	linux
to run multiple lamp servers on ubuntu i use xampp for linux and bitnami lamp stack

stderr	stdout
i have this executable that queries a remote-server for a cmd execute it on the local machine and returns the stdout and also possibly stderr from it back to the server

1618238
command-line	cmd
this executable runs just fine if called from the command-line as root but i found it s failing for some cmd .when execute automatically by the crontab

1618276
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe that there s any silver bullet tool that would convert all of your queries from being mysql to postgresql compatible

1618290
protected	public
you will only have access to public and protected classes and methods however unit-testing usually only tests public apis

1618290
contains	any
test project usually contains one static-class init methodss one static-class teardown methods one non-static init methods for all tests one non-static teardown methods for all tests and one non-static methods per test + any other methodss you add

1618295
command-line	cmd
this executable runs just fine if called from the command-line as root but i found it s failing for some cmd .when execute automatically by the crontab

1618304
void	main
i have a simple - void methods declare in my uiview class files how can i access it from my main applications class files

1618307
firefox	gecko
gecko is the engine that s used in firefox

1618321
key-value	key
you could also use key-value observing watching a key representing the playstate of the movie

1618323

the .net-standard from microsoft is to use pascal case for namespaces public and protected members basically anything visible to other classes

1618326
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
the mono project has a .net webbrowser that allows you to use either the gecko firefox or webkit google-chrome safari rendering engines under the hood exposing either as a clean well-designed .net api

1618337
textmate	vim
recently i ve been trying my hand at using vim instead of textmate and one of the features that i ve missed most in vim is textmate s jump to methods function cmd + shift + t for those who don t know

1618367
order	add
and you can still call the same validation in the add methods thereby doing the necessary validation before you add the order

1618367
order	add
you would allow the user to add a new product only if the previous order was valid

1618374
wxwidgets	mfc
i can t really comment on wxwidgets but wpf is vastly superior to mfc and good old win32 api

1618382
textmate	vim
i d love to hear good suggestions as i use vim all the time but haven t used textmate

1618382
python	ruby
.so to go to function foo in python or ruby and within the same file of course i types def fo and i m there

1618384
stateless	stateful
convert your componentx to ejb adding stateless or stateful and an interface local or remote in this way the as will notice componentx is an ejb and will know what to do with the desired injection

1618402
attributes	properties
if i don t find such a properties put the attributes named and value into a hashtable

1618425
defined	declare
defined methods used by asp.net server controls to provide programmatic access to any attributes declare in the opening tag of a server control

1618435
search-engine	serp
i can suggest you that you should have also to map by rewriterule with a 301 redirect all the old urls inorder to allow people that are coming from a search-engine serp to be redirected to the right new url of the content

1618442
decrement	increment
one words s letters increment the value and the other would decrement

1618450
value	field
now the field will show as subject standards value

1618469
oracle	mysql
future of mysql is also not very clear as it was bought by sun which was bought by oracle which has monopoly issues to resolve

1618484
environment	restart
try setting the environment variables rails_env development and restart webrick

1618485
conditional	operators
if the entire purpose is to assign a different value to some variables based upon the state of various conditional i use a ternery operators

1618485
variables	boolean
and the conditional are complex simplify by creating temporary boolean variables to hold the true false value of the complex boolean expression

1618485
variables	boolean
then use the boolean variables in the if else synatx instead of the complex boolean expression

1618493
variables	boolean
i am trying to assign two different strings to two different variables dependent on two boolean in ant

1618503
.when	ready
if i where to building a static-class that took a managedobjectcontext and returned me what i needed i would still have to pass the managedobjectcontext around to every view and it wouldn t be asynchronously like .when i implements delegation methods that just gets called .when a result is ready

1618528
contains	any
but if the instances of my custom control doesn t contains any controls will this still get called

1618532
required	checked
the quickest and dirtiest way to fix for these required elementss would be to add a checked for whether the input elements existed

1618532
required	checked
a little better would be to output the required elements and then do the checked inside

1618562
subtract	time
the basic premise is that i m getting the duration of time between the first and last session of the target courseid and then i m subtract the duration of any sessions that were not of the specified courseid but where the session request time fell within the min and max request time of the targeted courseid

1618563
ruby	php
in the first case a skilled php developer ideally with at least some ruby knowledge should be able to convert this to php fairly easily

1618563
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
perhaps you can convert this .app to a php based asp.net-mvc framework like cakephp but again you d need an experienced php developer to do this and in this case i think this would be a difficult task if they aren t also fairly familiar with ruby-on-rails

1618565
textbox	button
i need a white-box with a gray border to appear below this textbox .when the button is click

1618566
contains	any
if the map does not contains any object associated with the key the operators insert a new object into the map using the default-constructor

1618572
configuration	environment
in your case from what i can see you are accessing the ejb from weblogic .so i d rather use the no-arg initialcontext constructor and use a jndi.properties configuration file for other environment but this is just a side note

1618589
continuous-integration	teamcity
but this issue could also be solved via a continuous-integration server like teamcity that allows to create private building

1618597
versioning	upgrade
i only have scripting that upgrade from versioning to versioning

1618597
versioning	upgrade
for each versioning there is an application function that upgrade to the next versioning

1618597
versioning	upgrade
i have a backup of the previous versioning i apply the upgrade scripting then i can revert to the previous versioning change the scripting try again until i m happy with the result

1618597
versioning	upgrade
.when they upgrade my application supports upgrade from any previous versioning

1618597
versioning	upgrade
.so at versioning 5.1 the default was foo in 5.2 the default is bar and that is the only difference between the two versioninging and the upgrade step is simply an updates statement followed of course by the versioning metadata change ie

1618597
versioning	upgrade
to repro a customer complaint simply by running the upgrade sequences and stopping at the versioning i m interested in

1618597
versioning	upgrade
because the latest versioning of foo might have been upgrade 2 or 3 versioninging ago and it wasn t changed since i need to look at the upgrade scripting for that versioning

1618599
mantis	trac
you can import your mantis bugs into trac with mantis2trac

1618620
value	field
instead i d send an id of the field which has changed and its current value

1618621
udp	tcp
essentially you d have to building some overhead on top of udp to checked what packetss have been received tagging each packets with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.

1618622
udp	tcp
once you ve decided which one to use you can write a server process the console application that listen to a specific ports tcp or udp ports depending on what you ve chosen that will serve your client process the asp.net application

1618627
webrequest	webclient
tech articles and resources describing using webclient or webrequest

1618632
directory	folder
generally all tests are in the same project but under a different directory folder

1618633
any	set
any class that derives it will be able to set it

1618641
hash	md5
.when debugging compilation is set .net uses an md5 hash for some internal bookkeeping

1618643
xlib	x11
i m tries to write my own windows manager in working with xlib x11

1618646
gethashcode	equals
you need to ensure that all your object that are used as key have a good gethashcode implementation and should likely overrides equals

1618648
protected	public
that way your tests have access to public protected and even package-private members of the class under test which is often useful to have

1618664
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
this work fine for firefox safari but not working with internet-explorer 7

1618666
g++	gcc
generally you can link directly with gcc or g++ and don t need gld

1618669
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
does it work in ie8 or ie6 or even opera safari google-chrome

1618670
object-reference	instances
im sure i have seen object-reference not set to an instances of object in my exception-handling list and the program continue

1618671
cross-compiling	binutils
macports does include several ports of binutils for cross-compiling

1618681
performance-testing	benchmarking
that s why it is important to not do performance-testing in unrealistic benchmarking scenarios

1618685
any	set
as a consequence i need an algorithm that will help me find all possible partition of a set in any order

1618687
nsdata	nsurl
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing

1618691
directory	folder
you don t actually need a readme it s just for illustrative purpose for what kind of things sit in the root directory of your project s folder

1618706
web-config	app-config
how do i enable reading from web-config or app-config while the pex explorations execute

1618720
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval takes the same arguments as settimeout but it execute the function every n milliseconds as specified

1618758
linux	unix
this is a linux unix thing only as far as i know.

1618776
environment	building
i m building a winforms application where i ll need it to work locally just like ms-word saving and opening files from the filesystems and also in a multi-user environment communication with a server in the network via tcp-ip

1618776
.net	wcf
another maybe unrelated question is can i hosts and consume a wcf service in the same windows forms executable if i m tagetting the .net client .profile installation

1618787
selected	button
if you hit enter or the go button it puts remote search results in a drop-down for you to selected each item has an image and some text

1618787
jquery-plugins	jquery
i ve been wandering around looking at jquery-plugins jquery user-interface jquery combobox etc

1618790
contains	set
other methods or the contains class are not able to read the variables or even know it exists .so you have to set the class variables using the prefix

1618814
binary-compatibility	standard-library
one reasonable reason versus unreasonable reasons like i don t want to learn the standard-library is that some libs wish to retain control over the binary layout inorder to achieve certain kinds of interoperability such as binary-compatibility across versioning

1618815
base-class	inherited
in addition in some cases people want to inherited from a single base-class which std string wouldn t do

1618816
implements	extends
coming from mootools and java mootools class implementation is a real nice way to structure my code plus i can have .some nice features like extends implements and .so on

1618822
registration	login
for instances i have a scripting that draw the login form the registration form a scripting that allows for mp3 upload and another that does the mp3 serving

1618834
unicode	wstring
even with std wstring you only get a containers for unicode code points but would still have to implements the unicode-aware functionality

1618847
controllers	routes
if you want to follow the rest model you controllers should be called sessions and your signup action should be new .so in your routes you could do

1618855
slideshow	loading
i m having problems implements google slideshow to my web application by loading it using a jquery-load function

1618860
controllers	routes
will create the standards routes for your account controllers as well as add the new route account signup

1618865
parentheses	operators
because the operators is right associativity without parentheses means the same as which is obviously wrong

1618866
configurable-product	product
the reason a configurable-product relies on child simple product is to keep tracking of inventory--the simple product is the physical shippable unit crew neck shirt-red-small and the configurable-product as you know is a meta product that grouping all of the crew neck shirt-some color-some size combinations together

1618895
any	set
after years of programming we all have a set of small functions used as helpers utilities that we wish it comes built-in .so we can use it in any project and have ti taken care by more people test and optimized

1618900
.net	wcf
according to this page on the .net client .profile pretty much all of wcf should be supported on the client .profile

1618900
.net	wcf
wcf features supported by the .net

1618904
binary-tree	linked-list
since you are using a linked-list if you can do a binary-tree then a binary sort esp if you can sort while insert would be your best bet

1618906
quicksort	mergesort
one can implements a versioning of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implements and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

1618927
build-system	cmake
i m building a file using the cmake build-system and microsoft s visual-c++ compiler

1618932
udp	tcp
udp unlike tcp is not a reliable protocols

1618933
python	c++	python	java
basically i need c++ java python environment

1618945
put	get
make sure your application has access to or get the document from there put it somewhere where your application can access it add change the path in the document accordingly

1618959
benchmarking	profiling
full of compilers interpreter profiling debuggers ides editor benchmarking checked-out code from repo development versioning of systemd libs test suites generator large test files backup tools virtual machines chroots music to set-up comfort environment mail office suite to do the paperwork

1618959
virtual-machine	virtualbox
i mean install putty and connect to your machine a or do all development on virtual-machine b that is kept on external hard-drive that s what i did .when i needed this .so you can use it everywhere where virtualbox can run

1618959
gentoo	linux
as for linuxes i personally would like to use gentoo linux as it can be customized to be lightweight

1618959
virtual-machine	virtualbox
and by the way boot speed is irrelevant on virtualbox since you can save virtual-machine state entirely on hard-drive and restore it within seconds

1618988
getter	setter
if on the other hand a methods must return some data which is unique to a particular instances of an object like most getter and setter methodss then it can t be static

1618991
implements	extends
for example the text functions you show can be refactored to a class or set of classes that extends or implements classes and interfaces from the collections framework

1619010
stderr	stdout
stdin stdout stderr will not be a tty .so .some programs will behave differently because of this stdout and err will probably be a temp file

1619020
wait	hang
i could wait periodically once in my main loops but i need to know which process are zombie .so my father process doesn t hang while waiting for children that are not going to end .soon

1619029
value	field
the extra field and the value they should contains will actually be available in a dictionary

1619058
children	tree
this makes it very efficient fast to insert and reorder any aspects of the tree for example if i want to move red and all it s children to the cars directory

1619069
updating	updates
it is very common to have multiple sites terminals updating a specific database row recording at the same time .so you have to be ab.solutely bulletproof in your row recording locking and updates procedure or you will lose both money and customers

1619084
sequences	unique
.some language barrier here but i am going to guess what you are asking is that a code execution path sequences of instructions starts with a unique reference to it s dataset - thus a unique reference means exactly that - .so we just re-read the definition of that in a standards dictionary

1619146
sftp	ssh
sftp path seems irrelevant to ssh path

1619160
sql-server	mysql
jeff atwood is talking about sql-server not mysql

1619201
linux	unix
also backuppc is open source but required linux unix on the server

1619202
arrays	loops
the dry fan in me tends towards solution b but then i m creating an arrays on every loops just for the purpose of extraction one object

1619219

1619492
keyboard	mouse	contains	any
there appears to be a delay up to several seconds occasionally between any mouse or keyboard event occurring and the jvm picking it up - initially i thought it may be the event-dispatch-thread not getting enough time despite the frame-rate sleep - i tested this by adding a custom event contains a frame token and waiting for it on frame end but it fires .when expected - it should only do .so after all other prior events have fired which suggests to me it s an x-windows-to-jdk problem as opposed to one internally within the jdk

however the more recent memory-model which took effect as of java 5 makes this impossible at least for final field all assignments within a constructor happens-before any assignment of the reference to the new object to a variables

1621465
python	php
the solution is to fflush the output buffering at selected points in the scripting s execution - i ve only ever done this in php via fflush but this looks like the python equivalent

the most popular in python is beautifulsoup and indeed lxml comes with it -- with lxml 2.0.3 or later you can use beautifulsoup as the underlying parsing then proceed just as if the document had parsing correctly -- but i find it simpler to use beautifulsoup directly

1621730
beautifulsoup	lxml
the logic in lxml or beautifulsoup in lxml clothing is not very different just the spelling and capitalization of the various navigation operations changes a bit

the compiler will automatically widen storage to a full proces.sor words .so even if you only declare 16-bit it likely takes 32-bit on stack

1622127
contains	any
to solve this you need to make your regex more specific as in telling the engine that term should not contains any quotes

1622135
standard-library	boost
as long as you stick with cross-platform libs the c++ standard-library the boost c++ libs and the qt-creator instead of using platform-specific call the win32 api and also assuming you use a cross-platform build-systemd cmake instead of a platform-specific systemd visual-studio then it won t matter

another advantage of this is that you can read the streaming into a single buffering and then create an arrays of s to points to the individual strings and each string will be correctly 0 -terminated without you having to change anything in the buffering manually

1622159
low-level	hardware
it basically taught me a chunks of low-level operations hardware i o etc

1622163
compatibility	legacy
stick to html5 which has much better compatibility with legacy uas

getter	setter
having read this question on generator getter and setter in visual-studio and tried somewhat the techniques describe i have failed miserably to graduate beyond the longhand way of writing getter and setter

1622298
getter	setter
while i recognize the conceptual advantage of encapsulation private-members of a class in this case writing 25 getter and setter is a waste of spaces and my time

1622315
managed-code	c++-cli

1622330
value	field
how could i go about adding a new link button to the foreign key field templates that would open a new windows make a panels visible where you can add the sought value and then refresh the drop-down

1622389
updating	updates
my question regards the instead of updates triggers updating the primary key column tx_station_id and updatess to multiple rows

1622389
triggers	insert
inside the triggers block is there any way to join the insert and deleted psuedo tables .so that i know the before updates primary key and the after updates primary key

1622389
triggers	insert
at this stage i ve put a checked in the triggers block that rollback the updates if the primary key column is updatess and there is more than one row in the insert or deleted table

1622480
benchmarking	profiling
profiling give the best benchmarking since they diagnose all your code however they slow it down a lot

1622488
32-bit	64bit
the fastest and simplest way to runs tomcat at a 64bit windows environment is installing the 32-bit jdk

1622531
.when	ready
.when i was ready to move to production i d just run all the pending migrations against the production server and i d be ready to go

1622551
constructor	object
i think the idiomatic way is to throw an exception-handling from the constructor to emphasize that the object is not in a valid state

1622552
linux	bsd	netbsd	bsd	netbsd	linux
you might try looking at linux netbsd or other bsd source code for an example but it won t be easy to read

the reason is that by using an exception-handling you prevent the constructor of the object from ever thinking the object is valid

1622578
soappy	suds
actually by just changing the libs from suds to soappy everything started working with no other modifications

1622578
soappy	suds

1622650
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
for example gcc can be configure in this manner .so that i can run the compiler on a 32-bit x86 systemd but produce 64bit code for an x64 systemd and that s just the tip of the iceberg

1622652
environment	building
there are a numbers of tutorials around that describe building your own cross-compiling environment

1623196
instances	private
and make it private you will al.so need to remove static from your methods signature as static-methodss can t access instances-variabless from a static context defobject.getdefobj can t access the instances variables defobj since the compiler can t ensure that it already exists - no instances was initializer and .so no instances variables

1623217
hide	show
i want to hide show the page headers based on the page numbers

in theory it would al.so be possible to implements the image analysis code directly in native perl but i m not aware of anyone having done .so and i expect that you d be better off writing .something that low-level and proces.sor-intensive in a fully-compiled language c++ rather than in perl

1624653
tablecell	cell
still having problem with tablecell i guess .when using touch begin and end user may move his finger .so that means user may have move from one cell to another

if you really like typing go for java if you really like whitespace go for python if you like programming more than you like high performance go for ruby

1624683
python	ruby	python	java
i don t know how python adds up for guser-interface stuff but .when i was looking at ruby in detail a couple of years back it seemed a trifle complex or at least nothing is hard to write in ruby but it didn t look easy to produce a nice modern-looking user-interface but i much prefer what i can achieve with a scripting-language in terms of lines-of-code compared with java s painful verbosity

1624850
json	xml
the main advantage to using json for a large amount of data is that the parsing time to decode the data is quite a bit less than parsing xml

1624895
onmouseup	onkeyup
except for onkeyup try handling onmouseup too

1624895
click	mouse	onmouseup	onfocus
edit apparently onmouseup only triggerss if the mouse button was click in the input-box too but onfocus should triggers .when the input-box receives focus .when you re dropping the text

1624928
buffering	streaming
you could implements a deterministic finite automaton which looks at each byte once only no lookbehind is required .so that you would basically streaming the input through a buffering holding max as many characters as the length of your pattern outputting the pattern on a match or overflowing non-matched characters .when advancing in the pattern

if you want to be picky and knows that the reallocation is not triggers then you still have to worry about insert

1624961
triggers	insert
.when you want to insert an object and the vector does not have the necessary capacity a call to the .reserve size_t methods is triggers

1624961
temporary	copy
it first creates a temporary vector which will allocate only as much memory as is needed with a minimum depending on the libs and copy the elements of myvector

1624965
firefox	safari
in ie8 firefox safari etc this is working fine but in ie7 at the moment specifically on windows-xp can t really test on vista 7 at the moment the maps seem to steal the focus and scrolls the page down

the updatepanel is part of system.web.extensions.dll and does not need to be explicit added to the bin folder of the project as it gets install into the gac global-assembly-cache

1624998
dictionary	map
if you defined your forms this way in templates you cannot map it to a dictionary directly

1625045
getchar	fgetc
the problem is there are no standard-library functions that detection individual keystrokes getchar and fgetc are buffering and required you to hit enter before they return

1625142
hide	show
if you don t have the information available at the outline scoping to determine what links to hide and show then you ll have to find a way to fail gracefully .when a file does not exist

1625145
order	add
say for example we add another user types which represents a less trusted staff member who can only view order from a subset of clients

1625165
sorted	lookup
if you trimmed excess you would have to come up with an algorithm that still provided close to o 1 lookup time in what would effectively be a randomly sorted list

1625167
system.diagnostics	.net
.when i subscribe to windows events using the .net classes in the system.diagnostics namespace and retrieve event object in the form of eventlogentry instances is there a way to serialization these instances to the xml format mentioned above

1625180
boolean	double
edit to clarify the above answer the original question asked about using a boolean to control the double checked locking

1625180
boolean	double
you could double checked lock actually setting a boolean but you still have issues about instruction reordering .when it comes to creating the class instances

1625181
required	checked
would required to gather all the profiling gather all the roles attributes to each profiling and then finally develop the roles to checked if the action is authentication

1625189

you could always use whatever orm linq-to-sql entity-framework nhibernate etc. for reading the data and then building a facade layer on top of a combinations of the web-services for writing and the object for reading

1625236
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the control market around webforms is quite a bit more mature than asp.net-mvc .so tools from companies like telerik devexpress infragistics will have a more mature implementation and broader base of support

1625242
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the decision towards webforms or asp.net-mvc is one that should place heavy focus on whether or not you have the necessary experience and comfort with working with all the client-side code that asp.net-mvc required you to implements yourself

1625255
build-process	msbuild
if i run the msbuild manually its fine and it says in the log its building a metaproj file but in the automated build-process it fails

1625262
click	mouse
they work only after click component with mouse

1625263
bufferedwriter	writer	bufferedwriter	filewriter	filewriter	writer
using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter

1625263
bufferedwriter	printwriter
but the bufferedwriter and printwriter wrapper are not strictly necessary

1625267
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox has firebug but all other major browsers ie google-chrome safari also have debugging tools built-in that you should checked

1625268

internet-explorer 8 has developer-tools which is similar to firebug for firefox

1625268
google-chrome	opera
opera has opera dragonfly and google-chrome also has something called developer-tools shift+ctrl+j

1625352
revision	svn
obviously it couldn t get the svn revision since the data did not exist

1625358
children	nodes
this python code assumes that each nodes contains a list of children and that the nodes object do not defined equality .so that the index function is comparing identities

1625369
triggers	insert
i am trying to create a sql triggers in sql-server that will somehow serialization the insert and deleted tables for use in .net code via sp_oamethod

1625371

i don t really get the getvalueat int row int col methods

1625374
updating	updates
edit the op has updates his question with new code .so i m updating my answer accordingly below.

1625382
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseover	mousemove	mouseout	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	keyup	mouseout	mouseup

1625382
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

1625387
perl	awk	python	perl	arrays	map
or you can use perl or python or awk all of which have associativity arrays equivalent to a map

1625416
binaries	install
another option would be that you install the subversion binaries

1625443
directory	folder
do not use server.map path but the full named to the folder such as myserver sharenamed directory + filenamed

1625502
any	set	lookup	any
thus at any points the keyset of the map is the set of unreturned connections and you can lookup that value in the map inorder to find the guilty bit of code that created them and never release them

1625504
slidedown	slideup
there s other effects you can use too like slideup slidedown .so you may want to look into those too

1625534
click	mouse
in other words i need to add a control points on the linesegment where i click with mouse

1625542
declarative	imperative
they support both declarative and imperative model of defining dependencies and are quite good at what they do

1625550
exception-handling	try-catch
i guess i can always wrap that code in a try-catch block but .when the exception-handling occurs i won t know if it is a legitimate exception-handling or one caused by this weird conditional

1625558
.when	ready
.when a request finishes it alert it delegation the webview s controllers that data is ready to be loaded

1625592
reflection	runtime
it uses reflection generics and attributes to locate and bind the concrete types at runtime

1625604

i m assuming you mean that you re talking about well-formed xml but xml which contains elements that are not defined in the schema

1625607
value	field
each object will contains a properties called hmac that will contains a hash of the object s value itself but excluding the hmac field

1625642

how can i create a background-image that will change in width with rounded borders for each of my li links

1625662
bazaar	git
git subversion bazaar and mercurial are all supported

1625663
any	set
the development-environment of all developers is set up exactly the same and configuration for development-environments is checked in .so developers can just checkout the code from version-control and building without any further fiddling about

1625690
attributes	properties
you can defined attributes for your properties

1625691
checkbox	button
i m struggling to do multi-select for deletion not checkbox just the standards - delete button

1625694
configuration	environment
in all of my .app web configurationuration that have settings that change for different environment i split them into their own files .so that my main configuration looks like this

1625694
configuration	environment
after that i create folder for each environment dev staging prod etc and use a different sub configuration file in each folder .so all the settings can be checked into tfs

1625701
constructor	object
b isn t fully construct until after the call to the super constructor .so if you pass this if the compiler allowed it as a reference and it call a methods on b b would be in an invalid state and cause all kinds of nasty problems in fact a is still not initializer nor any class up the chaining including object

1625723
attributes	properties
yury litvinov those properties are new properties that haven t been mapped to hibernate mbean attributes because the hibernate mbean is no longer maintained

1625751
z-index	overlay
to avoid the content being overlay by the elements give the content positioning relative and a z-index

1625766
triggers	insert
a triggers on table1 insert into table2

1625766
triggers	insert
a triggers on table2 insert into table3

1625766
triggers	insert
there s a triggers on table3 that would insert-into table4 but since the maximum depth is 2 either the triggers just doesn t get run less ideal but consistent with current recursive triggerss false behavior on sql-server or the whole set of insert is rollback and fails with an error like maximum triggers depth 2 exceeded - insert failed messages ideal

1625769
xsd	xml
in other words the xml file is automatically validation against some part of the xsd

1625772

this properties is automatically added by the weblogic plugins for eclipse using the configuration defined in server runtime environment

1625795
value	field
selected insert-into tables field here value + field1 + ..

1625805
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
if it detection internet-explorer it raises an error however it works fine in firefox and safari

1625813
background-color	width	background-color	height
and of course if you re using flash the application you can just click the stage and then go to the properties panels and set the width height and background-color

1625818
selected	button
if it allowed multiple delete button visible at a time the user-interface doesn t work - if you have one delete button on each row click one of them and having all the selected rows disappear in inconsistent user-interface

1625818
checkbox	button
the only way to implements this properly is to have checkbox and a delete button in a toolbar like mail etc

1625821
webforms	asp.net
you may want to checkout what is the â page lifecycleâ of an asp.net webforms

1625824
constructor	object
i d like to create a b s object by passing an a s object to b s constructor as you can see i cannot re-assign the this variables

1625834
any	set
any set have the same interface .so typically can be used interchangeably as good-practices required that you use the set interface for all of them

1625869
double	int
the cast to result was enough for my needs int + double double + double double

1625876
protected	public
every public or protected methods and properties from class a is available in class b

1625898
sql-server	postgresql
currently migrating from sql-server to postgresql and attempting to improve a couple of key areas on the way

1625898
sql-server	postgresql
partition is a feature of sql-server enterprise but which is one of the many exciting prospects of postgresql

1625972
any	set
any outstanding request will complete normally assuming they don t take too long at which points the old set of process for the pool will terminate in an orderly fashion

1625974
decltype	auto
i d use the c++ 0x decltype and the new definition of auto

1625974
decltype	auto
in particular you can use decltype auto to deduce the correct return-type instead of having to specify it explicit

1625977
internationalization	globalization
if internationalization is not on the horizon turn off globalization rules

1625983
type-conversion	int
xor of pointers is not defined in some contexts the c language although many languages provide some kind of type-conversion between pointers and int

1625999
contains	set
.so the left and right borders would each be 10px wide set inside the 500px-wide contains div - therefore the table s remaining content area would be 480px

1626004
google-chrome	firefox
problem quick demo how it works in firefox and doesn t in ie and google-chrome

1626033
execution	restart
it seems that you d have to restart execution of the jquery code on the page inorder for this to get the results you re looking for

1626039
command-line	cmd
have you tried issuing the same svn cmd manually from the command-line

1626058
any	set
don t set any breakpoints just run in debugging command-y and do what you normally do to cause the .app to crash

1626059
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
does mysql have a bulk-load command-line tool like bcp for sql-server and sqlldr for oracle

1626064
synchronous	.when
.when i call the methods synchronous i run the following code and i get the exact amount of time it took a the methods mymethods

1626065
selected	textbox
in the entity picker .when the user selected an entity the id appears in the textbox next to the add bottom

1626074
any	set
it gets rid of the need to send any sort of passwd and you can set an expiry on your invite recording if you want as well

1626078
variables	boolean
i am unsure how to use the php captcha to prevent people from posting but i was thinking that i could use it to set a boolean variables that i send to my mail.php page that will tell it weather or not to acutally send me a job applicants email

1626081
debugging	trace
i ve done a bit of debugging to trace the error to this function but i m having problems figuring out what part of the function is at fault

1626085
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
but .when i use other browser opera firefox safari google-chrome i get this

1626094
execution	exit
i m attempting to start a process from a piece of code but i want the code to pause execution until the process finishes and exit

1626100
active-directory	adfs
i ve no experience with it but i think active-directory federation service s adfs is designed for this sort of thing

1626114
sql-server-express	sql-server
checked sql-server-express is running using the sql-server configuration manager

1626119
exception-handling	try-catch
the bad thing about the exception-handling handler is that execution will stop after the exception-handling_handler is called - .so there is no such thing as a recoverable ignore exception-handling should it not be caught in a try-catch block

1626119
any	set
on the other hand errors are always global and can be handled by any function class set by the set_error_handler

1626119
exception-handling	try-catch
this removes the need for extra exception-handling classes object memory or line of try-catch code

1626119
exception-handling	error-handling
.so given that you must support error-handling anyway do to the php language what is the purpose of wasting extra code and memory al.so implements exception-handling

1626122
margins	padding
the ie box model actually works the way you would want once you declare the width of an elements that s the width and then it subtract from the inner width of the elements the padding margins and border to give you the declare width

1626122
margins	padding
all of the other browsers do the opposite they set the elements width to the declare width and then add the margins padding and border

1626137
boost	stl
also i think stl and or boost has a foreach methods

1626150
setinterval	settimeout
if the issue is that you don t know how to get the page to poll the server every x seconds you can do this with javascript using settimeout function milliseconds and setinterval function milliseconds

1626154
temporary	copy
can you copy the file to a temporary location and then use the temp file to launchd the program

1626166
32-bit	64bit
as chris mentioned above the pruint32s are actually 32-bit not 64bit unsigned int .so i ve changed them

1626168
syntax-highlighting	textmate
sass syntax-highlighting works fine in textmate .when i install a sass bundle like this

1626171
error-handling	try-catch
.when you use try-catch blocks the error-handling will almost always look similar and in many cases is more self-explanatory than using normals errors with codes etc

1626189
value	field
your aim is to put as many the most valuable towers on a field as possible to maximize total tower value on a field lets assume that all towers are built at once there is no turns

1626189
contains	any
the only optimization i came up with is to skip combinations that don t contains any most valuable towers

1626190
restart	reload
this is because it makes modifing the context configuration more invasive since the main conf server.xml file cannot be reload without restart tomcat

1626202
pixels	line
.when two div s float in a containers that has not a fixed height or its height is than the max height of the contains div s your containers collapse in a line of pixels and your floating div s overflow the containers

1626252
click	mouse
the origins of the current setting eating the initial mouse click that brings focus to a windows started as a fix to a bug in the ribbon user-interface

1626254
runas	cmd
one way i can think of doing this is to execute a batch-file cmd .so you can execute multiple line items with runas to imper.sonate another user account

1626274
any	set
an alternative would be to use dotfuscator pro a commercial product that i know for certain will correctly link together assemblies and does correctly link any satellite resource assemblies for the set of input assemblies

1626296
constructor	object
in fact if you re that concerned with having a no-arg constructor for immutable object you can always not map them as entities and instead load them via hql which does support constructor-injection

1626318
carbon	cocoa
carbon or cocoa

1626336
data-members	instances
typically every instances of a class with at least one virtual function will have an extra pointers stored with its explicit data-members

1626343
show	next
therefore you are asking the next dialog to show which it does â right on top of the previous one

1626363
project-management	project
the real project-management job is not to control the project but rather to enable it

1626378
selected	checkbox
it wouldn t hurt to display a list of selected ledger items to a list updates onchange for each of the checkbox this provides away of reminding the user what they ve selected if the ledger items they ve checked are not on the current page

1626421
submitchanges	datacontext
the save methods on the datacontext object is submitchanges

1626428
value	field
it seem that is the way form work if you use the methods get .so if i need to preserve the value and need to use get i would need to add a bunch of hidden field like it was suggested

1626478
python	php
i would like to create a class that effectively does this mixing a little php with python

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
it might be that having something like mouseenter mouseleave events would solve this but they re not yet in a w3c recommendation

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit to be clear mouseenter and mouseleave are in the dom level 3 events working draft

1626499
exception-handling	try-catch
all the asynchronous call to httpwebrequest.begingetresponse endgetresponse and httpwebresponse.getresponsestream .beginread endread are made from try-catch blocks however these exception-handling propagate and do not leave a chance handle them and stop application termination

1626514
textbox	button
then i databinded the textbox to each column in the database and managed to updates the database via my own cmd button such as updates with this code

1626514
selected	textbox
the only thing missing now is how to add a row delete selected row and editing selected row via my own textbox

1626524
any	set
if the user-interface doesn t have to be completely dynamic you could include all the controls in the markup with any optional ones set to visible false

1626526
derived-class	base-class
in c++ and empty struct class member-specification is explicit permitted but the size is defined to be 1 - unless as part of the empty base optimization the compiler is allowed to make an empty base-class take no spaces in the derived-class

1626532
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval

1626554
lookup	any
notice that getattr is called for any failed lookup and that you don t get it like a function all .so you have to return the methods that will be called

1626575
lookup	any
might not really provide any advantages to 1 since would need to store lookup anyway

1626598
exception-handling	try-catch
the case might be that you exit the try-catch block before the exception-handling gets raised .so it raises with no handler to it can you please .post your part of the code .so i can see how we can improve it

1626603
arrays	loops
in this case it s right to complain about for...in because that s the wrong construct to loops over an arrays

1626607
concatenation	comma
i assume that it will hand an xmlnodelist as the value to be converted and then you can enumerate those nodes and concatenation a comma separated string yourself

1626607
itemtemplate	textblock	itemtemplate	itemscontrol	itemscontrol	textblock
since the ivalueconverter suggestion did not work due to the xpath engine doing a pre-coercion here s what i suggest you do instead of binding to a single textblock bind to an itemscontrol instead and defined the itemtemplate for the itemscontrol to be as follows

1626610
enumerator	any
if you look at the jslint docs you ll find a link explaining the rationale behind filtering for-in loops basically it s to avoid tripping over any enumerator properties that have been added to the object s prototype

1626629
separation-of-concerns	srp
however - from a separation-of-concerns srp standpoint the first two are more correct

1626637
invoices	product
if it s an exception-handling in that the absence of a user with that id will prevent the application from successfully completing whatever function it is doing say we re creating an invoices for a customer we ve shipped product to... then this situation should throw an argumentexception-handling or some other custom exception-handling

1626642
exception-handling	try-catch
it provides a quick and easy mechanism to detection if something screwed up without throw exception-handling and using tons of try-catch all over the place

1626689
required	checked
i d rather use the occasional no strict foo or no warnings bar in a block where i need the ability to do something that required it than disable the checked over my entire file

1626696
arrays	loops
if there is a cleaner way of doing what i want please suggest .so but without the use of arrays or loops

1626706
appdata	temp
file c users myname appdata local temp customprofiledir4b9b53c99d684ec4952cf8a721790c85 proxy.pac

1626724
arrays	loops
i don t understand why you don t want to do this without arrays or loops

1626728
environment	building
we are going this route building relativity because it is cost prohibitive to try and replicate our hardware environment in production

1626738
background-image	width	background-image	height	display	height	display	width
since you re using a background-image a for the button give the button a height and width otherwise it will display as a small gray blip because there are no words on the button

1626770
put	get
if you put those two together you ll get something that s unique for the moment but is subject to change at any time

1626778
instances	self
however i have seen code out there that does something similar except it doesn t release self before reassigning it to another newly allocated instances

1626787
multiplication	division
at least multiplication and division of several rows would be easy

1626790
compact-framework	.net
i am using sql-server-ce 3.5 and c# with the .net compact-framework 3.5

1626805
subclassing	base-class
it would be much cleaner to defined a base-class with all the common functionality and a subclassing for each types variation

1626805
instances	self
unless the init methods is a factory-methods re-using instancess or a singleton initializer avoid releasing self en-lieu of another instances

1626811
perl	php
i want to parsing a large xml file and i have two options perl or php

1628292
configuration	logging
put your webapp s logging properties configuration file into its web-inf classes directory

1628300
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
in a traditional object-oriented language able to dispatcher only on the types of the leftmost arguments -- like python ruby java c++ c# c if x is of some built-in types and y is of your own fancy new types you re sadly out of luck if the language insists on delegation all the logic to the methods of types x that implements addition assuming the language allows operator-overloading

1628338
configuration	logging
if yes my guess is that tomcat might not be able to find its logging configuration file that is set up in catalina.sh or equivalent .when using the scripting

1628339
sql-server-express	sql-server
it s currently an access database but i imagine i m probably going to need to migrate it to sql-server or sql-server-express

1628348
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object. after compiling and starting the project

1628359
expression	evaluation
because it s not evaluation the conditional but simply building the expression

1628360
dsa	rsa
it uses rsa but it should be quite simple to switching over to dsa

1628366
carbon	cocoa
i was able to register for the events using carbon s installeventhandler but would prefer a cocoa equivalent

1628368
printf	scanf
you can be practical and use the magic of printf and scanf to translation your data to and from plain ascii characters .when sending data over the network

1628379
dictionary	map
given a dictionary of words calculate the numeric strings that would be generator and store this data into a map dictionary structure table 85 hi

1628396
data-members	constructor
if t is a non-union class types without a user-declared constructor then every non-static data-members and base-class component of t is value-initialization

1628396
value	field
for your example int is definitely a pod types it s an arithmetic types and therefore a local or field of types int in the absence of initializer will have an indeterminate value

1628414
contains	any
last time i looked neither contains any of the wizards you may have grown accustomed to nor the asp.net graphical design service

1628430
cucumber	webrat
cucumber with webrat gives you the step of

1628434
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in c# the same c++ problem is present the desire to checked every unknown reference against null argumentnullexception and to quickly fix nullreferenceexception s by adding a null-checked

1628441
json	xml
i would serialization the data myself on the server and remove anything redundant such as the named of each properties inorder to speed up my transfer and i found that time to send a request to the server get the response and process was faster with json than using a webservice or returning xml

1628483
pdostatement	bindparam
pdostatement bindparam

1628493
subclassing	inherited
we have is-a extends derives subclassing and simply inherited

1628509
subclassing	inherited
i most often uses a subclassing b very direct or a inherited from b modestly more circumlocutory

1628509
python	c++	python	java
extends is fine in languages where it s a keyword such as java but using it for say c++ or python seems to be a bit of a stretch for some reason

1628509
subclassing	inherited
is-a is a relationship constraint that inherited must respect liskov s principles and holds between instancess left side and classes right side -- .so you can say x is-a foo .when x is an instances of foo or any subclassing of foo but bar is-a foo where they re both classes seems wrong it would cause confusion in languages where classes are al.so instancess of meta classes such as python

1628517
directory	folder
ideally reusable apps should be outside of your project directory anyway .so consider creating a folder such as etc django .lib to contains reusable apps and append that to sys.path in your wsgi handler too

1628519
fiddler	pac
you should find that fiddler now registers as the systemd proxy using a simple pac scripting rather than manually specifying 127.0.0.1 8888

1628529
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
is a suits dynamic-languages and relects the chimeric qualities of perl php python and javascript-objects

is-a polymorphism is .when an interface is defined by a base-class but the implementation can be provided by an inherited class

1628549
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i don t quite follow what navigation problem you re having but if there s no navigation bar .when you need one i suspect you need to create and add a uinavigationcontroller somewhere that you re adding a uiviewcontroller subclassing

1628592
subclassing	inherited
a subclassing b - inherited isn t restrict to just classes

1628600
instances	destroy

stripes	grails
if you are afraid of grails and need java try stripes and read the excellent stripes book

1628621
environment	building
the input are the same in both environment and with the operational code being the same same java building there is a significant difference observed in the behavior

1628623
low-level	hardware
i m not familiar with the term systemd level program per se but if it s anything like systemd level programming then it has to do with writing fairly low-level code that interacts directly with a systemd usually specific hardware platform architecture etc and abstracts it in some way systemd programming to allow for higher level programs to be written that can be systemd-agnostic

1628628
web-services	api
i am developing my own php libs and i would like to call restful web-services from my api

i want to checked whether two list are the same in that they contains all the same elements or not order not important

1628658
duplicates	elements
duplicates elements are considered equals e is the same with

1628666
implements	extends
my preferred terminology is subclassing or extends for classes and implements for interfaces

1628666
derived-class	base-class
checkout a dictionary entry on the words to see the variety of possible meanings many of which have to do with a set of step which sounds more like an algorithm than inheritance. on a side note i ve found that base-class and derived-class are preferred by many academics but perhaps not as often in industry

1628680
json	xml
output in either json or xml

1628680
implements	final
and also added the final note that you should implements the appropiate put or delete methods .when that action makes sense for your api

copy-constructor	constructor
i am pretty sure all of you are familiar with the concept of the big4 and i have several stuffs to do printing in each of the constructor assignment destructor and copy-constructor

1628699
absolute-path	realpath
the problem is that i can t use realpath to generator an absolute-path because any call to this function with directory that don t exist will return false

1628699
directory	folder
by figuring out a reliable way to insure that the directory given is in fact higher than the parent directory - i can feel safer allowing my admins to work with the filesystems in the upload folder

1628701

1628701
oracle	mysql
we ve used it to convert between oracle mysql and postgreqsql

1628703
key-value	key
if writes are very rare compared to reads a key assumption in most key-value stores and not just in those

1628703
duplicates	sorted
- suitably sorted yep the latter s a denormalization -- it s often necessary to denormalization duplicates information appropriately to exploit key-value stores at their best

1628709
perl	php
i have something the same for perl and php

1628712
contains	elements
floated parent will contains floated children but parent are never to expand just to contains floated elements

i am considering porting a wpf application to silverlight

1628728
inverse	cosine
the rotation angle is simply theta inverse cosine of vx sqrt vx 2 + vy 2 + vz 2

1628737
contains	elements
if the count of list1 elements in list2 equals the count of list2 elements in list1 then the lists both contains the same numbers of elements are both subset of each other - in other words they both contains the same elements

1628742
json	xml
the indexing strategy is entirely tunable see can incrementally read directly from your database to populate the index see dataimporthandler in the same wiki and can be queried from basically any language that speaks http and xml or something like json

1628746
constructor	object
the way to work around that is to store a class field that represents the types and create the object with that types in the constructor

1628753
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework applications can be run on desktop computers with the full .net as long as they only access the shared parts of both frameworks though their user-interface can not be upgrade to look like that of an application developed for desktop pcs

1628768
derived-class	base-class
here the derived-class s function is eclipsing all functions of same named not signature in the base-class

1628774

1628800
directory	folder
i get extra files and directory in their attachment if there is a folder

1628800

well if nothing works since linux unix is close to my heart i can write a scripting for you to pull all files of a list of extensions out and copy them to a new directory with subfolders in tact

1628809
javascript	dom
your best bet is to either immediately delete the script-tags after the dom tree is loaded or dynamically create the script-tag in your javascript

1628814
linux	unix
by the way no matter you are on unix linux or windows forwarding slash works well in this context at least

1628817
printf	scanf
functions like open printf scanf read are libs function implements on top of their counterparts .so they can be used for any application development

1628858
nsimage	appkit

callback	methods
the content is return back to the activity through client s idl that defined callback methods

1628880
configuration	logging
for database logging you need to configurationure your connection strings using the data-access application block - you will need another section in your configuration file for this

1628880
configuration	logging
looking at the configuration file you ve attached you may want to remove the passwd by the way i think that you are missing a logging exception-handling handler - the only exception-handling handler you appear to have is a wrap exception-handling handler

1628882
specifications	w3c
here s another way of attaching the event based on w3c dom level 2 events specifications

this is the solution i used to show hide the toolbar with animation .when the view appears disappears via navigation

1628986
value	field
there isn t anything like viewstate in asp.net-mvc that will persistent a value over multiple request unless you re writing code or using form field to make it do .so

1628986
contains	any
does that stuff contains any references to viewdata

1628993
toolchain	avr-gcc
i m not sure what toolchain you re using but in avr-gcc you ll need to use the header to store access data in flash - it s not enough just to declare your data const as it is still loaded into memory at runtime and as such takes up spaces in both flash and ram just as any other initializer variables

1629031
any	set
is there any way to properly set these value

1629052
cherrypy	web.py
edit which versioning of os x python cherrypy and web.py are you running

i spend a lot of time writing perl code for website and c++ for graphics engines

1629119
perl	c++
i can do things in c++ that run far more efficiently and faster than what i would write for perl but for the size of most perl scripting the loss in efficiency is negligible

1629122
pointers	stack
since a pointers is an int variables that could store 4 bytes of data why isn t it allocated on stack like the other three variabless

1629148

i suggest you log the string somehow - then you ll see the real data and my guess is that it won t contains the backslashes - assuming you haven t written any backslashes to the stringwriter to start with

1629159
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i can pretty much guarantee that the problem won t be in stringwriter or stringbuilder - they don t perform any escaping

1629167
push	pull

web-applications	web-services
if the rest of the model is transfer via dtos and wcf web-services and persistent with nhibernate in the database but the files not necessarily .so how to make the file-handling transparency part of the overall transactional where applicable yet support all that is necessary for them to be consumed not only in web-applications but al.so in ordinary desktop applications

1629406
double	int
that is i want to make all call to getglobal t where t is not an int or a double an error

1629414
realloc	malloc
a naive way of solving realloc would be to have realloc call you malloc function and just copy the data but i guess you re looking for a more sophisticated solution

1629458
contains	any
since the measurements are collected every 10 minutes and the database contains all data for 30 to 50 sensors the total amount of data is quite significant after a few years yet it must be possible to generator overviews graphing for any random period of time

1629588
expression	brackets
as with any other use of the square-bracket notation the string within the brackets can be held in a variables or construct returned by an expression

1629588
constructor	object
code that is execution in the global context the code within global functions except object constructor invoked with the new keyword and inline-code outside of any functions could also use the this keyword to refer to the global object

1629588
constructor	object
however using the this keyword is very likely to be confusing especially in scripting that include custom javascript-object where the methods and constructor of those object would be using this to refer to their own object instances

1629599
traffic	packets
you can answer this yourself by using a packets sniffer to watch the traffic

1629676
value	field
i would like a user-controls to display the value from these field if the data is passed in as an or

1629679
implements	extends
the trick here is that you need to create a new authenicationtoken maybe extends usernameandpasswordauthenicationtoken and as emills says you need to then implements a new authenciationprocessingfilter to map the request value to the token and submit these to the authenicationmanager

1629681
domdocument	domxpath
you are much better off using simplexml or domdocument with domxpath

1630272
ironpython	ironruby
that said i routinely use ironpython and ironruby on production project

xsd	xml
if you have an xml schema xsd then i d probably always prefer the deserialize to object approach - it s just easier and cleaner to work with nice clr object

1630276

if you have xml that you need to parsing very often maybe creating an xsd might be a good idea in the end

1630290

1630410
if-statement	loops
there is nothing wrong with your way unless you will have 100 000 loops and wants save 100 000 if-statement

1630566
sql-server	oracle
.so i want to use just one odbc connection to sql-server and in sql-server link that oracle link

1630577
arbitrary-precision	bigint
the most interesting result is that the types-inference engine had a lot of trouble resolving between machine int and arbitrary-precision int -- they auto-promoted in vanilla self and hence could not be told apart by the types systemd which meant that the compiler had to include code to promote to bigint on every int operation

1630583

1630648
linked-list	arrays
this keeps the idea of returning a list or a collections of product but doesn t couple you to the actual collections implementation a linked-list arrays whatever

exception-handling	error-handling
this is exactly what exception-handling were designed for to replace error codes with a more robust and structured error-handling mechanism

1630740
double	int
now for your problem actually as you noticed you will have to defined both flavors of the operators int and double rather than using a generics templates

double	int
but if you use boost.operatorss you only provide complex operators int and complex operators double and the stand-alone versioning will be automatically deduced

1630747

pseudo-decorating both classes - having a base-class that doesn t implements the prototypeable interface inheriting from that to the proper subclassing and then having both classes extended to prototypeable versioning of themselves

1631920
python	php	python	c++
google offers ajax api for javascript programmers and a poor documentation for python php and flash.by the way if you are able to connect to remote httpserver with any other c++ libs you can do it

1631934

1631953
runas	cmd
or restart the process in elevated mode using the runas cmd if it is not elevated

1631967
onbeforeunload	onsubmit
perhaps you could handle onsubmit and set a flag that you later checked in your onbeforeunload handler

1631970
credentials	security
assuming it s just username passwd you would simply configure your binding to use transportwithmessagecredentials security where the client credentials types is username note you must use the http to do this

1631995
groovy	java
it is possible to compile and package groovy java code into a jar and then use it in a grails .app

1632015
c-preprocessor	macros
this will generator a part of makefile just like c-preprocessor does or more correctly lisp macros

1632029
value	field
i want the maximum value of a field in core data .so i have set up the following request

1632037
put	get
this is not an ideal situation but if you put things into a queue then browsers will begin to timeout after a while or users get impatient and click the submit button over and over as it is taking too long

1632045
malloc	strdup
fact is that npapi takes care of the allocated string from that points on and .when tries to destroy it it cannot since strdup uses malloc and not npn_memalloc

1632058
constructor	object
i can t decide which approach is better for creating object with a large numbers of field 10+ all mandatory the constructor approach of the getter-setter

1632069
ubuntu	linux
do you know how linux ubuntu handles the buffering for pipe s

1632081
constructor	object
imho you should pass everything that is needed for an object to be valid according to your business-logic in the constructor

1632099
boolean	double
there are a few ways around that problem including a guarding boolean but my preferred way would be to use a double object like .so

1632099
constructor	private	constructor	object
it should be noted that if you need true thread-safe immutability having all of the field of the immutable object as final this required more boilerplate storing the variables inside the builder and passing them to a private constructor of the immutable object but the approach is still clean from the points of view of the client code

1632101
boolean	int
return different rendering at gettablecellrenderercomponent jtable table object value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column according to your business-logic

1632102
void	main
that s int main not void main

1632107
synchronous	nsoperation
you use nsoperationqueue in conjunction with nsoperation - you can have either synchronous call in there since the work is all done on a background-thread or you can still do asynchronous call with a little more work have to defined a few more methods

1632119
unix	bsd
i could launchd my beloved turbo-c in dosbox an ubiquitous enough platform but i want to learn c such that i can develop something that compiles naturally on any bsd or unix platform

1632135
linux	bsd
well on unix-like systemd such as bsd and linux you definitely want to use ncurses as the terminal android-emulator make your life really miserable if you don t

1632138
scala	java
i m trying to get a real equivalent for java s public static final in scala for using twip

1632138
scala	java
here s an example of a java class i m trying to ports to scala

1632196
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
postgresql has no commercial versioning and is much safer legally to use than mysql plus it very similar to oracle pl sql .so the skills needed for it are almost the same as oracle and easy to find

1632201
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to compile the zpipe.c example in my linux ubuntu 8.04 with gcc but i m getting some errors take a look

1632209
contains	sorted
for the sorted list you can use a binary-search for your begins with but for the contains you will need to do a linear search evaluation every item

1632214
revision	svn
you could use svn log with a reverse revision range

1632228
udp	tcp
it is not clear from the code you ve provided but my guess is that you are transmitting the data using tcp as opposed to udp

1632228
udp	tcp
if you want that behavior use udp instead of tcp

1632228
.when	ready
.when using tcp the data is typically buffering on the send side until a sufficient amount of data is ready to be sent

1632228
buffering	streaming
you will need to parsing your buffering to extraction each messages from the streaming of bytes

1632231
double	int
your 64bit int will be converted to double which will at least usually have a significand that s smaller than 64bit

1632232
unique	words
i have a page that has 2 columns of words 20 total that are of a certain class dim and each a unique id

1632247
linux	osx	linux	unix
ibm s purify has linux windows and various unix versioning not sure about osx

1632269
priority-queue	queue
this implies that you have a function priority-queue which calculates the priority for a given queue based on the numbers of messages account priority time since last send etc

1632271
entity-framework	ado.net
it is usually best to use ado.net or linq-to-sql entity-framework to connect to your database directly unless the user is going to be disconnect while using the application

1632274
32-bit	64bit
i have tested this on my windows 7 64bit machine and it works there - .so presumably the same function will work on both 32-bit and 64bit windows

1632284
web-services	security
assuming that your intention is to pull down a subset of the data on the server dependent on client queries for local-storage then for reasons of security and control you probably ought to be looking at using web-services rather than exposing your database directly to the internet

1632284
.net	wcf
there are a large numbers of options for creating service - wcf being the principal methods for new .net applications and straightforward to implements at both server and client ends - in this case i d also probably take a look at ado.net data service as providing a shortcut to a rich set of service

1632292
instance-variables	local-variables
just try using local-variables throughout or defined instance-variables in helpers classes you are calling from the stateless session bean business methods

1632293
cassini	iis
i m trying to run a test versioning of a web using the filesystems the cassini webserver built-in to visual-studio 2005 rather than iis 5.1 on my win xp dev pc

using windows.forms i have a tabcontrol with a listbox and several textbox all bound to a datatableadapter

1632307
selected	listbox	selected	textbox	listbox	textbox
.when the user selected a member in the listbox the corresponding textbox are populate

1632307
selected	listbox
.so .when they selected a different member in the listbox their changes are lost

1632313
getter	setter
it looks like you re trying to merge the getter and setter created by attr_accessor

1632313
getter	setter
the reason this isn t working is because you re overrides the getter with the setter .when you call alias

1632314
getter	setter
if that s the case then you wouldn t use attr_accessor you d need to write the getter and setter yourself

1632324
entity-framework	ado.net
you can customize validation by creating an event handler in the ado.net entity-framework class

1632328
parentheses	keyword	display	width
another extension is supported by mysql for optional specifying the display width of int data typess in parentheses following the base keyword for the types for example int 4

1632328
display	width
this optional display width may be used by applications to display int value having a width less than the width specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces

1632328
display	width
the display width does not constrain the range of value that can be stored in the column nor the numbers of digits that are display for value having a width exceeding that specified for the column

1632328
unsigned	bigint
a bigint is always 8 bytes and can store -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 signed or 0 to 18446744073709551615 unsigned

1632329
display	width
the numbers merely defined the width of the numbers .when being display

1632337
contains	set
this because city contains special characters set by the javascript

1632338
display	width
the numbers between brackets is the display width and is unrelated the range of numberss the datatype can actually store

1632380

the framework directory under windir will not contains any of the linq assemblies

1632472
display	width
the display width is passed back in the meta data

1632476

its a programming language by itself with most of the things you learn in programming like arrays loops if else flow control etc you can program in sed as well but you won t want to maintain the code written in it

1632483
parentheses	keyword	display	width
another extension is supported by mysql for optional specifying the display width of int data typess in parentheses following the base keyword for the types for example int 4

1632483
display	width
this optional display width may be used by applications to display int value having a width less than the width specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces

i am using jquery to populate the field with numbers and value also using jquery to set the start date to a certain time and end date to +5 hours ahead with a change function exactly like facebook

1632541
gethashcode	equals
you need to overrides the equals and gethashcode methodss for the contains methods to be able to do comparisons as you expect

1632541
contains	elements
the contains uses the equals methods for comparing elements

1632559
silverlight	wpf
for all of the reasons posted here though i think the viewmodel is the correct design choice for this medium wpf silverlight even though it is less than perfect

1632567
display	width
the arguments only applies to display width which may be used by applications as jonathan fingland mentions

1632574
gethashcode	equals
you need to overrides equals and gethashcode for contains to do what you expect otherwise it is using equals which is just a reference comparison

1632574
gethashcode	equals
in this case you may find it easy to implements equals and gethashcode by just passing your implementsation onto string s

1632578
web-services	security
if not web-services for one major reason security

1632580
textbox	button
for that i created session for the textbox value .when the search button is click

1632591
double	int
this is because you will have to constantly convert between nsnumber and primitive-types like int double long etc

1632604
where-clause	sql
this takes for ever because .when order gets enumerated the sql generator ignore the where-clause pull 1000s of recording and then in memory filtering out the order based on the where-clause

1632609
instances	private
bar is a private class of foo and can only be visible to instances of foo

1632651
fflush	stdout
or use fflush stdout

1632675
constructor	object
.when you create an object in c++ the constructor goes through the following sequences

1632675
constructor	object
because c++ assumes a default-constructor call there is absolutely no difference between putting a default-constructor in the list and leaving it out entirely c++ will not unless under special circumstances outside the scoping of this question create an object without a call to a constructor of some sort

1632675
copy-constructor	constructor
all built-in types al.so have a copy-constructor .so you can you can initializer them by passing their initial value as the only arguments to the variables s constructor

1632688
compression	streaming
if you going to use wcf mtom streaming chunks and compression are some options depending on which binding you go for

1632762
json	xml
including a web .app that will use yuser-interface widget and the xml json from the web-services for a nice smooth user-interface

1632768
gethashcode	equals
as you can see i have overrides equals and gethashcode

1632772
factors	numeric
the way r import data and automatically works out what is numeric and what is not and thereby makes it a factors is wonderful - untill you have to manipulate it further and then it becomes a pain

1632787
32-bit	64bit
bho are in-process components and you can not load 32-bit dll to 64bit process

1632787
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit versioning of ie on 64bit windows should work fine with your 32-bit bho

1632789

if all you care about is home back and forwarding button you can make a simple toolbar and use the qwebview widget to do your actual web viewing

1632802
binary-tree	linked-list
i m trying to teach myself c++ and one of the traditional new language exercises i ve always used is to implements some data structure like a binary-tree or a linked-list

1632806
perl	php
i don t use php regularly .so i am assuming that a perl compatible regex is what it says it is

1632816
gethashcode	equals
you have not overrides equals and gethashcode

1632816
gethashcode	equals	case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the simplest fix would be to overrides gethashcode and equals directly rather than implements a comparator comparators are generally only interesting .when you need to supply multiple different comparison types case-sensitive and case-insensitive for example or .when you need to be able to perform comparisons on a class which you don t control

1632824
gethashcode	tostring
i overrides the tostring and the gethashcode methods and viola key lookup worked fine

1632836

1632883
vb.net	vba
i know sql and vb.net and vba

1632885
keyboard	mouse
if i have time to investigate and figure that out i ll repost but it might rank as a case where the return on investment isn t worth it customizing swing classes handling low-level mouse keyboard events directly etc

1632898
ruby	php
how feasible is it to translation this ruby websocket server to php

1632898
ruby	php
i know a little bit of ruby and a decent amount of php thought i ve never done socket programming

1632898
ruby	php
am i better off trying to integrated that ruby server into my php site by moving session management into the db instead of attempting to translation it

1632916
revision	updates
you can multi-selected the desired files if they are all files of the same types you can sort by extension first to make it easier then right-click and selected updates item to revision

coalesce	isnull
i do not know about createcriteria but hibernate hql supports coalesce ifnull or isnull depending on your underlying database only in the where-clause

1633017
boolean	int
the parsing logic is a switching statement with some boilerplate for parsing int strings and boolean

1633020
exception-handling	try-catch
my general rules of thumb for exception-handling-handling in guis is to have a try-catch block in all the event handler that logs the exception-handling to a file and notifies the user of an error

1633024
protected	public
keyword public protected or

1633038
contains	elements	contains	set
an alternative is to set up the ca rules you want in a single project find the xml elements that contains the list and use a text-editor or a few line of c# code to do a global search replace for the ca elements in all csproj files in your project

1633062
authentication	login
i save data in a cookies to authentication users for the next login remember-me option

1633119
16-bit	8bit
i also tried 1-bit black white 8bit and 24-bit bitmaps to no avail wince framebuffers are most commonly 16-bit but i have no image editor that can produce 16-bit bitmaps.

1633131
ref	out

1633153
punctuation	words
use punctuation spacess remove multiple spaces and any other chars that you determine to be words splits

1633170
contains	elements
the simplest way to clear floated elementss is using the styles overflow auto on the contains elements

1633170
contains	elements	margins	padding
one downside using certain combinations of margins and padding on the external elements can cause scrollbar to appear but this can be solved by placing the margins and padding on another parent contains elements

1633170
contains	elements	contains	any
using â overflow hiddenâ is also a clearfix solution but will not have scrollbar however using hidden will crop any content positioning outside of the contains elements

1633170
clearfix	margins
additionally using display block instead of display table allows margins to collapse properly .when elements with clearfix are siblings

1633170

selected all of one model and then for each them load only the relevant associations with a named scoping or finder

1633281
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview inside an updatepanel that is doing inline editing

1633312
json	xml
a client has requested an json xml types scheme to store data because they want a flat-file to edit updates without having to deal with queries and they want it flexible for future development

1633312
json	xml
i prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php

1633320
contains	elements
i have a seemingly simple problem whereby i wish to reconcile two lists .so that an old master list is updates by a new list contains updates elements

1633326
duplicates	elements
using a solution like dreeves but only returning a single instances of each duplicates elements is a bit on the tricky side

1633326
duplicates	elements
this doesn t precisely match the output produced by will robertson s imo superior solution because elements will appear in the returned list in the order that it can be determined that they re duplicates

1633326
duplicates	elements
i m not sure if it really can be done in a single pass all the ways i can think of involve in effect at least two passes although one might only be over the duplicates elements

1633335
highlight	selected
is it possible to mark a range of text in vim and change the highlight color of it to red than selected another range of text and change that color to green keeping the previous highlight and .so on

1633337
json	xml
using jquery and the like it s pretty easy to search an arrays of json object or an xml tree

1633337
sql-server	mysql
use mysql sql-server anything anything anything but a flat-file

1633337
json	xml
if they insist on having a flat-file versioning of their data provide a page on the site that will generator an xml or json versioning of what s in the database

1633345
updatepanel	gridview
if you have multiple updatepanel on your page you might need to tweak a little bit the end_request callback by checked the sender and arguments parameters .so that it attaches the datapicker only if the updatepanel that holds your gridview is triggers

1633356
json	xml
json and xml are used much more for transporting data than storing data these days

1633361
contains	set
i basically need to set up a page within my sharepoint site that is stored in the filesystems has that directive and can contains my web part

1633362
json	xml
look into getting an article as xml as rdf or maybe even as json

1633363
backwards-compatibility	legacy
never use legacy classes any more they don t behave correctly with respect to properties and much else besides and for backwards-compatibility they can t -- in python 3 legacy classes have finally been annihilated .so every class is new-style without the requirement to explicit inherited from object any more

1633369
interpreter	runtime
note that the conditional is in single-quotes not double which makes it interpreter at runtime rather than load-time

1633373
contains	set
dont set the key path for the component contains the files you don t want to auto-repair

1633390

contains	set
i have a user-controls that contains a datalist and i want to set the datasource of the datalist to different things depending on what page the user-controls is on

1633402
constructor	object
another idea would be to modify your constructor to add an empty b object whenever there is no b. for example a.thenestedobject would points to a b object which has no data

1633406
extjs	flex
i look at extjs and it appears to provide many of the ria features that more bulky suites such as flex provide without the flash requirement

1633422
value	field
the lookup field s internal named should stay the same and as long as the list the lookup field is referencing is using the same value id s can be different just match the value and create a new spfieldlookupvalue there is no problem

because we have the external and the directory folder structure set up this way you should in theory be able to checkout or export a solution to an empty directory and have it building successfully from scratch subject to all the necessary tools being install and therefore teamcity or whatever your continuous-integration server is should be able to also be building it from scratch

1633666

assign	add
you ll then usally assign some fba user full control using central admin you need to add the fba membership-provider entry to cas web-config

1635619
easymock	mockito
mockito originally based on easymock s code uses similar paradigms for mocking but automates several tasks such as switching mock object states namely recording replay verify reset

1635619

overall what i think is there should be 1 class say base-class which implements my idependency interface first and all my 100 classes will inherited that class and my configuration file should be like

1635706
innodb	myisam
sfussenegger is correct in that myisam doesn t support transactional use of the mysqldialect dialect doesn t exclude the use of transactional it only means that the hdm2ddl table generator will create innodb types tables

1635717
locale	french
it seems to be a problem with the formatting .when using the locale french

1635723

updating	updates
since you are already doing that in selected statement to fix your triggers just remove the updates statement as your selected statement is already updating the recording field

1635745
jquery	dojo
i ve never used jquery i preferred prototype then dojo but.

1635746
plugins	add-on
it s not unusual for framework plugins or add-on to have conflict s with one another

1635764
value	field
the problem occurs .when a field is missing .so instead of getting null in that field i get the next value

1635787
primitive	int
that properties is declare as the primitive types int and the problem comes .when the .app show to the user zero 0 instead of nothing .when i retrieve that data from the database and turns out to be null

1635800
constructor	private
since planetearth s constructor remains private there can only be one

1635805
bibtex	latex
usually whatever is inside a bibtex file gets copy-paste verbatim to the latex source code with some formatting maybe and case changings c. such as book title author c

1635805
bibtex	latex
.so your bibtex file encoding has to match the one used by your latex file otherwise things get funny

1635813
getter	setter
but this only works with getter and setter methods am i right

1635822
zend-debugger	xdebug
i ve looked up eclipse-pdt as well and it uses zend-debugger or xdebug but zd seems to be the default debugger

1635823
return-value	arguments
this statement call the get_proc_slow with an appropriate parameter is a pointers to a cilkprocinfo and then uses the return-value a pointers to a function to call that function with ws and f as arguments

1635839
python	c++
in python and c# the yield methods stores local state between call whereas in c++ and most other languages the local state stored on stack is not preserve between call and this is a fundemental implementation difference

keyboard	mouse
i d like to set up some thin clients -- user-interface heads old computer + mouse + keyboard connect to vms on a fast server

1635893
malloc	free
a class that has been new ed should be deallocated with delete but if it owns memory that was allocated with malloc either directly or indirectly then it should deallocate that memory with free

1635901
value	field
obviously this will not work if the initial value is not provided for the actual field

1635906
gedit	kate
kate is a pretty good editor i ve always preferred it over gedit

1635917
macvim	vim
in macvim like in vim you can also use

postgresql	mysql
or since you are planning on migrating to postgresql eventually you probably should do the opposite make the postgresql database default and change the connection for the mysql

1635950
malloc	free	malloc	strdup	strdup	free
you use free to release memory allocated with malloc or strdup and this is exactly what to do

1635996
account	api
you should not include the sensitive data into the public .so one option could be to make a public api for the service and then the users would need to create an account to get an api-key for the data

1636060
emacs	vim
vi vim and emacs xemacs can be very powerful take a look if you have time

1636076
return-value	arguments
you can pass the arguments as a pointers to allow the function to modify it without using the return-value

1636115
administration	account
we re thinking the error is due to the user account under which the windows service is running not having the permissions to make http request we ve tried running it under the local administration account but to no avail

1636119
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
sounds like breadth-first-search as opposed to depth-first-search

1636219
updating	updates
.when updating i d like to change the updates query into the following

1636222

what i want is that i want this portion of html code to be hidden from ie6 and ie7 but not firefox opera or ie8 but conditional-comments not working properly on this portion....i am using separate css with conditional-comments in the head section but conditional-comments for opera are not working and also sometimes firefox show strange behavior

1636291
decrement	increment
but make sure to use an atomicinteger for the coordination .so that you will be able to increment it in one thread and decrement it in the worker threads

1636314
command-line	cmd
i want to make some c++ program and i m using function popen here to send cmd to command-line in unix

1636319

in a production-environment i have logging set to info by default using log4net and at this level i log sufficient information to have a very good chance of diagnosing any errors

1636465
return-value	arguments
by including the arguments and return-value i get the most critical data for diagnosing errors

1636465
execution	exit
by logging methods entry exit i find i do not have to log much else--if your code is properly decomposed into methodss then this will document the execution flow through your application

apparently this only fires if the row has not been selected already .so .when i touch a row that is in the highlight region this event does not fire

1636505
highlight	selected
any ideas on how to detection .when a highlight selected row in a picker is touch by the user

1636519
python	java
java or c# will required more line of code written inorder to achieve same with let s say python which is dynamic

1636551
environment	building
the move was relatively easy as the building environment was first and foremost based on makefile

1636570
any	set
run-time-written files should go in a separate â dataâ folder outside the cgi-bin and preferably outside the web root bound with an alias with apache set to disallow any kind of scripting or .htaccess from that folder

json	xml
thus you can have some code that for instances returns a json or xml response that your flex .app can consume via a urlloader or similar request

1636582

1636641
constructor	object
why use a constructor and prototyping for a single object

1636670
derived-class	base-class
please checked the signature of the function in both base-class and derived-class if you have different agruments or data types o any arguments is not matched

1636687

i don t have any control over its execution which means i cannot employ classic signals boolean variables approach

1636702
selected	button
.when a button is click i want the list to reset to a state where nothing is selected all i can figure out is to set the selected index to 0 and have the first positioning on the list either blank or reading choose from the list and make the code ignore this if it is selected

1636708
lan	wan
on a typical lan setup where the entire lan is connect to the internet via a router each computer on the lan would shared a external wan ip assign to the router but each of them would have a internal lan ip typically 192.168

1636708
lan	wan
in that scenario all external request by any computer on that lan would appear to come from the same wan ip

1636708
lan	wan
the router alone would be aware of which computer on the lan the request belongs to .so there would be no way for your php to detection the lan ip but only the wan ip via the _server remote_addr elements

1636708
lan	wan
in short the server only knows the ip of the device that sent the request regardless of whether that ip belongs to a lan wan or any other sort of network

1636710
3d-engine	rendering
now how to use 3d-engine i know but in the end i need to produce rendering image or movie

1637334
jquery	.post
i m using a jquery ajax .post like so.

i would go after a methods that tells you that the rich textarea has the focus like hasfocus or maybe better an event-listener addfocuslistener to tell you .when the focus is there on a mouse click for the right mouse button

1637569
exception-handling	error-handling
ideally you wouldn t catch the exception-handling in the controllers at all and let general error-handling routines deal with it since the problem is no longer with user-input but instead the fault of the developer

1637583
linux	unix
linux unix is the same. the more you reuse code the more complex the install and maintenance story

1637711
fortran	cython
i m liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required types annotations in cython i think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran

1637723
selected	listbox
the problem is there is no sequences that which or all or any will be selected in ddls but the combined filtering result should show up in listbox

1637724
gridview	datalist

1637734
autotools	automake
see man automake or google for autotools

1637738
background-color	transparency
i guess i have to clear the background-color of the table view then set the cell color .when configuring them .so they don t turn out transparency

1637823
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know asp.net-asp.net-mvc and webforms handles postback and url handeling differently but im not comparing the two asp.net techniques but the asp.net-mvc pattern in generele for the two techniques

with my database upgrade scriptinging i typically just have one long scripting that makes the necessary changes for that database versioning

1637852
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net webforms is definitely not following the asp.net-mvc pattern

in asp.net webforms you have your page code-behind and the markup are compiled into a single object not seperate and whatever data is being show

1637863
ref	out
this is not a dupe of calling a methods with ref or out parameters from an anonymous methods

1637863
ref	out
not allowing ref parameters makes a bit more sense to me but the out parameters not as much

1637882
ref	out
out parameters are ref parameters

1637885
ref	out
this is basically to do with the fact that parameters of an anonymous delegation lambda are capture variables and capturing ref out variables doesn t make any sense in c# the clr since it would required ref out field internally

1637886
attributes	properties
there are attributes you can apply to your properties such as readonly that will stop the designer from setting your properties too

32-bit	64bit
why you would bundle 32-bit and 64bit libs into i686-apple-darwin10.0.0 is beyond me

1637984
value	field
you d probably get better bandwidth savings by doing your updates inside parameterized stored-procedures and only passing the field value across rather than the named

1637986
google-chrome	safari
expected behavior occurs in ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome and safari

1638010

value	field
should i dynamically generator the corresponding field on server side .when postback happens and put the already read in value from the client side generator field .so that it s transparency to users

1638057
postback	ajax
i was thinking of adding an ajax methods on the server side which would return back validation info and i could use that to signals errors or what not on client side without ever posting back but the button that causes the postback is the next button and i need it to go to the next page if there are no errors

1638062
jvisualvm	jvm
you can also get some information from jvisualvm if you re using a current 1.6 jvm

1638063

this bug can be easily reproduced if i keep device on the table or in hands horizontal positioning and run my application it draw landscape-like rectangles in portrait types screens

1638698
msbuild	nant
i would recommend using nant or msbuild for that purpose but powershell or a simple batch-file will also do

1638705
javascript	dom
you may also want to look into things like jquery prototype etc and attach to the ready handler which execute javascript code after the dom has been fully loaded which is an appropriate place for much javascript code

1638709
fclose	fopen
there s no lock to make sure that the fgets is not called at the same time as the fclose fopen

1638710
instances	private
above example is bad oo design which should be avoid by making a good practice providing private or protected access modifiers to the instances variables and access through the javabeans compliant accessor methods take the form

1638722
constructor	object
recently i searched for a way to initializer a complex object without passing a lot of parameter to the constructor

1638734
function-call	inline
if this were something similar inline and or there was a function-call where the return flag is set then one might possibly be at a points where one could start to justify it but not as it is

1638740
difference	count
why is there a difference between the rocount in properties and the selected count

1638743
project-management	scrum
can scrum and project-management live together

1638763
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods inorder to register the postback or callback data for validation

1638801
shutdown	restart
also is there a difference in time if you shutdown vs restart it and load your solution and try building again before you do anything else

1638804
http-redirect	postdata
no it s not possible to have postdata follow an http-redirect

1638813
docking	toolbar
gradually mfc started to get external control libs support particularly docking toolbar libs .so my tools like 3d model viewers and level editor all looked pretty sweet

1638813
silverlight	wpf
it s fast easy has great tool support excellent 3rd party libs a huge growing community is now cross platform mono and will enable you to move between all current emerging microsoft technologies asp.net wpf silverlight wcf etc

1638828
any	set
any way to set the permissions of this before before i open it or how would i go about doing this

1638837
terminate	timeout
.so each client proxy - in your case each thread - gets a separate instances of the service class which will keep serving that particular client as long as the session isn t terminate by the client by a timeout or by a fault

1638840
value	field
it is not getting fancy and resolving the foreign model named blog in this case to a field value blog

1638842
cvs	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	revision	svn
there are two kind of revision control centralized svn cvs and distribute mercurial git bazaar

1638846
webserver	upload
at one extreme you can pay for your very own physical server install your own operating systemd like windows or linux install your own python you own webserver like apache or iis your own django libs your own database like mysql etc and then upload your website to that

1638846
webserver	upload
at the other extreme you can pay for an account on a shared-hosting service where someone else has done all the setup of the os the python the webserver etc and all you need to do is upload your website code

1638861
perl	ruby	perl	c++
i ve used both svn and git extensively with plt scheme c++ ruby perl and shell-scripts and they both work fine with all of those languages

1638861
bazaar	git	darcs	svn
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1638866
macports	fink
avoid sw and opt as they are often controlled by fink and macports the two popular unix package-managers on os x

1638875
subclassing	base-class
another option would be to make a single richer base interface class - which has all the interfaces you need and then to simply defined a default no-op implementation for those in the base-class which returns false or throw to indicate that it isn t supported by the subclassing in question else the subclassing would have provided a functional implementation for this member function

1638888
sql-server	mysql
note that mysql syntax and overall ideology are very different from those of sql-server

1638906
biblatex	bibtex
as a side note the biblatex documentation also contains a section about encoding issues with traditional bibtex â 2.4.3

1638915
any	set
the filtering is then set to search on any of four of the field

1638916
ienumerator	ienumerable
since ienumerable has a single function which returns an ienumerator it can be used to iterate the collections multiple time multiple passes

1638920
shutdown	restart
but very occasionally the mongrel process will shutdown and then fail to restart with the following error

1638925
build-process	msbuild
as for the benchmarking try building with msbuild with the following options it will printing statistics on build-process at the end

1638929
onmouseover	mouseenter
secondly both onmouseenter and onmouseover fire .when the mouseenter the boundary of an elements

1638933
contains	elements
in other words the onmouseenter event does not fire .when the user move the mouse pointers over elements contains by the object whereas onmouseover does fire

1638965
directory	folder
in my head i envisaged having each skins in a directory under the views directory in the folder structure then maintaining a data structure which maps hostname to skins directory

1638980
return-type	arguments
it doesn t necessarily specify the return-type it just provides a value for the templates arguments a

1639000
python	java
don t know about googlebot most likely c or python but there are some good ones out there in both java and .net

1639001
python	java
the very earliest versioning backrub was written in python and java

1639022
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
we had this problem and it was very much firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser safari ie8 google-chrome etc were all fine

1639042
pkcs#7	pkcs#5
this is not my area but it looks like on the client you have pkcs#7 but on the server you have pkcs#5

1639043
entity-framework	nhibernate
a lot has been talked about entity-framework first versioning on the web also on stackoverflow and it is clear that it was not a good choice .when we already have better alternative like nhibernate

1639043
entity-framework	nhibernate
but i can t find a good comparison of entity-framework 4 and nhibernate

1639043
entity-framework	nhibernate
we can say that today nhibernate is the leader among all .net orms but can we expect entity-framework 4 to displace nhibernate from this positioning

1639054
put	get
you can also put some condition-wait pthread_cond_wait instead of just some nanosleep which will get signaled .when intended .when a new file gets fopened

1639070
any	set
however .when i need to make the match using a variables for b01 and that the variables is set with a selected statement i don t get any results returned

1639087
value	field
you d have one model answer with two field one value which is a string

1639088
instances	private
as a result inorder to get at the invocation list you ll have to inspect the private variables which is namedd by the compiler unless of course you use the longhand syntax yourself and know the named of the instances variables

1639095
malloc	free
does this mean that malloc tried to allocate memory that was not free to allocate

1639113
arrays	loops
as loops ranges from 0 to test.length-1 the compiler can tell that the index variables can never be outside of the arrays .so it can remove the range checked .when accessing the arrays by index

1639113
arrays	loops
in the first loops the compiler can t do the connection between loopss and the arrays .so it has to checked the index against the boundaries for each item that is accessed

1639129
debugging	trace	logging	trace
.when i configure logging for my server via the weblogic console my domain - environment - servers - my server - logging tab i set minimum severity to log at trace and severity level for the server logfile to debugging both are options under advanced

1639129
debugging	trace	logging	trace
logging is at the trace level which is why i couldn t see any jpa logging even after enabling debugging for the jpa subsystem via the debugging tab

1639129
configuration	logging	logging	trace
inorder to see kodo trace logging in the server log i had to open up my configuration.xml file user_projects domains my domain configuration configuration.xml and remove the elements under

1639129
logging	trace
consequently i am baffled as to why the weblogic console doesn t provide trace as an option for the severity level selected boxes under the advanced section of the logging tab

1639136
visual-studio	release-mode
2 are you timing this in release-mode outside of visual-studio

1639137
jndi	jdbc
it allows you to have a hierarchy of files or other configuration sources like xml jndi jdbc etc.

1639160
parsing	comma
my answer was to do the parsing by comma function

1639186
dependency-injection	inject
what the dependency-injection is all about it to help you to well inject these dependencies in your code

1639196
any	set
.when i set up openid on my site i do not get any .profile information

1639228
versioning	upgrade
set of upgrade versioning of dual

1639235
versioning	upgrade
in addition to the modules in vanilla perl strawberry will also include the entire dependency tree for bundle cpan as well as an additional set of upgrade versioning of dual cpan core modules that have win32-specific fixed

1639238
if-statement	loops
what this means is if you declare a variables inside a loops or an if-statement it will be available to the entire function

1639263
background-color	transparency
my .solution was to set the background-color to a default color then tile a square grey image with a transparency corner knocked out over the top - .so it show the background through it

1639274
versioning	upgrade
this is also useful if you want to be able to at runtime upgrade a types to a new versioning ie load a remote assembly and reload it later

1639314
implements	abstract
i though that such scenario will be best implements if i abstract the file persistent operation to the following interface

1639318
player	movie
you cannot customize the movie player in any significant way since doing .so might cause it to fall off the hardware decode path and it is entirely possible apple doesn t even have a .software decode on the device

1639321
dependency-injection	inject
this is dependency-injection where you inject the dependencies into the object

1639326
python	perl
finally if speed really keeps being an issue you could try perl or python instead of bash

1639328
racket	scheme
updates plt scheme is now known as racket which also has opengl binding

1639335
difference	datediff
the datediff function in mysql gets the difference in days

1639349
32-bit	64bit
i know this is a strange questions but i was wondering if it was possible to make a 32-bit pointers in 64bit compile on solaris using g++

1639349
32-bit	64bit
i was wondering if it was possible to make a 32-bit pointers within my 64bit compiled object

1639370
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i have written quite a few articles over on dotnetslackers that specifcally walk you through from a simple asp.net-mvc application where the webpage connect directly to the datasource think standards ms tutorial all the way through to a full distribute n-tier styles application where the presentation connect via wcf to business layer allowing business components to exist on seperate servers which then connect to a datasource through a pluggable data-access-layer this last couple of articles i am still writing

1639384
32-bit	64bit
and if you could what would you do with an 32-bit pointers on an 64bit systemd

1639388
32-bit	64bit
if you have pointers types there then you shouldn t make it 32-bit in 64bit program

1639401
32-bit	64bit
it does not make sense to need a 32-bit pointers on a 64bit machine

1639425
text-editor	editor
you should defined your application path and then use find and replace in a text-editor most editor have that feature

1639435
any	set
for this reason removing onevalue from a dense arrays is unlikely to releas any memory but after a sufficient set of elements are removed the implementation will likely convert to a sparse-matrix representation to save memory overall

1639454
selected	button
if for some reason the row is not selected you can assign a unique tag to every button upon creation and then

1639457
create-table	alter-table
some testing seems to show that a user in this new proddb can interact with tables normally with appropriate grant and cannot alter the schema alter-table create-table drop-table etc

1639467
ironpython	ironruby
basically if you want to ports your own dynamic-languages to .net like ironpython and ironruby did you will have to use expression-trees

1639483
mstest	nunit
you could either use mstest or nunit as the test runner however a good rules of thumb would be to separate these tests out into their own respective assembly or category .so they are not ran every time your fast unit tests are ran

1639499
controllers	routes
what i found is that a couple of routes map to the same controllers action combinations

1639514
openoffice.org	apache-poi
one workaround would be the apache java apache-poi libs -- generator the document with openoffice.org then open and modify it with the apache-poi microsoft office api --

1639529
output	mode
i think you want to use the for xml auto mode to shape your output

1639533
value	field
i created two asp.net hidden field then in javascript set the value of these field.

1639548
put	get
and if you still need java to play with that data put it in a place where java can get to it

1639552
uitextview	uilabel
if you need scrolling which is probably why you used a uitextview and not a uilabel then you need to do more work

1639556
attributes	properties
the class-library is setup with unity and several of my classes have dependency attributes on their properties i m exclusively using properties setter injections for this

1639569
logout	login
security enhancements programmatic login logout

1639572
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
i can t speak for everybody but the shell and editor that i use support some nifty features for debugging code-folding syntax-highlighting multiple runspaces etc

1639589
callback	methods
instead you go on to something else but you set up a methods called the callback that will fire .when the results come back

1639596
pointers	stack
that ll put pointers instead of value on the call stack

1639598
put	get
there is no need to put this in + void initializer for a singleton since it will only get called .when you first attempt to use the class

1639611
macros	vba
i would transfer all my code to vb and after its working like you have your vba macros start making libs out of the common stuff

1639613
constructor	object
i think the problem is that the compiler can t guarantees that stack-pointer will be properly aligned .when it goes to create a _vector3d object on stack to pass to the constructor

1639613
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit systemd stack-pointers are usually guaranteed to be 4-byte aligned .sometimes 8 byte aligned and on 64bit systemd i think stack-pointer is usually obly guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned .so the compiler doesn t know .when it goes to call the constructor that stack will be aligned properly

1639613
pointers	stack
note a downside to dynamic 8-byte stack alignment with respect to performance is that frame pointers omission oy effectively gets turned off

1639620
custom-attributes	custom-attribute
if an id or model named is include as a custom-attribute arrays we can quickly ignore any dlls that don t even have custom-attributes and then further ignore any that do not model the vehicle of interest

1639638
click	mouse
then whenever your hook is triggers the hook will tell you which windows the user is click on and which mouse operation is being performed

1639653
attributes	properties
i have a collections of ienumerable and each one has a different attributes value that corresponds to a different properties on my business object

1639655
shell	bash
this will be very handy if you are good at linux bash shell scripting but not good at windows batch-file

1639660
httpd.conf	.htaccess
try adding to your .htaccess or preferably your httpd.conf and restart

1639660
unique	words
in other words a unique resource should have a single canonical definitive url

1639680
getter	setter
without compiling it i already see a problem with properties that the code has to checked whether interface defined getter and or setter and verify the right methods s instead of blindly assuming the getter

1639714
contains	elements
which returns an linq extension methods almost always return collections and not single instances contains all elements value whose named attributes equals named

1639743
httpwebrequest	webclient
i tried both httpwebrequest and webclient and both of them throw exception-handling

1639752
string.format	stringbuilder
i would also suggest you consider using string.format or a stringbuilder in lieu of concatenation string fragments individually

1639753
protected	public
visibility public package protected private is important too because it defined who can access the actual methods

1639753
noclassdeffounderror	classpath
noclassdeffounderror usually means something is wrong with classpath you need to actually add your class to the classpath to be able to run it

1639758
deployment	install
it does not need any special software install on your deployment servers

1639761
32-bit	64bit
one other factors to consider is that 32-bit addresses are half the size of 64bit addresses and this has a significant effect on how much data can be caching

1639761
any	set
.so once a page has been move out of a .app s working set it s very likely that any caching line as.sociated with it would be invalidated

1639781
directory	folder
checked the permissions on the files and directory in the project building folder

1639791
contains	elements	contains	set
to your .details class and make sure the contains div is a block elements and its background is set to gray

1639818
required	checked
to help solve your required task do some addition checked in your regex for the one or more dots don t forget to escape them

1639821
.when	ready
only .when you have the tasty cookies dough ready given the compiler the dough types can you cut the cookies and cook it

1639829
derived-class	base-class
an interface might be implicit defined or explicit defined or might be implements by a derived-class and you re using a base-class reference

1639860
directory	folder
i am using a web setup-project to install my asp.net .app which needs to write to a folder that exists under the main virtual directory folder

1639865
show	next
to show the image on the next page load just link to the large versioning and resize it via css

1639868
put	get
to get it to map on startup you can put this in a batch-file

1639868
value	field
named it something non-descriptive and then modify it by right click it and then just put the path to the batch-file into the value data field

1639871
put	get
if there is too much finish put on your mockups you will get hung up on the big blue button syndrome where people are more concerned with how a button looks and less concerned with what it does

1639876
value	field
you could do something clever like generator one random value in each recording and using a hash of the field named and the random value to produce an iv for that field.

1639876
value	field
exist only two possible value m1 or m2 for a field f

1639876
value	field
let re be the random value used for this recording and let f be the field for which eve can submit her own value v

1639883
implements	abstract
the first class requestinfo is abstract and is actually implements by the other types in the union

1639884
rvm	gem
i was playing with the pik gem rvm for windows and ran into that problem for ruby 1.9.1 and after copying those dll files everything worked perfectly

1639897
python	java
i m not sure how much help this will be but the following works for me in python using the pyfacebook wrapper sorry not familiar with the java methods

1639922
web-config	app-config
also the program might be using typess from app-config configuration file or web-config asp.net dynamic types loading

1639930
linux	unix
just be aware that on unix linux your username passwd can be seen by anyone that can run ps -ef cmd if you place it directly on the cmd-line

1639930
linux	unix
i usually recommend creating a file or using here document .so you can protect the username passwd from being viewed with ps -ef cmd in unix linux

1639938
ngen	aot
you user might choose to use aot which is mono s counterpart of ngen

1639938
reflection	runtime
or subtle difference in how newer runtime versioning handle things like serialization remoting security reflection etc

1639940
authentication	login
if your site has authentication and the double-page_load is happening on your login page it s possible that your login.aspx page is using resources outside out the anonymous user s rights

1639943
logging	trace
if you have a running python which wasn t built with any sort of trace or logging mechanism and you want to see what it s doing internally then two options are

1639951
contains	elements
okay .so since split creates a new object list contains at least one elements you should do

1639957
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate and entity-framework are really for two different audiences in my mind

1639966
acceptance-testing	bdd
.when starting with bdd or having executable acceptance-testing i recommend to first understand what s in a story how to defined the requirements

1639982
quadtree	r-tree
if you roll your own you can do a lot worse than picking the r-tree or quadtree algorithms

1640038
transformation	normals
that s because you want the normals to stay perpendicular to the surface after transformation for reference it required a multiplication by the inverse-transpose of the model-view in the general case but that can be simplified in many cases

1640038
vertex-shader	shader
inside the shader you then have to multiplying each vertex positioning by that matrix and pass that to the vertex-shader positioning output

1640039
radio-button	hidden-field	radio-button	selected
since 7.x i think a surrogate field gets generator as a hidden-field in your html that you ll be able to reset .so after deselecteding all of the radio-button options you can then clear out the surrogate field and you should then avoid having to selected a none of the above option

1640068
worksheet	excel
i am tasked to develop a very simple web layer for a very complex algorithm that is implements as an excel worksheet

1640068
python	ruby
after perusing this site my best shot is to automate excel using python or ruby under windows and run the algorithm there --we are a ruby shop but i ve found more info for python

1640078
rollback	commit
if there were transactional in progress .when you shut down the server and inno did not commit rollback them cleanly then you might need to use 6

1640090
display	outline
the following blog .post by josã gallardo salazar outline one approach to determine how much spaces is required to display a given string of text including any required word-wrapping etc

1640100
switching	screens
if these are two separate texturess in memory and i draw a grass tile then a gravel tile then a grass tile to the screens the gpu will load the grass textures then switching it out to load the gravel textures then switching the grass textures back in to draw another grass tile

1640100
put	get	sprite-sheet	tile
the easiest way to get around this is to have a sprite-sheet where you put your grass and gravel tile into one textures and just tell spritebatch to draw from a different area on the same textures each time

1640106
uitextview	uilabel
it sounds like what you actually want is a giant uilabel inside a uiscrollview and not a uitextview

1640131
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you really want to utilize ddd and the repository-pattern go for entity-framework or even better nhibernate

1640174
constructor	object
boost deserialization of contains object fails .when performed from a constructor but succeeds otherwise

1640182
exception-handling	try-catch
i had been using a try-catch to capture the exception-handling and log it to the list as well

1640183
environment	building
the building will create a folder with everything you need for that environment including the correctly configure web-config files

1640185
registration	login
comment on this article by signing in or registering which links to the login and registration form once they have registered they should be directed back to the comment form .so they can leave a comment

1640196
webserver	upload
you could use mod_porter to let the webserver handle the upload instead of your .app

1640197
silverlight	wpf
i think that s primarily because silverlight makes .so much more sense for most people who want the benefits of wpf dotnet in a browser since their apps can be cross platform with silverlight

1640198
constructor	object
my guess would be that you triggers undefined behavior .when the constructor of innerthing passes implicit its this to the printing methods of an anonymous subclassing of innerthing while the object is not fully construct

1640200
bittorrent	torrent
if you are working with p2p data transfer in .net please take a look at mono torrent that s an open source implementation of the bittorrent protocols

1640200
bittorrent	torrent
you can either embed the whole mono torrent libs and use bittorrent as your underlying protocols or take the relevant parts of it for your own project

1640205
contains	set
for instances rfc 1321 contains the following set of test data

1640217
triggers	insert
create triggers mytesttriggers before insert on personteam

1640221
put	get
if you think of this as like a state monad execution one instruction followed by the next then a put will send the state value backwards in time to any preceeding get

1640237
constructor	object
it is dangerous to invoke overrides methods from a superclass constructor as they will be called before the subclass-part of the object is initializer

1640237
value	field
i suspect the reason bstring is treated differently is that its value is known at compile-time which allows the compiler to inline the field access in the subclassing making the time that field is initializer irrelevant

1640244
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language-features

1640248
postgresql	mysql
i need to move a database with a django schema from postgresql to mysql running on amazon s rdf

1640250
selected	button
selected add existing item in your web application s context menu selected the user-controls and instead of click the add button click the arrow in that button and selected add as link

1640259
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
.when working with speech recognition the best thing is to work in windows-vista or windows 7 cause they have microsoft sapi speech api 5.3 and will soon have 5.4 and that gives a big difference in performance comparing with sapi 5.1 from windows-xp

1640275
mouseleave	mouseout
and because this is mouseleave rather than mouseout it will work .when mouseleaving both the li and it s child submenu..

1640277
keyboard	mouse
i wanted keyboard users to be able to have the same experience as mouse users .so i m duplicating the functionality found in my hover event handler in my focus and blur event handler

1640292
libcurl	zlib
libcurl required zlib

1640315
postgresql	mysql
if you backup your postgresql database and choose the insert cmd option you will end up with a text file of sql-insert statements that in theory you can run against a different sql database in this case mysql

1640315
fault-tolerance	scalability
personally i love the directions rds is heading though and look forwarding to the day i can treat a relational-database as a black-box and not have to worry about fault-tolerance and scalability like the amazon-simpledb product is now

1640333
environment	restart
the .app server in the live environment is restart after the rsync

1640336
contains	elements
in this example arr will contains two elements hello and world

1640336
contains	elements
without removeemptyentires it would have contains four elements hello world and

1640360
google-chrome	safari
i ve found how-to s on using a custom building of the webkit safari google-chrome etc engine to generator png screens

1640425
derived-class	base-class
you can t declare a base-class constructor in a derived-class

1640425
derived-class	base-class
to be able to clean up the derived-class correctly you should declare the base-class destructor as virtual

1640428
derived-class	base-class
the constructor of the derived-class gets called after the constructor of the base-class

1640430
arrays	loops
one is to create five arrayss one for each level of severity then loops over the the arrays and push the hash refs into the appropriate severity level arrays

1640466
sftp	ftp
with it you can browse edit ftp sftp webdav cloud files and amazon-s3

1640467
webforms	asp.net
one is to use pb 11 s ability to retarget an .app as an asp.net webforms .app but i really don t understand yet what its limitations are

1640472
children	nodes
i think what i m ideally looking for is something like the ability to do xpath queries on an xml streaming where the streaming parsing only parsing as far as necessary to return the next item in the result nodes set and all its attributes and children

1640479
hash	md5
you d only have to make sure that the digital-signature stays private just like the md5 hash

subclassing	nsobject	subclassing	ivar	nsobject	ivar
should i be subclassing uiview or subclassing nsobject and have an ivar of uiview

1640559
any	set
the problem with taking a whole chunks of html changing an elements and then reinserting is that any event handler set up on elementss that will be replace .when you reinsert the html will be lost .so it s more elegant and less cumber.some intrusive to simply manipulate the part of the dom that you need to

1640575
constructor	object
this is .so that the derived constructor can count on the base object being fully initializer before it tries to use any properties of the base

1640600
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
after you create your collectionview you can set filtering and sorting and grouping

1640605
cosine	sine
for instances in x86 architecture there is a single instruction that computes sine and cosine

1640632
drupal	django
there are a lot of frameworks out there such as asp.net-mvc symphony django drupal and many more

1640636
subplot	contour
i want each contour s value and color to be shared between all subplot but each time i add a new subplot the contour value are recomputed as show in the image below .so any compari.son between them is meaningless

1640645
arrays	loops
you can split the arrays into grouping using on loops index

1640654
contains	elements
.so to get the index of an elements in all the elementss in the with id navbar we can use the fact that each is contains within a therefore the index in each case will be the same

1640668
constructor	object
constructor initialization list execution order guarantees that while the most derived object s constructor will be the first constructor to start execution it will be the last constructor to complete

1640668
constructor	object
.when you initializer an object the most derived constructor that matches the construction call gets called first

1640668
virtual-method	destructor
as a general rules of thumb if you already have any virtual-method the cost of making the destructor virtual is negligible and is a safe .net

1640674
key-events	keydown
in ie if flash has focus and receives a keydown event it does not appear to bubble the event up through the dom i can t capture the event by listening on document however the same listener can capture key-events from html siblings .so i know my listener is working

1640682
required	checked
other devices may required different things cts xon xoff .so checked that device s manual

1640720
strtol	atoi
.when using the function atoi or strtol or similar functions for that matter how can you tell if the int conversion failed or if the cstring that was being converted was a 0

1640720
contains	any
for what i m doing 0 is an acceptable value and the cstring being converted may contains any numbers of 0 s

1640721

environment	building
this is designed to building source control into ssms in other words it doesn t required dbas to leave the comfort zone of their management environment

1640763
worksheet	excel
an easy way to calculate delta is to copy the sys.dm_os_wait_stats value into excel worksheet and use vlookup to subtract corresponding value

1640771
configuration	environment
the configuration and everything are the same except the non-working one is hosted at rackspace cloud environment

1640779

getter	setter
i am currently using xcode for some c++ development i need to generator getter setter

1640848
getter	setter
the only way i know is generator getter setter in objective-c styles

1640852
constructor	object
if a non-gui object constructor wires a local event handling methods to the event field of an object on a different thread is it possible for said event handling methods to be called before the constructor is finished

1640855
required	checked
well you could certainly spit back a 400 bad-request if the request body fails a dtd checked but i wouldn t required the dtd reference to be present

1640856
any	set
any suggestions on how to set this up properly

1640862

profiling	debugging
the first one generator profiling information for gprof you may need it and the second one include debugging information in executable

1640896
getter	setter
it sounds like you re just looking for a way to reduce the hassle of writing getter setter properties synthesize statements all the time right

1640902
hosts-file	hosts
1 edit your etc hosts-file on windows it is something like c windows system32 drivers etc hosts and you might need to create it

1640916
google-docs	spreadsheet
a spreadsheet possibly on google-docs

1640921
sql-server	postgresql
if there s no specific functionality needed in sql-server you could equally go with postgresql

1640924
put	get
get the mysql connector-j jar put it in your classpath and read the docs

1640926
contains	elements
i ve been experimenting the same issue and after a while of messing around i found that if you have an elements contains inside your main div with relative positioning it will cause ie to open the accordion jerky

1640935
fancybox	lightbox
i gave up on fancybox as it was not practical .so i have opted for lightbox

1640940
hide	show
in my program i toggle the registry value of hidden-files to tell explorer whether to hide or show them

1640944
any	set
donâ t set time limits on any of the

1640948
contains	elements
where matches will contains an arrays of the matches it found .so you can grab whatever elements you want from the arrays with

1640957
pixels	line
if i set the white line s i see a one pixels grey gradient and a one pixels black line below it

1640959
http	ssl
the only added info i can supply we are using apache mod_proxy_balancer along with http in front of our mongrels however this problem was occuring before we turned on ssl

1640960
project-management	scrum
your question doesn t make sense since scrum is a project-management framework but here are some things to consider

1640964
click	mouse
test it and try to click on the button 1 and 2 inside the mc following the mouse

1640970
vb.net	vb6
i realize that vb.net and asp.net are the successors of their seemingly obsolete classic counterparts but i have noticed that some job descriptions still list vb6 and classic asp as requirements

1640981
vb.net	vb6
whether you should learn vb6 or vb.net depends on your goal

1640988
twitter	tweets
i m writing an application that utilizes the twitter api and it has a tweets class which has all the properties of a single tweets text sender date time source etc

1641008
value	field
is storing named value pairs where the user can specify additional widget field a good idea

1641008
value	field
.so i want to let each user building a new types of data field that will apply to all of their widget and then specify value for each custom field in each widget

1641027
selected	cell
.when i tap the wherever on the table view i d like cell to get selected and perform action tableview didselectrowatindexpath

1641034
macros	basic
maybe checked this wikipedia article as a preview btw depending on the assembler you use in particular if this is a macros assembler you can get much of this mechanics taken care of. no rush to do all this first get familiar with basic assembly

1641044
spaces	output
what you should be doing instead is making sure that the spaces are removed from the response before it gets stored in the output caching

1641050
gethashcode	equals
it would be possible to do with reflection the mbunit test framework does something along these line but with a heavy performance penalty and a good chance that it wouldn t do quite what you expected anyway and you should implements or equals and gethashcode by hand

1641091
malloc	free
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1641121
arguments	undefined
the elements arguments should be undefined because you re passing nothing to the updates function

1641124
where-clause	sql
obviously this is because the sql execute is not passing in the additional where-clause unless i specify it in the mapping

1641125
python	java
roughly the reverse situation wrt .app engine where python been around for a year longer than java and .so is still more mature and complete even though java s catching up

1641125
python	java
.so in any situation where you d be at all undecided between java and python if the deployment was due to h.appen on .some general purpose platform such as linux i think the maturity and completeness arguments could sway you towards python for deployment on .app engine and towards java for deployment on android

1641130
realloc	free
the points of realloc is that it tries to merge the block of memory with a free one behind that if possible

1641132
web-applications	scalability
don t know about books but if you want information regarding real world up to the bleeding edges scalability web-applications and architecture then highscalability is a must read

1641135
mkv	avi
i have a site that allows people to upload large video files in various formats avi mp4 mkv and flv

1641136
worksheet	excel
you can then do your calculations in your com object and even pass in the excel worksheet etc you wish to manipulate if required

1641149
google-docs	spreadsheet
if you need to work from home take the spreadsheet or use google-docs and .post its with you

1641166
csv	xml
instead of generator a words document i d rather use a java libs like itext to produce a pdf document more portable or even better the jasperreport report libs that can output report in a wide range of formats pdf xml html csv xls rtf txt as suggested by bigbrother82 in a comment

1641168
expression	evaluation
if the conditional are complex expression then i might assign the expression to appropriately named variables before evaluation the if-statement to avoid having to recompute the value in each if

1641169
communication	messages
first this messages usually means the machines aren t on the same domain and thus can t communication using windows security

1641169
credentials	security
messages security with windows client without credentials negotiation

1641170
realloc	free
ideally a realloc would simply see if there s enough free memory beyond the current block and if .so just adjust the arena data-structures to expand the current block in-place

1641170
malloc	free
by doing a malloc free if you have 100k in the arena with a single 60k block allocated calling your mm_realloc to adjust the size to 50k will fail

1641189
versioning	upgrade
relying on this or that methods of some other object being atomicity in a given implementation and versioning typically leaves you at the mercy of this atomicityity not being a strong guarantee just an implementation artifact for the specific points release c you re using and therefore subtle very hard-to-debug race conditional being introduced with any upgrade or ports to other python implementation

1641189
queue	fifo
if your profiling tells you that queue s strong and general guarantees are being a bottleneck for your specific producer-consumer use case make your own simpler guaranteed-to-be-threadsafe fifo queue streaming

1641190
signals	sigint
you have to catch the sigint signals we are talking pthreads right

1641219
python	java
i m coming from the java world and reading bruce eckels python 3 patterns recipes and idioms

1641219
protected	public
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641236
python	java
python mangles the named of variables like __foo .so that they re not easily visible to code outside the class that contains them although you can get around it if you re determined enough just like you can get around java s protections if you work at it

1641238
scala	java
here is a blog .post describing how to use the java libs for schema validation in scala

1641242
spaces	output
all the solutions i m showing here ensure only o 1 extra spaces is taken beyond the spaces obviously o n that s needed for the input list and the output dictionary of course

1641284
perl	ruby
i tried another language that also has perl re syntax ruby and it returned the expected string

1641296
execution	exit
what i am finding is that .when a tah begins but before it exit a timer event can begin process which is pre-empting the mousedown handler halfway through execution

1641305
protected	public
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641305
python	java
as a python and java programmer i ve found that private and protected are very very important design concepts

1641305
python	java
but as a practical matter in tens of thousands of line of java and python i ve never actually used private or protected

1641327
variables	boolean
a workaround to this issue could be to set a boolean flag in a public static-class variables singleton styles perhaps. call it ignoretick for example

1641330
wait	hang
right now if i use then cc .net hang while it wait for the process to end which will never come by definition

1641334
parsing	comma
1 input the categoryid as a comma separated string that i parsing on the php end

1641359
any	set
using this concept you can include or exclude function-templatess from the candidate set based on any properties of the templates arguments

1641381
show	next
like .when application starts it may show first 400 enteries in datagrid then the next 400 hundred are extraction until all the 72 000 rows are extraction

1641384
arrays	loops
the disadvantage is that it creates a lot of garbage allocation temporary arrays and may also be slower if used in a tight loops

1641398
put	get
this allowed me to put per-module tests in their own test.py file .so they didn t get mixed up with the rest of my application code

1641413
digits	zero
what do you want to get from a user who enters 0001-01-01 as the date that is they entered 4 digits for the year but the first three were zero

1641420
authentication	login
i did a flash application that has a login form in flash and authentication in php

1641440
sql-server	mysql
this should work at least in mysql and ms sql-server but reverse isn t standards and might not be portable to other branding of rdbms

1641472
value	field	subclassing	accessor
and then you can simply map the value accessor to one of those field in each subclassing

1641472
mongodb	couchdb
something like mongodb or couchdb would rendering this problem moot

1641482
myspace	twitter
in this case it might make sense to create a generics extractor interface class and then have subclassing for twitter myspace facebook etc but this really depends on how site-specific the extraction is

1641494
linux	unix
amazingly unix and linux do not actually have a place to set global environment variables

1641494
shell	tcsh
but anyone with a csh or tcsh shell won t see it and i don t believe csh has a global initialization file

1641505
shell	bash
shell is started bash reads and

1641508
shell	bash
nb bash is not the only shell on your systemd

1641527
windows-mobile	windows-ce
since you mentioned the words c# and device in your question i m assuming you mean a windows-ce or windows-mobile device

1641549
arrays	loops
for i has the advantage of designating the bounds and order of arrays items in loops and avoids a bug you can encounter with arrayss

1641569
configuration	environment
if all login service use pam and all login service have session required pam_env.so in their respective configuration-files then all login sessions will have some environment variables set as specified in pam_env s configuration file

1641592
dialog	pop-up
if i understand you re question properly you have a pop-up windows or dialog or some such and you need to retrieve information from it after it has been closed or some cmd is issued

1641602
toolchain	gnu
here is yet another link that can help guide you through the process of creating a shared libs using gcc and other parts of the gnu toolchain

1641611
subclassing	inherited
specifically how do you defined a class with a few field then a bunch of subclassing that inherited from it and each add their own new field and be able to pass them around interchangeably as function arguments

1641611
pointers	stack
and especially how can you do it .when c++ allows you to allocate object on stack .so you might not even have pointers to hide behind

1641627
python	c++
python is multi-paradigms but its central paradigms is oop much like say c++

1641634
function-pointers	virtual-functions
virtual-functions are normally done with a special table of function-pointers that is part of each object a rudimentary sort of what is my types recording

1641657
selected	checkbox
the value are come from depending on the checkbox selected

1641675
getter	setter
on an unrelated note you should have any non-boilerplate implementation in your dp getter and setter

1641675
getter	setter
remember that the binding and styling systemd will bypass the getter and setter and talk directly to the underlying storage

1641685
checkbox	listbox	checkbox	textbox	listbox	textbox
textbox comboboxes listbox checkbox have a maximum of 1 item in their controls collections the attached labels but if the labels isn t attached they won t even have that .so .controls 0 will throw an error

1641688
gtk	gdk	glib	gtk	glib	gdk
if you want a good reference on how this stuff works take a look at the glib gdk gtk open source libs

1641697
required	checked
you may want to rerun the enhancer and checked for errors in the output. has no table in the database but the operation required it

1641702
constructor	object	getter	setter
you can simulate an object by writing constructor setter getter and destructor with the hidden this-pointer called out explicit

1641711
triggers	insert
i used triggers and stored-procedures on the destination side since i insert updates a view .so that i could actually send data to several tables in one query

1641729
selected	textbox
.when user selected the recording and press enter that recording should be entered in textbox

1641729
click	mouse
and also .when user click the recording from mouse that recording should be entered in textbox

1641732
aggregate-functions	sum
grouping by will be more helpful if you want to use some aggregate-functions like count or sum

1641737
aggregate	grouping
grouping by should be used to apply aggregate operators to each grouping

1641751
getter	setter
no exposing non-api methods or allowing unfettered access to public variables - everything should be done with setter and getter

1641756
fontfamily	font-size
if i know the font-size 12 and the fontfamily calibri is there a way to determine the length in pixels a given string will take after it will be rendering

1641756
lookup	any
are there any lookup tables for this purpose to determine the length in php code itself

1641757
attributes	properties
in terms of poco xmlserializer has an overloaded ctor that accepts all the attributes you could ever want to add to avoid having to add them to your object-model - but it does still required a public parameterless constructor and only works on public read write field properties

1641760
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of object means that there is a reference which wasnt initializer before it was used

1641773
proxy-server	apache
if you find you need something a bit more programmable or robust the next free step up is definitely jmeter which also happens to be an apache foundation project and is a java client application that can recording a series of user actions on your site via built-in proxy-server and then replay them for x users n minutes y iterator etc.

1641794
.war	jar
the -0 option tells the jar cmd to not compress the member files .when creating the .war file

1641794
.war	jar
edit depending on how the .war file is structured it may also be necessary to use jar -0 .

1641805
subtract	time
the thing that got me confused is every time something gets push ed into stack stack-pointer gets subtract

1641806
python	lua	python	java
it depends on your preferred programming language the main language for android is java but it also supports scripting languages like python and lua

1641821
derived-class	base-class
in overload-resolution .when faced with a choice of resolving a parameter to a base-class or a derived-class the compiler will always choose the most derived-class if it fits

1641821
derived-class	base-class
this enables overloads which take a derived-class not being ambiguous with overloads which take the base-class

1641821
derived-class	base-class
since there s an implicit-conversion from any derived-class to its base but not vice-versa the rules above mean that any matching dervied-class overload always beats out a base-class parameter in an overload

1641825
local-variables	nested-function
now at the risk of adding more material for confusion another important elements of stack management is the concept of a stack frame which is a convenient way of storing the parameters to a function and the local-variables that correspond to the overall context of nested-function call

1641829
double	int
the following is thanks to dribeas the compiler is not allowed to make implicit types conversions during templates deduction .so by passing a complex with t being double and then another t being int .when trying to match the function treating t as double causes the second arguments to mis-match and vice-versa

1641834
configuration	environment
we have done this by adding a configuration parameter that allows the user named to be passed via url only .when configure in a stress load-testing environment

1641837
subtract	time
the thing that got me confused is every time something gets push ed into stack stack-pointer gets subtract

1641846
filtering	grouping
then .when you go to display a list of recording to a user you filtering based on the conjunction of the two grouping

1641847
instrumentation	profiling
don t add instrumentation code yourself - use a profiling to do this for you

1641852
report-designer	crystal-reports
i have devoloped an application in visual-foxpro 9.0 using crystal-reports 10 as report-designer

1641852
export	report
my problem is while export it in pfd through report viewer how do i set default file named for the exported file

1641853
double	int
the route from an int via a double to a is just marginally too contorted convoluted for the c++ language to follow it according to the standards and with the huge complications already arising from free-wheeling conversions and cohercions it s hard to criticize that aspects of the standards

1641853
double	int
i guess the super-special case of allowing uncasted int s as operands to its operators was just not deemed frequent and important enough to warrant specifying templates specialization for that extremely individual case considering how trivially easy it is for the programmer to cast the int to double .when that s what they actually want

1641884
export	report
i use xml file as the datasource for the report but .when the data increases jasper report export empty file in only for pdf format .when i reduce the data content it export the data available correctly

1641915
getter	setter
is the only possibility to work with getter setter or alternatively implements the class as an normals inner class that is not direclty implementss

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is .when i opened the report inside mozilla firefox 3.5.4 and google-chrome 4.0.233 it showed me the binary string content of the pdf file instead of triggers the adobe acrobat plugins

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked this by putting a pdf file in the htdoc folder and call it from firefox and google-chrome it worked just fine

1641945
put	get
but what if i want to get the named of the hotel with an id of 1 and put it in the url and replace spaces with hyphens

1641950
hide	show
for state a hide this field in this control for state b show this icons etc

1641959
openfire	ejabberd
may i know what integration technique that you folks use to implements external component to an existing xmpp server ejabberd or openfire

1641961

1641997
shell	bash
assuming you are running bash or a bash like shell do

1642004
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql

more formally adds the specified elements e to this set if the set contains no elements e2 such that e null

1642223
contains	elements	contains	set
if this set already contains the elements the call leaves the set unchanged and returns false

1642223

output	mode
.when you ar enot sure whether your job is execute in asynch mode you should implements some output to the console including timestamp

1642355
required	checked
getfilesize ex avoids the nitty gritty of handling 4gb file sizes and detection valid results but also required a file handle rather than a named and as of delphi 2009 at least i haven t checked 2010 isn t declare for you in the vcl anywhere you would have to provide your own import declaration

1642376
export	csv
in a few cmd you can go from having a csv file to interactive plot on the screens then to an image export in just about any format

1642413
python	c++
i can see the advantages if it were a heavyweight language like c++ etc but for python why does it make sense

1642415

bugzilla	trac
you cannot use it for example in bugzilla or trac

1642606
extends	super
it seems that the inner classloaderimpl by extends the classloader class and by not calling an explicit super constructor should reference as its parent classloader the systemd classloader

1642614
floor	ceil
i need to mimic the exact functionality of the ceil floor and round functions on bcmath numbers i ve already found a very similar question but unfortunately the answer provided isn t good enough for me since it lacks support for negative numbers and the precision arguments for the round function is missing

1642621
environment	execution
there is a very good rea.son if your program is distribute in an unsafe environment like the user computer execution a text file which is .so easy to modify is the doors open to many viruses

1642683
jquery	.post	put	get
anyways we put the logic of submission data from out site to the legacy site into a jquery plugins which handles any form elements in the form by escaping each value before .posting the form - actually the landing old page required the data in get format .so we just end up setting window.location to the resulting query-string - but i guess we might as well have submitted the form with a normals .post if we wanted to

1642695
administration	account
if you created an .app and set it to use google-accounts for authentication and you yourself use a google-.apps account you will not be able to authentication against your .app as an administration using that account even if you ve created a google-account for that email-address

1642695
administration	account
the workaround for now is to create a gmail account and add it as an administration of your .app using that whenever you need to authentication against your .app as an administration

1642712
any	set
is there any way to set a more complex mapping in a sharepoint .profile

selected	listbox
you set an itemsource on a listbox to get the data from persons and for each person in that list you want to selected other items depending on the social security numbers

1642793

the advantage of this is that you can get the desired form html via ajax generator by php and you can put the exact same html inside tags for those with deactivated javascript by calling the same php function to get the html

1642798
radio-button	button
i decided to change it .so that instead of closing the pop-up in the radio-button selectedindexchanged event i removed that and put the code in a button submit event

1642799
udp	tcp
i don t think i can improve on those definitions but let me attempt to explain it from socket programming perspective understanding that socket is the programming interface for tcp udp

1642799
udp	tcp
specifically if you program server sockets say in java you would notice how this connection-oriented and connection-less nature of tcp and udp respectively affects the programming model

1642815
textbox	button
i have this html page which is very simple it contains a textbox and a submit button what i want is .when typing something in the textbox and pressing enter the function in the onclientclick event of the button gets called

the next numbers to add must be different from all possible sums of the numberss already in the set including the empty sum which is 0 and can t combine with any combinations of numberss already present to produce a duplicates

1643002
attributes	properties
however unless all attributes and elements exist in your xml you re going to miss out on some properties

1643009
multiplication	division
the tostring should be slower than parsing since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643019
ubuntu	debian
but for ubuntu creating a debian package should suffice your needs here

1643021
interface-builder	iboutlet
you need to use iboutlet and ibaction if you are using interface-builder hence the ib prefix for your gui components

1643029
interface-builder	iboutlet
ibaction and iboutlet are used to hook up your interface made in interface-builder with your controllers

1643029
interface-builder	iboutlet
but in reality most of us use interface-builder once you want to get some interactivity going in your interface you will have to use ibaction and iboutlet

1643039
interface-builder	iboutlet
ibaction and iboutlet are macros defined to denote variables and methods that can be referred to in interface-builder

1643039
interface-builder	iboutlet
if you re not going to be using interface-builder at all then you don t need them in your code but if you are going to use it then you need to specify ibaction for methods that will be used in ib and iboutlet for object that will be used in ib

1643064
aggregate-functions	sum
i have grouping by clause everywhere where i use aggregate-functions sum

1643077
icollection	ienumerable
in my mind it is good to be aware of anything that implements icollection idictionary ienumerable and ilist

1643094
interface-builder	iboutlet
iboutlet and ibaction are purely there as markers that interface-builder looks for .when it parsing your code at design-time they don t have any affect on the code generator by the compiler

1643095
hide	show
this coupled with conditional-statements to show or hide data controls or the asp.net loginview control should allow you to do what you want

1643112

1643130
selected	button
the category selected button click handler

1643140
exception-handling	try-catch
the simplest way would be to wrap the call in a try-catch block and log the exception-handling

1643145
required	checked
basically what i wish to do for each request is checked to see if there is a cookies and if .so show their named on the screens .somewhere if not and the page required the user to be logged in redirect them to a login page

1643153
derived-class	base-class
all in all typedef in a templates base-class seem rather useless for use in derived-class

1643171
value	field
the problem is the following i want to compute the value of the hosts field automatically

1643184

it s running fine in 32-bit on mac os x but .when i compile in 64bit the results are all wrong

1643204
any	set	order	add
to perform order by any column in your result set add to the end of the query

1643224
revision	svn
a look at your trac web interface for svn show that r2345 simply changed the indentation of the line it wasn t the revision at which the line was introduced

1643224
revision	svn
.so next you use the -r flag or -r do svn help ann to make sure to specify the revision one less than the revision you found in the previous step

1643224
lookup	any
you can omit the trac lookup at each step by simply repeat until you don t see the line any more and taking the result-of the penultimate iterator

1643239
any	set
still to answer your original question at least insofar as mootools is concerned you can simulate a click fire the function set to handle it if any via this

1643248
hide	show
choose one to show then hide them all filtering by the class you want to show and display it

1643281
specifications	w3c
of course the other thing with putting it inside the elements other than inline-styles is that as it doesn t meet with the w3c html xhtml specifications is that any page with it within the body will fail on the w3c validation

1643289
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome .when i added it ad the very end of my document before body

1643289
.when	ready
it is quite posiible that if an image at the begining of your document didn t load and you attach yor event handler .when the document is ready some browsers may not fire that handler - you should test it on your target-platform

1643307
required	checked
rather than changing the required attributes i believe you should do the checked to see if phone is blank and raise a validationerror describing the problem

1643326
right-join	union
a outer-join b a left join b union a right-join b

1643329
temporary	copy
i could always just copy the logic into a temporary controllers call its actions via http and then delete it but was wondering if there was a better way to go about it

1643361

but if the features are unrelated i d commit everything to dev git-rebase -i to put the uncompleted feature on top of everything and then get the id of the last completed commit

1643399
player	movie
as you can see from my code below i am using swfobject2.2 to embed the movie on my webpage and i am using flashvars to call and play .flv within the player

1643403
any	set
add an onactionexecuting methods to set it before any action is called

1643417
sql-server	oracle
i agree with your points but to answer your question one thing that makes sql .so terrible is the lack of complete standardization of t-sql between database vendors sql-server oracle etc. which makes sql code unlikely to be completely portable

1643428
restart	reload
i don t want to restart my application to reload the new situation

1643433
uninstaller	inno-setup
with the shipping inno-setup there is currently no way specify the uninstaller file named

declarative	imperative
another problem of the declarative language is that some problems are easier to solve in a imperative manner

1643447
callback	methods
i also have a callback methods to be called .when the caching item expires which deletes the file created by rendering

1643447
callback	methods
i then expect that the callback methods will get called after 60 seconds and delete the file

1643447
callback	methods
then i can see the callback methods get called and place a lock on the lock object

1643447
callback	methods
this results in rendering checked file is there callback methods deletes file rendering methods tries to serve now-deleted-file

1643447
callback	methods
i understand that the callback methods is essentially lazy-evaluation and therefore only call back once i make a request but surely the threading in .net1.1 is good enough not to let two lock blocks enter simultaneously

1643457
contains	any
the np.ma.compress_cols methods returns a 2-d arrays with any column contains a

1643460
vb.net	vb6
i m a small developer in vb6 and vb.net and use for bug-tracking a simple excel

1643471

sorry guys now i shifted from mysql to sql-server with the same question

1643482
ggplot2	lattice
have a look at the graphics view on cran and this series of post on the learnr blog about lattice and ggplot2

1643542
scheme	lua	smalltalk	scheme
javascript is more like scheme than it is like smalltalk which supports methods not defined or lua

1643552
callback	methods
if that is the case you will need to delegation those events using live or rebind them to your elements within your ajax methods s success callback

1643579
callback	methods
.so you would be best doing as karim79 suggests and using live or your ajax methods s success callback

1643591
key-value	key
for example don t rely on some key to be set in a shared key-value collections such as session

1643594
linux	unix	spaces	output
if you want to see the output i expect open a unix linux shell types echo -e followed by a spaces followed by the above string in single-quotes and hit enter key

1643619
callback	methods
the key was i added a strongly typed callback that the renderview methods above call instead of doing reflection

1643621
contains	elements
i am facing a problem where i need to sort elements depending on their value which contains a numbers separated by periods

1643688
.when	ready
.when the pages are loaded for the first time document .ready function is getting called but from step 3 onwards the ready function is not getting called - making the assumption that 1-3 are execute in sequences on initial page load

1643688
.when	ready
other events occur after that and before but for this purpose jquery is ready .when ready

1643688
.when	ready
this call myonloaded .when the event the ready fires

1643718
contains	elements
which results in an arrays with 3 elements contains an arrays of each 3 matches

1643721
tokenize	parsing	punctuation	words	punctuation	tokenize
during the tokenize words parsing in this case process look for patterns that may defined expression boundaries such as punctuation particularly periods and also multiple linefeed cr separation use these

1643721
sequences	subset
having filtering the n-gram known to cross boundaries as hinted in the first paragraph may help significantly because in natural languages sequences ending and sequences starts tend to draw from a limited subset of the messages spaces and hence produce combinations of token that may appear to be statistically well represented but which are typically not semantics related

1643727
configuration	installation
its nice to be able to generator one working eclipse configuration and then repeat that same .profile installation on another computer or shared that .profile with an entire team

1643738
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
perl autovivification can be contrasted against languages such as python php ruby javascript and all the c styles languages

.when i call a methods in the remoted dll from process a which in turn is supposed to callback to the wcf service hosted in process a the caller just hang and after one minute i get a service timeout

1644023
radio-button	selected
it works fine except .when in certain cases i need to disabled first radio-button leaving user to selected one from remaining

1644034
compile-time	hardcode
with optimizations it will calculate b and d for you at compile-time and hardcode their final value if it actually needs them for anything

1644038
meta-inf	jar
the jar file is referenced by the project and i have a meta-inf application.xml referencing those jar files as ejb modules

1644046
buffering	streaming
said implementation would generator a buffering of x random bytes and dole out as many as required regenerating a streaming .when exhausted

1644071
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1644079
any	set
the thing is i cannot set any control from this thread

1644082
any	set
not sure if it d be any easier to set something up to output your site s content as xml than it would be to insert it into the db but it s an option

1644093
windows-server	windows
we have just started to use windows-server 2008 r2 and iis7.5 and i m trying to move some existing sites across from our windows 2003 box

1644094
profiling	trace
run a profiling trace on both servers and compare the existing connections details

1644120
lookup	any
any other tricky to speedup join or other such time-consuming lookup

1644121
linked-list	nodes
i had the idea of using a linked-list and allocation more nodes as the data fills the list

1644134
updatepanel	ascx
assuming you have an updatepanel around your custom ascx

1644134
textchanged	textbox
set up a triggers on that updatepanel that comes from the textchanged event of your textbox then set autopostback true on the textbox

1644150
constructor	private	constructor	object
and i can t create a new object of the types that the points properties is - its constructor is private or protected

1644205
subtyping	generics
either you do a single filtering query against generics and then cast each item to its specific subtyping results in n+1 queries where n is the numbers of items returned or you make a separate query against each specific table results in k queries where k is the numbers of specific types

1644205
subtyping	generics
if the second is actually significantly faster for your use case and you re willing to do some extra work to clean up your code it should be possible to write a custom manager methods for the generics model that pre-fetches all the subtyping data from the relevant specific tables for a given queryset using only one query per subtyping table

1644215
display	width
.when loaded the text will regardless of the table width stretch out to display all of the string

1644233
value	field
if i have a tabinfo object that has an iconfile set for it the value of the iconfile field is something like fileid 83

1644247
put	get
if you want to get those effects put a inside the table cell and apply the effects to the

1644253
subtyping	generics
the only relation that can be expressed in java s generics is the super- subtyping relationship

1644284
linux	aix
linux being little endian stores byte information differently compared to aix windows boxes

1644296
lookup	any
any other tricky to speedup join or other such time-consuming lookup

1644311
sql-server	oracle
there are dedicated stack exchange sites for both sql-server and for oracle

1644323
radio-button	selected
are there any attributes to pre selected some radio-button in tag on page lodads

1644323
radio-button	selected
below is my code i want the now radio-button to be selected .when page loads

1644327
account	userid
creating this index will also improve updates and delete concurrency without this index all account both activated and not-activated for a given userid will be locked for the duration of updates operation in innodb

1644329
tga	png
since the images are all stored as targa tga files i have to preprocess them into png files

1644329
expression-blend	designer
this also works from within the xaml designer in visual-studio as well as expression-blend 3

1644329
expression-blend	designer
this works in the actual application but not in visual-studio s designer or expression-blend

1644340
constructor	object
the target object capture is immutable and i would like to provide a types converter to take both value and call the constructor

1644372
ref	out
why don t i have to use out or ref

1644372
ref	out
i know that a ref you must have initializer the variables before and out you just have to have set its value before return from the methods

1644374
subclassing	inherited
think about what it would mean to force all subclassing to have an inherited constructor

1644385
selected	checkbox
edit if you want to selected only the inner text you could try wrapping the inner text with a div but with the code you provided that would also selected the checkbox i believe

1644387
contains	set
each of the sets contains a list of nodes in that set 1-6 below

1644387
contains	set
.when a subset of nodes is contains in a bigger set that forms a grouping then only the bigger set gets a grouping in this example nodes 1 2 do not have a grouping of their own since all the sets they have in common already appear in grouping2

1644399
32-bit	64bit
.when we deployed in 64bit machine windows 2008 virtual-machine it seems very slow .when compared to 32-bit versioning of iis

1644406
32-bit	64bit
because it s not usual case for .net .when performance dramatically degrade in case of 32-bit running on 64bit

1644410
constructor	object
then because every class eventually derives from object every class would end up with a parameterless constructor

1644410
subclassing	superclass
the parameters needed to construct a subclassing are often different from those required by the superclass

1644411
attributes	properties
create a custom-attributes and tag the properties you want the user to edit with this attributes

1644411
contains	set
then set the browsableattribute properties on the properties grid to a collections contains only your custom-attribute

1644416
filesystems	fat
i have a fat filesystems mounted in linux with the vfat drivers

1644416
contains	any
these don t contains any vfat attributes however

1644425
value	field
the hardest part is taking the value from the datetime field and identifying which 5 minute bucket it belongs to

1644435
attributes	properties
.so basically copy properties from your custom object to the api object as long as the fieldnames and types match you can do .some specifications on this with attributes or .something

1644453
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
i answered like inotifypropertychanged icommand ivalue converter

1644458
constructor	object
you can t just get to the canvasdiv elements necessarily because if it is never assign to the object in the constructor using the this keyword the reference to that object exists in a closure created by the constructor function itself

1644458
constructor	private	constructor	object
the same thing happens in an object s constructor where local-variables are closed into the member-functions of the object and they act as private variables

1644458
constructor	private
unless there was a methods or variables reference to a private member defined in the constructor you just can t get access to it

1644462
32-bit	64bit
some applications run slower on 64bit simply because they touch more memory overhead for each instances of a class is higher + every reference to an object is 64bit instead of 32-bit - causing the cpu to have to fetch data from ram to the cpu-cache more often

1644474
subclassing	superclass
because constructing your subclassing object may be done in a different way from how your superclass is construct

1644474
subclassing	superclass
you may not want clients of the subclassing to be able to call certain constructor available in the superclass

1644474
superclass	inherited
or you could just required that you repeat the constructor from the superclass if you want to inherited them which arguably is the more obvious way of doing it

1644478
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
baked in support for icommand and inotifypropertychanged are the two biggest benefits

1644504
writetofile	nsstring
writetofile atomically in cocoa s collections classes only works for plist only for collectionss that contains standards object like nsstring nsnumber other collectionss etc

1644506
contains	elements
add a class rules the elements must contains the paymentdatefield class

1644510
hide	show
since you re using hide and show it does something different then what your intended css wants it to do

1644529
children	nodes	children	tree
.when using the tree i would use something like a nodes class that has two children left and right

1644538
base-class	inherited
in terms of the model and control you could consider dealing with any minor difference between the current model controls using shared functionality in a base-class and using inherited to deal with exception-handling

1644563
virtual-machine	vmware
using server 2008 as a desktop operating systemd and install sharepoint 2010 on a virtual-machine or using windows 7 64 and use vmware to hosts the sharepoitn 2010

1644566
restlet	spring
have you considered integration spring with restlet libs

1644577
put	get
wpf is probably not finished yet with sizing and placing the child controls in memory because .when i put my code in the onloaded event handler of my control i do get correct location for my child controls

1644577
rendering	redraw
this however means that i will need to redraw my line untill the last child control has finished rendering

1644579
put	get
.when you building up a string with internal quotes you need to use eval to get the shell to put the quotes back together

1644585
versioning	upgrade
if the your versioning is equals or higher the backup can be restored and and upgrade with a limit not all past versioninging are supported

1644586
arrays	loops
firstly you re already aware that there s a length properties for the arrays - .so you could use that to create a loops that gets rid of the multiple call to .sort at the start and makes the length of the arrays a non problem

1644595
double	int
stores an int not a double

1644609
contains	elements
by my understanding the byte should contains a specific elements of bytes 8bit

1644619
python	c++
i also read somewhere that python is c++ interpretation

1644622
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox and google-chrome happily load content as long as i add the ca to the trusted root cas

1644624
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod ..

1644631
selected	listbox
even if the listbox starts out without anything being selected unless you specify which item should be selected in your code

1644631
selected	button	selected	listbox
if not pressing the button and initiating a postback will reload the listbox thus losing the selecteditem that the user selected

1644665
listboxitem	selected
is it possible to change the selected listboxitem from code-behind in windows presentation foundation

1644666
numeric	zero
.when converting a numeric to a string you lose any leading zero

1644681
linux	unix	filesystems	fat
fat s dos attributes do not map well to the unix filesystems model .so linux s vfat drivers does not reflect them

1644697
directory	folder
i leave out the visual-studio solution user options file .suo and the binaries directory as they get recompiled everytime you building your solution the bin and .obj folder

1644702
selectedindex	selecteditem
use the selecteditem or selectedindex properties of the listbox control

1644711
arguments	default
you can initializer most of the security classes with null arguments to use default value

1644711
contains	elements
usually the arrays will only contains one elements anyway

1644724
double	int
unboxing required the same types you can t convert directly from a boxed int to a double

1644724
double	int
by first unboxing to an int and only then casting to double

1644725
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
i have been wondering if the factory-pattern and the repository-pattern is keened to go hand in hand in a domain-driven-design project

1644726
callback	methods
you should enclose everything in the callback you re passing to the getjson methods

1644733
xilinx	fpga
it s a bit xilinx specific in places which is ok for your fpga but the principles are transferable to others

1644736
credentials	security
for an in-house behind-the-corporate firewall solution you re best bet is probably the nettcpbinding with transport-level security and windows credentials

1644736
credentials	security
you could probably set up basichttpbinding or wshttpbinding with transport security using windows credentials for your service

1644736
http	ssl
if you use transport security you ll be using http addresses and ssl must be enabled on your network but on the other hand you don t need to identify the service with a certificate

1644737
put	get
but it dosn t seem to be working even if i put .some text in the rewriterule as .so i get a url like

1644752
static-methods	unit-testing
many good programmers will tell you that you should try to avoid static-methods especially those who use extensive unit-testing

1644757
callback	methods
however al.so note that the success2 callback is only called on the submit or click methods .so you can fill in all of the form field prior to that

1644788
quirks-mode	firefox
i want to write a cross-browser widget to integrated both to ie standards and quirks-mode pages firefox is easy of course

1644809
web-config	app-config
i know nothing about the enterprise libs but i think i d checked your web-config or app-config configuration settings looking at the database connection strings for the default database

1644828
directory	folder
moreover i have explored the downloading program files folder under windows directory in status column it is showing words unknown

1644831
firefox	safari
can anyone tell me why this would generator a syntax-error in safari and not in firefox

1644851
ethernet	packets
will the os s realize that the endpoint are on the same machine and know not to go out to the ethernet with the packets

1644852
bluetooth	usb
i can use it as a gprs 3g modem either using bluetooth usb or information-retrieval

1644856
python	java
it ll eventually be started from a python and java application - and some form of cleanup is needed .when the scripting exit - any options i should look into or any way to rewrite the scripting to clean itself up on exit

1644875
google-chrome	firefox
this code doesn t work in ie7 but does in firefox google-chrome

1644898
debugging	trace
you re-enable debuggingging trace - but it is frustrating to have to debugging the debuggingging tracing code because it refers to variables that have been rename or retyped during the years of stable maintenance

1644898
debugging	trace
however the compiler won t generator any code for the debuggingging trace statements unless debugging is enabled

1644898
required	checked
compared to the first versioning you lose the limited checked that required the fmt arguments which means that someone could call debug_print with no argumentss

1644898
comma-operator	operands
but it could be used as the left operands of a comma-operator where the versioning cannot

1644907
sql-server	oracle
all mayor dbs ms sql-server oracle db2 can store and query xml

1644916
subtract	add
while you can take the union or intersection of shapes or add and subtract them curve tend to deform with repeated boolean-operations sometimes quite dramatically

1644916
user-interface	drawing
.so i m looking for a better tool for this specific purpose shape-based drawing of simple icons button and user-interface elements on a mac by .someone without graphic design training

1644917
selected	listbox
i want to do the same with a listbox but selected multiple value

1644924
radio-button	selected
by default the first radio-button is selected

1644924
radio-button	selected
however if the user click the 3rd radio-button and i go to another page i want my user-controls to still show that 3rd radio-button as selected

1644929
sql-server	mysql
this works fine in mysql 5 but in sql-server 2005 it doesnt create the properties table

1644929
sql-server	mysql
i havn t tried creating the table myself i d like to avoid that .so i dont know if it is working at all in sql-server but it works fine in mysql

1644939
textbox	button
then you can copy and paste the following code that implements a form with 2 textbox and a save button

1644946
versioning	upgrade
i was using mysql .net connector dll of versioning 5.1 i have just upgrade to 6.1 latest and its working fine without any error

1644948
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
i have a page with checkbox one of which is a selected all button

1644948
checkbox	button
i show the area after a button is click but .when the page loads at first these checkbox is invisible

1644979
curly-braces	parentheses
al.so note that this assignment uses curly-braces not parentheses .so as not to be confused by the results of the match

1644990
base-class	inherited
i try to make a base-class with .some base elements .so that other windows can inherited these components

1644990
base-class	inherited
but all that i have .when i inherited base-class is only empty windows without these elements

1645013
uiimage	nsimage
i don t know anything about opengl but cocoa abstracts this functionality with nsimage uiimage

1645025
contains	any
you ve asked a question specifically relating to db object that do not contains any data and theoretically should not be changed that often

1645032
selected	listbox
i just set the selected value .when the listbox is being databound

1645038
compact-framework	.net
i have a .net compact-framework .app that can runs on three windows machines desktop windows and two wince machines and on the wince devices the process never terminate on exit even if i call .application.exit

1645043
multiplying	division
there is also some scrambling or unscrambling multiplying by a specified value adding a specified numbers and then the modular division

1645044
radio-button	checkbox
i am replacing the styles of a radio-button with that of a checkbox

1645044
radio-button	checkbox
anyway using expression-blend i was able to extraction the styles of the checkbox and apply it to a radio-button

1645050
cout	cin
std cin and std cout globals

1645050
python	php
also if you come from php and want to increase your performance you could begin with a lot of different scripting languages python is my favorite and it would probably be easier

1645093
enterprise	legacy
i maintain a legacy asp.net web application using .net 2.0 + sql-server 2005 enterprise + vsts 2008 + c# + ado.net

1645094
arrays	loops
you can set the properties of your entire elements arrays at once you don t need to loops through them

1645112
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
your core-graphics surface should be cleared to all zero before you rendering to it .so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645112
loading	png
if you d like to avoid core-graphics for decoding png images i recommend loading in a pvr file instead

1645129
arrays	loops
example given a loops over an arrays of data to parsing

1645130
traversal	parent
then via jquery i can find the parent .collapsiblepanel elements and could traversal into that div and manipulate the child elementss

1645130
traversal	parent
then jquery can find the parent .collapsiblepanel but is unable to traversal the children

1645136
assign	add
to add an anonymous hash at runtime assign it as you would a normals hash elements

1645181
png	gif
the board has an lcd and i would like to be able to take screenshot convert them into a gif or png

1645181
png	gif
i can get the raw-data by doing the following cp dev fb0 screen.raw but i am stumped on how to convert the image into a gif or png format

1645183
value	field
this is because the salt is added to the passwd before it is hash .so it effectively adds to the total numbers of entries the rainbow table must contains to have a list of all possible value for a passwd field

1645186
authentication	login
again authentication works and .when i am logged in as a customer and i click on the internal site link in the menu i am being redirected to the login page

1645186
put	get
updates i put a bounty on this question because i still cannot get it to work

1645190
crypt	salt
usenix.org unix crypt used salt since 1976

1645197
contains	set
i have a set of document contains scored items that i d like to index

1645197
value	field
my first thought was to add each relatedscore as a multi-value field using the boost properties of the field to modify the value of the particular score .when searching

1645197
value	field
insert the multi-value field items inorder of descending value

1645197
assign	add
then somehow add a positional-aware analysis to assign higher boost score to the first items in the field

1645197
value	field
add a high value score multiple time to the field

1645214
derived-class	inherited
making a derived-class is great if you want to inherited both controls and behavior but consider using templates for a more flexible way of managing a common set of controls

1645234
google-chrome	firefox
innertext works in ie and textcontent works in firefox google-chrome etc

1645235
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
pull this trace into a table and do some filtering sorting grouping focusing on duration and reads

1645239
interface-builder	iboutlet
but if i connect the iboutlet mytitle to the labels in interface-builder recompile and run the .app it works fine until i try to push the view controllers onto the navigation controllers s stack at which points i get a crash

1645258
repository	entity
this will properly separate out your concerns since each repository is only responsible for knowing how to deal with that specific entity

1645260
hash	md5
i m trying to represent the result-of an md5 hash in the shortest possible string

1645260
hash	md5
one idea i have had is getting the md5 hash of my input as an arrays of bytes and constructing a bigint with it

1645264
g++	gcc
i m using g++ instead of gcc and it should work i found similar examples over the web but it seems that ast_node is not known .when defining yystype because i get this error

1645278
mobile-browser	opera
.when i attempt to browse to the asmx page via the mobile-browser opera while on the cell network it connect and rendering the description page perfectly

1645295
directory	folder
in which case all classes from myjar1.jar myjar2 jar and some classes folder directory will be available to you

1645302
rollback	commit
my version-control requirements are very basic commit rollback browse and good utility support

1645308
any	set
i have also tried to set autoflush mode to off | 0 but even that doesn t do any thing

1645309
unsigned	short
is this a reference to void cast as an unsigned short pointers and then offset by 3 mesh etc... + batchnum

1645312
populate	row
getting a table populate with one row per minute can be done extremely quickly as follows

1645318
authentication	login
user authentication login automatic login with current user named and passwd

1645353
boost	stl
you can easily building such a queue on top of stl and boost though - just wrap std queue and boost-mutex in your custom class

1645354
bazaar	git
mercurial git and bazaar all just put a single directory at the root of the project

1645359
connection-pooling	pool
i don t have any performance stats at hand but maybe a words of warning .when using connection-pooling you might end up with too many small pool instead of one large one

1645362
integrated-security	connection-string	connection-pooling	pool
one ado.net application-pool is created per unique connection-string therefore it is worth noting that .when you use integrated-security you will lose the benefits of connection-pooling as you will effectively have one connection pool per db authentication user

1645399
header-only	boost
there are very useful and successful libs like many in boost that are header-only

1645432
directory	folder
instead of adding your bin directory to source control which just seems wrong why don t you put the dll in a folder called third parties within your project and reference it from there

1645434
sniffing	packets
ultimately with packets sniffing tools or even just firebug you can see the request response from your browser .so really .some .sort of encryption encoding is the best way to go

1645444
value	field
q is it possible to pull out the value for one of my modelform s field while in the templates

1645444
value	field
.so i want to add a column after the field s column that contains the field s value but not display this column

1645444
value	field
i could parsing the html string for the field and grab whatever s in the value attributes but i d only do that as a last resort

1645444
value	field
.so far i ve been able to access the data dictionary of my form and get the object of whichever field i want but i haven t figured out which methods i can use to actually grab the field s value

1645446
unsigned	short
this is casting 0 to an unsigned short pointers

1645446
unsigned	short
this will be used for computing a memory offset computed in terms of the size of an unsigned short

1645480
any	set
if that class is never intended to be a mouse target you could also set these properties in the class constructor to prevent any instances of that class from blocking mouse events

1645489
authentication	login
in the login page i use something like this to authentication the user

1645489
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work on google-chrome haven t tested on ie however .when i run the .app on firefox with multiple tabs activated if i close the browser and open again im still authentication and the cookies is still there

1645492
arrays	map
i was wondering if the value_types of the std map has to a struct types with defined memory size like with pod or arrays of pod

1645499
header-only	boost
on the other hand presuming you re asking this because you re wondering if you can use boost in a project that you want to work on many distributions most of boost s libs are header-only because they re templates which means they get compiled into your project and it doesn t matter whether or not a distribution has them install same effect as statically linking

1645499
header-only	boost
for those parts of boost that aren t header-only you can statically link and still make a binary that will run on distros that don t come with boost

1645528
32-bit	16-bit
the openwatcom project contains a very good debugger which exists in both 16-bit and 32-bit versioning for dos 32-bit through several so-called dos extenders windows and os 2

1645531
compression	streaming
is all you need for a basic zip you can of course set compression levels directory structures zip streaming unzip streaming and much more

1645532
temporary	copy
what you re seeing is that a temporary copy of column is being destroy

1645557
contains	set
if s cannot be a member of g but the intersection of s ang g s set contains more than one nodes make a new grouping for that intersection and add it to the list

1645557
any	set
combine any grouping that have the same set

1645557
any	set
delete any grouping with only one member set

1645574
duplicates	contains
contains duplicates methods

1645578
put	get
it works over http and you use the standards http cmd of get put .post delete to manipulate data you can query using browsers and clients are simple http clients

1645616
any	set
try to look through the configure.log for any clues on why libxml2 is not correctly set up

1645638
c++	lua
lua c++ interface

put	get
.when you are sure your scripting is perfectly working you can get rid of warning and notices like this put this line at the beginning of your php scripting

1645697
32-bit	64bit
it is not inconceivable that a systemd could have for example a 32-bit address spaces and a 32-bit ptrdiff_t but a 64bit long and then your printf would fail

1645698
exception-handling	error-handling
i left in the error-handling as i m not sure if your trapping errors on task execution or just looking for the exception-handling you were throw on a particular step failing

1645715
32-bit	64bit
you said that you can t imagine it failing on a 32-bit or 64bit machine

1645715
32-bit	64bit
inorder to prevent this failure you d need at least 33-bit signed ptrdiff_t on a 32-bit machine and at least 65-bit signed ptrdiff_t on 64bit machine

i do not understand why i m having trouble with mysql if the second level caching is just configure for oracle

1645849
copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	std-pair	temporary	copy
now you make a copy of the object as it is copy-paste into the temporary object of types std-pair int column this uses column s copy-constructor which makes a copy of the m_name member you now have two pointers to the same memory location

i know of several general formula for converting between binary decimal and octal but i was wondering if java has any built-in methods or classes that convert between the three

1645961
binary	octal	decimal	octal
in particular i am looking for methods to convert from octal and binary to decimal and between octal and binary

1645979
hide	show
specifically .when we have a child control on a page and the child control itself hosts a report viewer and the report has a document map the postback on the show hide document map button seems to be lost .so the document map never disappears

1646010
binary	hex
.so to turn f hex into 1111 binary

1646041

gethashcode	equals
provide a proper implementation that implements both equals and gethashcode

1646045

i m suspicious of nginx passenger because i just switched to that last week from nginx thin and now these are happening

1646105
32-bit	64bit
both 32-bit and 64bit compiles

1646107
value	field
i think the problem that you are seeing is that the initial may populate the file field with that value but .when the form gets submitted the value pictures no_beer_picture.jpg is not a valid file on the user s computer .so no file is sent with the form

1646115
variables	boolean
i ve answered .something similar to this earlier on see question with the same .solution as you re currently using see points 2 of my answer but i thought of .something like handling the flag not as a boolean but to do it using an enum .so 1 variables will be enough

1646116
getter	setter
then synthesize the getter setter like this

1646117
constructor	object
it is called automatically before the first instances is created or any static-members are referenced.classic constructor is used to initializer instances-variables and called every time the object is created

1646137
value	field
the following line of comma-separated value contains several consecutive empty field

1646137
substitution	replace	value	field
i want to replace these empty field with n a value which is why i decided to do it via a regex substitution

32-bit	64bit
it s a 64bit os but this is 32-bit code compiled with -m32

1646326
versioning	upgrade
and i fear that if python is install before and i upgrade to a new versioning this could break something else.

1646326
stderr	stdout
i execute the plugins from command-line and read the stdout and stderr output

1646368
linux	aix
if you don t have an aix machine to test it on the install works the same way on .solaris or linux .so you could write your documentation based on that

1646368
directory	folder
basically you ungzip the tarball file use tar to unpack the archive change directory to the unpack folder run a shell scripting to install it tell the shell scripting what directory to place it in and wait

1646369
contains	elements
for example an order list of elements should be contains within an tag a paragraph of text in a tag and a heading inside a tag

1646393

1646467
perl	c++
i know of implementation in perl c++ and java

1646480

what s interesting here is that i completely decoupled the exception-handling the catch part of try-catch from the closing of the resource which is done through finally

1646492
droppable	draggable
i have a droppable containers with 1 draggable in it

1646514
any	set
i ve set up a reverse-proxy .so that any request to actually go to the server inside my firewall

1646522
value	field
once you have candidate tables to remove from the database and approval from your manager then don t just drop the tables create them again as an empty table or put one dummy recording in the table with mostly null value or zero or blank in the field except for named and descriptive field where you can put something like deleted report error dele to support centering etc

1646529
composite-controls	asp.net
here is a good article that answers your question a crash course on asp.net control development building composite-controls

i have an ant building scripting that deploys a .war folder into my jboss deploy directory

1646650
executable	jar	.war	jar
can i convert that into an executable .war jar file and run it as well

1646654
hash	md5
rather than convert the above subroutine to php here is a subroutine to convert a string to its md5 hash in vb.net

1646671
python	java
another is to write a python scripting that would read the rules files and generator java classes with the unit tests

1646673
.net	wcf
however if you directly initializer the service class as a .net class and not via the wcf service runtime then obviously you re limited by the .net visibility constraints and members of a class are internal by default not visible to the outside

1646673
.net	wcf
.so basically you need to distinguish whether you re looking at your class as a representation of a wcf service contract or as a classic .net class

1646676
attributes	properties
does microsoft have a url in th e internet from which we can get the list of all possible properties attributes that exist in the different versioning of active-directory

1646678
value	field
.when i just assign field value

1646690
vertex-buffer	vbo
you could look at using a vertex-buffer object vbo as your large arrays this will place the your mesh data in vram and you would rendering it using indexes read pointers into the vbos that you ve created

1646706
constructor	object
all object created from this constructor will now have a getname because of the prototype-chain that they have access to

1646727
constructor	object
the new keyword creates instances of object using functions as a constructor

1646761
jquery	.post
i m ok with jquery and can send the .post request via an ajax call but that doesn t exactly put the user on the authorize.net page

1646769
build-server	msbuild
if you install the svn client cli onto your build-server you will be able to use the execute task in msbuild to run the svn updates cmd

1646775
click	mouse
after that you could use ajax to send the mouse click results back to your server and save that information in a file

1646795
environment	execution
execution environment

1646795
environment	execution
what does it mean to setup own execution environment

the .net compact-framework will only follow the user s preferences

1646851
click	mouse
how to distinguish between left and right mouse click with jquery

1646856
silverlight	wpf
there are a lot more wpf-like controls in the silverlight toolbox and wpf now has silverlight s visaulstatemanager

1646856
silverlight	wpf
at this points it s probably fair to say that silverlight has even surpassed wpf in terms of the numbers of themes available

1646856
silverlight	wpf
today you can t just use a silverlight themes in a wpf .app but how much of a leap would it be for microsoft to make this possible

1646871
calloc	malloc
if you want to simulate limited memory calloc not malloc a gigabyte or two of memory in bogdown.exe

1646875
required	checked
checked datetime.now in doevents isn t actually required for this technique to work but will improve performance if someproperty is set very frequently during deserialization

1646901
conditional	parentheses
there were also some missing close parentheses after some of the conditional

1646913
implements	extends
it s also easy to remember easy to implements and easy to extends to any numbers of field

1646928
executable-jar	.war
you can also create an archive that is both an executable-jar file and deployable .war file at the same time

1646956
silverlight	wpf
i am happy to see resources shared between wpf and silverlight though

1646956
silverlight	wpf
as a result it s relatively easy to ports a silverlight project into wpf

1646956
silverlight	wpf
on the flip side it s not quite as easy going from wpf to silverlight simply because wpf has always had more features but that s just the nature of the beast

1646965
silverlight	wpf
yes we will see that wpf and silverlight becomes more and more alike if the acutely will be merge

1646965
silverlight	wpf
.so in the future you will not implements wpf or silverlight you will just implements xmal

1646973
.when	ready
the css will load with the styles set to not display then .when the dom is ready it will show your div

1646978

1646980
unsafe	out
how can i find out why the error occurred or why my assembly must be registered as unsafe

i m writing an application that is able to be connect to multiple types of database eg sql-server oracle mysql etc

1646999
assign	add
audit_comment can also be mass assign making it simple to add a comment field to any form

1647008
spaces	output
i m trying to process a line at a time and having problems because looping on output from a cmd like sed or grep tokenize on white spaces rather than the entire line

1647012
arguments	undefined
the defined function returns true unless the value passed in the arguments is undefined

1647013
numeric	digits
by default a perl identifier a sequences of letters digitss and underscore.js not starting with a digits unless it is completely numeric that is not otherwise a built-in keyword or previously seen subroutine definition is treated as a quoted text string

1647013
arguments	default
since no other arguments are supplied printing default to printinging to filehandle sdf

1647023
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb and why it s still being widely used

1647028
temporary	copy
would it be best to copy convert into an interim format in a temporary table work on it and then import it back in

1647037
innodb	myisam
innodb supports row level locking whereas myisam only supports table-level locking

1647053
json-simple	json-lib
i used php s json_encode json_decode and java s json-lib to encode the messages in json-simple text-based good match for datamodel

1647059
lgpl	gpl
are there any restrictions of using lgpl gpl bsd licensed software in a commercial venture if the tools software are only used as part of internal process and not integrated or incorporated into any software product that is being sold

1647062
contains	elements
in the real code each page div contains many more elements

1647076
delegation	dealloc
i solved this by setting the delegation to nil inside the dealloc block of the view controllers

1647078
innodb	myisam
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647078
innodb	myisam
personally i still believe that the advantages of innodb triumphs myisam and myisam also has problems with data-integrity from my experience

1647083
constructor	private	constructor	object	factory-method	singleton
you could make private the normals constructor .so it can t be used from outside the object like you would if you were making a singleton and create a factory-method

1647089
audio	ogg
i had the same trouble sending an ogg audio file using php

1647099
ellipse	pixels
a set of pixels covered by the ellipse including the fill

1647099
ellipse	pixels
a set of pixels covered by the edges of the ellipse

1647099
ellipse	pixels
any nonzero value in pixels is partially covered by the ellipse

1647099
ellipse	pixels
if you need to get only the pixels along the edges but your ellipse is filled or vice versa you can create a new shape to pass to rendertargetbitmap

1647114
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb

1647114
innodb	myisam
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1647134
javascript	dom
you could also investigate using jsfl javascript with access to the flash ide s dom to get data out of the flas and into common formats if you like

1647142
arguments	default
if the programmer decides that it doesn t make sense to provide a default no arguments constructor as part of the class s contract then the compiler should not provide one

1647170
compact-framework	.net
it does support both smtp ssl pop3 ssl and s mime on .net compact-framework

1647172
gwt	dwr
technologically java is quite good for non-standard web things - like heavy use of ajax gwt dwr comet spring to mind mobile where you generally need lots of session data and less front-end bling really simple things that are going to be put under immense load it will definitely trounce apache mod_xxx every time the only thing faster in wide-spread use is native-code

1647173
32-bit	64bit
i thought java source code and java bytecode was architecture-independent as in a java program compiled with either a 32-bit of 64bit jdk can be run on a different machine with either a 32-bit or 64bit jre

1647173
32-bit	64bit
if this is true why does eclipse have a 32-bit versioning and a 64bit versioning i realize they don t have one for windows but they have one for linux

1647173
32-bit	64bit
this second page lists various downloadinging for eclipse 3.5.1 and for each downloading you have a wide range of architectures 32-bit and 64bit and os s windows linux to choose from

1647173
development-environment	platform
i personally chose the eclipse sdk downloading - this comes with eclipse platform java development tools and plugins development-environment including source and both user and programmer documentation

1647179
cvs	git
how can you get the cvs repo of mmix to cvs git

1647179
sourceforge	git-clone
i know how to clone a repo at github by git-clone url but i have never really used sourceforge before

1647181
click	mouse
jfreecharts seems like the generally recommended choice for chartsing purposes but from a little browsing of their api there doesn t seem to be any obvious way to detection mouse click on a particular splice and change the charts in response

1647182
cherokee	apache
this seems to me to be a pretty basic thing but even with the excellent apache documentation i m at a bit of a loss been using cherokee too much lately

1647183
static-class	inherited
using inherited and a special extended declaration done by a static-class methods they know how to turn

1647185
base-class	inherited
it s probably the easiest way but it has certain disadvantages you need to be able to inherited from some base-class it only works in runtime though this was always enough in my wpf-experience it surely looks like a patch for a missing static checked

1647190
processor	affinity
basically i iterate through each processor visible to windows set thread affinity to that thread and then make a sequences of cpuid call

1647199
look-and-feel	swt
eclipse provides an alternative gui framework with a more native look-and-feel swt and uses it for the development-environment itself

1647213
mta	sta
threads belong to exactly one apartment .so a thread can not be in mta and sta simultaneously

1647213
mta	sta
if your object lives in mta whenever an sta object tries to use it it will have to create a proxy

1647214
constructor	private
class a gets as part of it s constructor a pointers to class b and saves that pointers in a private variables

1647277
data-members	private
you ve created a problem as a caller can change your private data-members which leads to all sorts of defensive copying

1647286
.net	wcf
wcf on the other has a much more broad scoping but doesn t support silverlight development in the same way that .net ria service does

1647298
inherited	accessor
because they don t support inherited one is stuck with the following choices .when one wants to have a new containers that needs the stl functionality plus a small numbers of additional features say a specialized constructor or new accessor with default value for a map or whatever

1647306
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if currentsummary is already a nsmutablestring you shouldn t attempt to assign a regular nsstring the result-of stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofstring withstring to it

1647307
selected	listbox
my problem is that in my page_load it refreshes a listbox before the selected items can be process by imagebutton_click

1647311
required	checked
the advantage of this methods is it required less spaces however it complicates removals as if the bucket following the removed item is not empty one has to checked to see if that item is in the right or wrong bucket and shift the item if it originally has collider with the item being removed

1647315
any	set
you can set up binding without using xaml see bindingoperations.setbinding and you can set up binding in visual basic or any other language that targets silverlight and can call the setbinding api

1647327
typename	typedef
note that if i change const typename containers pointers to simply typename containers const_pointers it compiles fine however as far as i can tell the const_pointers typedef is an extension i don t see it mentioned in the c++ standards containers requirements 23.5 table 65 and .so therefore i don t want to use it

1647335
return-value	return-type
the difference are subtle printing has a return-value of 1 .so it can be used in expression whereas echo has a void return-type

1647343
hash	md5
well here hash is what we call a one-way function like md5 sha1 etc

1647355
arguments	default
also worth mentioning is that print_r and var_dump will echo by default add a second arguments to print_r at least that evaluates to true to get it to return instead

1647367
.war	jar
you can deploy the web application and the web service in the same .war but this is just a deployment choice you could package the business-logic in a jar and use it in several .wars

1647391
directory	folder
i want to add a folder project scriptinging .so i can use required scripting where scripting is a ruby file in this directory

1647396
getter	setter
just plain getter and setter

1647409
mapply	grepl
mapply grepl dataframe letter dataframe food

1647412
filtering	sorting
i haven t really dabbled in sql but with a bit of reading i m sure i could create my own custom server side paging filtering sorting

1647424
ellipse	line
the program draw the ellipse only if i replace line 2 with painter.begin this

hashmap	arrays
a hashmap containss an arrays of buckets inorder to contains its entries

1647434
cvs	git
git is not magic that drive cvs it s an entirely different thing altogether

1647434
cvs	git
git does have a cvsimport tool that will make a git repository out of a cvs repository but do note that this will be an entirely different thing

1647434
cvs	git
i d recommend you understand both git and cvs better before trying to work with one gating the other though

1647460
sql-server	mysql
mysql or sql-server supports

1647485
contains	any
i believe the arguments against mbstring.func_overload is that if you use any 3rd party libs code whatsoever that code may be relying on the normals functionality of the functions in question -- it may be calling substring to truncated a string contains binary-data at an exact byte boundary or using strlen to get length in bytes rather than length in utf-8 characters

1647489
hashmap	arrays
the hashmap has an arrays of entry s

1647522
boolean	double
construct double bitwise not to convert the length properties to boolean it will return false only .when length is zero

1647596
instances	self
if you re binding to the instances you shouldn t include the self arguments

1647602
single-sign-on	shibboleth
if you are looking at a secure single-sign-on solution something like shibboleth will come to mind

1647614
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	ruby-on-rails	django
i m currently working through some code katas in multiple-languages ruby perl python frameworks ruby-on-rails django mojo

1647616
instances	self
in particular look at the instancesmethods function which allows binding a methods to an instances -- in this case that would allow you to use self in the methods

1647632
textbox	button
and also if it s possible i would like to have the person login without the actual google web interface but with 2 textbox and a button

1647634

revision	updates
if you updates to a revision with the file you ll get a warning

1647747

1647753
filtering	grouping
if what you really want is to express filtering over your grouping data take a look at the having clause

1647754
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
create a subclassing of qabstractitemmodel or qstandarditemmodel depending on how much coding you will want to do overrides the flags methods to return the appropriate flags including qt itemisusercheckable in the column-count methods add an extra column to include the checkbox and in the data methods for the column where you want your checkbox to appear return the checked state qt checked qt unchecked for the qt checkstaterole

1647754
qlistwidgetitem	qlistwidget
this can also be accomplished using the qlistwidget where you can use qlistwidgetitem for adding data and do not need to create a model

1647766
push	pull
much of this stuff doesn t need to be run every single time you push pull in particular i usually wouldn t want to dump a new data fixtures that frequently

1647793
any	set
if you re using a different database other than currentdb you really do want to make sure any database variables points to your external db is closed and set to nothing

1647795
attributes	properties
yes you can updates the variables it s accessible from the outer closure the problem is that z-index is not an attributes it is a css properties you can get it using the jquery css function

1647795
background-color	font-size
also note that the css properties that contains dashes like background-color or font-size are accessed removing the dash and capitalizing the next words

1647812
pointers	stack
once the gdb stack unwinder goes off balance it creates bogus frame #2 through #8 but eventually stumbles on a frame which uses frame pointers and produces correct stack-trace for the rest of stack

1647830
required	checked
if you re not allowed to perform any preprocessor on that list of strings then there s no reasonably efficient solution you re going to have to iterate all over the list checked for each words whether it can be composed as required its signature see below is uniformly less than the incoming bunch s signature

1647851
button	popup
the above code will make all three button popup 3

1647851

but i was then often until i learned to never make them anything but immutable burned by modifying a copy sometimes an unnamed temporary copy of a struct instances instead of modifying the instances itself

1647863
updating	updates
all you have to do is set the commandname properties of the linkbutton inside of your templates column to edit for editing delete for deleting and updates for updating

1647925
selected	cell
but the selected row also has a selected cell which draw in a slightly lighter colour than the rest of the selected row and has a border

1647934
triggers	insert
.so we have a triggers on the .post table .so .when a new .post is insert the triggers fires off and part of that logic it calculates the user s latest score

1647956
factors	numeric
furthermore many of the factors in play are discrete qualitative in nature and hence less easily subjected to numeric integration

1648036
selected	cell	click	mouse
for this purpose mouse over named column left edges cursor becomes a plus sign and click to selected the cell

1648079
dictionary	arrays	key-value	key
you can use an arrays of key to remember an order if you need to but dictionary are conceptually unordered bags of key-value pairs

1648086
selected	cell
i found a way of making the individual cell appear to be not selected although i m not sure if its the best way

1648086
selected	cell
this is the rectangle thats used to indicate a selected cell

1648204
.net	wcf
those are simply attributes on .net classes that expose them to the wcf runtime

1648212
sequences	unique
if that sequences is unique in the file then you can try to change the e8ab3c8200 to b8ffffffff if you can t use a disassembly

1648254
callback	methods
if format_row also belongs to the class where the test methods is then the callback should be passed as

1648289
spaces	output
note that is unquoted for this to work otherwise the extra newline appear only once at the end of all the output but must be quoted to protect spaces in filenames if they exist

1648329
attributes	properties
typically i use assemblyfileversion as the attributes properties value and have the setter logic fill in the missing pieces

1648329
attributes	properties
unit test showing attributes properties value sans required prefix or suffix

1648341
numeric	digits
however i think a great all-round solution is just using numeric digits

1648353
oracle-spatial	postgis
this approach is common in spatial databases oracle-spatial postgis etc. but probably not as useful in regular multi-indexed tables

1648355
height	frame
how to set the height of a frame used within a frameset in html

1648363
subclassing	superclass
if subclassing in objective-c wants to overrides a superclass s methods does it have to match the return-type too

1648364

properties which specifies the height of the inline frame

1648366
packets	ping
you can use ping to send varying sized packets to the windows 2003 hosts

1648406
version-control	git
use version-control mercurial git subversion and a schema-migration tool like .south .so if .something does go wrong .when you deploy to production you have the possibility of backing out the changes and allowing production to run on the old code with the old database-schema

1648406
web-testing	selenium
use a web-testing framework like windmill or selenium to test my application in my test environment .so that i can get a lot of test coverage of my systemd very quickly

1648416

tapestry	spring
he speaks about the importance of being a scripting-language for a popular systemd think spring-mvc to spring brevity think tapestry s simple jwcid attributes or savant for php needing only 1 loc to function hackability again spring-mvc allowing your own impl of framework interfaces having expert hackers as your targeted user base others will follow their lead etc

1648498
constructor	object
in your example the empty constructor looks for a constructor that can take in an object value of null

1648498
constructor	object
since a string is an object that can take nulls it call that constructor

1648519
chmod	sudo
once i did sudo chmod a+w dev chardev the drivers worked as expected

1648532
administration	account
if systemd use the user-named or other trivia then the passwd can be compared to other users with the same named in other systemd imagine how often the administration or root user account uses the same passwd in different systemd...

1648539
beautifulsoup	lxml
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html-parsing than lxml

1648542
revision	svn	revision	updates
if you fight svn you will run into trouble because you might not have both working copies updates to the same the same revision the merge tool messes up the hidden .svn folder and whatnot

1648542
revision	svn
if you re afraid of bumping svn s revision count without doing actual work get a grip

1648568
amazon-web-services	hosting
does using amazon-web-services mean that not only i can fully migrate to this platform but that partials solution is ok too - writing regular php apps on regular hosting that invoke amazon-web-services storage cloud queue

1648596
compact-framework	.net	keydown	keyup
my problem is i need to handle the keydown keyup events to navigate between controls in the form .net compact-framework textbox combobox etc

1648596
compact-framework	.net
with the controls provided by the .net compact-framework framework it works but .when i reach a user-controls written by me that control don t get focus the textbox inside get the focus .so from this user-controls i cannot navigate because in the panels i don t have any control of who have focus

1648619
artifactory	nexus
for the recording i m using both nexus and artifactory

1648619
artifactory	nexus
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free versioning cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1648619
artifactory	nexus
excluding artifactory s awesome web 2 user-interface its main features such as security management periodic backup and accessibility issues are way beyond those of nexus

1648630
objective-c	swift
swift is now perhaps less weird than objective-c seems to a programmer coming from some other language

1648630
objective-c	swift
you may find learning swift is an advantage if you have that option - many developers are stuck supporting existing project in objective-c

1648632
environment	building
you can do this in your building environment and then only store key1 and key2 in your application

1648644
contains	elements
i think i should be increment the emp_details arrays and dereference the pointers to see if it contains a null in the first arrays elements

1648649
contains	any
what you can try is to look if any children of your user-controls contains the focus

1648669
environment	building
as a learning exercise i m building a basic scientific computation environment based on .net

1648679
toggle	slider
the problem is that if i click on a year .when it s opened it first slider up being intercepted by the first line and then slider down via the toggle line

javascript	dom
you could even declare the field as in the html then have your javascript function modify the dom to change its types

1648704
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
by the way a solution should preferably work without root rights to install with php python perl xslt or any program found in a half-decent linux-distro

1648706
pixels	line
one nice idea i had would be to take the stripes of pixels going diagonal across from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner maybe have a look at bresenham s line algorithm

1648708
web-applications	enterprise	web-applications	scalability
i suppose that the core target of amazon-web-services and cloud frameworks in general are enterprise applications but regular web-applications that want to be scalability and flexible can benefit from these architectures too

1648720
aquamacs	emacs
i just used aquamacs emacs to load a diff file and it provided some highlight

1648741
grouping	sorting
however finding all product that have one attributes would be at least lousy in case you have attributess as comma-separated you need to use like and in case you store attributess as serialization arrays they are completely unusable for any kind of sorting or grouping using sql queries

1648741
grouping	sorting
using separate table for multiple relations between product and attributes is far better if they are of any importance for selected grouping sorting other data

1648751
linux	unix
those are the two tools plus the cli that i use for .net development but i am entirely on linux unix using the mono tools

1648752
oracle	mysql
the following is a summary for mysql i need similar stats for oracle

1648752
solaris	linux
linux or solaris should be able to support at 500â 1000 simultaneous connections routinely and as many as 10 000 connections if you have many gigabytes of ram available and the workload from each is low or the response time target undemanding

1648752
compatibility	platform
windows is limited to open tables ã 2 + open connections 2048 due to the pthreads compatibility layer used on that platform

1648765
postback	ajax
any reason you want need to do this via ajax rather than a regular postback you could use an updatepanel to do a partials postback

1648770
expression	brackets
the problem is that if i push more expression onto stack they will have nested brackets

1648773
textmate	macvim
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free

1648792

1648853
sql-server	mysql
the error was that sql-server doesn t allow null key which mysql obviously handles

1648868
protected	public
it should be ideally protected but it can be public

1648875
tcpdf	fpdf
personally i d rather go with tcpdf which is an ehnanced and mantained versioning of fpdf

1648886
expression	evaluation
without further assumptions such as your list being sorted in a specific order there s really no other way meaning the two versioning you give will result in the exact same evaluation of your expression

1648894
children	nodes
.when i try to traversal to the children of the gallery nodes it return nothing for the nodesvalue .when it should read joe bloggs and #text for the nodes named .when it should read properties

1648994
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	button	radio-button	textbox	checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button	radio	click
i m guessing you probably want to bind a click event to a numbers of radio button read the value of the click radio-button and depending on the value disable enable a checkbox and or textbox

1649002
thread-dump	visualvm
instead of using jstack on the command-line you can also triggers a thread-dump using visualvm and look at the threads over time

1649006
32-bit	64bit
this all worked fine on windows 2003 32-bit windows 2008 32-bit and windows 7 64bit

1649046
decrement	increment
keep in mind that in all of these cases you will have to make sure that you either never ever use this in a multithreading environment or that you make sure that refct_ is a types that you have both an atomicity increment and an atomicity decrement and test instruction for

1649060
ubuntu	debian
avoid obscure distros that may miss package go for debian or ubuntu or fedora or one of the biggest ones and you ll be fine

1649070
data-members	private	getter	setter
no virtual methods all data-members are private no protected getter setter helpers

1649081
httpwebrequest	webrequest
i tried httpwebrequest webrequest streaming class but i failed.

1649106
value	field
why is productgroup not a field on a sinlge product table thus allowing you to selected rows where the productgroup has a certain value

1649118
sequences	unique
sequences will allow you to populate primary key with a unique serialization numbers

1649124
any	set
what i m interested in is what standards libs there are in .net to help with the specifics of generator xml and if there any external libs or tricks that can help automating the transformation from result set to xml

1649126
sequences	unique
the sequences is a feature by some database product which just creates unique value

1649126
sequences	unique
without a database sequences it is very hard to generator unique increment numbers

1649131
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	grails	wicket	grails
with four grails project under my belt preceded by two tapestry project and one wicket project i m seriously looking at play next

1649131
groovy	gsp
one of the things i thought was cool about grails is that everything s groovy. that is you use groovy to write everything except the html and the css -- domains controllers service page templates gsp tag libs hibernate api gorm unit tests gunit and building scripting gant

1649131
delphi	c++
.so being able to code all aspects of an .app using a single language again seemed like a simplification that was long overdue -- hearkening back to the days of writing desktop .apps in a single language like c++ or delphi

1649131
groovy	java
how you specify log4j settings for example looks nothing like how you specify the data sources and neither looks like the pure java upon which groovy is based

1649131
spring	grails
one of my open questions is that i m assuming that jpa has transactional support which is why play doesn t need spring for that like grails does no

1649143
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump path to repo1 -r head | svndumpfilter include project to keep | svnadmin load path to repo2

1649143
svnadmin	dump
but .so far we have not been able to get the svnadmin load to succeed with just these partials dump

1649145
value	field
my value properties is bound to a colour field in a business object then after i types red in the textbox and tab to another field then any other field on the form that bind to the same colour field are updates immediately

1649179
arrays	loops	order	add
split the string into an arrays of string using the as the deliminator you will then have an arrays with in this order key then value you could then loops through looking for the email key then simply add 1 to the arrays index to get the value

1649179
value	field
but this could fail in lots of ways eg some one enters as a character or there are empty strings in the value field

1649213
contains	elements	contains	sorted
if the vector is sorted and contains the value std lower_bound will give you an iterator to the first elements with a given value and std upper_bound will give you an iterator to one elements past the last one contains the value

1649279
python	java
if you re used to the java python etc

1649299
arguments	default
let me explain positional arguments a and b in your case are obligatory and may have default value

1649299
default-value	arguments
if you want to make an arguments obligatory or to have a default-value put it before arguments and kwarguments

1649299
arguments	default
there s another way but not that readable to have default value for arguments and have no positional arguments

1649318
arrays	map
this should map .when adding an arrays of json object as arguments to your function

1649346

attributes	properties
we re able to load a dicom file and fetch the attributes but we re having problems putting the image data on the source properties of an image control to show it

1649359
actionscript	mxml
this is also why actionscript classes and mxml components interoperate very horribly you might have noticed mxml doesn t have the concept of interfaces execution flow and thus time whereas as3 doesn t have the concepts of events or binding which are native in mxml but are built on top of as3 using some metadata and the flash.events package looking very nice in mxml but being an impressive numbers of call and instantiations in as3 .

1649359
reflection	runtime
at runtime every object has its own class and interfaces are secondary for introspection reflection .

1649373

1649440
revision	updates
you need to create and write a new recording for each updates if you want to keep a revision history

1649461
python	php
my first thoughts were to look at going down the libcurl route as i have done similiar with python php

1649472
python	ruby
solutions in bash python or ruby would be helpful

1649515
wamp	php
if i try to execute in php wamp install on pc.dev.xp those scripting they hang

1649518
value	field
for example i know i can make a new row and enter value into all field doing this

1649518
value	field
assuming the named of the first field id77 is myid and the named of the second field some value is foo .

1649534
order	add
an alternative to changing the order of deletions would be to add a reverse one-to-many collections in b with cascaded deletes

1649541
any	set
timeout can be set on oracle server side but not through any oci apis

1649555
sqldatareader	sqlclient
but i ve heard and read that the default.aspx page should not know about sqldatareader in fact you probably dont want to add the sqlclient namesspace to the default.aspx code-behind page

1649556
updating	updates
i can save updates on regular field but i m having trouble saving updating cck field

1649576
configuration	installation
the easier and faster installation and configuration is the better.

1649586
httpwebrequest	webclient
in the scenario given you should be able to use the async nature of things like httpwebrequest webclient which will support all this already using completion-ports rather than just threads

1649589
java.util.date	to-date
should give you a compiler error stating that the reference to-date is ambiguous because both other.date and java.util.date matches

1649592
attributes	properties
for some reason it is only binding the standards sitemap attirbuites title url etc and errors databinding system.web.sitemapnode does not contains a properties with the named address .when putting a breakpoints in i can read the standards attributes its the custom ones that done seem to be getting passed

1649599
versioning	packaging
using the open packaging conventions and the open xml sdk 1 as suggested by nestor would be one option but you could also easily roll your own versioning of such a format

1649607
instances	private
accessing a private member directly from another instances is correct not always desirable though for instances .when you re subclassing that s why it is private in first place

1649614
jdk1.5	jdk1.6
we can do this fine and works perfectly under jdk1.6 however we need it to work under jdk1.5

1649614
wsimport	jdk1.5	jaxws-maven-plugin	wsimport
we re using jaxws-maven-plugin to generator the source code however it depends on the wsimport binary being available this is not available in jdk1.5

1649614
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the versioning numbers to 2.1-1 and now .when we building the project to generator the source code we get the following error

1649617
shell	bash
a shell language like bash and one hll like lisp which might be useful

1649651
put	get
to get user management let subversion listen to localhost 127 1 and put an apache webserver in front

1649653
any	set
we have two tables family and member the relation between these two is family has set of members in it but member don t have any family relationship within it

1649656
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
i looked at using bind but didnt want to deal with having to set up zones and extra configuration evdns allowed me to use the existing resolv.conf to forwarding any dns request to real named servers and to modify the response as needed based on information contains in a mysql table

1649675
associations	model
also using default_scope isn t very revealing .when ticket associations are accessed outside the ticket model i called account.tickets

1649692
decrement	increment
the problem is that it assumes that the subscript increment decrement and other indexing operators of the iterator step over elements of the sequences

1649693
criteria-api	many-to-one
the many-to-one associations refuses to load .when using the criteria-api all i get is null here is an example of a query

1649709
32-bit	64bit	versioning	staging
all the versioning between the staging server and the production server are the same but in the production server which is 64bit but is running the .app in 32-bit mode i m getting a timeout in this controllers action

1649709
attributes	properties
however i ve tried several approaches such as using the bind attributes before the action parameters tried creating a newpersonform class which contains 3 properties person peoplecertificationlevel address and even tried with a formcollection and updatemodel call

1649709
32-bit	64bit
updates 2 this application is compiled in 32-bit and running in a 64bit environment

1649711
stderr	stdout
i have to call an external program from my ruby scripting and this program send a lot of useful but cryptic info to stdout and stderr

1649711
stderr	stdout
while the program is running i d like to parsing the line it send to stdout and stderr and

1649711
stderr	stdout
etc. but i can only retrieve stdout stderr after the program is execute not during its execution

1649715
versioning	upgrade
smooth upgrade to new versioning

1649716
any	set
really if you want an order sequences outside of a key-value setup std set is just easier to use than any other

1649744
selected	textbox	auto-populate	selected
textbox would auto-populate with the current value for the language selected in the dropdown

1649749
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
i would start by looking inside the view lifecycle methods - viewwillappear viewdidappear etc

1649764
arrays	loops
why not just create a temporary arrays the size of loops to store the dist value

1649764
arrays	loops
then .when loops is finished just use the xlswrite function to write the arrays to a file

1649782
sql-server	mysql
mysql supports triggers but it doesn t seem to support a way to raise an error yet like sql-server and other databases

1649789
contains	lookup
the session data should actually be stored on your server and the cookies merely provides a lookup key to the session object that contains all the details

1649793
json	xml
i understand why rest framework vendors want to provide the support for returning both json based representations and xml based representations but why do people want to return both from the same service

1649793
json	xml
do you have some kind of standardized mechanism for mapping attributes and elements into some kind of consistent json format or do you just avoid attributes in your xml

1649793
json	xml
some people want to migrate from xml to json and therefore supporting both is required for backward compatibility

1649793
json	xml
another interesting suggested reason is json can be used to provide a quick a dirty data summary and xml can be used as a semantics rich complete representation

1649808
credentials	account
if sso is running under your account and it stopped working .when you changed the passwd you need to updates your passwd on the service s credentials

1649811
private-members	instances
the code works because an instances or class can access private-members of other instancess of the same class

1649817
asp.net-mvc	webforms
can someone clarify as to why asp.net-mvc is ill-suited towards data-heavy applications and why webforms are more appropriate

1649823
json	xml
of course xml can be parsing with javascript and java and the most part of other programming languages has at least one json parsing

1649823
json	xml
talking about the implementation vs benefit topic i mostly work with ruby and i can tell you ruby-on-rails provides the ability to create a json or xml response in less than a couple of seconds from the same source

1649824
keyboard	mouse
scrolling through or filtering 3000 rows would be very annoying on a quad-core desktop with 4gb of ram continuous ac power a 19 lcd a full-size keyboard and a standards mouse

1649829
firefox	safari
works fine in firefox and safari but i get nothing in ie7 it doesnt swap the first class on document-ready nor does it swap anything onclientclick

1649852
joomla	drupal
perhaps take a selection of project again i m thinking web based because web usability is more defined in my mind - cms blogging software drupal joomla wordpress

1649869
command-line	cmd
i like how visual-studio can be configure to autocomplete your nant cmd via xsd but i m still testing my scripting on the command-line

1649872
webserver	upload
i am upload a file into a webserver using file upload api it works good for a single user if multiple user upload a file simultaneously how to improve my code using threads

1649874
json	xml
an application might required the ability for ajaxy browser clients to grab information for pages for which json would be good and also might need to support some standalone api clients that may do background or batch-file process for which xml libs are more convenient

1649884
icmp	tcp	packets	ping
ping is an icmp packets and doesn t create a tcp connection hence you won t see it in netstat

1649885
webforms	asp.net
not event-driven .so maybe difficult for people who know only asp.net webforms to wrap their minds around it

1649887
sql-server	postgresql
trying to recreate my sql-server database on postgresql

1649892
asp.net-mvc	webforms
they might be speculating on the difficulty of creating many model if you have lots of different types of data or perhaps the relative difficulty of creating webforms in asp.net-mvc

1649894
value	field
another hacky way to do this if the absolute value of the scores aren t that important is to discretize them place them in buckets based on value and create a field for each bucket

1649894
value	field
.so if you have scores that range from 1 to 100 create say 10 buckets called relatedscore0_10 relatedscore10_20 etc and for any document that has a relatedscore in that bucket add a true value in that field

1649894
value	field
otherwise you d need to reindex to change the field norm boost value for each field

1649900
databound	gridview
i believe that these author are talking about the ability to drag drop data controls onto the page such as gridview formviews and other databound object

1649914
vdproj	cab
we are currently building the cab using a vdproj in visual-studio and signing it using cabwiz

1649919
moodle	elgg
i like elgg only because it is being used by a growing numbers of online education sites and i think it integrated very nice with moodle

1649965
ruby	php
php and ruby programmers tend not to care

1649993
dictionary	arrays
the solution in this case was to put the items into an arrays or a dictionary and caching that instead and then recreate the items .when the page was loaded

1649997
arrays	loops
then .when you create rootviewcontroller in your loops you can set the tabledataarrays with the new init methods and you can have each the table views populate with different arrays

1650002
cursor	row
while the using the into variables construct is on the right tracking the code-snippets show with only this change will fail since the cursor has more row columns declare than variabless referenced in the into clause

1650014
directory	folder
set the working directory to the original building output folder .so that file named are still valid in the temporary test folder

1650027
defined	declare
for this reason as long as you declare and defined function separately there s really no redundancy in having to list the parameters again

1650031
json	xml
just because you want the resource in a different serialization be it xml json html or something else we re still describing the same resource

1650076
macros	let
let me break down in a more human-readable pseudo code what this macros is doing

1650091
double	int
.so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1650123
double	int
if you want your comparison to return true if and only if the double precisely matches the int value has no fractions component you should cast your int to a double to do the comparison

1650123
double	int
if something like 1.1 would be considered equals to 1 you can either cast the double to an int if you want to ignore the fractions component altogether or round the double if you want say 1.9 to equals 2

1650125
value	field
the text appears fine but some of the field are packed decimal which .when unpack give bad value

1650129
internet-explorer	firefox
as per usual w django this was fairly easy to set up and works beautifully on firefox but using ie8 i intermittently get a puzzling internet-explorer cannot display this webpage .when i save a recording

1650130
value	field
the field that have keyword are combo boxes on my form and their controlsource is the keyword field from the query like i mentioned earlier the value can only be one keyword out of a list

1650151
coding-style	indentation
sorry for bad indentation and coding-style

1650162
any	set
i m not using any special widget and i get the enter a valid date messages even .when i explicit set input_formats y- m- d m d y m d y on the form field

1650165
hashmap	arrays
o 1 is arrays access time and hashmap btw

1650168
delphi	c++
it was about delphi but that doesn t mean it won t work with c++ as well

1650201
memcached	apc
since you already have apc install it can be used similar to the memcached recommendations to store object

1650208
fadeout	fadein
best way would be do make copy of your datasource make a double animation for the fadeout and fadein add the grid withe viso-ve source opacity 0 in the same conatiner and remove the useless at animation end event .

1650211
emacs	vim
i have noticed that .when i access the repository with a browser sometimes the pdf files in the repository show up as plain text as if you viewed the pdf with a text-editor like emacs vim or notepad instead of being downloading or opened with some pdf-reader

1650225
background-color	transparency
have you tried explicit giving the elements a background-color transparency

1650249
contains	elements
.when i generator javabeans from this xml schema then the javadoc of those beans only contains some generics generator information about the allowed content of the types elements

1650259
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
my actual solution for the job i then tend to break down into the web application business-logic-layer data-access-layer and entity layer

1650269
hash	md5
you could probably generator a md5 hash of the current datetime random numbers and truncated it to the length you need 5-8 characters and store it as the id field

1650269
sequences	unique
but i ll give it a shot .so i guess what you need is .someway of converting a numbers into a unique short string and that is not in sequences

1650269
mapping	unique	sequences	unique
to avoid the sequences problem you could have some mapping between your auto-generated id s to some random value unique mapping

1650272
worksheet	excel
simplly an excel sheet that has a single line for each requirement a worksheet for each product a book for each stage plan

1650276
where-clause	sql
sql abstract can take a perl hash and turn it into a where-clause

1650285
margins	padding
try inspector the elements with firebug in firefox to see the effective padding margins border of elementss

1650286
margins	padding
because the parent elements factors in the pixels for the border padding and margins of the textbox

1650287
output	mode
the -p option is for pass-through mode as against -i for input or -o for output

1650299
internet-explorer	firefox
the following code works ok in internet-explorer but not in firefox 2.0.0.20

1650349
clutter	gtk
the gtk docs usually don t contains examples for every single function because that would clutter them up and the documentation of functions like gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file is usually pretty straightforward

1650356
put	get	contains	elements
but if the elements i want to have contains cdata is only one on the page how do i get it to not put cdata in all the other elementss

1650357
richtextbox	linklabel
i am sure using a child linklabel or richtextbox to rendering my control s text will solve this but i don t like the idea of using a child control just to underline a few words

1650365
checkbox	button
based on this types i want to rendering the question to html in a specific way multiple choice radio button multiple answer checkbox etc...

1650373
contains	elements
in this example elementstypess will be a single elements contains the types for system.string

1650376
implements	extends
if you needed more functionality than the libs provides you could implements a partials class in your project and extends the libs in that way

1650407
project-management	project
i have been developed all different asp.net project in the last 4 years but never happened to get deep into project-management and now since i am start to work on some project on my own i think it is time for me to get into learning those methodologies on project-management and development

1650412
value	field
setting it up like that would let you use the value field as an index on your dataprovider like this

1650414
qobject	qevent
first thing i d try would be to install an event filtering on the child widget see qobject installeeventfiltering then in the parent widget grap the qevent paint event and do the painting there

1650414
qobject	qevent
bool draw eventfilter qobject watched qevent event

1650436
double	int
using double for testing 32-bit int you should be fine though

1650440
instances	self
my problem is self is always giving me the id of the class but not the instances of the class

1650441
base-class	inherited
the rendering is definitely a user-interface concern .so i d separate that from the question class and add a factory to i.solate the switching logic the questioncontrol base-class inherited from webcontrol and would contains the majority of the rendering logic

1650475
duplicates	contains
does the uniq methods remove duplicates in .so far as these object points to the same spaces in memory or that they contains identical information

1650507
contains	lookup	contains	any	lookup	any
an object can contains a direct reference to another object without resorting to key or key lookup or any such foolishness

1650519
hide	show
as i m using jquery s show and hide methods it means it ll often be in this state

1650524
project-management	project	project-management	scrum
are you wanting to learn scrum to get into project-management or just as a way to manage your own personal project

1650524
project-management	scrum
if you are wanting to get into project-management find some books articles etc on scrum and go for it

1650541
xsd	xml
i ve got a xml schema xsd file snippet bellow in which i want the named and adress elements to appear in any order but always before the film sequences

1650591
python	php
my target languages are php and python if this is relevant

1650596
.when	ready
we got a temporary reprieve by convincing the provider to switching back to verisign but .when they switching back we have to be ready

1650600
callback	methods
instead you must set up a methods that knows what to do with the answer once it arrives at some points in the future--that s the nature of a callback

1650623
variables	boolean
you can t actually assign a boolean value to a boolean variables - but you can convert from boolean to boolean using autoboxing

1650648
keypress	ctrl
yet .when the user hits ctrl + c the keypress event doesn t fire

1650652
display	width
i am trying to adjust the width of tabs from windows - preferences - general - editor - text editor where there is a field for display tab width

1650658
numeric	digits
x year for the week where sunday is the first day of the week numeric four digits

1650658
numeric	digits
x year for the week where monday is the first day of the week numeric four digits

1650658
numeric	digits
y year numeric four digits

1650658
numeric	digits
y year numeric two digits

1650660
boolean	int
don t be queasy about summing boolean python boolean are sharply defined as a subclassing of int with exactly two instances which have peculiar str repr but otherwise behave exactly like the plain int 0 and 1

1650699
facebook-page	facebook
i m not sure how to get that variables since my .app uses facebook connect and is not install in the facebook-page

1650718
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter key do raise the keydown and keyup events

1650724
oracle	mysql
also do we have any site or resource where we can get mysql equivalent syntax to oracle syntax

1650727
selected	cell
i ve noticed that .when one performs the above action and then copies the result back into an excel sheet you get only those cell selected - which is great

1650727
selected	cell
however .when one copies the selected cell into notepad you get the complete range

1650748
hide	show
you can fine-tune your grant options and hide the data you don t want to show

1650776
restart	reload
the user can reload the page without restart the search

1650777
double-quotes	single-quotes
this however won t play nice with which al.so uses double-quotes .so we changed that to single-quotes

1650780
moodle	elgg
i have been experimenting with a lot of web development apps like drupal moodle efront and elgg lately

1650789
boost	stl
not part of stl but well known libs is boost

1650789
header-only	boost
many things in boost are header-only templates libs

1650801
google-chrome	opera
then i cue up another browser instances - opera google-chrome whatever and enter the details page for that person

1650810
google-chrome	firefox
if i change it to google-chrome or firefox this doesn t happen

1650855
groovy	gsp
one other possibility is to view the source of the groovy code generator for your gsp

1650859
arrays	loops
if you re going through an arrays or other iterable structure use a foreach loops and put your completed loops code following it

1650866
puts	gets
it gets my named right but then it s puts my day job in as the company at the top of each page

1650891
memory-management	memory-leaks
2 and 3 are really the only safe options in c++ code that uses exception-handling - if you use raw pointers and manual memory-management you will end up with memory-leaks sooner or later

1650893
put	get
it seems anonymous types get a debuggerdisplayattribute put on them where

1650910
put	get
timestamp field are unable to handle this data accurately for reasons i ll explain if your systemd is set to a dst timezone then what you put into timestamp may not be what you get back out

1650925
32-bit	64bit
i am unclear on the difference between the 32-bit and 64bit versioning of installutil

1650936
python	java
concurrency in python at least cython and java are wildly different at least in part because of the global interpreter lock gil

1650943
foundation	cocoa
once you add unittestbundle to your application open its info getinfo and in other linker-flags change cocoa to foundation after your change other linker-flags should like this

1650954
thread-dump	visualvm
visualvm has a plugins called tda or you can use thread-dump analyzer directly

1650980
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit machine you will be able to allocate much more memory in a single process than you would be able to on a 32-bit machine

1650989
fitnesse	jbehave
technologies like fit fitnesse jbehave cucumber .

1650995
double	int	boolean	double	boolean	int
another example of types that are not classes are the primitive-types boolean byte char short int long float and double are types but they are not classes

1650999
32-bit	64bit
both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of the install tool

1650999
32-bit	64bit
64bit clr use the 32-bit install tool to install 32-bit

1650999
32-bit	64bit
32-bit or 64bit

1651041
c-standard-library	standard-library
the c++ standard-library itself include the stl and a previous versioning of the c-standard-library

1651058
constructor	object
in the mainpage.xaml file i can create an image object call it mainimage and then in the code-behind use this in the constructor

1651059
administration	account
thus you ll want to add whatever from account you want as an administration to the .app

1651075
carbon	cocoa
since the finder in snow leopard has been rewritten to use cocoa instead of carbon i d like to know if there s a new api to write finder plugins

1651083
subtyping	generics
subtyping does not extends through generics types does not imply that

1651085
constructor	private	instances	private
in fact if you look at the source of the keytool class sun.security.tools package not only is it final it also has a private constructor preventing any caller from creating an instances of the keytool class from code

1651095
if-statement	loops
add this in the inner loops before the if-statement this is a quick fix

1651105
put	get
almost like it caching the request and its saying i did this already let me just return what i got before .when i copy the url and put it in my browser i get the expected behavior why is this h.appening .when i am making the request through the silverlight .app

1651119
margins	padding
it removes the div from the dom and recreates it as the first elements within the body tag and sets the margins and padding to zero

1651130
put	get
just don t let them save strings and send to other people -- al.so don t put the value in the url via a get .so that it can be emailed

1651154
children	nodes
the problem is that every instances of nodes class shared the same children attributes if the attributes is not given explicit such as

1651166
postgresql	mysql
the hosting company does not support mysql or postgresql

1651171
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
if you re using interface-builder make sure the class for the viewcontroller your expecting to reload is defined selected the viewcontroller in ib then cmd-4 make sure class is defined to be the class you want viewwillappear and viewdidappear to be called in

1651178
cursor	row
this can be done within a stored procedure by use of cursor or within an application fetch a row process updates a row

1651192
arguments	default
.so the default arguments is evaluated at the moment that that line of code is evaluated

1651199
z-index	overlay
i don t know how asp hyperlink works but have you tried giving it a z-index larger than the overlay

1651204
value	field
in the pop-up windows you can enter value of the field or make a selection from a dropdownlistfor

1651210
virtual-machine	virtualbox
i run windows 7 as my main os and for development work i install centos on a virtual-machine under virtualbox

1651213
mobile-devices	blackberry
we d like to sync our data to mobile-devices iphone windows-mobile blackberry etc

1651219
rollback	commit
whether commit would be a no-op or not and whether rollback would discard something or not

1651220
arguments	default
but you must see that evaluation default arguments every time would lay a heavy runtime burden on the systemd

1651235
csv	xml
to save to disk i d just serialization the memory structure if that s easy in c# i assume there s a built-in pickling mechanism or translation it to xml or csv or whatever is appropriate

1651260
firefox	opera
i think the best bet is to wait as in late 2007 there was blogs for firefox and opera to have 3d support in canvas

1651278
google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome and firefox both rendering the same webpage just fine through cassini and iis7

1651280
arguments	default
also more fundamentally it s technically impossible to implements arguments default as function evaluation

1651284
arguments	default
the alternative would be quite heavyweight -- storing default arguments value in the function-object as thunks of code to be execute over and over again every time the function is called without a specified value for that arguments -- and would make it much harder to get early-binding binding at def time which is often what you want

1651284
early-binding	late-binding
the alternative forcing late-binding for both situation would not offer this flexibility and would force you to go through hoops such as wrapping your function into a closure factory every time you needed early-binding as in the above examples -- yet more heavy-weight boilerplate forced on the programmer by this hypothetical design decision beyond the invisible ones of generator and repeatedly evaluation thunks all over the place

1651284
early-binding	late-binding
- rather than giving two obvious ways to get late-binding and no obvious way to get early-binding a minus

1651304
append	input
just to re-iterate the problem in ie programatically setting the named attributes on an elements created via document.createelements input is not reflected in getelementssbytagnamed form.elementss if append to a form and is not submitted with the form again if append to a form reference

1651322
profiling	debugging
you know how vbulletin has a sql profiling .when in debugging mode

1651323

the search url doesn t return the results but returns some json or xml content with the url of the actual results

1651331
oracle	mysql
i want to migrate schema from oracle to mysql .so are there any free tools that would be useful for this task

1651346
any	set	subclassing	superclass
the problem was that uipickerview already has a delegation member variables and you were declaring another one in a subclassing which was what was being set while the superclass s delegation variables remained nil and therefore any delegation methods would not be called on the class you expect it to be called on

1651346
implements	extends
if you need to extends the given protocols do .so have a class implements that then just set the class as the uipickerview s delegation

1651352
put	get
are you expecting the scripting to get execute .when the option is chosen just because you ve put it in the value

1651352
javascript	dom
better to use the dom object than trying to mess around insert javascript inside html inside javascript inside html

i have a .xslt that translation xml from one form to another i m not using and xsd .so i will not say from one schema to another

1651412
value	field
one thing to watch out for is recording which are present in the append queries but aren t insert into the data due to duplicates key value null required field etc

1651417
versioning	upgrade
you ll have access to essentially all of python 2.5 functionality not sure .when ironpython will upgrade to a 2.6 versioning of python but 2.5 is already quite usable plus all the .net libs and assemblies you know and love and tools such as visual-studio add-ins

1651421
oracle	mysql
this does not mean one does not exist however it is probably easier and less error prone to take your existing oracle scripting and manually create the appropriate mysql scripting

1651421
oracle	mysql
oracle to mysql

1651438
dependency-injection	inject
next put in-place a dependency-injection framework like spring which will inject a concrete widgetrepository implementation at runtime based on some xml configuration or auto-wiring mechanism

1651468
while-loop	for-loop
and not to be nitpicky or anything but your first while-loop would probably suit your needs better as a for-loop since you need a counter anyways

1651469
mouseover	mouseout
if i mouseover the navigation the drop_down div slider down and if i mouseout it slider up

1651473

updates it appears to be something with the scriptaccess setting but even .when set to always as said on the uploadify website it still is not firing any backend scripting or my oncomplete function

1651559
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead new in prototype 1.6.1 but not new in ie

design-view	designer
however once in the code-behind it takes me back to the design-view on the designer which is never what i want

1651607
python	c++	python	java
it can be in any language but better in c++ java python etc

1651614
arrays	loops
assuming you re not altering the arrays while iterator through it you could maintain a counter that decrement in loops and once it reaches 0 you re handling the last

1651632
arrays	loops	contains	elements
note that this methods won t work if your arrays contains elementss whose value is false and you ll need to handle the last elements after doing your usual loops body because the arrays pointers is advanced by calling next or else memoize the value

1651641
design-view	designer
i don t work in asp.net but there is a setting under options - html designer to start pages in source view design-view or split view

1651675
multithreading	wait
something based on jan willem b s ajax-based suggestion should be a viable alternative to this multithreading wait state pattern

1651675
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the example from aspfree.com i posted should meet a majority of your requirements though and work just as well with asp.net-mvc as webforms

1651719
wsimport	jdk1.5	jaxws-maven-plugin	wsimport
we re using jaxws-maven-plugin to generator the source code however it depends on the wsimport binary being available this is not available in jdk1.5

1651723
sql-server	oracle
i am aware that there s no equivalent of the offset keyword and oracle s rownum in sql-server 2000 but is there any workaround

1651729
any	set
because i have to decide find an arbitrary set of characters that will work for any possible case

1651733
csv	xml	csv	zip
i have a bunch of xml data with highly repeat segments angle brackets repeated attributes named etc which compresses fantastically if i save it out to a csv and zip it as a control case but i get almost 0 compression in sql-server

1651748
any	set
the init methods works as basically a reset button then if you code it right allowing you to return the class to its initial state while for instances allowing any variables that have been set to remain set

1651773
contains	elements	contains	any
there s try and true tooltip jquery plugins that you can use for pretty much with any elements that contains title attributes

1651834
queue	fifo
the points of a queue is to provide a fifo fifo interface abstraction

1651862
64bit	x86
on x86 the fastest way to atomically write an aligned 64bit value is to use fistp

1651864
sql-server	oracle
how do we execute an oracle stored procedure from sql-server 2005

1651864
sql-server	oracle
as part of a sql-server scripting we need to execute an oracle 10g stored procedure and downloading data to sql-server 2005

1651871
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
for example if a user hide the sports news containers it won t be show on users next visit

1651889
triggers	insert
what you re looking for is an instead of insert updates triggers

1651889
triggers	insert
within your triggers you attempt the insert or updates yourself inside a try-catch

1651893
filtering	grouping
then run the results through a filtering in the calling scripting to grouping them together

1651901
macros	vba
specifically what do i need to do to have calc openoffice.org s versioning of excel read and execute vba in macros s and tie macros events to button click

1651909
triggers	insert
after triggers that fire after insert updates delete

1651909
triggers	insert
instead of triggers which can catch the operation insert updates delete and do something instead

1651909
triggers	insert
sql-server does not have the before insert updates delete triggers that other rdbms have

1651909
triggers	insert
you can have any numbers of after triggerss but only one instead of triggers for each operation insert updates delete

1651910
contains	any
for five of the columns contains teacher namedd i d like to collapse all of the blanks in each row .so i have no blanks to the left of any named

1651915
arrays	loops
would it be easier to have two views that exist separate from this in an arrays for example then index the one you want to make active and wrap that into the animation loops above while releasing and hiding the other one

1651924
annotations	mapping
possibly that would allow me to skip mapping files and just allow me to specify everything in annotations

1651925
value	field
but ext.data.record itself has a public properties called data an object with the field value properties which you can collect into an arrays using the ext.data.store#each methods and then encode with ext.encode to stringify it

1651928
python	ruby
python and ruby just about even

1651928
python	ruby
i would rather have continue the comment thread above that briefly mentioned python vs ruby but i need formatting to do this

python	ruby
smashery is certainly classy but doesn t need to worry it turns out that python and ruby are in a pretty close race by one measure

1651928
python	ruby
i went back and compared python to ruby in the eight code-golf s that i have entered

1651928
python	ruby
challenge best python best ruby

1651936
ostream	std
right now passing std endl into a ostream generator the cr character only for newline

1651940
unpivot	pivot
you can unpivot row_number over teacher and pivot again.

1651951
cassini	iis
my assumption as mentioned in my comment earlier was that ie is working in a different rendering mode depending on whether you are using iis or cassini and this is causing the layout difference

1651953
annotations	mapping
i consider jibx the best of the bunch jaxb castor xmlbeans etc. particularly because i favor mapping files over annotations

1651953
annotations	mapping
side comment i prefer mapping files over annotations because annotations

1651966
attributes	properties
created the converter to attempt to read the attributes from the properties

1651966
attributes	properties
now i was able to read the attributes value if i supplied the types of my test model with the decorated properties .so that much is possible but i wasn t able to dynamically identify the types on-the-fly

1651970
revision	svn
svn copy -r revision

1651973
value	field
if you cannot use an auto increment field and want an absolutely unique value use uuid

1651985

for some context i just upgrade ubuntu which broke my existing gitosis installation see here bug #368895 and have just reinstalled gitosis from package

1651985
configuration	installation
i now want to migrate my whole configuration and set of repositories from the old gitosis installation which still exists and can be pulled from but is otherwise broken

1651992
sql-server	mysql
our .app runs on mysql h2 and sql-server with no modifications and probably would just run on the other major databases as well

1652004
contains	set
it seems that .when some controls have their visibility set to false they do not get rendering yet .when i set an ascx control to be hidden from the aspx page that contains it the code still runs through the ascx s codebind despite it being marked as not visible

i don t believe that ooo calc can read or execute vba it has its own dialect of basic which has a variant syntax

1652045
postgresql	mysql
and i also want to know whether i should start with postgresql or mysql

1652056
return-value	arguments
for general use methods with a return-value and any numbers of arguments use nsinvocation

1652076
ruby-on-rails	camping	sinatra	ramaze
you can use the ruby-on-rails ramaze sinatra or camping frameworks

1652076
postgresql	mysql
their systemd default to postgresql but if you use mysql or sqlite on your development machine heroku will automatically import it and convert to postgresql .when you push to it

1652084

constructor	object
note that all object exposed by your .net libs must have public constructor that accept no arguments

1652121
pivot-table	crosstab
if you are familiar with pivot-table crosstab report then this should be fairly straightforward

1652123
protected	public
in c# set access modifiers public private or protected before the methods getmyinfo generator the following error the modifiers private is not valid for this item

1652160
administration	account
the running asp.net application should be able to execute certain actions under an administration account

at the same time the change should be logged with the normals user s account .so i don t want to lose the authentication user s credentials

1652168
sql-server	oracle
can you confirm if you have successfully execute an oracle stored procedure from sql-server using the open query function

1652171
any	set
you can set a triggers such that a scripting pushes the trunk to a dev systemd immediately on any checkin

1652212
tiff	gif
the file is most likely to be a pdf pdf file has form field filled in by users or scanned jpeg tiff gif files in zipped format where user has scanned the form

1652212
png	gif	tiff	png	tiff	gif
optional we may want to allow jpeg tiff gif png - any components to checked these file types

1652212
antivirus	security
from the security perspective are there any antivirus components that can be invoked from .net code to checked the file for virus

1652215
any	set
in visual-studio i have all the xml settings set to 4 spaces no tabs but this does not seem to have any effect

1652221
include	ssi
technically the ssi is probably a little faster because the include are pulled into the page and compiled into a single class

1652223
attributes	properties	any	set
the only workaround i could come up with was to create a system.web.ui.htmlcontrols.htmllink object in the code-behind set the href properties and the rel attributes and any other attributess you want and add it to the controls for the head contentplaceholder

1652225
testdriven.net	ncover
all but one of these test suites runs perfectly in the versioning of ncover that comes with testdriven.net 1.5.8

1652235
sinatra	ramaze
there are other frameworks like merb which is merging with ruby-on-rails sinatra and ramaze

i m thinking maybe i missed something in the install process since i can t find the my.cnf or mysql.sock file on the systemd

1652255
getter	setter
how should i write my getter or setter in this case

1652265

there are apis for c++ java python and c# and it s easy to use

1652341
selected	button
background i have a toolbar and i want to hide button s depending on what subclassing is currently set to the selected item object

1652368
input-field	textarea
i would advise splitting your textarea into a textarea and a text input-field for the image url

1652380
dictionary	arrays
i presume that fbrequest cannot deal with the arrays you include in the attachment dictionary

1652397
c++	lua
i m not saying you should do this but lua will let you grow and is very easy to implements in c++

1652404
temporary	rvalue
for some invented temporary variables t with the result being the value of t as an rvalue

1652412
phpmyadmin	phpbb
try to look into existing project opened ones such as phpmyadmin phpbb etc. as opposed to starting a new one to understand how they re built the ideas leading to their core structure etc

1652454
python	perl
if you ve never worked with any dynamic-languages before python perl etc you re in for a ride

1652457
joomla	drupal
cmss like wordpress drupal or joomla are widely used which keep all the data organized and do all the work of generator the page for you

1652465
windows-vista	windows
i have tried now on windows 7 and windows-vista

1652489
value	field
i m not really sure how the form would know about what unique value exist in the database it just validation the types of field required to populate the model as far as i know

1652493
value	field
in the tees table these dolts are storing the par target score like .so field named par_ 1 par_ 2 par_ 3 through par_ 18 with int value

1652493
value	field
.so the hole numbers is part of the field named and is not stored as a value at all

1652519
onkeydown	onkeyup
try binding to one of the following events onkeydown onkeypress or onkeyup

1652531
value	field
you can then get the field value for a specific instances or static value

1652561
puts	gets
with this it should be quite easy to write a category on nsobject with a methods that gets the list of properties and puts them into a dictionary

1652565
textbox	button
button onclientclick methods and set the text of winform textbox

1652570
dump	temp
we don t have write access to the db .so we can t do what i was originally thinking create temp db copy tables minus the columns we don t want into the temp db and then dump that db

1652570
export	csv
a csv export doesn t work it s almost impossible to put the data in the correct field b c of newline

1652577
value	field
the value of field x changes very frequently and a lot of foo recordinging are related to one recording of model c

1652581
unique	words
this attempt will produce better results for collections that are very similar and produce unique words listings for items in the collections

1652583
pascal	delphi
pascal and by extension delphi uses named equivalence rather than structural equivalence for arrays types including dynamic-arrayss

1652602
revision	svn
this is not enforced by svn the tagged tree will always be the same as .when you tagged it even though you re getting the head revision .when you pull down the tag directory

1652612
handler	service
i wrote a handler javax.xml.rpc.handler.handler for a soap web service that inspects header data

1652633
virtual-functions	abstract-class
now in the code i use an abstract-class named imotor which contains only pure virtual-functions

1652634
any	set
as a rules it s best to disable this option .so that you don t have any unfortunate accidents .when translating potentially destructive cmd such as set or delete .so only to enable it if you really need it and be careful what code you run .when you do

1652636
administration	enterprise
administration of an enterprise s

1652654
32-bit	64bit
how do we add two 64bit numbers using 32-bit arithmetic

1652657
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve also found that some browsers won t work with clickonce firefox without a plugins and google-chrome required the setup.exe file to be downloading and started but the machine in question is using internet-explorer though i m not 100 on the versioning

1652665
buffering	streaming
.something large enough that the overhead involved in making the call to load the buffering from disk is small in compari.son with the time it takes to read the data from disk .so that the streaming is optimized.

1652673
32-bit	64bit
if the 64bit numbers are a 2 a 1 and b 2 b 1 where x 2 is the high 32-bit taken as unsigned and x 1 is the low 32-bit taken as unsigned then the sum of the two numbers is given below

1652682
boolean	int
assuming i have a large numbers of int and boolean

1652683
versioning	upgrade
you can have the user go to and it will say what versioning of the framework he she has and how to upgrade to the latest versioning

1652684
spaces	output	double-quotes	spaces
and all occurrences of f should be in double-quotes in case any of the filenames have spaces or other funny characters in them -- should really do this with output as well though since that s defined in the scripting it s actually safe to leave off.

1652695
apache-poi	docx4j
the java equivalent to the openxml-sdk are docx4j my project and apache-poi

1652703
mouseover	mouseout
i am not looking for the typical mouseover mouseout combinations

1652733
default-value	arguments
.so all call to f that don t provide an arguments will use the same instances of c because that s the default-value

1652733
arguments	default
as far as why python does it this way well that tuples could contains functions that would get called every time a default arguments value was needed

1652736
strategy-pattern	command-pattern
if you google for design-patterns like the strategy-pattern and command-pattern you will find some good uses of interfaces and polymorphism

1652740
arrays	map
the map is really a 2d arrays a simple map

1652740
arrays	map
now once that s done draw out your map on graphing paper then building an arrays with the value required to building the walls

python	php	python	java
i am currently developing code using eclipse in java php python and ironpython

1652901
instances	destroy
as long as the underlying instances are never destroy will the pointers added to them remain intact

1652908
contains	elements
sometimes you can hide that by thinking of â niceâ class named that describe how the contains elements are related

1652909
gethashcode	equals
it s much better to implements equals and gethashcode manually .so that you get the results you expect

1652911
value	field
if you are not worried about performance you could use reflection in a utility function to iterate over each field and compare their value

1652916
expression	brackets
your regular expression doesn t do anything like remove brackets - it looks like it s for removing parts from a path

1652941
wamp	php
i am supposed to run the file go-pear.bat which i have in my c wamp bin php php5.3.0 directory

1652941

1652976
expression	brackets
i m trying to write a regular expression that matches all words inside a specific string but skips wordss inside brackets

1652980
floating	padding
other than having the image floating over the textfield via positioning and z-index and adding padding to the textfield to prevent the content to get underneath the image i can t think of any other way to achieve that

1652990
32-bit	64bit
.so why have i been talking about this rather than your question about 64bit numbers and 32-bit arithmetic

1652990
digits	base
now you add them in base 2 32 the exact same way you add them in base 10 -- just rather than adding using digits arithmetic you add using 32-bit arithmetic

1652990
32-bit	64bit
how do you split a 64bit numbers a into two 32-bit numberss a_1 and a_0

1652990
bitwise-and	bit-shift
where is a right bit-shift and is bitwise-and

1652990
32-bit	64bit
typically if you can t do 64bit addition a 64bit numbers will actually be the two 32-bit numberss a_1 and a_0

1652999
constructor	private
local-variables in the outer anonymous-function the constructor are accessible to any function defined within the constructor but not elsewhere making the local-variables private

this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie8.

1653028
triggers	insert
if the view has an instead of insert triggers associated with the view

1653028
triggers	insert
generally you should not rely on being able to perform an insert to a view unless you have specifically written an instead of triggers for it

1653030
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
actual hardware doesn t use 32-bit to add 16-bit at a time only one extra bit of carry is ever needed for addition and almost all cpu s have a carry status flag for .when an addition operation overflowed .so if you are using a 32-bit cpu you can add 64bit operands in two 32-bit operations

1653031
order	add
in fact that new collections holds onto the sort criterion the block instances that was used as the parameter to the assortedcollections messages and as you add more instancess to that collections in the future they will automatically be insert in the correct sort order

1653057
g++	gcc
alternatively if you re using g++ as a better c you may be able to use gcc for your final link step which will include libc automatically

1653086
javascript	dom
i believe i ve come across something similar to this before - it could be a timing issue where the dom is rendering slighlty after the javascript is being told to bind to the elements

1653093
primitive	int
my first instinct is that flatrateint might be null but from the named i m guessing it s a primitive int which would rules that out

1653093
click	mouse
your error messages is about mouse click

1653100
dialog	pop-up
i have an android-spinner and i d like to get a callback .when the user selected something from its pop-up dialog

1653116
callback	methods
don t use dependecypropertychanged callback methods

1653117
dictionary	arrays
mapping your functions to key in a dictionary associativity arrays is a common approach for this situation as jldupont has mentioned -- not just in php but in many dynamic-languages with associativity arrayss

1653117
python	lua
for example python and lua don t even have a switching statement -- this is pretty much the only way to emulate a switching

1653129
put	get
i am trying to get the program to call up the current dateadd 30 days to it and then out put that date as a string

1653131
scientific-notation	digits
enter a very long numbers lets say 500 000 digits long without it going into scientific-notation

1653136
python	java
otherwise what you seek is a libs to extends the built-in functionality of another programming language such as python or java

1653141
python	perl
perl has a bignum module to do that sort of thing and python supports it natively

1653145
python	c++	python	java
python and java have native support libs exist for c++ c .net .

1653147
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java
perl python ruby and java can all do that

1653147
python	ruby
i rather like ruby and python because they automatically switching from fixnum to bignum

1653171
slidedown	slideup
.when i call slideup or slidedown on my div it seems to be sliding very very fast

1653177
visitor-pattern	visitor
i think it is the visitor-pattern although all the time i have seen it i don t quite get it the visitor documentation .so probably this is .something else

1653192
contains	any
the view must not contains any of the following construct

1653192
contains	any
in addition if an inherently updatable view contains pseudocolumns or expression then you cannot updates base table rows with an updates statement that refers to any of these pseudocolumns or expression

1653195
scheme	let
let s say my db scheme is as follows

1653197
perl	php
i have not tried any php html parsing to recommend any but since you are working on a webserver i m hoping it has perl

1653217
wamp	php
warning mail function.mail failed to connect to mail-server at localhost ports 25 verify your smtp and smtp_ports setting in php-ini or use ini_set in c wamp bin php php5.3.0 pear mail mail.php on line 125

1653231
javascript	dom
if i write some javascript that runs in an iframe which is dynamically created and added to the dom with javascript if that matters is it isolated from the global namespace of its parent page or are conflicts still possible

1653235
32-bit	64bit
i found that if you install the 32-bit versioning first it some how mucks up the 64bit versioning

1653244
instances	private
here we are just using static-methods to get and set the private instances to work around the fact you can t have static properties

1653244
instances	private
note 2 the one thing i really question is whether i have done the right thing in the readxmlintodataset methods in lazy-evaluation initializer of the private dataset instances perhaps using clear if the dataset instances is already initializer is not enough

1653247
exc-bad-access	crash
i am programming my first iphone .app which crash with an exc-bad-access error

1653251
abstract-factory	factory-method
this sounds like it might be a job for the factory-method or perhaps abstract-factory

1653251
constructor	object
whether this is better than simply adding constructor to a switching statement depends on the complexity and the uniformity of the object you re creating

1653252
plugins	add-on
then inside the plugins i add-on methods to this passed in object accessor since its an object

1653275
json	xml
i would highly recommend considering either a json or very simplified rest based xml service .when delivering data to your iphone application

1653277
strtok	atof	strtok	atoi	atoi	atof
i would reccomend that you use strtok to split the string into tokens and the use the atoi atol or atof to convert the text into numbers

1653279
attributes	properties
either append it with the attributes set or set the properties after insert

1653282
sinatra	ramaze
i would recommend looking at sinatra ramaze and especially rack which undergirds all the significant ruby web-frameworks including ruby-on-rails

1653314
ruby-on-rails	django
django ruby-on-rails the next big thing.

1653320
any	set
i m sure there is an environment variables you can set to make this happen but i can t see any listed in the on-line manpage for ld

1653327
punctuation	comma
let s say a programming language was developed in a non-english part of the world the keyword were written in the native language for that area and it used the native punctuation eg â â instead of a comma as the decimal-point 123 45 and .so forth

1653359
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
if i use inherited and later realize that a single subclassing needs a methods or field that is not available should i declare that in the base-class and not have it implements in the other subclassinging or should i declare it in that single subclassing

1653359
subclassing	base-class
on the other hand if i choose to put it in the base-class then i end up with a lot of subclassing not implements the properties or methods

1653365
highlight	cell
i am custom drawing cell how can i highlight the cell on touchdown

1653380
esoteric-languages	brainfuck
and i suppose if you like writing in esoteric-languages you might consider a befunge to c compiler or a brainfuck to c compiler very useful.

1653381
subclassing	superclass
however if you need to use it polymorphically then think about what that function would mean for other subclassing of the superclass

1653402
oracle-xe	oracle
i m using java 1.6 the ibatis sql mapper 2.3.3 and oracle-xe an eval versioning of oracle 10.2 with the oracle thin drivers

1653406
administration	account
this process will be entirely automated it assumes the database itself already exists and that it is granted full administration access through the anonymous account with no password...this is for a sandbox environment .so no worries about security .so it needs to be able to detection regardless of the request

1653415
shell	bash
the following diagram illustrates the typical fork execute operation where the bash shell is used to list a directory with the ls cmd

1653416
domdocument	domxpath
or if you re familiar with xpath you can also initializer a domxpath object to query against the loaded domdocument to selected the desired data

1653417
derived-class	base-class
a methods does not belong in a base-class unless every possible derived-class has an appropriate implementation

1653417
derived-class	base-class
this principal basically states than any derived-class should be appropriate whenever a base-class is expected

1653424
groovy	java
you could use groovy to work around the java complexities

1653433
swing	swt
i now use java with both swing and swt

1653433
python	java
i didn t find the transitions from python to java that difficult

1653433
python	java
one thing i did notice is that all the really good stuff i used in python -4 -1 could still be done quite easily in java

1653433
python	java
my advice pick a smallish project - do it in both python and java - see how it runs on all the platform you re interested in

1653435
python	ruby
you can use any of languages targeting jvm jython python impl and jruby ruby impl

1653436
wxpython	pyqt
if i had a chance to start again i d probably go with pyqt based on advice from friend but wxpython will get the job done

1653443
nsmutablearray	plist
nsmutablearray plist or sqlite

1653446
python	java	pyside	pyqt
python with pyqt or the eventually-to-be-equivalent-but-gratis pyside seems the way to go -- after all few languages are easier to program in than java which you consider almost too difficult to program in python is one of those few qt arguably the best cross-platform gui toolkit in any language and pyqt now but gpl or for- or pyside eventually gratis even if you want to close-source your own code are powerful interfaces between python and qt

1653455
solaris	linux
but i m far more familiar with linux strace or even solaris truss .

1653455
python	perl
i suppose we can mostly rules out perl because i ve reproduced the same issue using python .

32-bit	64bit
we were building the indexes on a 64bit windows-vista quad core machine but we were running 32-bit java and 32-bit eclipse

1653493
authentication	login	response	timeout
in a webpage it uses yui connection manager datasource to send ajax request to the server if the session which contains the info on whether the user has been authentication has already timeout those ajax response that can only be viewed by authentication users should return an http-status code telling the client that the session has already timeout then the client either simply redirects him to the login page or asks him if he wants to extends the session

rollback	commit
.so the data you read back should always be consistent with the constraints that you put in your schema and or with the transactional begin commit rollback that you process

1653523
oracle	mysql
by designing where the systemd are decoupled then you can al.so adapt it to other situations .so if the database layer is decoupled then you can easily switching between mysql and oracle by just swapping out the layer

1653546
calling-convention	dllimport
if it is cdecl you need to add calling-convention attributes to the dllimport

1653546
calling-convention	dllimport
dllimport vsssdkd calling-convention calling-convention.cdecl

1653556
abstract-class	derived-class
and as i went through my code looking at all the places where this methods was being called it became extremely clear that all of the customized methodss really needed to be members of an abstract-class the customers assemblies needed to contains a single derived-class that implements all of the abstract-methodss and then the program just needed to get the named of the assembly and the namedspace out of its configuration and create an instances of the custom features class at startup

1653563
combinations	permutation
be wary of combinatorial and permutational algorithms that find all combinations or permutation

1653585

1653603
selection	cell
.when he she leaves the cell the selection box should be closed without changing the html inside.

1653606
dictionary	arrays
that is why you can just add them to dictionary and arrays and save them and reload them easily

1653606
boolean	int
if you were dealing with non-object like int or c-strings or boolean then you will have to use nsnumber ... to turn those into object and then object ... to turn them back into non-ojects to begin with

i came up with some ugly code to achieve my goal that work quite nice in firefox and ie sadly it seems to not work in google-chrome webkit and opera

1653769
bison	yacc
most people user specialized parser- and lexer-generating tools like antlr or yacc bison with lex

1653777
google-chrome	firefox
i am surprised that ie6 7 or 8 are all pretty quick as is google-chrome but firefox seems to take quite a few seconds for exactly the same task in this case

1653779
interpreter	lexer
pick design a language write a couple of really small programs in it write a lexer parsing for part of it then the back to get parts working possibly interpreter to start - just .so you can see it running and then iterate chunks that seem interesting building up to the full language

1653788
beautifulsoup	lxml
i would suggest writing your own using python with the scrapy and either lxml or beautifulsoup package

1653798
selection	cell
basically sethighlighted gets called on touch down and unset on touch up whereas setselected gets call .when the selection is stuck the user meant to press the cell

1653798
highlight	cell
if you play around with a normals table view and cell combo you ll notice that the cell can highlight briefly and unhighlight .when you scroll away from them

1653801
expression	evaluation
in general you can create expression like these from proper use of symbolsname and symbols but be careful with your evaluation

1653812
conditional	operators
one useful composite operators for conditional adding strings or lists into other lists is the x

updates see my improved answer here how to ceil floor and round bcmath numbers

1653843
traversal	parent
however i dont know how to traversal upwards with the parent

1653859
value	field
i would ask if you really need to have the id value in your index field though

1653873
click	mouse
ashcatch - can t leave a comment but wanted to add that iterm has other advantages over terminal.app such as sensible copy and paste configurable words regex for easy double click selection of paths urls middle click paste and terminal mouse support se mouse a in vi to get mouse text selection moving of windows borders etc.

1653875
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	arrays	loops	tokenize	parsing

.when i insert a http ... adress in the field data and value in the code its completly okay

1654056
backslash	regex
you need one backslash to escape the dot .so the regex knows you want an actual dot

1654069
textbox	button
.so to avoid using javascript you would have use ordinary form button instead of link button use form button in conjuction with controls where you would otherwise use autopostback and use a free-form textbox and system.datetime.parse for dates

1654069
any	set
any webserver control whose autopostback properties is set to true

1654090
png	gif
is there a header that can be used to show jpg png gif

png	gif
there s no catch-all content-type for images that ll work for gif png and jpeg all at once

1654128
postgresql	mysql

entity	poco
entity framweork although in v4 poco object are possible they re still pretty hacky and force you into doing too much manual work to set things up

1654140
mongodb	couchdb
i ve also looked at mongodb and couchdb but in those cases the catches with related object looked like they required too much testing before getting things right

but in your business-logic you could call an overloaded default-constructor for the business object that grabs the dependency from a di containers and then call that constructor above

1654238
object-oriented-database	db4o
have you thought about using an object-oriented-database such as db4o

unfortunately the code found online was vb.net not vba

1654326
perl	c++
i saw michael sparks s very interesting dissection of peter norvig s spell checker at the .so devdays in london and it got me wondering if anyone has attempted to implements this piece of code in another language say perl or maybe c++

1654331
debugging	trace
it s fairly usable - but it can be slow that s down to the fact that it s loaded with debugging and trace info to help analyse any crash

1654332
checkbox	textarea
i ve seen that eav could be a possiblity but due to the different input types involved drop-down checkbox text textarea this may become tedious

1654371
subtract	add
the same is true for operation on it add subtract etc.

1654390
data-structures	dictionary
the main thing to keep in mind is that as in most stack-based languages big data-structures are built backwards first you put lots of little strings or numbers on stack then you invoke an operation that says put those together into a list or grab pairs of items on stack and make a dictionary

1654395
innodb	myisam
autoincrement will use the next available id for both innodb and myisam tables

1654395

1654432
datacontext	llblgen
the session in nhibernate has problems .when you are doing web development similar to those related to datacontext in l2s or objectcontext in ef llblgen doesn t suffer from those thanks to self-tracking-entities

1654432
entity-framework	nhibernate
the moral i learned was if you want something that just works and a bit basic use linq-to-sql or subsonic if you want something in the middle and your production-environment can afford beta .net versioning given golive exists use entity-framework 4.0 if you want something very powerful and can afford the hard learning process go to nhibernate and best of all if you can afford llblgen use it

1654464
semantics	keyword
although the following speculation is plausible the reason for the two keyword was probably practical in nature by keeping the syntax and semantics of the struct backward compatible it was possible to introduce c++ into existing programs easily as opposed to say revisit all struct and add the keyword public to them...

1654465
wmv	mp3
i can deal with the mp3 wmv restrictions

1654484
scheme	prolog
though you should also know prolog and scheme

1654488
annotations	mapping
instead of using xml mapping files you can use the hibernate annotations libs which is based on java 5 annotations

1654498
radio-button	textbox
i am showing the value in the textbox.the value comes from the databse first i store it in the variable.i have three radio-buttons and .when the user click third radio-button the textbox going to be disabled

1654505
python	php
i feel that the problem is in the internal presentation which php hide similarly as python

1654513
pointers	stack
if it were a class every time you created a new object 8 bytes would be allocated on the heap and another 8 bytes would be allocated on stack for the pointers

1654515
protected	public
and most programmers explicit identify all their sections as private protected or public anyway

1654515
typedef	struct
.so literally speaking there s nothing you can do with a class you can t do with a typedef struct

1654527
attributes	properties
why won t you save current value attributes to a variables and then set input.value properties to empty string

1654531
jmenuitem	jmenubar
in the java desktop-application templates used by netbeans a menu bar is created with jmenubar and jmenuitem

1654535
.when	ready
start by making your suggestions only .when you can think of a replacement algorithm that is demonstrably superior and also clear and be ready to back off if he resists

1654542
webforms	asp.net
are there any vs templates starter kit any example of an asp.net web application which uses jquery and wcf json without asp.net webforms or asp.net-ajax and generator clean code

1654542
asp.net-mvc	webforms
no webforms asp.net-mvc

1654585
contains	elements
idea is that between variables should contains all elementss between current nodes and next h1 or h2 elements stored in stop variables or all remaining elementss if there is no next h1 or h2

1654587
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
constructor aren t inherited or polymorphism and subclassing constructor while they must and always do invoke a constructor for their immediate superclass do not and cannot have that done automatically except if there s a zero-arg constructor which is implied by the mention of the superclass s named in an extends clause

1654593
constructor	object
i think a better way is to have an configuration object that will get passed to the constructor of all your other classes

1654608
groovy	java
it is fairly easy for us to convert current ibatis mapping in sql to oracle used a groovy scripting to do this also it is easy to convert java code that was calling old mapping that were in sql

1654616
contains	any
but if your class does not contains a pointers to any external data as suggested in the documentation then it would be perfectly valid to copy it using wm_copydata

1654621
radio-button	selected
you would have to building some functionality to undo this if the user then selected a different radio-button

1654622
authentication	login
in this case i forwarding him to the login page but what s the best practice to save that url .so i can serve it to him once authentication

1654657
json	xml
of course with ria ajax the difference could be further clouded serving only non-html content json xml to clients pumping particular remote access service

1654667
multiplication	division
this tick count can be converted to a fixed-point time in seconds as needed usually using a multiplication followed by a division

1654668
required	checked
you should able to know what are the required changes by determining them on your staging development-environment not performing delta checked with live

1654670
testng	junit
the recommendation to create junit or better yet testng tests is spot on

1654675
multiplication	division
another approach might be useful in contexts where int multiplication and division is considered too costly which should be getting pretty rare these days

1654684
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i can only suggest a workaround not a solution if you do not find a suitable activex control for your vb6 application you might consider migrating the communication part of your application to vb.net

1654684
vb.net	vb6
since vb6 ide support ended in april 2008 you will probably want to migrate your application to vb.net sooner or later anyway

1654684
deployment	install
your deployment process becomes more complicated since you required the .net to be install on your customer s machines and you need to register your .net libs as a com component .so that your vb6 application can access it

1654689
attributes	properties
plus if your logic was more complex than a single contant sentinel value you could handle that in the properties but not in a static attributes

1654694
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
myna include jdbc drivers for h2 mysql microsoft sql-server and postgresql but any jdbc or odbc datasource can be used

1654713
change-management	maintenance
maintenance and change-management is significantly simplified

1654714
any	set
paging recording without any order of the result set

1654727
python	c++	python	java	openoffice.org	uno
and then use swftools for converting pdf using openoffice.org you can use uno bridge which is available in c++ python java for automating the whole pdf-conversion into swf

1654735
hotmail	gmail
however after sending the email to gmail and hotmail account the email appears in plain text with all formatting gone

1654737
return-value	arguments
each call to comp_base above has to unpack its arguments from the list passed it which is in a highly platform-dependent format and stuff its return-value back in

1654759
erlang	python
what is different erlang and python in lay man term

1654765
pointers	stack
what this stubs does is stores the the return address into ecx a scratch register in the x86 calling-convention pushes an extra parameter onto stack a pointers to a thunk and then re-pushes the return address

1654769
logout	login
you don t need to do anything with usersessioncontrollers since that controllers would only handle login form-submit and logout

1654780
mouseover	mouseout
then based on the event types if event is mouseover it zoom the row else if the event is mouseout it changes the rowâ s zoom back to its original before the event occurred

1654786
erlang	python
erlang and python are programming languages and each language has one or more runtime that allow you to run programs written in those languages

1654791
any	set
windows and dialog boxes are generally loaded in the correct language without needing any specific function-call as long as you have set the correct language identifier in the resources

1654799
pagespeed	yslow
use something like yslow or pagespeed for starters

1654825
positioning	slider
what may work better is to instead animate the top properties of your div .so that it smoothly slider to it s new positioning instead of flicker

1654844
any	set
it s a set of regular expression to match any numbers followed by h or m or d to represent hours minutes and days

1654850
gethashcode	equals
because you re overridess equals you should also overrides gethashcode

1654878
qtruby	shoes
there are also a few other less popular approaches like qtruby and shoes and you can even use ironruby a clr ruby implementation to write a .net application

1654890
32-bit	64bit
what s a good hello world types program that demonstrates 64bit multi-core capabilities by doing some simple things that don t work well at all in 32-bit single-core code

1654897
stderr	stdout
if the subprocess is writing to stdout while you are writing to stderr that could explain the odd interleaving

1654902
constructor	object
create a single random object and pass its reference to the constructor .when you create instancess of the a class instead of creating one random object for each a instances

1654907
rollback	commit
if an exception-handling occurs before the call to commit the transactional will never commit and will be automatically rollback .when the transactional connection closes

1654913
sql-server	mysql
though i can parsing this trying to see if there is any generics module since other dataserver like mysql sql-server etc. can have their own way of report the error messages

1654947
binary-tree	nodes
the idea is having a binary-tree that has its nodes accessible via indexes

1654947
children	nodes
the nodes class that the value are stored in is not modifiable but has a properties size which contains the total numbers of children below along with left right and value that points to children and store the value accordingly

1654971
hash	md5
if you end up with the same answer neglecting the infinitesimally probable case where two different but very similar files have two identical md5 hash then the files are apparently identical and tortoisesvn has some problem

1654975
arguments	default
you should never use a mutable value like for a default arguments to a methods

1654975
default-value	arguments
.when you use an empty list as a default-value that same list is used every time the methods is invoked without the arguments even as the value is modified by previous function-calls

1654986
arguments	default
as ned says the problem is you are using a list as a default arguments

1654988
binary-tree	nodes
well a nodes in a binary-tree cannot have a value and an index

1654989
arguments	default
your code has a default arguments to initializer the class

1654989
arguments	default
the value of the default arguments is evaluated once at compile-time .so every instances is initializer with the same list

1655003
dbd	dbi
i m not quite sure what you re asking but you ll find a lot of information by reading through the documentation for dbd sybase and dbi

1655023
python	ruby	ironpython	ironruby
you should probably take a look at the ironruby and ironpython project since they will provide the best overall integration with .net applications since they are themselves implementation of the ruby and python scripting languages on the .net platform

1655024
linked-list	tree	children	tree
if not then the simplest thing to do is make a tree in which all the left children are null a tree that devolves to a linked-list

1655024
children	nodes
for example and empty list has one nodes without children with value null and size 0

1655024
children	tree
then you want to end up with a tree whose root has two children with sizes 1024 and 10

1655024
children	nodes
the left child has no actual children but the right nodes has a right child of its own of size 2

1655024
children	nodes
.when searching the list you need to take care .when traversal a nodes with null children

1655036
fractals	curve
note that some fractals such as the mandelbrot set are pixel-based while others such as the snowflake curve can use vector-graphics

1655070
hosts-file	hosts
.so if you want .something really quick and dirty why not just write a program that edits your hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts or etc hosts on unix

1655082
keyboard	mouse
how do i generator and send mouse and keyboard events from process a to b

1655089
any	set
any ideas on how to direct cmake to set that option

1655094
windows-vista	windows
this behavior was dropped from windows some while ago -note that windows-vista 7 use a tree to show programs in the start menu

1655124
malloc	free
the following is a very very simple versioning of malloc and seems to allocate some spaces to me but apart from the fact that there is no free and i don t checked if i ve overrun the allocated spaces how can i checked that the code is correct

1655129
primitive	int
some more uninvited advice if your valid value are decimal in the range of -10 to +10 the standards data types is int primitive

1655141
subtraction	time
the each subsequent time the .app is launchdd do a subtraction of the first launchd timestamp from the current time timestamp

1655161
pointers	stack
you set pointers to stack+size but you want it to be just stack

1655184
sequences	unique
first you would create a unique id on this table that has a sequences

1655185
perl	ruby	shell	bash
written in something commonplace like perl c ruby the bash shell scripting-language or even java

1655187
ubuntu	debian
i have searched far and wide on google and looks like a pretty wide spread problem on ubuntu and debian boxes

1655196
any	set
if they have them set up in such a way that it break any frame then your outta luck

1655202
contains	any
this report can contains pretty much any types of data as the users can query pretty much anything

1655211
ruby-on-rails	grails
with java and perl background i have narrowed down the web framework choices to grails or ruby-on-rails

1655214
jquery	.post
from the jquery perspective you can now call these methods using the jquery.ajax api or any of the simpler variations .load .get .post etc.

1655223
contains	any
there are some good answers here but remember that whatever you do it will be imperfect because any words contains markup will appear as a normals words to the user but will not match your search pattern

1655235
bazaar	git	version-control	bazaar	version-control	git
the big three of distribute version-control git bazaar and mercurial each treat branching fairly differently

1655235
bazaar	git
in my mind bazaar s approach of one branch one repo makes branching more of a pain than git s approach to use a branch in bazaar i have to first create the branch then cd out of my current working copy then checkout the new branch like i would in svn

1655236
directory	folder
also it should be easy to install without requiring admin access - i should be able to install to a custom directory in my home folder on the server

1655267
visual-studio-test-runner	mstest
my mstest tests run with visual-studio-test-runner but not r# s runner

1655269
ruby-on-rails	grails
i have developed with groovy on grails and ruby-on-rails

1655304
javascript	dom
server-side javascript doesn t normally implements a browser-like dom .so extjavascript isn t going to work server-side

1655343
.when	ready
i have some divs that are set with positioning absolute css .when the page is ready and are positioninging relative to another fixed div wich works fine

1655372
shell	bash
ideally it would be a simple bash shell cmd instead of a scripting

1655379
fiddler	charles
edit if it helps the .app charles show me way more information than fiddler but i really want to figure out fiddler since i like it better

1655383
webforms	asp.net
i ve blasted through a numbers of tutorials for how to create a custom membership-provider but all the information i ve found about how to hook it up to an application seems to revolve around regular asp.net webforms applications which seem to be a piece of cake

1655383
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m coming unstuck with the amount of magic that just happens in asp.net-mvc which is great but i m used to plugging stuff in in a webforms way .so this it just works methodology is a bit of a mind bender for me

1655404
contains	elements
the div is hidden by default and is absolutely positioning the table inside the div usually just contains a few columns with a single form elements in each column

1655404
selected	checkbox
.when i put it in a th elements i can t click on the inputbox but the selected boxes and checkbox work fine

1655404
hide	show
the only fix i have found is to move the div outside of the header and use .some more complicated javascript to find it .so i can show hide it etc

1655424
binary-search-tree	nodes	children	nodes
in a traditional binary-search-tree removal of a nodes can have different consequences depending on how many children the nodes has

1655424
children	nodes
a nodes with no children can simply be removed

1655424
children	nodes
a nodes with two children has a slightly more complicated rules you must find the inorder successor or inorder predecessor of the nodes to be removed replace the current nodes s value with its sucessor s or predecessor s value then delete the successor or predecessor according to these ruless

1655426
children	nodes	any	set
if you just set the child nodes to null you ll lose any information about the childs children

1655450
compatibility	deprecated
date is almost entirely deprecated and is still there for backward compatibility reasons

1655489
nsresponder	nscell
as nscell isn t an nsresponder how does one handle events if i wanted to add some sort of accessory to the cell like how the arrows in itunes work although itunes is carbon

1655495
arrays	loops
it then pass a _post arrays to my page of tabs_sort that i loops through by accessing the _post tabs_sort arrays

1655518
innodb	myisam
in particular switching from myisam to innodb will break your application if

1655518
innodb	myisam
it is high performance and you have not understood how to tune innodb correctly but did tune myisam well or ok

1655533
installation	building
you need to set the building setting installation directory to executable_path .. frameworks

1655539
version-control	git	push	pull
i am new to git and distribute version-control but have managed without much stumbling to init my own local source setup a private remote repository origin via ssh on my own web hosts and do the basic pull and push from master to origin

1655540
attributes	properties
contains the methods and properties you want of the object and add .some attributes i write it from memory .so details may not be correct but i swear it worked for me...

1655545
binary-tree	tree	children	tree
a standards tree class will know its children usually stuck in an arrays or collections - in the case of a binary-tree you ve only got two direct children .so a fixed sized arrays will work

1655556
python	php
what is the following python code in php

1655558
tostring	equals
beyond that look at the boilerplate hashcode equals tostring and getter-setter copying code that ends up in most java web-applications

1655564
glassfish	weblogic
there are a lot of high-performance application servers like glassfish jboss and weblogic

1655564
scala	java	groovy	java	groovy	scala
even lots of spiffy new jvm-languages that you can use along with java scala jruby groovy clojure jython and .so on

1655577
jquery	dojo	jquery	.post	javascript-framework	dojo
as i mentioned in the beginning of my .post though you ll be better off using a javascript-framework like jquery dojo yui mootools or prototype

1655630
32-bit	64bit
for example you may have to use a 64bit counter rather than a 32-bit counter

1655633
selected	checkbox
you are trying to access the selected properties of the checkbox but the error is saying that the checkbox object itself is null - hence there is no selected properties to get

1655637
temporary	copy
copy one of the temporary files on top of your working file

1655640
value	field
one thing to realize is that the checkbox should always have a value once you create a data binding between the checkbox and some boolean field

1655651
contains	set	pixels	line
also note that you ll want to set a one pixels transparency border on non -hovered links or the page ll jump around a little due to one pixels being added subtract to the height of the line contains the link

1655652
subtract	add
you can subtract an hour by subtract 3600 60 60 add a day by adding 86400 24 60 60 and .so forth

1655672
version-control	git
git just makes doing .so a little easier than .some other version-control systemd .so you can use branches the way you might use tags elsewhere

1655674
page-fault	kernel
once you will try to access it it will generator a page-fault in the kernel the kernel will try to allocate a physical page for it and if it can t .

1655705
postgresql	mysql
iâ m looking for a scripting that allows me to defined my database-relations in a simple model file and have the possibility to convert this scheme definition to the explicit formats for mysql postgresql and sqlite

1655714
arrays	loops
it is used mainly in arrays declarations of the form which is equivalent to and of course in the foreach control-structure to assign value to key and value loops variables

1655752
key-value	key
having a non-integer as a key of an arrays in php is called an as.sociativity arrays where each elements is defined using the syntax of key-value .so in our example

1655760
value	field
.when you are moving the data you change the order field to the new sort value + 1 and then do a quick updates to convert all the odd order field to even

1655765
any	set
the simplest approach is two passes pass 1 would be to set the new order tag to 0 or any character earlier than the first character followed by the new tag of the appropriate length and step 2 would be to remove the 0 from the front

1655774
json	xml
it ain t xml it ain t json but its human-readable and i m pretty sure i could write it if i had to

1655781
void	main
public static void main

1655781
void	main
default void main cil managed

1655782
python	java
i haven t programmed in either java or python .so before i start learning new languages i m hoping to get .some advice on what route i should follow or other recommendations

1655788
web-services	security
improving web-services security scenarios and implementation guidance for wcf lighting reading

1655791
postgresql	oracle
a query to return the items inorder is trivial in oracle but im not sure how you would do it in postgresql

1655791
postgresql	oracle
wrap it in a transactional selected for updates in scoping and use a deferred constraint postgresql 8.5 has support for deferred unique like oracle

1655810
postgresql	mysql
i know nothing about it other than it claims to do forwarding reverse engineers to postgresql and mysql

1655835
pixels	line
sometimes while typing in a textarea in flex many characters will be rendering at one height then at some points on that same text line the rest of the characters are rendering a couple pixels lower than the rest

1655895
value	field
not sure about mysql specifically but in ms sql you definitely should use a varchar for anything under 8000 characters long if you want to be able to run any sort of comparison on the value in the field

1655955
swing	awt
i use this methods because it gives the better result for now but i would like to stay without awt if possible using swing instead

1655956
constructor	object
what s going on here and is it ok to do this not return the object you create in a c constructor function

1655965
puts	gets
without puts the last thing on stack is the nodes you allocated and it gets returned

1655965
pointers	stack
with puts the last thing on stack is the return-value of puts which is an int and is returned and used as a pointers which is probably bad

1655966
ruby-on-rails	django
now that the .application is written and i have some hindsight i wonder what the end product and experience developing the .app would have been with django ruby-on-rails or java

1655968
profiling	debugging
a good way to debugging this is to use sql profiling to determine what sql code is being run against the database

1655972
object-reference	instances
i have user-controls .ascx file and .when i place it inside a listview edit templates it throw a nullreference error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1655976
value	field
if it is auto_increment just enter 0 and it will make the value of that field the last number+1

1655996
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe closures have made me more lazy-evaluation than it needed for c++ and i have to but i don t want to believe

1656045
strncpy	strcpy
don t use call like strlen strcpy - use the length-limited versoins like strncpy etc

1656049
nstextview	nswindow
i have an nswindow with 2 nstextviews an nssplitview and a custom nstextview

1656116
any	set
if this is the case you should connect your eclipse debugger remotely to the tomcat instances .so you can set a breakpoints at interesting location and then use the display view of eclipse to run any arbitrary code you might need to perform advanced debugging code

1656125
value	field
if a custom field is set for an issue the xml will have its id class and value value

1656125
value	field
screen-scraping the html gives us not only ids of the custom field but also possible value for enum field

1656125
value	field
you ll get all the info - field options default value which field is required

1656162
average	max
the second will give you the max average rate

1656180
ip-address	hostname
if you do this consider using the ip-address instead of a dns hostname for inline images javascript and css files

1656186
simulated-annealing	traveling-salesman
if this is a closed path it is the traveling-salesman problem and a sub-optimal but quite effective way to resolve it is to use simulated-annealing

1656194
include	ssi
use the following ssi tag to include that html in each page

1656197
factors	primes
.so i assume 486847 is the largest primes factors of x but project euler says otherwise

1656201
cross-compiling	toolchain
i downloading a cross-compiling toolchain for arm from

1656202
server-side-includes	ssi
the simplest thing you could do that i know if would be server-side-includes ssi

1656215
factors	primes
second what you re printing is factors not primes factors

1656229
factors	primes
you need to divide by the primes factors after you find it otherwise you ll find all factorss not just primes factorss

1656236
profiling	debugging
valgrind basically runs your application in a sandbox. while running in this sandbox it is able to insert its own instructions to do advanced debugging and profiling

1656255
hide	show
i would like to hide or show the items in a package if the user double click

1656257
32-bit	64bit
if you re compiling to a 32-bit or 64bit binary under windowss as i m sure you are then it s just a console windows

1656259
firefox	opera
as requested a sample which call alert on the page it is embedded in tested in opera 10.01 firefox 3.5.4 ie6

1656264
radio-button	textbox
since the browser will just change all your input to http-formatted form-data you won t be able to tell what data is from a radio-button versus a textbox or other input

1656266
selected	button
however you will never get the named value of all button - just the selected one from each grouping

1656267
jquery	.post
i know how to send by jquery .post methods

1656267
jquery	.post	value	field
how to send these 2 field value send to url by jquery .post methods

1656269
functional-programming	imperative
i could have done this in an imperative manner already but i would like to see it done in the spirit of functional-programming

1656319
widget	button
if i named a widget in interface-builder and then i write a methods that receives click events on that button

1656320
required	checked
.so i install things that are required in the fresh pc to run qt from visual-studio 2005 just to checked whats the problem

1656331
selected	button	touch	drag
click on the button in interface-builder press cmd+2 or in info dialog second tab and drag the circle from touch up inside to file s owner from the yourview.xib windows and then it ll let you selected one of the methodss which has the - ibaction methods id sender signature

1656332
directory	folder
hence i tried reinstalling eclipse by copying from inside the .zip directory of the installation folder and pasting it inside the eclipse program directory

1656334
hash	md5
one of the points that i go over in my paper is md5 being only one-way and the only way to crack an md5 hash is to continuously make strings and use an md5 function then compare it with the hash you want to crack

1656342
required	checked
the default in database.php would reference a nodb datasource which you can checked in the appcontroller i think you would be able to initializer a dummy model and checked it s datasource and then push up the required install

1656360
hash	md5
it is not true that the only way to crack an md5 hash is to generator every possible string and look for collision

1656365

if you don t need 256 bits of the hash truncated it to 128 you will have a much more secure alternative for md5

1658299
canvas	scale	display	width
.when the canvas is display the whole canvas has been scale up including content to to match the 500px width which results in ugly resampling

1658332

contains	elements	contains	set
a set in mathematics can contains each elements only once

1658453
contains	set
.so the following list canâ t be a set in the mathematical sense since it contains one numbers 3 twice

1658454
double	int
also at least in my opinion a counter is almost never a double you should use an int types such as plain old int

1658477

1658531
contains	elements
the containers isn t actually contains the elements properly

1658544
constructor	object	subclassing	superclass
the idea is that you pass an instances of a factory class as an arguments to some function or methods or constructor which is then used to produce new object instancess typically these are instancess of some specific subclassing of a superclass that is known in advance

1658548
strtok	atoi
2 you can read the whole arrays at once and using strtok to divide the numbers and after that convert with atoi

with jpg png gif files identify can run on file without needing a valid extension eg .jpg to be able to recognise the file types

1658599
pointers	stack
in other words the new commit is created on top of tip of current branch and branch head advances to the new commit somewhat similarly to how the pointers to top of stack might advance

1658599
ref	out
for example if currently checked out branch is master then .git head file representing head would contains single linefeed terminate line with ref refs heads master a symbolic reference to refs heads master and .git refs heads master head of master branch would contains for example linefeed terminate line 0b127cb8ab975e43398a2b449563ccb78c437255 whihc is sha-1 identifier to tip of master branch that is if current branch is not packed then you have to take a look at .git packed-refs

1658606
callback	methods
using callback methods is tricky but i just don t know how to pass event object that way

1658611
output	cat
.when i capture the output from this cmd i get a file that display normally with cat on a terminal all the backspaces and re-edits are replayed but i want to be able to use grep on the file and process it .so i see all the backspace edit cmd

i must also confess to being ignorant of the restrictions on running as a windows service although i m sure i ve read somewhere that the systemd account does not have network credentials

1658700
environment	building
checkout pbuildinger it can create building environment for many architectures some instructions here

1658733
function-handle	nested-function
if you have a function named in a string you can use the function str2func to convert it to a function-handle assuming it isn t a nested-function which required the function-handle constructor

1658734
16-bit	x86
you are using an antique 16-bit x86 real-mode compiler

1658739
contains	elements
actually vector.size is synchronized and will return a value consistent with the vector s state .when the thread calling size enters the monitor. if it returns 42 then at some points in time the vector contains exactly 42 elements

uiscrollview	subviews
i have a view uiscrollview which loads some data and display various things from it in various subviews

1658762
put	get
the best approach to get the visibility you ask about is to put this def statement in a module say fit.py import fit from any other module that needs access to items defined in this one and use fit.fitnesscompare in any of those modules as needed

1658769
firefox	opera
just to add to my question there is no trace of this problem in firefox or opera

1658785
contains	any
edit if you want to search for multiple items inorder to find a sublist contains any one or more of your items

1658792
qdialog	qwidget
also is the change from qwidget to qdialog on purpose

1658804
kernel	mmu
if spaces for the kernel were not reserved in each process switching to kernel-mode in between execution user spaces code would be more expensive and be unable to use virtual address mapping through the hardware mmu memory-management unit for the systemd call being serviced

1658816
push	pull
once you think it s time for a release you tag your stuff probably as beta push it to origin go to your beta server and pull that tag from there for public testing

1658816
push	pull
the solution is simple though a has to pull from origin merging all changes introduced by b into a and then it can push .

1658821
temporary	copy
doing something like that will only overwrite a temporary copy of the null-pointer at key k

1658831
key-value	key
with your custom map class should first checked if the key k exists and if not insert a new key-value pair using the default-constructor of typename val into the map

1658879
embedded-fonts	fonts
now this works great for 90 of the embedded-fonts i m using but any fonts that have giant serifs are not measured properly for instances look at the f s in this textarea

python	c++
every project that i ve been involved in since about 2002 has been a c++ application with an embedded python interpreter

1658901
collapse	sidebar
for example .when you click on a widget in the sidebar it collapse and all of the widget below it move up

1658914
temporary	copy
but .when they are changed a copy is created and the temporary variables is used in the rest of the methods

1658914
stringbuilder	substring
mixing string actions replace insert substring regex etc often makes using stringbuilder or string concatenation equals

1658914
string.format	stringbuilder
code often mixes concatenation + stringbuilder.append string.format tostring and other string operations using stringbuilder in such cases is hardly ever effective

1658931
document-ready	.when
for now i thought reason is ajax .when document-ready load welcome text but now that scripting is disabled and problem still exist

1658961
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
certain browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari are pretty close to being standards compliant

1658968
arrays	loops
you will need to loops through the arrays

1658984
boolean	int
or you can just use the read annoteted properties of each instances which being an int will obviously evaluate to the correct boolean value for unread books

1658995
vbscript	perl
this .post presents a peculiarly mixed solution with vbscript reading the info from wmi and perl continually presenting the information in a windows-console

1659008
return-type	lvalue
i ve added lvalue to the egglayer use to show that sometimes the return-type is important

1659021
any	set
any chance your deployment-target is set to iphone os 3.1

1659022
contains	elements
list1 contains 750 elements and not just 250

1659023
pointers	stack
if a similar program to your c# program was created in c generally reference-type would be like data using pointers and value-type would be normals data on stack

1659038

contains	set
where the answer for a cell is known the set contains one value from 1 to 9 set 4 and where the answer is unknown the set contains the remaining possibilities set 3 5 7 9

1659040
selected	button
this view will have a single row selection and a button to delete edit the current selected row in a pop-up form and a insert button that will use the same form as well

1659044
for-loop	arrays
in my opinion the arrays is overkill but you could have just as easily used it to get refernce to each clip as you added each circle reference in the same linear order they get added to the display list the same for-loop but ran against the arrays length instead of the containers clips numchildren

1659049
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
self.w3 as you ve coded it contains many references to the same set object -- as soon as you call any mutating methods on one of those references you ve changed all the others

1659059
constructor	object
constructor don t return value they are used to initializer the new object you are creating

1659085
put	get
you just need to get an imgur developer key and put it in linup_control.py

1659092
implements	extends
the sortedlist extends a collections by implements icomparer to provide the sort functionality

1659093
buffering	streaming
i wondering if the mediaelement.js component from wpf is capable of playing and buffering mp3 streaming

1659115
c++	lua
if you re serious about game development you will probably need to learn c++ eventually but if you just want to quickly get some things done you re already on the right tracking with lua

1659115
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this does not include internet-explorer .so you will probably want to use safari firefox or opera

1659115
c++	lua
once you are comfortable making games in an easy language like javascript or lua then it will not be quite .so hard to learn to make games in a hard language like c or c++

1659134
reflection	runtime
dynamic-languages is a pretty loosely defined term but i think if you had to restrict it to one qualifier it would be runtime reflection

1659134
reflection	runtime
if you can do reflection you can probably do the other qualifiers listed in the wikipedia article eval object runtime alteration closures macros...

1659152
language-design	compiler-design
before the compiler-design can be explored i think the more fundamental question of language-design needs to be addressed

1659163
click	mouse
.when you click on a state you can certainly get rid of the event for that state image by unbind ing the mouse over event and adding a click event

1659163
click	mouse
then onclientclick you reverse the process by unbind the click event and re-instating the mouse over event

1659166
contains	set
form a set s initially contains rules of form e- ..

1659176
python	c++
-- many many such 3rd party tools will let your python code call those two c++ entry points without any need for wrapping anything else but them

1659178
widget	button
the one problem is ie which adds an extra couple of pixelss of unremovable padding to button widget and move the content of the button down and to the right one pixels .when click

1659182
required	checked
it required checked the box for the summary results file and entering results.xml to get the detail to show up in the output of the test run or building

1659183
ruby	php
i know how to do this in ruby but i want to do this in php

1659215
attachment-fu	paperclip
i ve come across solutions like paperclip attachment-fu etc

1659223
double	int
my best thesis unsupported by the data above is that somehow you have not got the conversion from int to double taking place in the call to the constructor but i confess i don t understand how that could happen

1659233
sigaction	signals
additionally the signals function has been deprecated in favor of the sigaction function

1659233
sigaction	signals
inorder to ensure portable behavior .when registering signals handler you should always use the sigaction invocation

1659233
default	reset
using the sigaction function you can use the sa_resethand flag to reset the default handler

1659266
typechecking	subtyping
furthermore all of these attempts to hide the typechecking entail adding knowledge of the subtyping to the supertype interface which means that it needs to be changed as new subtyping are added

1659267
linux	osx
i don t know much about osx but in linux the free cmd is useful for this purpose

1659281
build-system	cmake	build-system	cpack
you may be better off using the cmake build-system and using its cpack packaging features for installing bundling in the default preferred platform-specific manner

1659293
temporary	copy
as others have said func class will make a copy you will have a new temporary instances of class not derived in func

1659297
sqrt	sin	sqrt	cos	cos	sin
in a complex numbers the real and imaginary parts behave like real numberss .so all of the operations + - sqrt sin cos etc can be inherited form the class of object called real instead of having to be written in code

1659305
constructor	private
note the constructor are private

1659322
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
your complex class would need to handle the extra logic needed around how to add subtract multiplying divide etc two complex-numbers together

1659327
checkbox	textbox
each column of table contains different types of field like textbox drop down checkbox etc

1659344
visualvm	yourkit
visualvm and yourkit as pointed out by the others here are both good as well

1659351
publish-subscribe	messaging
also it is clear that messaging supports systemd based on publish-subscribe sychronous or asynchronous communication transactional etc

1659361
configuration	environment
is it possible to detection the hostname in the environment files configuration environment production.rb .so that i can defined this environment variables dynamically

1659371
keydown	keyup
your best be would probably to use timeout with keyup or keydown events -- restart the timeout timer every time the event is fired

1659371
keydown	keyup
you will need javascript handler to handle the keydown keyup events

1659389
any	set
or more specifically it can t be used in any result set in oracle there is a boolean that can be used in pl sql but you can t return it in a ref cursor or declare a column of being types boolean

1659399
buffering	streaming
because i m working completely in memory i don t really need to use the image object to re-save it as it is in the same image format - i can just copy the byte buffering to the new streaming

1659400
double	int
it might be getting confused .when trying to do the translation from int to double

1659401
any	set	terminate	timeout
but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

1659415
specifications	w3c
since w3c is slow in getting an updates specifications and the web is not only fragmenting more but there are needs that can be met that aren t really possible due to the specificationsifications being .so old html5 is working toward fixing these such as the canvas tag and having embedded video audio

1659421
primitive	int
now in the datatypes world of common languages like c and java you ll never find a complex types given for primitive types int char etc

1659431
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
edit i am working with a service that required a case-sensitive field to be passed. since the http 1.1 protocols defined header field named to be case-insensitive this service is breaking the protocols

1659440
32-bit	16-bit
i need a cross-platform libs algorithm that will convert between 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point numbers

1659447
operators	keyword
the first phase is the lexer where identifier language keyword and other special characters arithmetic operators braces etc are identified and split into token object that typically have a numeric field indicating the types of the lexeme and optional another field indicating the text of the lexeme

1659447
bison	yacc
software for doing this include antlr yacc bison scala s cala.util.parsing.combinator.syntactical libs and plenty of others

1659451
short-circuiting	equivalent
this one doesn t short-circuiting but is otherwise equivalent to mark s

1659469
32-bit	64bit
i don t know if this makes a diff i am using iis 7 in vista 64bit with 32-bit process on the .app pool set to false that this .application is using because we re running 64bit in iis and not using the buit-in vs webserver

1659471
removeclass	addclass
also i think what you are looking for instead of a delayed switchclass that might not triggers the live event handler try using instead with the above addclass removeclass

1659478
for-loop	arrays
yet the conditional on the for-loop which michael showed to be your problem subtract another 1 from questioncount which means that your for-loop will never reach the last elements in the arrays

1659496
itemtemplate	gridview
simply add your validation control inside the gridview itemtemplate with the control you want to validation

1659505
environment	building
the hostname is only available in a request object .so no it s not available .when ruby-on-rails building the environment

1659530
selected	button
i would then have an add button near it to allow the user to selected the part and add it to another list box contains the selecteded parts

1659549
callback	methods
the callback methods will be run everytime your .app runs - if you are trying to checked that those methods are being called using the debugging log you won t get any output to the debugging log if you stop the debuggingger and then just launchd the .app on the simulator since it s not starting a new debuggingger session in xcode it s just running the .app in the simulator

1659617
shell	bash	bash	zsh
if you mean i m going to be extensively typing it in at a shell prompt i want the mysterious but utter conciseness of bash or zsh

1659617
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python like perl or ruby is mostly used to write much more substantial scripting impossible to distinguish from programs except maybe by total bigots

1659617
bash	zsh	tcl	lua
- -- in which case very different considerations apply wrt real scripting-languages such as bash or zsh or lua or tcl for a different definition of scripting-language

1659617
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	smalltalk	scheme
- but that s the arena where python ruby and perl mostly play -- and where one could debate one against the other but any one of them would crush any other popular language i know -- yeah i ve known and loved and used rexx scheme smalltalk and many many others but none could hold a candle to the big three i just mentioned in this arena

1659620
python	c++
what is that needs to be coded in python instead of c++ etc

1659629
tcl	lua
one is that scripting-language should be embeddable .so the core should be small like lua or tcl

1659646
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop assumes you ll access the object by their index but then after each iterator you re deleting something out of the arrays which shifts all the indexes after that points

1659655
32-bit	64bit
most likely one of your cohorts altered the project inorder to separate the 32-bit and 64bit debugging folder in separate building configuration

1659659
output	cat
edit here is the output of cat proc meminfo

1659676
contains	any
like rexem - i made a function that contains a similar cte to generator any series of datetime intervals you need

1659682
any	set
the kernel doesn t use special instructions that allow direct access to physical memory location - it has to set up page table entries for any physical ranges that it wants to talk to

1659682
kernel	mmu
under this scheme the kernel could directly read and write any physical memory location without having to fiddle with the mmu to change the mapping

1659709
web-config	app-config
if you want to access the value in your web-config or app-config for client apps there is already a wrapper class set up to do that named my.settings

1659709
web-config	app-config
those app-config and web-config files are a pain in the keester to deal with directly

1659733
scala	java
now the jvm is becoming less language dependent with clojure and scala running off of it .so java has become more interesting now for designing applications

1659747
required	checked
also it doen t required you to checked in files

1659749
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.4 gecko 20091028 ubuntu 9.10 karmic firefox 3.5.4

1659770
selected	checkbox
the above code works fine for the insert mode where intially during the checkbox is selected --select value comes

1659770
selected	checkbox
now in edit mode the user has to get his selected value .when this checkbox in checked in .cs file of asp.net

1659774
linux	aix
it runs on every platform i know of aix hp-ux linux mac os x windows..

1659793

the coolness comes from the fact that every keyboard shortcut every menu item every ad-hoc expression function evaluation is recorded

1659808
search-engine	seo	search-engine	web-crawler	web-crawler	seo
search-engine web-crawler can t crawl flash sites .so your seo ranking will be based off the non-flash part the blank html page

1659811
contains	set
my brute force solution would be to set a precision value and then compare value in my columnfixture contains the test cases

1659822
contains	elements
i have a user-interface elements textblock that contains a mix of text with formatting inline images and symbols

1659824
variables	boolean
i have a variables in my php application that changes often i d like to debugging .so that it keeps execution until the variables changes to a specific value in this case boolean true

1659890
callback	methods
call nslog from each of those callback methods in your delegation to see what s happening

1659895
any	set
am new to vb.net how to set a datagridview size according to windows screens size in datagridview properties itself any option is available or i have to make a code as like vb

abstract-class	base-class
an abstract-class is a base-class that cannot be initializer on its own

1659908
json	xml
i have dynamically created a xml string form a json object returned from server

1659939
temporary	copy
may actually mean you ve temporary got a third copy in memory a big string with the entire output file

1659947
implements	abstract
an abstract methods properties would have to be implements in the concrete class but the virtual-methods properties may not be overrides in the concrete class since it already has an implementation in the abstract class.

1659958
progress-bar	progress
i believe you can get the progress via the msi api but if i were you i would just show the progress-bar from the msi itself after invoking the install via msiexec.exe

1659958
hide	show
this yield a progress-bar where you can hide the cancel button and optional show a completion modal-dialog

1659959
difference	count
count the difference between stored time and current time i restore the timer according to that but what if i quit the application and change the time zone to something else

1659996
difference	count
see andrew shepherd s reply on the semantic difference between these two forms of count as well as count

1659996
difference	count
the focus being to checked a named these difference matter little with the following trick instead than count you can also use

1660014
retaincount	dealloc
dealloc is called by the systemd once the retaincount of an object hits 0

1660015
anchor	iframe
.when user tigger anchor link a or b the iframe will load either childa.html or childb.html

1660016
selected	button
user can click on the delete button to delete the selected dx directory

1660017
attributes	properties
the two latter use the index of the option you want to set one specifies which index is selected by setting the selectedindex properties of the elements while the other sets the selected attributes of the elements to true .

1660029
easyhook	detours
only a side note easyhook - the reinvention of windows api hooking is an open source lgpl project developing a successor to detours

1660037
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i know google-chrome and safari have scripting debuggers built-in or there is venkman the firefox plugins

1660040
attributes	properties
you can decorator your object classes and properties with attributes to map them with database tables and field

1660041
search-engine	web-crawler
however for a better search-engine positioning i suggest you to use some text replacement solutions because the web-crawler scan the source of the webpage and in the yours there is few textual content

value	field
now my question is if i provide value for these field which has mapped with sequences what will happen

1660639
put	get
actually you tend to get the first row in mysql storage order which a lot of the time will be the first one you put in the database which is a bit of a trap because .sometimes that s what you want .so it looks like it s working until the order changes for .some rea.son and everything goes wrong

1660643

i have an wsdl web service and i need to generator an set of interfaces for them is there any easy way of generator interfaces for the wsdl

1660661
navigation	styling
depending on what you re actually trying to achieve you may have better luck simply styling the input-field itself rather than trying to overlay some extra content on top of it that is going to fail the first time someone who uses keyboard navigation tabs through your content

1660671
children	nodes
to get the amount of content elements you need to count the children of the implicit root nodes

1660700
javacc	bison
sorry but my experience of antlr indeed javacc bison or any full function parsing is that most of your learning will be by fixing your own mistakes

1660729
row	col
yes spreadsheet writeexcel has a embed_chart row col filename x y scale_x scale_y function which lets you do this

1660772
vba	vb6
-- in vb6 vba

1660783
arguments	default
however if i remember correctly this doesnâ t work .when giving a default for the arguments and in any case it makes using the default arguments rather redundant

1660802
worksheet	excel
depending on whether the origin of the charts is excel but if you have excel service which is part of the enterpise edition of moss 2007 you can upload the excel document to a libs and then use one of the excel web-parts to show the worksheet which contains the graphing

1660828
contains	any
we re trying not to have any customer logic contains inside the code

1660838
processor	cpu
as adathedev says if it s using 100 cpu then the issue is with your algorithm not how windows is allocation processor time to the thread

1660855
children	nodes
this nodes will then ask the child-nodess if it contains the item which in their turn will ask their children

1660901
localization	translation
you could use localization libs such as gettext to manage translation

1660903
expression	brackets
officially regular expression are not designed for parsing nested paired brackets --- and if you try to do this you run into all sorts of problems

1660903
bison	yacc
there are other other tools like parsing generator yacc or bison that are designed for such structures and can handle them well

1660903
contains	any
now i suggest to parsing brackets from the inside out replace any substring text where text does not contains any brackets by a placeholder 01 numbers 2 and store the include text in arrays numbers

1660915
apache-commons-email	javax.mail
without a mail-server you can t do anything with any of the mail api s from which i by the way highly recommend to choose the javax.mail because it provides both pop3 and smtp support to retrieve and send mails respectively the apache-commons-email is restrict to sending mails only

1660938

default-value	arguments
in views you can add an arguments and specify that .when no arguments has been supplied as is always the case for a block a default-value should be used

1660975
arguments	default
by adding a arguments for the author of a nodes and specifying a default arguments for it you can limit a nodes list to just the nodess created by that author

1660975
arguments	default
the block is probably a variant of 3 - the default arguments is to take the id from the currently show nodes instead and the teaser comes from the nodes linked to the user with the module describe in 2

1660975
arguments	default
.so - to create .something like that i would install content .profile and then create .some views with arguments that has default value and with block display

sunos	unix
how do i determine the uptime on a sunos unix box in seconds only

1661006
sunos	unix
i m trying to do the same on a sunos unix box but there is no proc uptime

1661027
type-safety	generics
the main benefit of using generics lists over normals tlist tobjectlist is improved type-safety with less casts and cleaner code

1661027
key-value	key
also if you re using key-value pairs are you putting them into a list and then retrieving them by searching for a key and returning the associated value

1661038
processor	cpu
the cpu of most processor manufactured in the last 15 years have some special instructions which are very powerful

1661051

the triggers currently initializer some variables from the insert table updates the datetime column on the same table and then attempts to insert a history recording using the initializer variables i mentioned earlier

1661123
jqtransform	jquery
i am using a jquery plugins called jqtransform

1661125
json	xml
json and xml have extremely different semantics and xmlnode that you mentioned is actionscript 2 legacy that you shouldnt use .

1661125
json	xml
no offense but i think you should look at either a json or xml e4x tutorial since you code and what you say somehow leads me to believe you didn t understand some fundamental things such as the general process

1661146
environment	building
run the configure shell scripting that sets up your building environment setting things like which cpu and os you re using

1661170

1661276
boost-python	f2py
i have investigated f2py boost-python swig cython and pyrex for my work phd in optical measurement techniques

1661276
python	c++
if you already have c++ code of your own that you want to use in python go for this

1661276
python	c++
it is very easy to translation c++ class structures into python class structures this way

1661276
python	c++
i recommend it if you have c++ code that you need in python

1661276
boost-python	ctypes
timings ctypes has the highest call overhead 700ns followed by boost-python 322ns then directly by swig 290ns

1661293
display	height	hide	show
even though i declare the item s root layout to wrap_content and each component in the item to fill_parent the view i hide show which is supposed to change the item s height is simply cut off at the bottom instead of its parent the item layout growing in height to fully display it

1661295
ado	jet
long story short check-constraints were introduced into the engine in the jet 4.0 era .when the access team were favouring ado

1661295
ado	jet
.so for the majority of jet 4.0 -only functionality compressible data types fixed-length text data types fast foreign key etc you need to use ado

1661318
contains	elements
now no matter what i try the scrollviewer will alway expand contract to contains all elements in the stackpanel even if that means overflowing under the screens but no vertical scrollbar

1661321
buffering	capture
use the bracketing construct ... to create a capture buffering

1661332
jquery	.post
q is there a blog .post or .something in the adobe documentation that show crud on a one-to-many relationship header detail that uses web-standards css instead of tables that uses best practices cf9 has changed .so many things now scripted components orm that uses the latest user-interface techniques jquery or .some of the buser-interfacelt-in ajax features of cf9 that has a nice front-end a nice looking header and background along with .some pretty button

shell	bash
on linux with ksh or bash the shell will add additional quotes which mess up the whole thing

1661378
base	zero
leading zero indicate that the numbers is expressed in octal or base 8

1661378
base	zero
zero base is taken as 10 decimal

1661383
decimal	octal
in this case it doesn t matter because a single digits octal constants has the same value as the equivalent decimal constants but in c

1661383
decimal	octal
whether an int literals is expressed in octal decimal or hexadecimal once it is parsing by the compiler it is just treated as a value

1661385
octal	hex	decimal	octal	decimal	hex
octal is a numbering systemd based on 8 instead of 10 for decimal or 16 for hex

1661386
margins	padding
as i tend to then you can use margins or padding settings to positioning the elements

1661392
decimal	octal
for 005 both the octal and decimal representations are the same and should not bother you but still it s asking for trouble unless you specifically meant the octal representation

1661430
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
dynamic-sql might be a least complex way but i don t want to consider it because of the parameters like performance security sql-injection etc..

1661430
any	set
this will required me to declare the parameter-types while passing it to the sp it distorts the abstraction i don t set types in any of my parameters because each of them is treated in a generics way

1661473
put	get
i have put what i believe to be the most permissive crossdomain.xml possible in the wwwroot folder and still get the errors

1661503
environment	building
they don t appear to use any standards for setting up their building environment other than just buildinging it using vs2005 and click the compile button

1661503
environment	building
or am i asking too much from a c++ building environment

1661505

this works as expected in ie firefox google-chrome and opens the links on the opener howeve safari opens all links in a new windows and not the opener

1661587
subclassing	superclass
originally i had a design problem where i needed five subclassing of a superclass where all but two would use the same generics methods of doing things and the other two classes would need special handling

1661587
superclass	inherited
.so i had every class inherited superclass and its do.something methods and had subclassspecial1 and subclassspecial2 overrides with their own do.something methods

1661587
implements	abstract	subclassing	superclass
i could of course make an abstract dosometing methods in the superclass and make each subclassing implements its own versioning but that would duplicates code in three of the classes

1661589
contains	elements
the actual scripting elements have been removed from the parsing childnodes to stop them getting execute on insert into the document presumably .so that scriptinging are only execute once .when content contains them is append into multiple elements at once.

1661612
cross-compiling	toolchain
you should assume the kernel append cflags are right provided your configuration is ok and if your toolchain does not support one of them then you have no choice but to cross-compiling a toolchain by yourself using the original crosstol scripting that should work with 2.95.3

1661631
required	checked
i had worked up a scripting that explode the date in to parts and added 4 hours to the time but the ensuing logic that would be required to checked for .when 4 hours pushes in to the next day month year seemed a little excessive

1661692
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i ve heard good things about fogbugz which also gives you a bug-tracking email-address and automatic customer reply

1661709

1661846
peer	p2p
could and should i consider p2p peer to peer for multiplayer

1661852
export	csv
there s no direct way to do that however i use adoquery.recordingset.getstring to get the recording as string here s an example i use to export the data to csv file

1661881
matplotlib	scipy
also i ve gotten away with using python numpy scipy and some plotting like matplotlib libs in the past which gives you some more options in terms of libs

1661889
directory	folder
this directory isn t in the list of sources folder while src main java or src main resources do

i ve got an install that can login an administration account to continue the setup but i don t know how to checked the current user to see if he she already has administration or power user privileges

1661918
repository	entity
option a - you do not want to be pulling the whole repository down all the tags and branches every time and it will encourage your users to think of the whole repository as a single entity which it isn t really - you want them thinking in terms of solutions and of tagging branching in that context

1661918
external	root
you address shared project by referencing them as external in the root of the appropriate solutions

1661927
runas	cmd
you can already put in the install the cmd runas read more at wikipedia - remember that this cmd will make the person need to use the administration privileges

1661927
administration	account
in windows how can i run an administration task from a non-admin account

new composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight 3.0 - october 2009 release

1661956
udp	tcp
considering modern webserver can staurate 1gbit ethernet with http over tcp the lower overhead of udp means that you re probably going to be able to saturate 1 gbit ethernet with udp as long as your computations hold up

1661958
peer	p2p
could and should i consider p2p peer to peer for multiplayer

1662409
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
if you want to use this to show the user which sub-page on your site he she is on you have to use some sort of serverside-coding examples php asp asp.net python ruby or similar to assign a specific class to the elements corresponding with the current page

1662420
32-bit	64bit
php 5.2+ should convert 64bit numbers to floats which is better than previous versioning of php which would just convert it to the maximum 32-bit value

1662442

1662718
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight and i know that your question is about wpf this information is more accessible than in wpf

1662728
decimal-point	digits
the exponent -16 serves to shift the decimal-point over by 16 places but doesn t change the numbers of digits in the overall numbers

1662728

1662745
attributes	properties
just like calling the methods that fire ups the event with the named of the properties could it be designed as and attributes and using auto-properties

1662745
attributes	properties
we could do something like this if we can indicate to the compiler by this attributes that it needs to generator a call to the propertieschanged with the named of the properties if the new value is different from the previous

1662763
ruby	php
in future if i write a libs in ruby and want to use it with php is it possible

1662769
exponent	modulo
i first tried using the pear crypt_rsa functions but it doesn t support x509 or pkcs8 it just simply base64 encode the serialization modulo exponent and key types

1662776
attributes	properties
you can achieve the end result by adding a .post building action using mono s cecil to go through properties with that attributes and modify the behavior of the properties and spit out the newly compiled assembly with the appropriate behavior

1662791
exception-handling	try-catch
however i see your main methods throw exception-handling - this isn t the best practice but it will prevent you from needing a try-catch block in this particular instances

1662797
bufferedwriter	filewriter
do you need to close the bufferedwriter and filewriter object

1662804
highlight	selected
do i programmatically have to manage the backcolor highlight color on a listview s item .when selected through code

1662804
click	mouse	highlight	selected
do i al.so need to do this .so it looks highlight as it does .when selected with a mouse click

1662804
click	mouse	highlight	selected
i would have thought that selected true would also do the backcolor highlight that happens through the mouse click

1662806
profiling	trace
running profiling from the user-interface is expensive but you can run trace without the user-interface and that will give you what you want

1662817
shopping-cart	cart
usually the state of your shopping-cart is maintained in the session but he makes the comment paraphrasing here that this is an incorrect interface implementation since you can t send your session to a colleague but you could send the resource state which would then have all of the items in your cart

1662886
subtract	add	pointers	stack
the il itself is correct and has no casts none are needed - in il you push a pointers and an int arguments on stack and do an add subtract

1662894
silverlight	wpf
a silverlight .app just a wireframe that is hosted on an html page no aspx server side solution just a client side html page loaded from c somefolder mysilverlight.html actually it is hosted in a wpf .app using webbrowser-control

i m trying to write a shell scripting that will list all the folder in a particular directory on the remote-server

1662953
selected	checkbox
i am trying to create a table that is sortable using jquery tablesorter and also with a selected all none checkbox toggle for the individual row checkbox

1662975
keyboard	mouse
low-level mouse and keyboard hooks are execute in the context of the calling process not the process being hooked internally windows notifies your hook via a windows messages

1662975
32-bit	64bit
for other hooks you do need to call the 32-bit versioning of setwindowshookex and pass a hook function in a 32-bit process and call the 64bit versioning of setwindowshookex and pass a hook function in a 64bit process though

1662976
compact-framework	.net
i cant understand why sending parameters to insert function works slow in .net compact-framework

1662987
contains	elements
although if you resize the windows contains the elements it gets updates

1662998
rollback	commit
this generally means closing the database connection at the end of a request or alternatively issuing a rollback or commit if the connection is to be re-used again for a subsequent request

1663003
selected	cell
i have the first view come up with a cell of the table populate statically .when you selected one of the cell it will pull up a form to input data

1663048
any	set
i m not exactly sure why though because i set the buffering length to the length of the file .so i don t see how this would be any different than readfiletobytearray

1663050
hide	show
this user-controls should always be able to show the worklog .so i don t think it s bad to bind it in there but at the same time i want to be able to hide it if the user wants

1663061
wxwidgets	mfc
qt is one amongst a numbers for gui frameworks and libs such as wxwidgets windows forms mfc gtk vcl and many others

1663066

1663109
pygtk	gtk
import pygtk gtk

1663121
interpreter	runtime
move your code-behind to a dynamic-languages that silverlight can interpreter at runtime

1663121
ironpython	ironruby
using the dlr you can have silverlight code-behind in ironpython or ironruby

1663121
ironpython	ironruby
the dlr allows you to dynamically load ironpython ironruby code and assosciate it with code-behind

1663125
callback	methods	synchronous	.when
this will only work reliably if we assume that scripting.onload events for each scripting fire and execute sequentially and synchronous .so there would never be a situation .when two or more of the event handler would pass checked for len 0 and execute callback methods

1663140
opensolaris	solaris
for example opensolaris and therefore i presume solaris machines can grab significant amounts of their own configuration over ldap

1663147
postgresql	mysql
the bug is data.source independent i tried with postgresql and mysql .so far

1663150
delphi	c++
i m a c++ programmer but my question is about the delphi network socket libs indy

1663153
xsd	xml
however .when i use the data flow task- xml source to try and parsing an example xml file that file is located here xsd is located here it says

1663157
contains	set
in c++ i have a reference to an object that wants to points back to its owner but i can t set the pointsers during the contains class construction because its not done constructing

1663163
nhibernate	ado.net
the error messages reads the user must provide an ado.net connection - nhibernate is not creating it.

1663180
kerberos	ldap
organization that deploy ldap don t t deploy it for auth per se they use kerberos for that

1663180
kerberos	ldap
once you deployed kerberos for authentication and autheization it makes sense to use ldap as your organization structure store since most kern implementation will create an ldap anyway eg

1663196
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
that is hide the previous page and show the next page loading its content via ajax only if not loaded

1663217
jaxp	xom	jaxp	jdom	jdom	xom
my prefered options would be xom jdom then the built-in jaxp in that order

1663230
boolean	int
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean

1663261
authentication	login
for authentication with some other web service you ll have to write a module and implements hook_user particularly the login case

1663266
system.net	wcf
you will likely want to avoid using the high level interfaces like wcf and asp.net and go straight to the system.net namespace depends a bit on how many player you ll be synchronized but if it s large you ll want speed here over ease

1663277
webserver	upload
however if you allowing the file-extension through to the webroot you ll still need to ensure that the extension is something that won t cause any problems on the server such as .php ok php handling should be disabled in the webserver for upload directory but still

1663283
python	perl
in the spirit of perl golf here s my shortest python solution

1663323
constructor	object
does not call the constructor of templatizedtypes but instead call a methods on an already construct object of that types

1663325
abstract-class	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass	subclassing	superclass
but on the other hand those methods are not intended to be called manually from anywhere except inside the abstract-class the superclass of the subclassing

1663341
javascript	dom
however the dom is required by javascript scripting that wish to inspect or modify a webpage dynamically

1663341
javascript	dom
.so you might try searching through .some howto document on using javascript dom techniques

1663358
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
postgresql mysql or oracle consult

1663365
rar	zip
and can validation them but what in case of zip rar and pdf files

1663377
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms are built around the concept of 1-form only

1663377
asp.net-mvc	webforms
to get around this you d need to either use a different flavor a la asp.net-mvc or take a look at this article for how to get around it in webforms

1663388
subclassing	base-class
however you choose to implements the base-class clearly document in the header as well as in your documentation exactly what the class assumes and how to go about subclassing it correctly

1663392
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
it can t be done with asp.net webforms you can have many forms but only one should have a runat server which isn t paractical but you can get it done easely with asp.net-mvc

thickbox	jquery
i am using thickbox jquery tabs.when any of the tab is click i want to pass the url.idnumber to the iframe which on tab pages

1663399
put	get
i put out a blog .post on how to use this for paypal and get around the asp.net single form tag problem

1663434
updating	updates
to optimize the updating make sure that postgresql can use heap-only tuples to store the updates versioning of the rows

1663434
tuples	any
also take into account that any long transactionalal including statistical queries will hold onto tuples that have changed after the transactional has started

1663441
python	perl	gitolite	gitosis
with larger numbers of users you could be better with using a tool to manage access to git repositories like gitosis in python required setuptools or gitolite in perl

1663461
dictionary	arrays
since the msisdn is unique in the arrays you could consider making that arrays a dictionary keyed by msisdn instead

1663476
value	field
remember that you can only use one field at a time and if you set say f.c to something the value of f.i is going to change in a potentially messy way

1663477
lookup	any
any decent hashtable implementation will required reading the words fully process it using a hash-function and finally a lookup in the table

1663477
unique	words
this way rather than doing a full lookup of the words you could often find yourself skipping characters once you ve established the unique words prefix

1663479
hashtable	set
add these elements to a set data types as you go line by line before asking whether it is in the hashtable

1663479
unique	words
this will take some of the memory and computation away from asking the dictionary every single time and instead will handle unique valued words better at the end of the call just dump all the words that are not in the dictionary out of the set with a value of 1

1663484
contains	any
the object merger would contains a dictionary of all object within the model and know how to identify two instances as being the same and merge any value from the receiving end

1663485
attributes	properties
you should use firebug in firefox to examine the dom attributes of the table to determine the properties to use

1663485
put	get
you will need to use document.getelementbyid to get the table you will be pulling from and then the header will be in .so you can parsing the cell in that row and get the value where i put header above

1663492
prefix-tree	trie
see why use a hashtable over a trie prefix-tree

1663497
hide	show
reference toggle visibility - show hide anything

1663498
contains	any
my code does not contains any circular or other references .so the commonly cited tools will not help me devel cycle devel peek

1663503
google-chrome	opera
and it works in opera and google-chrome

1663503
google-chrome	opera
i can browse it without problems in opera and google-chrome

1663537

.when i use any of the firefox google-chrome ie6 ie7 and opera browsers it all works fine

1663540
expression	evaluation
if your main issue is the need to types eval parsing text i instead of i you could create a simpler-to-use functions for evaluation expression from strings

1663547
click	mouse
any other events like mouse click xmlhttprequest returns and timers will queue up while your code is execution and run one after another

1663548
any	set
make a new viewcontroller for any view or set of views that manage different user experiences or tasks

1663563
arguments	default
then provide a default empty hash as an alternative if you didn t supply any other arguments

1663566
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	arrays	loops	while-loop	for-loop	while-loop	loops	while-loop	arrays
performance questions aside it strikes me that the while-loop variant has potential maintainability issues as a programmer coming along to add some new bells and whistles has to remember to put the arrays increment in the right place whereas the for-loop variant puts it safely out of the body of loops

1663575
unpivot	pivot
here is a good explanation using pivot and unpivot

1663576
defined	declare
i think you re supposed to forwarding declare the variables in the .h and later defined it in its shared section in a .cpp something like

1663627
scheme	lisp
i m learning emacs lisp and i came across this decade old .post saying that at some points guile scheme will replace emacs lisp or emacs will be rewritten with guile

1663627
scheme	elisp
the original goal was for guile to be backwards compatible with elisp but it seems like developing scheme is the better choice

1663632
pure-virtual	base-class
your base-class can log assert or throw .when an abstract pure-virtual methods is called

1663643
directory	folder
in svn the tags would just live in a tags folder in the repo then i could just export something from there but it doesn t seem like the same trunk-branches-tags directory are used for hg project or are they

1663644
rake-task	rakefile
as far as difference are concerned the rakefile is going to run the gem building cmd on its inline gemspec with a rake-task

1663667
extends	final
if you extends the left-hand side by adding more digits positioning you ll see that the carry rolls over into an infinite numbers of bit positioning towards the left .so you never really get a final carry of 1

1663675
subtract	add
it allows you to add subtract just like you do with base-10 because you ab use the fact that the sign-bit is the msb which will cascade operations all the way to overflows .when nessecary

1663693
complement	addition
.when performing 2 s complement addition the only time that a carry indicates a problem is .when there s an overflow conditional - that can t happen if the 2 operands have a different sign

1663746
installation	upgrade
in a separate installation try upgrading to the latest perl 5.10.1 and also upgrade all your cpan modules

1663768
value	field
why would the datatable and binding source have different value for the same field

1663790
bad-request	http-error
sometimes the resource throw a http-error 400 bad-request .when my request contains an error

1663790
contains	elements
however that response also contains an xml elements that gives a detailed error messages

arrays	loops
i m saving the result in an arrays but you could redirect it to a temporary file and read it in a line at a time with a loops

1663845
contains	elements
to fill a selected elements contains category supposing you have a user belongsto category relationship

1663852
google-chrome	opera
however the html 5 draft drops the requirement that the base elements be an ab.solute uri .so i guess opera and google-chrome have already implements that relaxation

1663859
default-value	default
i had to do this in the past too and having read threads like arrays or collecton as a default-value of a mojo configuration parameter or configuring a list as default-value for a plugins parameter i ended up setting default in the execute methods like chris mentioned in a comment to his answer see for example the flexmojos wrapper plugins sources and the parameters parameter

assuming you ve set up a many-to-one relationship between notes and prospects properly and the column that contains a prospect s named in the prospects table is called named this will do exactly what you want

1663910
javascript	dom
how can i access them in javascript dom or jquery

1663916
any	set
note that a types s properties should be able to be set and retrieved in any order

1663918

i m hand typing the file right now but the task is very slow because of the numbers and order of the field and value for each recording in the xml

1663934
default-value	default
i don t have a default-value but on default setup with 1gb heap it is only 64mb

1663938
controllers	routes
if you change methods named you need to adjust routes controllers and replace auto-generated url helpers with hand-written ones

1663945
restart	reload
even if you hot deploy the .war file by not restart the server there will still be some downtime while the context reload

1663954
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
whats the best way for uiviewcontroller that are pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller to communication with each other

1663955
arguments	default
what you re requesting is very hard to do properly because help gets the function signature from inspect.getargspec which in turn gets it from introspection which cannot directly be fooled -- to do it properly would mean generator a new function-object on-the-fly instead of a simple wrapper function with the right arguments named and numbers and default value

1663964
worksheet	excel
what is the fastest way to import data into a sql-server database directly from the active worksheet in excel

1663964

javafx	swing
2 swing we previously evaluated javafx

1663980
groovy	java
ideally the code listing should be in java or groovy but anything fairly similar c# would do

i believe you don t need to keep the old versioning available if you don t mind not allowing people to upgrade incrementally

1663995
python	php
i come from a php background and would like to know if there s a way to do this in python

1664016

.when it comes to c++ only wxwidgets mfc or wtl could be considered as alternatives although i would argue that qt is in a different league from them

1664052
combinations	permutation
it has permutation and combinations with and without repetition

1664063
typename	typedef
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode

1664088
testng	junit
then java got annotations junit got competition testng and it is suddenly moving along again

1664088
testng	junit
for example testng allowed a smooth migration path from junit

1664111
where-clause	sql
then in your sql statement s where-clause use the instring function to checked for a match

1664122

1664178
scriptaculous	jquery
initially it was because search engines didn t crawl it but these days it s mainly because flashy effects can be done with javascript engines like jquery scriptaculous or mootools

1664184
javascript	dom
i want to convert a javascript dom htmldcument to a string that i can write to a file

1664189
javascript	dom
javascript only sees the html dom tree in the client side and can access it

1664205
cross-join	inner-join
it goes on to show an example of the similar results of an inner-join and a cross-join with where conditional

1664220
contains	set
in c++ i have a reference to an object that wants to points back to its owner but i can t set the pointsers during the contains class construction because its not done constructing

1664254
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
tons of stuff does not behave properly because there are tons of undocumented integration between uiview uiwindow and uiviewcontroller

1664255
private-key	rsa
my thought was to have a private public rsa key-pair and hand out the public key to each client leaving the private-key solely on the server

1664255
aes	rsa
each client would then generator their own aes key and rsa encrypt it

1664276
contains	elements
will get you the text of all elements contains within the body of the document

1664277
buffering	streaming
this is all hypothetical but you could try using the built-in streaming buffering engine

1664291
perl	php
i have to call an existing amf methods in a php or perl scripting and read its results

1664300
sql-server	oracle
b-tree variants are probably the most common in the general purpose dbms market oracle or ms sql-server

1664312
integration	payment
we decided to roll our own in the end just due to the fact that we knew clients would be wanting changes that the store software didn t include - and we were right - but it does what 95 of people will want from an online store doesn t cost the earth and comes with paypal integration and a bunch of other payment portals out of the box

1664337

linux	unix
ps you should add details on your environment such as your os windows gnu linux unix etc the apache versioning etc

1664366
cassini	iis	webdev.webserver	iis	webdev.webserver	cassini
alternatively in your project that contains the user-controls you could use ctrl-alt-p to attach the project to the iis process or webdev.webserver process if you re using visual studios built-in webserver aka cassini

1664390
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
i ve already created the binary-tree and linked-list classes i m just in need of an algorithm that printing only the nodes of the largest path

1664390
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
the height and size of the binary-tree are already stored in the root nodes but my problem is traversal only the largest path while adding each nodes to my linked-list

1664394
haskell	python
i m wondering if any other c# developers would find it an improvement to have a compiler directive for csc.exe to make whitespace significant a la haskell or python where the kinds of whitespace create code blocks

1664394
haskell	python
since curlies and semicolons are often a barrier to entry to c# they are really only parsing helpers they don t in themselves impart meaning to your code they could be removed a la haskell python

1664398
touch	drag
as the user drag the touch around you maintain a list of touch points

1664398
postback	ajax
you draw these as a line list on the canvas for feedback and submit the list encode as an ajax postback

1664402
any	set
for this i need a separate set of indic but .when i specify two index-arrays gl_element_array_buffers and points them to different shader-variables with two call to glvertexattribpointser something goes wrong and it doesn t rendering anything but doesn t report any errors either - checked with glgeterror

1664407
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
yes you need to specify the itemssource on an itemscontrol listbox tabcontrol combobox to be able to bind data to it

1664414
zend-framework	drupal
for example zend-framework and drupal both use this technique

1664419
perl	ruby
i dunno ruby but looking at the scripting it almost looks like similar to perl

1664422
cryptography	security
using cryptography primitive directly is not trivial and difficult to get exactly right and with cryptography you have to be not exactly right only once for your security to be broken

1664422
aes	rsa
to answer your question it s generally a better idea to create a session secret the aes key through a diffie-hellman exchange and each side use its private rsa key to sign its key-exchange data

1664461
combinations	permutation
since you want permutation not combinationss map each combinations to the set of actual elements true false true becomes 1 3 and then generator all the permutation of these using next_permutation again

1664463
shell	tcsh
tcsh is a little different about variables than the usual shell and it s the default on freebsd

1664475
show	next
also is it possible to instruct xval to simply show a next to the field and then show the actual error messages in a tooltip and or summary above the form

1664485
linux	unix
i dunno if gcc or unix linux platform provide anything similar

1664486
delphi	vb6
most frameworks create object for this model or suggest this types by default vb6 delphi mfc atl

1664487
.when	ready
.when you re in user-interface code on the user-interface-thread of course field some kind of a data is ready event that is posted by the data service

1664489
punctuation	words	punctuation	tokenize
the tokenize would remove the punctuation and return an arraylist of words

1664496
linux	unix
see also why is it that utf8-decode is used .when integration with a unix linux environment

1664497
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
well make a binary-tree data structure fill it with some dummy data traversal the tree with a depth or breadth-first-search and construct a linked-list of the nodes in the longest path

1664509
click	mouse
you don t say whether the program freezes .when the messagebox is display or .when it is dismissed but i d guess the problem is that the drag-drop subsystem is still capturing the mouse preventing you from click the messagebox button

1664513
constructor	object
in my case i also have to make sure the base object interface for the equivalent of iunknown in com has a protected destructor and constructor because the smart pointers do an implicit-cast to one of these and this would be flawlessly passed to delete and compile

1664521
lightbox	thickbox
.so the idea is on a certain page of the site the site is shaded out much like a lightbox or thickbox but certain divs other elements are still visible

1664525
contains	any
note that this will match any messages that contains the substring target_word

1664531
firefox	safari
as you can see it looks ok in firefox ie7 safari etc. but in ie6 - nothing

1664546
repository	entity
if your repository is backed by linq 2 sql and rsvp is an entity you will usually have to cause deleteonsubmit to be called inorder for the recording to be deleted from the database--just calling remove on the associations will not be enough

1664548
insertion-sort	quicksort
the algorithm used by std sort isn t specified by the standards but libstdc++ used by g++ uses an adaptive introsort which is essentially a median-of-3 quicksort down to a certain level followed by an insertion-sort

1664560
difference	count
however you should consider whether you really nead busy waiting for the time or if you could get away with setting a timer to count down the difference between the current time and the expected time

1664562
order	add	required	checked
rather than testing against the real repository which will add object in the database and required to delete them to clean the state after the test you can create an interface irepository with the two same methods and use a mock to checked that .when your class call irepository it is exercising the right methods with the right arguments in the right order

1664562
any	set
it also gives you the ability to set the fake repository to any state you want in memory without having to physically add or delete recording from a real storage

1664575
required	checked
could you checked if it is actually the named that is required or if the person who messed around with the list renamed the title column and made it mandatory

1664583
credentials	account
have you tried to log into the site using the credentials of the service account the site s .app pool is running under

1664603
linux	unix
on unix linux os x these files should exist at

1664607
any	set
you re just trading one arbitrary set of code block identifier with another which nullifies any gains if there were any with the new syntax which isn t even established

1664633
scripting	shebang	chmod	sudo
bin sh this is called a shebang line and tells the os what to do with your file on the first line of your scripting and then types chmod u+x myscripting.sh this tells the os that you and only you are allowed to execute your file you ll be able to run the file directly with sudo myscripting.sh

1664657
defined	declare
first declare but don t defined a templates

1664668
managed-code	unmanaged
if you want to load it at runtime you ll have to write an unmanaged shim that starts the clr and loads your managed-code in a new appdomain- then you can tell it to load whatever configuration file you want for the new appdomain

1664683
compatibility	legacy
i ve tried putting a value into the registry under hklm software windows-nt currentversion appcompatflags compatibility assistant persistent with the path to the copy of the install that the control panels runs it s a legacy install that s based on installshield tech that predates windows-install

1664684
binary-tree	nodes
i assume your binary-tree nodes have a reference to their parent is that right

1664684
linked-list	nodes
once you find one such nodes then from there go up the trail of parent nodess and add each nodes along the way to your linked-list

1664684
linked-list	nodes
.when you reach the top then the linked-list has all the nodes of the largest path

1664684
children	nodes
use a breadth-first or depth-first search to reach leaf nodes nodes which do not have any children nodes

1664684
linked-list	nodes
add this leaf nodes to the linked-list then go to it s parent

1664684
linked-list	nodes
repeat that last step until you reach the root nodes and there is no parent - then your linked-list has all the nodess of a longest path

1664704
logging	trace
try logging some stack trace and see if you can figure out what is triggers all of the draw call

1664725
udp	tcp
it include tcp udp raw-sockets

1664735
contains	elements
where the navigation panels content dynamically generator contains hundreds of elements

1664740
background-color	display
i want to have the ribbon lie above the background-color the parchment paper that is .so to display the wooden background

1664753
jms	jta
actually the big deal with java on the server side is imo that you benefit from standardsized enterprise apis aka j2ee that allow you to do enterprise things jdbc jta jms etc in a standards way with hardware operating systemd and software vendor independence which is a big plus for contract negotiation

1664760
subtraction	addition	subtraction	complement	complement	addition
most implementation use 2 s complement because it makes addition and subtraction the same binary operation signed and unsigned operations are identical

1664761
rollback	commit
begin trans rollback commit

1664765
entity	poco
by default each entity class or poco should have a tostring overload anyway

1664766
complement	negation
at least c and c++ offer 1 s complement negation which is the same as bitwise negation via the language s operators

1664768
complement	addition
unlike unsigned addition this doesn t necessarily mean that the value is too large to represent in the one s complement numbers just that the representation temporary exceeded the numbers of bits available

1664773
value	field
you can use a converter like that adds target references to the field object and provides a value accessor like this

1664773
attributes	properties
though frankly i would use description attributes on the individual properties along with reflection instead of hard-coding the list

1664799
great-circle	haversine
i d like to create a function that calculates the distance between two pairs of lat longs using the pythag theorem instead of the haversine great-circle formula

1664803
textbox	button
.when i click a button action buttonclick it should change the two textbox mytextlabel and mytextlabel2 text increment value r by one

1664804
constructor	private
edit sorry i mentioned private constructor but you ve already dealt with this points in your question

1664813
child-process	spawn
what s happening here is that your fork call returns twice .so both the parent and child-process continue looping and spawn new process

1664821
systemd	sysv
at the c level there are different implementation and semantics for signal-handling on bsd vs systemd 5 sysv

1664832
default	reset
reset your environment settings back to the default tools - options

1664832
versioning	migrate
some settings in the text editor don t migrate well from earlier versioning

1664834
pixels	line
the basic problem you describe sounds like the vertical line are being draw between vertical stack of pixels which is causing the systemd to draw an antialiasing line

1664845
contains	elements
my problem is that the file i am trying to read contains wordss and i don t know how to get a whole words as an elements in the arrays

1664853
constructor	private	protected	public
if your class is not too complex you could either use an interface which is publically visible and make the actual implements class private or you could make a protected constructor for the jornalentry class and have a private class jornalentryinstance derived from jornalentry with a public constructor which is actually initializer by your journal

1664853
constructor	private
if that too is infeasible you can always make the constructor private and use reflection to call it from your journal class

1664853
contains	set
now that i think about it another possibility would use a private delegation in the contains class which is set from the inner class

1664862
any	set
i m not seeing anything .so far setcellformat is a methods on writablecell and there doesn t seem to be any way to set a format for anything within a single cell

1664896
versioning	upgrade
if it s an upgrade don t try jumping too many versioning and if possible uninstaller any third-party modules or activities that might cause trouble whilst updating the tables

1664918
spaces	output
.so what s happening is that the children themselves are continuing loops in the own process spaces after they printing their output as well as the parent doing it

1664938
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
why is it that internet-explorer is placing my find listing submit button on a newline whereas firefox google-chrome keep the submit button inline horizontally with the input-field which is the desired result

1664938
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i would like internet-explorer to behave the same as firefox google-chrome in that it keeps the find listings submit button horizontally inline with the input-field

1664957
python	c++	python	java
i think that null in java just like null in c++ or none in python means specifically there s nothing here -- not i don t know which is a concept peculiar to sql not common in oop languages

1664964
textbox	button
try setting width on that button .so that textbox + button + padding 400px size of your containers

1664966
environment	execution
you get native execution direct interfaces with windows 7 direct2d api and arguably one of the best ide development environment available on windows 7

1664970
configuration	environment
you might have to edit your environment configuration to get the observers to fire though depending on how your application is currently set up

1664987
order	add
this ignore the order desiderata but that wouldn t be too hard to add

1665002
temporary	copy
i m trying to catch an image dragged from firefox onto a tpanel i ve got something that nearly works but .when i go to copy the file that i thought would be temporary created the file did not exist what did i miss

1665010
toggle	slider
since i m only using jquery for the slider functionality - how can i remove all the unused jquery base code like the toggle function etc easily

1665012
firefox	safari
dreamweaver is good but however using the wysiwyg may have problems getting consistency .when viewing between ie firefox and safari

1665015
versioning	upgrade
what if someone doesn t upgrade from versioning x to x+1 but wait for x+2

1665015
versioning	upgrade
what if versioning x+1 is buggy and we need to rollback to a previous versioning of the s w but have already upgrade the data-structures

1665043
pascal	delphi
with .so many open-.source and cross-platform ides libs i think pascal is still alive except the popular delphi dialect and could do practical tasks.as the results implies pascal could do operating systemd compiler cross-platform libs desktop-programming..so it seems that pascal at least could do a lot of serious tasks if not too pratical to make moeny back instantly

1665049
hide	show
this is the kind of code i use in my apps all the time and i ve used it ever since the first time i implements it about 10 years ago and noticed that it was clearly noticeably faster to show hide controls with the custom collections than it was with walking the entire controls collections

1665053
contains	elements
i want to get all the leaf elements and elements which contains text

1665053
contains	elements
and instead returns all leaf elements and all elements contains text which are the first child of their parent and is equivalent to

1665056
asp.net-mvc	webforms	authentication	login
whereas in a webforms .app you kind of have to code the rest for yourself - the asp.net-mvc framework does the rest for you - all you need to do is add the authentication attributes to your action methods and the framework will checked to see if you re logged in and if not redirect you to the login page

1665063
value	field
the status numbers is made up of the on bits of the status field value

1665063
value	field
msdn libs has this to say about the value of the various bits in the status and status2 field of sysdatabases

1665064
arrays	loops
the first thing that occurs to me is to pull this out of the other loops since it s loading the same arrays each time and just assign it to each view

1665066
populate	row
how can i grab the rest of the data field from the selected row to populate my cart

1665069
binary	hex	decimal	hex
512 decimal 200 hex 0010 0000 0000 binary

1665069
binary	hex	decimal	hex
1024 decimal 400 hex 0100 0000 0000 binary

1665069
digits	base
principles apply of any base you just a way to represent each digits for large

1665073
logout	login
i need session handling ie login logout and some kind of encryption

1665073
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
my preferred language is c++ python or perl

1665080
arrays	loops
the .net result is that the arrays is kept in memory for the duration of foreach as well as object necessary for iterator and yet the cost is all at the beginning - the yield is basically an empty loops

1665093
ruby-on-rails	django
in this question i m not looking for scripting-language-based frameworks like php ruby-on-rails or django - but more raw html css javascript frameworks.

1665093
scriptaculous	jquery
.so far i ve done a quick look at things like yui jquery prototype scriptaculous and a few others but i m curious to know what people have had good experiences with

1665102
directory	folder
this will automatically map the correct physical directory on your server and save the file in the appropriate folder

1665106
scriptaculous	jquery
i ve always really liked prototype scriptaculous despite some involved work with yui and to a lesser extent jquery

1665108
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
with its key components of encoding obfuscation and licensing zend guard protects your php applications from reverse-engineering unauthorized customization unlicensed use and redistribution

1665111
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
on the client you can use libcurl which works with c++ python and perl

1665164
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
that got me looking around the properties in interface-builder and i noticed that .when i click on the 2nd tab in the tab bar which is set to a navigationcontroller rather than a viewcontroller there was an option for show toolbar that was checked

1665170
value	field
create a recording which maps field named to field value

1665170
value	field
this is easily extensible to add new field or change the data types of the value

1665208
selected	button
.when i selected paid in dropdown and click the button it show the list of paid customers in the jquery-dialog and if i selected unpaid and click button it show unpaid customers in the jquery-dialog

1665208
selected	button
for the first time i am getting the list correctly in the jquery-dialog but .when i click the paid unpaid list link again and selected unpaid in the dropdown and click the button it show the previos loaded content in the jquery-dialog

1665213
twitter	tweets
on a ruby-on-rails site i d like to display a certain twitter feed with paginator .so the visitor can see previous tweets as far back as needed

1665213
twitter	tweets
or i could have a rake-task that polls the twitter feed frequently with crontab and stores the tweets in the db

1665213
twitter	tweets
i don t like having to store the tweets in the db but that would also take care of the latency problem of querying twitter though i could use fragment caching to overcome that except that i haven t been able to get it working with ajax

1665216
32-bit	64bit
small images are 32-bit while the smallest 64bit image is m1.large

1665219
version-control	bazaar
bazaar has a pretty straightforward interface for the basic version-control tasks

1665245
order	add	value	field
for this you should add the predefined value in the reverse order to the field function arguments list and make the order descending

1665245
value	field
for the value not in the arguments list field returns 0

1665274
put	get
but the problem here is that all the rijndael samples available in the .net are mostly using a text file but is there any way of doing it in a online mode where .when i get the data in the textbox i convert it and put directly in to the database

i believe that the same thing happens with the parameterized prepare query this is called parameter sniffing - the execution plan is optimised for the parameters used the first time that the prepare statement is execute however this definitely doesn t happen .when you declare the parameter and use it in the query

1667340
version-control	git
seeing as there are no good reasons not to use version-control we intend to get either svn git mercurial or something else up and running on the server

1667765
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	seam	tapestry	jsf	wicket	seam	wicket	jsf	seam	jsf
struts 1 2 spring-mvc jsf seam wicket tapestry etc are all web-frameworks that are built up on top of the servlets specifications

1667769
printf	scanf
i believe typechecking call to printf scanf is turned on by default and should catch this

1667770
qtreewidget	qwidget
use qtreewidget setitemwidget qtreewidgetitem item int column qwidget widget to put the combo box into the cell

1667783
silverlight	wpf
as an example the prism framework for silverlight and wpf defined an iloggerfacade interface with a simple methods named log

1667783
constructor	object
later you can pass loggermock.object to the tested object via constructor or properties or configure a dependency injector that uses it

1667786
put	get
to get a better idea what is happening either in ie8 use the web developer toolkit for me i hit f12 and debugging then put in a break in the create function or do the same with firefox using firebug and debugging

1667797
any	set
that means everyone can edit but that single person gets god mode and can undo any change plus set the rules

1667809
value	field
the current algorithm i am testing simply pull the data from a state field stores each value in an arraylist capitalize it and then writes it back to the database

1667809
value	field
thus even though i have exactly the numbers of value that i need and they are in the correct order in the arrays to be pushed back out to the database once i reach a lapse in the sequences the rest of the data is placed in the wrong field

1667820
constructor	object
the object that implements ihttphandler must have a parameter-less constructor

1667821
value	field
alternately you can use a switching statement reflection or the dynamic types in c# 4 to return the value based on a supplied field named

1667823
any	set
as with any benchmarking i compare with a control to set the baseline .so i know how much time the boring bits take up

1667828
getter	setter
i don t think that there is an easy way for automation in generator getter and setter

1667830
ubuntu-server	linux
is there anyway in linux ubuntu-server to make a jar file that invokes the java viewmodel by itself

1667835
callback	methods
if you want the alert to be called at the end of an animation take a look at the animate methods s callback parameter

1667836
punctuation	words
this is non-trivial as you need to modify the xml of the flow document to be able to add adorner and you need to be smart about filtering out punctuation etc. as well as .when and how often to checked the spelling of words paragraph

1667858
perl	php
is there a php equivalent to perl s taint mode

1667859
callback	methods
business methods interceptor methodss lifecycle callback interceptor

1667859
callback	methods

1667869
serialization	marshalling
serialization and streaming over web-services metro on jboss work fine but plain marshalling with jaxb doesn t

1667872
getter	setter
unfortunately there s absolutely no way to do that currently as get and set prefixes are hardcode in generator getter setter wizard code

1667882
http	ssl
the issue is this - on the .net client if i set my security mode transportwithmessagecredential i must have ssl else i get the fun error invalid scheme expected http

1667919
mousedown	mouseup
the issue was mouseup and mousedown events did not fire

1667948
value	field
the first arguments to toof.set should be the target object too not the field and the second arguments should be the value not the field the value comes from

1667954
javassist	cglib
another points is make sure you have all the required jar in your classpath such as cglib or javassist

1667972
innodb	myisam
convert to all myisam tables to innodb you can search myisam vs innodb in stackoverflow.com and search engines to find out why

1667980
webserver	upload
upload the swf to your webserver and you can see the actual load progress from there

1667982

i could then checked this get header and if it had an absolute-path this request was coming from an outside source and required credentials otherwise it was coming from my .app and no basic-authentication is needed

1667993
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari behave as expected at least as i expect

1667994
logging	trace
turn on trace info logging .when trying to tracking down a problem during development

1667996
authentication	login
all users already have a linux user account on the same server as apache .so i m thinking it would be .so much better if i could just make a login form that would authentication users against their systemd usernames passwd and then examine their groupinging to see if they have the privileges to do what they are trying to do in which case they would belong to the already existing managers grouping

1668003
http	ssl
yup i wrote a blog .post about this a while back called how to ssl pass-through with wcf --or-- transportwithmessagecredential over plain http

1668007

mobile-browser set firefox multi ie opera safari google-chrome why why not

1668022
search-engine	web-crawler
while you loose out on things like pagerank scores that nutch provides it does simplify things because your web-crawler and your search-engine are separate tools

1668030
contains	set
.so i set that to contains . the current directory

1668045
value	field
serialization the old value of the field to a hidden-field on the form

1668060
font-size	height
alternatively you can try altering the line-height variables to 0 in the div then back to 100 in the p but that seemed to change the div s height by a few more pixels than the font-size methods .when i tried it

1668061
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen can do that with help from graphviz

1668069
postgresql	mysql
to make it more clear i want to use something available in mysql postgresql

this may be more than what you asked for but doxygen use the dot tool from graphviz to generator class-diagram along the documentation of any java application

1668115
msbuild	nant
there was a question about msbuild and nant advantages and disadvantages

1668115
environment	building
in my opinion nant because you can easily move the building environment in few seconds to another machine depends on copying files also it s easier to manage much faster to debugging and it s not integrated with team foundation server what do you think

1668136
widget	button
for my project .when a button is click the click event should then wait and listen to the next two click on different widget and then connect them .so as to form relationship between them

1668138
capitalize	uppercase
take a look at capitalize first letter of each words and at c# uppercase wordss in string i posted in two languages perl and c# because you haven t specified the language that you re using

contains	any
since i use an asp.net-mvc framework i have access to a baseutil class which contains common functions that don t really fit in any specific classes

1668178
constructor	object
the only wayout i can see at the moment is get the locale info using javascript and then parsing the labels .so i can create a date object with another constructor but this seems to much for a supposedly simple problem

1668183
32-bit	64bit
disclaimer for this discussion i like to stick to 32-bit and 64bit floating-point as describe by ieee-754

1668191

1668257
selected	button
besides using the next previous button one can use the sidebar to selected what panels to go to

1668257
selected	button	highlight	selected
the problem is that while the selected panels s sidebar button is highlight bolded it is barely discernable to my client

1668257
selected	button	highlight	selected
not only do they want the button highlight but they want the selected sidebar button to change color as well

1668259
qvector	qmap
what are the pros and cons of using qt containers qmap qvector etc. over their stl equivalent

1668259
qsettings	qhash	qlist	qmap	qhash	qlist	qhash	qmap
for example they can be used to populate a qvariant and then a qsettings with some limitation though only qlist and qmap qhash whose key are strings are accepted

1668273
linux	osx
unfortunately the only codecs supported on all three platform linux windows osx are dib i420 and iyuv which are all uncompressed video-codecs and thus make for really huge file sizes

1668273
output	mode
edit fyi on windows i have opencv output in motion-jpeg and then i use virtualdub in directstream copy mode to resave the file which corrects a bug with the movie s index

1668279
revision	updates
selected your desired project subfolder s right-click and selected updates item to revision

btw you can also have non-visual form inherited which is my preferred methods of creating a common base-class for all forms

1668380
decrement	increment
negative slopes work pretty much the same except you decrement instead of increment

1668397
signals	sigpipe
i m not sure what platform you re running on but if it s a unix-based platform then you might be running into a feature where a remote-closed tcp connection can cause your client to raise a sigpipe signals .when it tries to write to the socket

1668397
signals	sigpipe
if the sigpipe signals goes unhandled which it will unless you ve explicit install a handler then the unhandled signals will cause your program to terminate

the control was designed for use with webforms but it will work from an asp.net-mvc view as long as you don t need to handle postback events

1668404
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you do you may want to consider developing a hybrid solution with webforms pages where charting is required and asp.net-mvc for the rest of the site

i don t have any benchmarking handy but i m pretty sure 1 million hash operations per minute is not unreasonable for md5 or any flavor of sha on a suitably powerful machine

1668559
latex	tex
for .some odd rea.son the data cur.sor tool in matlab forcibly sets the data tip text to be display literally instead of with tex latex interpreting even if the default matlab settings say to do .so

1668561
constructor	object
there s at least one case where you might want to do this kind of checked though and that s .when the object s not being immediately used by what you ve passed it to if it s being set in a class s constructor

radio-button	checkbox
accessible custom designed checkbox and radio-button input styled with css and a dash of jquery

1668656

.so they would selected both checkbox

1668673
selected	checkbox
how do i retrieve the checkbox value .when multiple checkbox have been selected

1668681
pixels	line
the most counter-intuitive part is that every line of pixels is 4-byte aligned

1668723
selected	checkbox
you can use events to see if a checkbox was selected onchange

1668724
directory	folder
had to copy web-config from root views directory to the area views folder

1668727
ruby	php
ruby is quite similar to php .so the transitions may be fairly simple depending on your prior experience with other dynamic-languages

1668745
instances	private
for instances you can set up f# s dynamic assignment-operator to assign to private field

1668757

edit andy-score may be on to something with the between operators and reserved-words something like

1668803
sharp-architecture	structuremap
pretty sure i used sharp-architecture as my example the first time i implements structuremap

1668806
nsmutablearray	nsarray
like nsarray instances of nsmutablearray maintain strong references to their contents

1668880
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button
they contains different types of field textbox radio button checkbox single or in grouping

1668886
for-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop	while-loop	loops
and i want to convert it to a while-loop mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwarding and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

1668899
32-bit	64bit
i finally realised this might be due to using 32-bit int types instead of the native types and indeed .when i replace with int 8 the 64bit performance is only 25 worse than the 32-bit one

1668899
32-bit	64bit
why is using a 32-bit int .so much slower on a 64bit machine

1668899
32-bit	64bit
is it always the case that 64bit will be slower than 32-bit for this types of code i was surprised at this - or is there a chance i could get the 64bit compiled versioning running the same speed or faster

1668899
32-bit	64bit
ie 32-bit .when compiled 32-bit 64bit .when compiled 64bit in modern fortran

1668899
32-bit	64bit
edit the large performance hit was from the f2py wrapper copying the arrays to cast it from 64bit int to 32-bit int .so nothing inherent to the fortran.

1668900
python	ruby
if you don t like the idea of using applescript directly there is apple s scripting-bridge or even better use appscript for objective-c ruby or python

1668914
for-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop	while-loop	loops
and i want to convert it to a while-loop mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwarding and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

object-reference	instances
details system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1668962
put	get
before now and again i would get duplicates key errors and also i put in a log trace on the constructor and it appears that 1 petition is overwriting the other - hence the static versioning of mapper

1668962
constructor	private
in the constructor the urltemplate arrives i save it in a private variables and then in the overrides resolvecore it s something else -

1668968
environment	building

in this sense it is the same as the entity-framework only that ef is already embedded in the .net and nhibernate is a separate assembly that you must reference in your project

1668984
primitive	int
if it is a primitive types of at most 32-bit byte short int you can get stale old data .when reading

1668986
32-bit	64bit
like you i m surprised that the 64bit versioning is slower than the 32-bit versioning

1669000
pdf	xmp
strictly speaking modifying the pdf should change its moddate or xmp modifydate without changing its creationdate

1669040
any	set
it fails with a objct not recognized and i m guessing its because the set parameter is a utf8-decode strign any ideas as to how i can coerce data to a bytestream and use that as a set parameter

1669046
attributes	properties
each properties has a named attributes which would get you someproperties

1669056

you haven t show any code for the table view however i ve seem similar issues before where you add subviews to a cell then next time the cell is dequeued with dequeuereusablecell you add subviews again without checked if they are there or clearing them

1669179
parallels	vmware
use vmware or parallels if you are on a mac

1669180
value	field
but if your string where something- id -something-else it would be better to get rid of the index field and extraction the id value from the string using a regexp and then filtering directly by the id with questions.objects.filtering id id

1669229
any	set
will set min and max in one pass if the arrays has any elements

1669231
button	popup	textbox	button
once i have written some thing in textbox and i click the cancel button by which the popup windows will close

1669234
multiplication	division	getter	setter
you could attempt to obfuscation your score value in memory to make them harder to find with cheatengine for example storing them as a multiplied value then in your getter and setter for the score value include a multiplication division of the value to get set the proper score for your views and score submission widget

1669242
order	add
use the addchild methods to add the children back to the display list in reverse order

1669243

silverlight	wpf
the commanding concept in silverlight and wpf is used to tie together through binding mostly the user-interface to business-logic be it a controllers viewmodel model etc

1669250
widget	button
now in your application you might actually initiate saving a widget through a lot of different user-interface avenues such as page 1 has a button on the right hand side that saves the widget on that page page 2 has a menu item on the top that saves the widget on that page

1669262
silverlight	wpf
since one of the goals of mvvm which is the more common pattern for silverlight and wpf over asp.net-mvc is to seperate code and user-interface

1669266
implements	extends
of course you would have to implements the queryinterface _addref and _release methods and extends the interface to do something more useful

1669277
logfile	tail
how the scala scripting that reads 5g logfile from network-drive should be modified inorder to read last x line like tail in unix

1669328
template-method-pattern	strategy-pattern
you could use the template-method-pattern with the strategy-pattern

1669347
children	nodes
if you want a parent to have 1 or more children use a parent attributes on each recording and have root nodes have a parent of id 0 or some other meaningful value

1669347
children	nodes
if you want nodes may have multiple parent and children use a separate table to store the relationships

1669347
traversal	parent
this way you can traversal the tree by by querying for nodes that have a certain parent or child

1669353
ruby	php
the best way to learn ruby and or java is to forget the php way and to tackle each new language under their own idioms

1669362
consistency	acid
it has very robust features for guaranteeing important reliability properties called acid for atomicity consistency isolation and durability and has great performance but from the programmer s perspective it s a simple map structure

1669365

dictionary	arrays
as mentioned a dictionary isn t order but you could put the key in an arrays to use the above

1669457
subclassing	inherited
classmethod function also callable without initializer the class but its definition follows subclassing not parent class via inherited

1669495
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
not .so sure about google-chrome opera safari etc

1669499

1669513
http	ssl
the methods of using a network monitor like wireshark as describe here or using micro.soft network monitor is no option since the externl .soap web service only provides an ssl http url .so the payload of the http package are encrypted and not viewable

1669524
instances	self
with classmethods the class of the object instances is implicit passed as the first arguments instead of self

1669524
instances	self
with static-methods neither self the object instances nor cls the class is implicit passed as the first arguments

1669532
dictionary	arrays
most likely you d want to create an arrays with the key from the dictionary in the order you want and iterate through that using indexes

1669532
dictionary	arrays
and you d lookup dictionary value with dictionary arrays i

1669546
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked it in ie 8.0 firefox google-chrome

1669553
error-handling	try-catch
.when implements error-handling using the built-in validation-helpers on a strongly-typed view you usually create a try-catch block within the controllers and return a view with it s corresponding model as a parameter to the view methods

1669574
background-image	width
that makes the css a lot cleaner and sets the exact same rules for all elements except the ones that are unique which in this case is just the background-image used and the width

1669580
json	xml
you can get the positioning size and other properties about the form s controls at runtime and save that state in an xml or json file

1669587

1669618
arrays	loops
your loops is wandering past the end of your arrays

1669618

1669674
16-bit	x86
in x86 16-bit mode address spaces is not flat

1669676
binary	hex
the only way i can think is to convert hex value to binary

1669677
while-loop	arrays
your argvalues arrays is not automatically initializer to be all null you ll have to do that by hand .so right of the bat you can t detection the null in your while-loop as others have indicated

1669684
value	field
however unfortunately for me the built-in html-helper functions appear to be autobinding these field to the matching properties value on the viewmodel even though they are intended to apply to a completely different object

1669695
value	field
.when i restart the application the value of field in the parametric form are reset

1669702

1669767
tuples	sorted
here would be the sorted order of tuples by distance

1669778
abstract-class	base-class	base-class	inherited
if you don t have any specific implementation that is applicable across the classes that will inherited your base-class you re probably better off using an interface instead of an abstract-class

1669813
ruby	php
java and php have more in common syntactically than ruby and php

1669814
http-get	get
you can get the json of the autocomplete searching for the words obama using the following http-get query

1669825
internet-explorer	firefox
the browser is ie statement in the body works fine if i open firefox it s not there internet-explorer

1669837
getter	setter
have a data-class with code types and id properties and the appropriate public getter setter which is just a javabeans class which represents a single row of the table

1669846
communication	messages
the application on the worker computers would make a search request possibly by writing a messages to a ms messages-queue on the server and then wait for the response from the service again possibly via messages-queues but you have a numbers of different options here this communication

1669870
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
if you need to alter and save an image without losing any of the data you need to use a lossless format such as tiff png or bmp

1669870
tiff	png
i d go with compressed tiff since it s still lossless even though it s compressed or png

1669883
constructor	object	contains	set
if you passed your result set to the constructor of an object that contains your collections you would have much more control over the situation--you would also find that many other utility functions actually belong in that class

1669887
contains	set
checked your messagemap is set up correctly and definitely contains wm_create

1669899
db2-connect	ibm
the code is connecting via a systemd dsn setup via the ibm db2-connect components

1669909
trackpad	mouse
if you enumerate the list of devices you can attach for each device trackpad and mouse

1669927
python	perl
since most languages internally hash a string to an int still learning perl but this is how python works you could put runic glyphs from the writings of the high elves in there if you want and key creation would work fine

1669936
bazaar	git	perforce	bazaar	perforce	git
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

1669937
primitive	int
int is a primitive types not an object while string is considered more of a primitive object

1669940

i initially designed my site to show a login box at the top of the page if the user was not authentication how reddit.com works

1669963
updating	updates
if updating a fact in the database such as a street-address required more than one updates

1669980
authentication	impersonation
unfortunately i can t help you set up impersonation as we use sql authentication where i m at

1669984
average	median
use more robust statistical measures like median absolute deviation mad likewise you might want to test using the median instead of the average

1669985
directory	folder
but in case you no longer have connect with the svn server you might as well delete by hand all hidden folder from the copy-paste directory

1670011
32-bit	64bit
if you really want to try your luck with cpuid what i would recommend doing would be to create a simple stubs which is capable of execution cpuid and returning the results to managed-code you will need different versioning for 32-bit and 64bit and execute those within the context of your managed application

1670021
.net	wcf
enterprise .net community security your wcf service

1670023
selected	button
the user can double click on an item in the left list box or click a button .when an item is selected and it will move to the right list box

1670023
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
after the user selected which data they want by click on checkbox the user presses a button or some other event at which time you go directly to the underlying table of data and query only those rows that were checked

1670032
triggers	insert
that s not really an option with a regular identity-column but you could set up an insert triggers to auto-populate the userid though

1670032
triggers	insert
the naive way to do this would be to have the triggers selected the max userid from the users table for the customer id on the insert recording then add one to that

1670066
directory	folder
why don t you set the caching directory to something a little more windows-y like c temp and make sure that folder exists

1670074
arrays	loops
dumping the arrays collections to cfdump tells me that i have an arrays with items and a structure but i cannot understand how to loops through each and insert-into the db

1670101
arrays	map
you can map the value to an index of an arrays and lookup some information about that value very quickly

1670114
tuples	set
if you want to find the distance between all possible tuples between set 1 and set 2 i think you may be stuck with nested-loops resulting in o m n

1670141
instances	destroy
i thought the instances of my user-controls was removed and destroy once i called the clear methods

1670173
variables	boolean
in other words variables has not only to resolve to true but also has to be a boolean

1670177
nsmutablestring	nsstring
basically in the assignment you re assign an to a variables of types which is not necessarily safe note that nsmutablestring inherited nsstring not the other way around

1670185
children	nodes
these are hierarchical .so information attributes that is applied to i.e nodes of types site should propagate down to and be overridable by its children

1670194
perl	php
otherwise you ve always got perl php etc.

1670206
installation	environment
i am looking for free dbms options for a localhost environment which will support migrating data and database object stored-procedures table definitions to a db2 9.5 installation

1670309
put	get
if i put a where-clause on the query i simply get an empty list

1670320
memcached	apc
.when the application starts feeling sluggish if it generator enough revenue maybe i can get a dedicated-server if not there are always solutions such as apc memcached beanstalk etc

1670340
println	output
i can cut and paste the query output by println and it works fine yet in my program it returns no rows but throw no exception-handling

1670367
order	add
a little trick add up all the down-to-4 time and take away the up-to-5s - the order is not important

1670368
json	xml
as itowlson noted wcf doesn t talk java s proprietary binary protocols but there are still a lot of choices that can be used to talk to java xml json text rest

1670410
python	ruby
if that s all you re looking for i d recommend python or ruby

1670410
python	ruby
of the two ruby seems to have more meta-programming facilities but python seems to have more mature implementation on other platform

1670418
postgresql	mysql
i ve successfully converted a mysql database to postgresql with it --it should support sqlite

1670441
any	set
next if any of the 2 bits is set to 10 that is your answer

directory	folder
i am trying to hide files in a directory on a webserver by using random folder named

1670488
hide	show
for hide uinavugationconttoller i don t need to show to user navigation bar during the login.

1670524
any	set
this will take precedence over the globally set value and be returned to any code in your application that is performing localization

1670528
google-chrome	firefox
by default on winxp firefox google-chrome ie - the checked is green

1670543
put	get
it doesn t get rid of -i. but you can put relative paths in your #include directives

1670561
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	delay
.when the mouseenter a tooltip comes out .when the mouseleave it sets a delay for it to disappear

1670561
mouseenter	delay
if the mouseenter the same elements before the delay is triggerss then we destroy the triggers before it goes off using the data we stored before

1670567
controllers	routes
the problem is most likely that you have two routes to the ambiguous controllers named

1670569
soap-client	suds
using suds soap-client how do i specify web service url

1670580
android-emulator	adb
adb - interact with your device or android-emulator from the command-line

1670609
qmake	cmake
cmake is more generalised than qmake which is specialised for qt project

1670609
bjam	jam
jam and bjam are replacements for make different syntax

1670615
mouseover	mouseout
this way .when you change your selected class to unselected or vice-versa the live event will updates note hover is not supported with the current versioning of jquery .so you d have to use mouseover and mouseout

1670617
put	get
you could put the math into the where statement directly but it would get recomputed on each item .so i prefer to keep the starting timeout of the statement

1670620
google-chrome	safari
try this it works in ff3 and ie7 and i assume safari and google-chrome

1670631
printf	scanf
note that unlike c++ nemerle versioning of printf and scanf are safe

1670651
ironpython	ironruby
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby .so you may prefer to use that

1670651
ironpython	ironruby
i d strongly recommend going with either ironpython or ironruby over creating your own custom language.

1670661
silverlight	wpf
can we create a silverlight socket server only using silverlight and xml s no wcf wpf consol apps

1670676
constructor	object
the only other thing i could come up with was to pre-populate the menu object in the base viewmodel constructor

1670683
vxworks	qnx
get a real-time linux-distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements

1670690
content-length	content-type
say the response doesn t contains a content-length header and the content-type is not text html how would one terminate the while-loop

1670691
boolean	int
the primitive-typess are defined to be the same on all machines and in all implementation and are various sizes of two s-complement int single- and double-precision ieee 754 standards floating-point numbers a boolean types and a unicode character char types

1670698
put	get
i also agree with the suggestion to use a synchronizedd wrapper if you only need to synchronized the get put call and don t have any bigger synchronizedd blocks

1670699
associations	model
the model i m trying to test studentexam has associations to other model

1670758
databound	datalist
the reason i ask this question is that in case you are using the .databind methods of the datalist from the code for binding the datalist you will have to call it on every postback to make sure that the datalist gets databound again

1670773
put	get
i have even put a breakpoints on the getter in the dependancy properties and it does not get hit

1670780
constructor	private
what you could do is add a secret arguments to your private class s constructor which is only known by your main class

1670793
dependency-injection	singleton
wild guess but use a singleton for the main class and factory singleton with dependency-injection of the main class for all the subclassing

1670796
arrays	loops
you re adding the same object to your arrays every time through loops and overwriting it as you go

1670799
environment	building
i didn t find ant separately packaged .so i just selected the java building environment from help .software updates

1670799
directory	folder
i used this to copy required .libs into my .lib folder compile the flex sources using the ide building which has eclipse-integration with error messages which a pure ant-based command-line building would miss and copy the result to a common deploy directory renaming the wrapper html file in this process

1670801
configure	libtool
my guess is libtool and my guess is that after upgrading you re running make in your source dir or vcs checkout without rerunning autogen.sh or configure as appropriate

1670805
http	ssl
ssl through http then it ll request

1670811
subclassing	superclass
at runtime you can substitute a subclassing of superclass this is the liskov substitution principles

1670811
base-class	superclass
your base-class superclass should defined dosomething as abstract

1670811
base-class	inherited
your three classes that need the same implementation of dosomething should inherited it from an intermediate base-class which has that specific implementation

1670811
superclass	inherited
your two special classes should inherited directly from superclass and have their own implementation of dosomething

1670818
stderr	stdout
additionally you need to consume stdout and stderr concurrently inorder to avoid blocking and a possible process hang

1670847
instances	private
the view and controllers classes both hold the same instances of the model as private field

1670877
instances	private
for something like an immutable reference-class it makes sense that multiple class instances could receive the immutable reference-class and hold it as a private attributes

1670892
getter	setter
breakpoints in dependency-properties don t actually work - wpf bypasses the getter and setter once the binding is established

1670910
fflush	stdout
automatically fflush stdout without printing a newline

1670918
binary	hex
if you want to count the bits it would be simpler to set up an arrays that tells you how many bits are set in each hex digits indexed by character code and then add things up without explicit converting to binary

1670926
protected	public
this is generally be a good principles to start with as protected and public member variables should only be used .when you have a good rea.son to do .so

1670944

i m trying to upload a huge file from my nokia n95 mobile to my webserver using pys60 python code

1670944
webserver	upload
any idea how to upload huge files 120 mb to webserver using pys60

1670953
contains	elements	contains	set
if s is a finite set with n elements then the power set of s contains 2 n elements

1670966
decrement	increment
you might increment decrement your sleep delay more or less depending on how far away you are from ideal load

1670966
decrement	increment	increment	average
if you get the running average and your sleep increment decrement value right your program should self-tune to get to the right load

1670986
contains	any
contrary to what is often said an interop assembly doesn t contains any executable code and it doesn t do any marshalling

1671001
any	set
how can i change the precision of the assert to ignore milliseconds or any precision i would like it set to

1671008
value	field
i just tested this and mysql bit field come back as the raw binary value as expected

1671009
instances	private
the controllers cannot change the instances from the view because it it private

1671066
perl	php
maybe a simple perl or php scripting

1671067
base	zero
tinyurl s are generator by a base 36 hash 36 indicating the numbers of characters a-z and 0-9 the arrays of possible value out of which a tinyurl can be construct autoincremented by mysql with an initial value count of zero

1671124
executable	jar	scripting	shebang
thus if you use the cat cmd to put a shebang before the zip data in the jar file and make the file executable then you can call the jar file like you would call any ordinary shell scripting

1671126
shell	bash
i don t know about setting up vim but i ve used fcsh successfully as a terminal bash shell compiler for as3

1671138
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am working on linux mint ubuntu btw

1671141
fadeout	fadein
fadein operates on an existing elements s and animates the opacity of the elements just like fadeout

1671149
constructor	object
scala doesn t let you set constraints on the form of the object s constructor

1671157
push	pull
the opposite of ienumerable pull can be expressed as it s dual in iobservable push

1671166
32-bit	64bit
in general if you want to use a 32-bit com object on a 64bit machine you ll want to register the com object use the regsvr32 executable located in the windows syswow64 folder

1671177
attributes	properties
you could make a separate properties on your filenode class which returns relative paths and add the attributes to the original properties to prevent it from being serialization

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the versioning is different upgrade is send back to the utility other wise good

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the utility receives upgrade it send the users to a predetermined url to downloading the newest versioning of the utility

1671214
implements	extends
if you need to implements the iterator yourself it may help to extends abstractiterator in that same package

1671236
relational-database	rdbms	oodbms	rdbms
in general you re also getting into a conversation of using an object database oodbms versus a relational-database rdbms

1671265
contains	any
if you modify any of the following properties of a movieclip object that contains a motion tween flash player stops the playhead in that movieclip object alpha blendmode filtering height opaquebackground rotation scalex scaley scale9grid scrollrect transform visible width x or y

1671267
contains	elements
if you take the intersect of two lists as it looks like you re doing the result will be a single list that contains all of the elements that are in both of the lists

1671268
environment	building
if you re going to use scripting and css resources from multiple sources then how about a good old-fashioned building scripting in your building environment of choice

1671270
highlight	cell
i d like to be able to highlight the cell that contains the named of the person viewing the report

1671273
type-conversion	int
umm as mentioned above the code is a bit dense but i think you might have a bit of type-conversion problem between string and int is the last value always 0

1671293
google-maps	openlayers
this is my first time on stackoverflow and working with openlayers google-maps

1671302
groovy	java
i wrote most of it using groovy with jfreechart for charting and .when performance became an issue i rewrote the core parts in java

1671328
filtering	grouping
in ms sql we currently grouping sum filtering about 30gb of data in 4 minutes somewhere around 17 million recording i think

1671333
account	userid	contains	set
there is a globals set of variables that contains userid which is the domain account of the person execution the report

1671333
value	field
.so to automatically compare the value to the domain account you can assign this expression to the color properties of the field

1671341
required	checked
you would therefore need to simulate it yourself either at the form level or if required at the control level say with a dictionary of which controls are locked and manually checked it in the code you ve written for moving controls around

1671358
arrays	loops
then you can just loops through the arrays and for each id do the work you want to do

1671391
python	ruby
it is able to recording scripting in your choice of jython or jruby which are essentially python and ruby that give you access to java-api

1671391
subset	unique
for advanced testers you are able to identify which gui component you want to selected using not just their named but instead a a unique subset of their properties for example

1671396
pellet	jess
can someone explain the difference between a dl reasoner like pellet default owl reasoner and a rules engine like jess

1671417
push	pull
however one of the two will have to pull from origin before it can push

1671420
jprofiler	yourkit
you can downloading an evaluation license of jprofiler or yourkit

1671423
any	set
to avoid any possible issue about hibernate i suggest you to set disable-event-thread to true in zk.xml

1671425
any	set
also any other attributes of misc set in its __init__.py or peculiarly in tools.py will be available but then if the barenamed misc itself is available as it must be if compound named misc.tools is required then it s inevitable that it will have all attributess it building for itself or that get external built for it from other code that execute

1671447
contains	elements
there is a root elements in each feed which contains a bunch of information and the actual entries dictionary

1671470
json	xml
one of the benefits of asp.net-mvc i keep reading about is that it s easier than with traditional asp.net to create content-specific and or device-specific views straight html or json or xml or iphone-targed html etc

1671475
children	nodes
of course everything will work with the the childnodes collections properties always being of types abstractnode but i m trying to embed some logic into my classes in regards to what nodes should be the children of other nodes

1671480
pointers	stack
.so you ll need to figure out .some way to make that happen pass a pointers down through stack walk back the chaining of parentviewcontroller value keep a pointers at your application delegation etc.

1671483
combinations	permutation
you said java but please take a look on this permutation combinations and variations using c# generics

1671485
click	mouse

xcopy	cmd
.when i first noticed the problem i tried running xcopy in a regular cmd prompt and the same problem occurred

1671806
value	field
field id and date are in more serious violation - there will be many ids and dates within one grouping by set and you re not telling how to make a single value out of that set mysql pick a more-or-less random ones stricter sql engines might more helpfully give you an error

1671807
aggregate	grouping
in our specific case we could add the id in the selected and al.so add it in the grouping by list but in doing .so the groupinging upon which the aggregation takes place would be different the results list would include as many rows as we have id + gameid combinations the aggregate value for each of this row would be based on only the recording from the table where the id and the gameid have the corresponding value assuming id is the pk in table we d get a single row per aggregation making the max and such quite meaningless

silverlight	wpf
i really appreciate the question and answers we already have in â œ list of wpf functionalities that arenâ t in silverlight 3 .â my allegedly new question narrows down the difference between wpf and silverlight into the context of mvvm

1671837
silverlight	wpf
is there a summary of mvvm-centered difference between wpf and silverlight

1671837
silverlight	wpf
updates silverlight required that call to external resources be asynchronous whereas in wpf it can be synchronous or asynchronous

radio-button	button	base-class	inherited
i am trying to ports rewrite gui made using nucleus grafix to qt on linux.in nucleus code there is a control class which is the base-class for the rest of the controls like button editbox radio-button etc.this base-class uses nucleus api s and control struct to maximum.my question is whether to ports rewrite the base-class or make the control classes like button to inherited from qpushbutton.which is better

my question is this how would i go about retrieving the value in the quantity field at the selected row manipulating it and reinserting it into the table

1672066
thread-sleep	synchronized
another note - don t use thread-sleep for threads process synchronized

1672066
response	timeout
for client server-communication try to wait until server response to your request if such is defined in protocols not just timeout

1672082
fflush	stdio
you haven t ffflush the stdio buffering to the operating systemd and you haven t asked the operating systemd to fflush its bufferinging to physical storage

1672083
boolean	int
also why can t it be an int or boolean

1672087
macros	vba
creating a macros in vba isn t difficult and you can distribute it as an add-in to your users

1672088
attr	src
css3 attr eg src content attr src url

1672093
boolean	int
if you want to treat the string command-line parameters as int or boolean you are expected to do the conversion yourself

1672095
boolean	int
you could have designed it to take int or boolean but that would have added more work to the java runtime for potentially little benefit

1672095
boolean	int
strings can be used to transmit any sort of information into the main program including int and boolean

1672104
boolean	int
if you want to convert that text into int or boolean you have to do that yourself - how would the operating systemd or java bootstrapper know exactly how you wanted everything to be parsing

1672114
.when	ready
.when can i use - an interactive table that show .when features are and will be ready for public use

1672134
hide	show
at certain cases i want to show all three tab bar items and some cases i want to hide the 3rd tab bar item from the tabbar

1672142
put	get	mouseover	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
the same thing happens if i put the handler on document or document.body except that surprisingly document.body does not get mouseover mouseout events .when the mouseenter or leaves an empty part of the windows such as the empty vertical spaces created by absolutely positioning an elements with bottom 0

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
for that spaces document and windows will get mouseover mouseout events with the target being html but document.body will not.

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
also register a mouseover handler and detection cases where mouseout is not proceeded by or followed shortly by a a mouseover

1672148
updating	updates
.when i click the reject button it doesn t updates what code can i write in a stored procedure for not updating

1672155
qmake	cmake	scons	cmake	scons	qmake
i think the easiest way would be to use cmake qmake or scons to generator your xcode-project for you

i suggest you combine nunit and moq for object mocking

1672168
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms

device-driver	hardware
your program has unrestricted access to the graphics hardware you re writing a windows or linux device-driver or are execution in pure dos or your own kernel or

1672188
contains	elements
it does however allow you to use positioning absolute on child elements while keeping them contains within the parent by default and releasing it from the flow of the page thus preventing the push down effect

1672206
value	field
i need to bind with two field of datatable value

1672221
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the underlying reason is that .when you call xmlwriter.create with a stringbuilder it creates a new stringwriter instances which always has an encoding of utf-16 and creates an xmlwriter around that stringwriter

1672221
instances	private
looking in reflector it looks like the encoding of stringwriter is a private static variables .so all stringwriter instances will have the same encoding

1672242
contains	set
to contains at least the set of bits specified

1672247
reliability	scalability
i m thinking mainly about performance scalability reliability etc.

1672250
mouseover	mouseout
perhaps you can set a listener for mouseover and mouseout document body or some other elements that wrap the entire document and use that by saving that it happened as a triggers to determine whether it is a valid mouseout on windows

1672253
click	mouse
if you get to that points you may want to consider the middle click being three fingers on the mouse instead of two

1672253
click	mouse
i ve thought about this middle click issue with the magic mouse and i notice that i often leave my 2nd finger on the mouse even though i am only pressing for a left click

1672253
click	mouse
.so a 2 finger click might be mistaken for a single left click and it would al.so required the user more effort in always having to keep the 2nd finger off the mouse

1672258
specifications	w3c
your problem comes from mouseout events being generator for elements inside the windows which then bubble up as describe in the w3c events specifications

1672269
webserver	upload
this works great in development mode i set up url to serve static files under static but .when i upload to my webserver the images aren t rendering

to make a call to a service i extends basic result handler class and make custom functions to process results

1672315
kate	kde
the most recent versioning of kate kde s advanced text-editor come with a plugins called ctags that does exactly what you want

1672316
installation	building
during the installation of a web application the structure privileges are required to building the database however these are almost never needed during the web application s operation .so they can be turned off

1672320
double	int
store a subset of available types - limit the actually serialization data to a few data types such as int string double

1672320

1672333
webforms	asp.net
router with asp.net webforms scott allen

1672339
contains	set
anyway my question is how would i go about creating a .net executable that can contains a set of files which are extraction at runtime

1672364
response	timeout
by using ping the -n will determine the timeout only .when there is no response to the ping

1672372
javascript	dom
i thought i could be clever and load them as iframes hide the iframes and access their contents through the dom and javascript

1672382
user-controls	treeview
i ve inherited a vb6 project that has a form with vb controls labels etc and windows common-controls treeview imagelist etc which looks like an ideal candidate for a user-controls

1672399
.when	ready
using this model you can do all your development on a separate database then .when you are ready to â œreleaseâ you just put the new mde up onto the network shared and the next time the user opens the jumper the latest versioning is copy-paste down

1672400
textbox	button
i ve already solved part of the problem by overrides the loadviewstate methods of the web-controls but unfortunately this disables the viewstate specific for the control not for his children too textbox button etc.

1672403
codeigniter	kohana
kohana was initially a fork off codeigniter but it has become an excellent framework on its own

1672408
arp	tcp
investigation has show that this is associated with the arp caching being refreshed causing a resend of the tcp messages

1672417
required	checked
i think that the time you d have to spend on creating an install from scratch would be better invested in checked out the various existing systemd evaluation them as to which one provides best support for all the setup tasks required and then customizing it .so that the setup flow fits your needs

1672422
google-chrome	firefox
the major browsers that i ve tested apps on ie firefox and google-chrome all default to using the same collections of cookies regardless of whether you are opening a duplicates webpage in a new tab or a new browser instances

1672424
mouseleave	mouseout
on ie you could instead use mouseleave which is a non-bubbling versioning of mouseout

1672424
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
ie has events called mouseenter and mouseleave that are non-bubbling versioning of mouseover and mouseout

1672424
mouseleave	mouseenter
this makes it possible to implements mouseenter and mouseleave in other browsers

1672425
contains	set
edit if you want to find out if a part of the line contains a string from the set you have to loops over the set

1672446
google-chrome	firefox
if you the click back again here s where i get difirefoxering results in ie6 7 and firefox google-chrome ie8

1672446
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome ie8 this second back send me back in the state of the gwt .app which is what i want naturally

1672455
contains	any
you want to see if the line contains any of the words in the arrays

1672499
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
.so you have odbcconnection and odbcdatareader al.so sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

1672520
subclassing	inherited
i want to add two variables to my subclassing which is inherited from unittest.testcase

1672541
where-clause	sql
in old sql the where-clause could not

1672546
hide	show
you could take a screenshot of your current view save it in memory as a textures hide the old view and simultaneously show an opengl view

1672574
required	checked
you can t even checked if the memory would be available beforehand since you cannot know how much memory a 10kb jpeg-image would required it depends on the dimension of the image its color depth etc.

1672600
any	set
by the way is there any reason you re not using a setup methods to set these value

1672601
handler	service
there are menu manager service selection service event handling service administration service preferences service action and cmd handler service etc

1672611
data-annotations	xval
i have an asp.net-mvc project with xval and data-annotations and i need to switching to nhibernate validation

1672630
progress-bar	progress
you can also create the progress-bar in the ui-thread and use a custom messages for the working thread to modify the progress status

1672673
httpd.conf	.htaccess
after a lot of cursing i also found out that it depends on whether the rewriterules are inside a directory directive or .htaccess on the one hand or in your virtualhost directive or just in the main body of an httpd.conf on the other hand

1672675
tstringlist	tlist
as for structures look at tstrings tstringlist and tlist

1672675
delphi	basic
for other classes and functions look at delphi basic

1672696
silverlight	wpf
tools to develop wpf or silverlight applications

1672715
hide	show
hide the menu via css then show it in the javascript function that works with the menu

1672723
contains	elements
.when creating a mainwindow to contains data i inherited the header file into my custom class specified above .so i can make use of the elements created within qt-creator

1672740
selected	button
drupal s ubercart is a solution where you selected some product manually and then click add to cart button

1672740
attributes	properties
but here goal is a bit different i may have a custom javascript where user plays with catalog and attributes and selected product with properties in this windows

1672742
getter	setter
seems like it would be a good way to generalize a simple getter and setter

1672751
administration	account
i ve even used psexec.exe to run appcmd.exe on the box remotely which also works fine if the current security context has appropriate permission but as soon as you specify username passwd on psexec you get an error messages saying cannot read configuration file due to insufficient permissions. the user specified is a domain account and is part of the local administration grouping on the 2008 server

1672754
contains	set
i have a database contains tables with more than 600 million recording and a set of stored-procedures that make complex search operations on the database

1672765
boolean	int
you have two choices - either the boolean or the int variant

1672767

1672768
pascal	delphi
delphi pascal

1672790
google-chrome	firefox
nothing is wrong onabort and onerror are not supported in firefox and apparently in google-chrome too

1672792
handler	service
for the case of remote service i usually prefer to use callback instead of event handler since it leads to more readable maintainable code by just looking at the service call invokation code i know which code will be execute .when the call finishes

1672825
tuples	any
as you can see in the tuples they still are valid numbers not strings .so this should not pose any problem

1672840
difference	zero
the fastest way to compare the strings to find difference would be to xor each byte of them together then test for zero

1672855
asp.net-mvc	webforms
don t mix webforms with asp.net-mvc

1672866
selected	textbox
for example the background of a disabled textbox will be grey and the user is unable to set focus or edit or selected text in the textbox

1672883
click	mouse
a class needs to react to a given situation let s say a mouse click

1672883
click	mouse
since your code presumably knows what it wants to do .when you click the mouse

1672887
derived-class	base-class
your derived-class uses the base-class as a foundation

1672887
value	field
the field value is visible in the child class

1672891
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button	radio	click
always use labels for all form elements especially radio button and checkbox that makes it possible to click the text as well as the tiny button to selected the option

1672919
constructor	private
your child class will have an id field even if it cannot access it directly with child methods and since this field is private you cannot possible initializer it with the child constructor - .so a base-class constructor must be called

1672933
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
my software use both microsoft sql-server mysql and postgresql as backend

1672946
constructor	private
because that class only has hidden private internal constructor

1672948
duplicates	contains
second question if its a physical limitation in how many items the view can display does this mean that its impossible to checked for duplicates in a sharepoint-list that contains vast quantities of data

1672948
duplicates	contains
in the sense that to perform a wslist.getlistitems you have to pass a view if the list containss 100 000 recording and the view can only contains 2000 recording how is it possible to checked for duplicates

1672958
thickbox	jquery
i m using the jquery thickbox extension

1672972
arrays	loops
this is a common practice in asp to speed up the page load - rather than loopsing thru a recordset you get the data into an arrays close the recordset and loops the arrays to display the contents

1672973
lookup	any
if you have a combined key on object_id lang there shouldn t be any join just an o 1 lookup right

1672994
selected	button
as such we probably should provide a more explicit representation of this task in the user-interface than just selected a row in some grid and click the â deleteâ button and â œare you sure

1673007
command-line	cmd
you know how you can run cmd from the command-line in linux if you put a line on the top of your .rb file .so you don t have to types ruby myfile.rb all the time and can just do . myfile.rb

1673007
binaries	install
i use git-bash as my shell most of the time and have a lot of cygwin binaries install

1673013
properties-file	jar
in general it s straightforward - you can create a java.util.properties object with the default-constructor then get hold of an inputstream for your properties-file either using fstream if it s really on the filesystems or classloader.getresourceasstream if it s in a jar

1673018
selected	textbox
if user selected gallery2 and types 5 in the textbox

1673025
macros	vba
.so i was thinking about vba macros to move cell contents to words force parsing and then copy the result back to the originating cell

1673027
wait	hang
thus if the pipe clog and one request hang for a very very long time other request will wait at most a fixed amount of time .so the queue doesn t grow indefinitely until the clog goes away

1673029
contains	elements
data-wise a typical use case would contains 2..4 path segments anf 20 elements per segment

the part i like about it is that you can defined an enum within the scoping of a class which most of the macros based enums usually don t let you do

1674902
xsd	xml	csv	xml
i am trying to find a reusable way of taking a csv file and generator an xml file from it that conforms to a specified xsd

1674902
xsd	xml	csv	xml
my ideal solution would be a set of java classes that i can give a csv file to an xsd and get an xml file out of it

1674904
getter	setter
inside the datamodel you keep all the getter and setter of the dataobject as well as any remote service call you need to populate the dataobject

1674925
macros	vba
okay i ve got an outlook 2003 vba macros that clears a mail item s category and this is assign to a button

1674937
authentication	login
ideally i would be able to in my custom authentication methods state that after login the information collected from a ldap server should be written to the user instances and potentially the user .profile instances

1674938
macros	let
the part i like about it is that you can defined an enum within the scoping of a class which most of the macros based enums usually don t let you do

1674948
macros	vba
instead of retrieving the parameters from the solution perhaps using vba and the class envdte.dte.solution you could display a small form to selected the process and computer and use this input as parameters to your macros

1674954
abstract-class	subclassing
what is the correct way of providing a value in an abstract-class from a concrete subclassing

1674966
vbscript	vba
many nas product use embedded-linux .so running a vba or vbscript .solution directly on the nas may not work unless it is based on .something like embedded xp and you have access to scheduled-tasks etc

1675010
derived-class	base-class
i think the second idiom is better as it is more manageable if your base-class needs multiple properties defined in a derived-class the constructor can get messy

1675016
value	field
if value is only used in abstract-class i will declare it as a private field instead of a properties

1675017
variables	boolean
use semaphores and extra boolean done variables

1675018
constructor	object
if a constructor throw an exception-handling the object s destructor is not

1675021
contains	elements
i have four std vector containsers that all might or might not contains elements

1675023
selected	button
can i not just selected my properties and click a button

1675024
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think what you are after are ie s mouseenter event fires .when the user move the mouse pointers inside the boundaries of the object and mouseleave event fires .when the user move the mouse pointers outside the boundaries of the object

1675024
contains	elements
mouse pointers over elements contains

1675029
value	field
for example you might want to compute the value based on other field that the subclassing defined

1675033
constructor	object
basically if the constructor throw an exception-handling you re safe that the memory of the object itself is free again

1675035
environment	building
that said pgo sets some pretty tricky requirements on the building environment that are hard to satisfy for open-source project meant to be built by a distribute heterogeneous grouping of people

1675045
contains	elements
replace by elements contains in

1675051
stderr	stdout
now most people would react by trying python -h |less but that only works if you send the output of -h to the stdout instead of stderr

1675094
constructor	object
however any new statements or anything else that directly manages memory needs to be handled in a catch statement in the constructor otherwise the object is deleted without deleting it s subsequent allocation and you my friend have a leak

1675096
restructuredtext	asciidoc
a specifications should be written in a plain text-editor and utilize lightweight markup such as restructuredtext asciidoc etc

1675097
constructor	object
if the constructor throw the memory allocated for the object is auto-magically returned to the systemd

1675104
textbox	button
use a form with a textbox and two button ok cancel on it

1675112
implements	final
i want to implements a network fuzzer over a vnc-server as a final year project

1675118
constructor	object
consider a layer application where the data-layer has a certain class with all the data-access stuff in it and above that the business layer has a class which can take in the constructor a data object and has other overloads as well

1675128
bitwise-and	bitwise-xor
scheme has a function called bitwise-and ... which is equivalent to the operators in c there is also bitwise-xor ... bitwise-not .. etc. which do the expected thing

1675140
constructor	object
if an object cannot complete destructor because the constructor throw an exception-handling the first thing to happen this happens as part of the constructor s special handling is that all member variables to have been construct are destroy - if an exception-handling is throw in the initializer-list this means that only elements for which the initializer has completed are destroy

1675140
instances	destroy
for instances new std nothrow somethingthatthrows will allocate memory with operators new size_of_ob nothrow attempt to construct somethingthatthrows destroy any members that were successfully construct then call operators delete ptr_to_obj nothrow .when an exception-handling is propagated - it won t leak memory

1675140
pointers	stack
the best way around this is with smart pointers because as local object their destructor will be called during stack unwinding and their destructor will properly deallocate memory

1675153
digits	zero
what we do want is one or more characters that are digits forwarding slash and the asterisk means zero or more instances

1675154
static-methods	setter	static-methods	getter	getter	setter
i have a model class with getter and setter methods and the occasional static-methods

1675171
windows-mobile	symbian
i have an existing application created using qt for the symbian operating systemd and i want to ports it to windows-mobile devices

1675191
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
are there any suggestions out there for setting a default enter button that can work not just in ie but in firefox google-chrome safari and .so on

1675203
clang	icc
use __counter__ works on gcc4.8 clang 3.5 and intel icc v13 msvc 2015

1675204
abstract-factory	singleton
i have been looking at the following design-patterns factory abstract-factory singleton prototype and builder

1675228
instances	self
edit and mind you - classmethod-decorated methods receive the class as the first arguments while instances methods receive the reference to the instances of the class self

1675235
.net	wcf
i need a little help getting a php client to connect to a .net wcf webservice and return a usercontext

1675239
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	any	set	contains	elements	contains	any	contains	set
the simplest way to do it would be to take the powerset of an arrays a set contains every possible combinations of elementss of the arrays throw out any of the resulting sets if they don t have a common elements flatten the remaining sets and discard subset and duplicates

1675254
textbox	button
write one tis almost trivial creating the form and adding labels textbox and button and using the vb one is perputating something that was only put in to appease the baying mob

1675254
textbox	button
on the form make sure you set the flags for the ok and cancel button correctly and provide a properties ideally to allow you to read and write if necessary the textbox

1675260
any	set
any solution that involves removing from the set you re iterator while you re iterator it but not via the iterator will absolutely not work

1675304
javascript	dom
you need to use jsonp and this works only with get request that s because jquery inject a script-tag to the dom inorder to perform the request and a script-tag can only use get to fetch javascript

1675312
authentication	login
also make sure the user authentication item under custom settings is set to one of the automatic login options checked automatic login with current user named and passwd should make the browser automatically log into the site

1675318
required	checked
a numbers of field could be zero could be more than one depending on the page have things like unique codes which required checked with the server first

1675318
callback	methods
this isn t the same as a callback because the result-of the methods depends on the result-of the request

1675337
any	set
beware though that any .solution involving the use of set will probably reorder the elements in your list .so there s no guarantee that elements will be in any particular order

1675345
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.5 google-chrome 3.0 safari 4.0.4 opera 10.00

1675357
duplicates	contains	contains	set
as daniel states a set cannot contains duplicates entries - .so concatenation the lists

1675367
asp.net-mvc	webforms
whether you are using iis6 or iis7 and or asp.net-mvc or webforms shouldn t have any impact on the feasibility of using subsonic

1675378
value	field
but the last recording will have only two field two null value and hence unexpected eof

1675381
typedef	struct
instead you can typedef the struct

1675381
typedef	struct
you can combine struct definition and typedef s it in a single statement which declare an anonymous struct and typedef s it

1675383
jsonp	ajax
since fluiddb api does not support jsonp i am forced to use ajax and hence to develop a firefox extension to workaround ajax s same origin policy

1675383
postdata	request
that html file display a simple-form where the user could enter the username passwd and the other get postdata that forms a request

1675386
typedef	struct
if you use struct without typedef you ll always have to write

1675386
typedef	struct
if you use the typedef you don t need the struct prefix anymore

1675387
arguments	default
mathematica by default defined a lot of useful messages for signals common errors like functions being called with the wrong numbers of arguments or files not being found

1675391
contains	elements
therefore the list is held in a variables which contains a list of object .so .when you try to extraction an elements from the list you get a object .so you would have to cast it back to the required types in this case b

1675395
attributes	properties
for outgoing encoding from as to java you need to retrieve the alias classname you can do that by calling flash.utils.describetype and use reflection on your actionscript object s class to query attributes properties methods of the object

1675405
keyboard	mouse
switching to firebug console without moving a mouse using keyboard shortcuts maybe

1675419
value	field
if that is the case i would create a j.son arrays of field and value and send it all at once - .so you are only waiting for one response

1675429
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
normally what i d do is changed the ivalueconverter into an imultivalueconverter and bind a second value to numbers.count like this

1675430
contentcontrol	textblock
if you only have one child then your best bet would be to use contentcontrol and set the textblock as the content

1675446
typedef	struct
you can defined a function with the same named of the struct as the identifier are kept in different spaces but you cannot defined a function with the same named as a typedef as those identifier collider

1675455
sinatra	gem
for you to use sinatra for simple crud web-applications you need simply to load a gem

1675455
put	get
under sinatra you defined routes that obey to four main proposes get put .post and delete

1675460
spring	seam
- the new frameworks i said are the ones that have good test frameworks to use like ruby-on-rails spring seam with catalyst it is not easy to do tests besides the normals unit tests and also a lot of developers working to building applications to them the community around these frameworks are far more active

1675462
bison	yacc
you may also want to checkout bison yacc examples such as these or these

1675492
sqldatasource	radgrid
i have a radgrid bound to a sqldatasource that include a hidden readonly column that stores a pk

1675499

how would i make the size of my qdialog adjust automatically like a qmessagebox

1675514
scrollbar	widget
i would like to have a scrollbar which i have full control over myself and use it to control the contents of another widget in a way which isn t possible with the built-in scrollbar in the table widget for example

1675521
selected	button
additionally i wanted to put a button on that page .so that user click it and draw a rectangle on the state the systemd will just have to pop-up the latitude and longitude of the selected area and area .

1675524
xsd	xml	csv	xml
or if that doesn t work you could create another class that maps to your xml requirements generator it from the xsd you have and just simply defined a mapping between the two types mydatatype from your csv and myxmldatatype for your xml with something like automapper

1675527
typedef	struct
this gives you the convenience of the more concise typedef named but still allows you to use the full struct named if you need

1675529
hide	show
or instead of using 4 to 5 pages should i just use one page with multiple divs and show hide based on the user click

1675536
subclassing	superclass
i m having problems calling a methods in a subclassing which should overrides a methods in the superclass

1675565
google-chrome	firefox
you need to be using firefox with the google-chrome backend and you need to specifiy an absolute filepath

1675596
contains	any
it will find any tr that has a styles contains the string color #ff00ff exactly no spaces etc

1675615
selection	highlight
i would like to disable highlight in this box because by definition the value in this box are the selection

1675615
highlight	selected
i m talking about the usually blue highlight that the browser applies to selected line item s .when the user click on them

1675653
xsd	xml
you want to map that to an arbitrary hierarchical xml document based on the xsd

1675659
configuration	environment
i have seen people here on .so have issues with spring in terms of having a test environment on injecting test configuration and having to drop down to xml to get it done

1675668
contains	any
i need to create a provider named grouping which is based on any or all of three field that contains service provider codes

1675712
wordpress	blogs
this kind of setup is often seen with blogs wordpress blogger kickapps

1675713
nsmenuitem	nsmenu
the delegation should not be your nsmenu object your delegation should be an object that is invoked as a callback by the nsmenuitem to provide custom logic

1675714
base-class	inherited
it is very lightweight a single base-class that you can inherited from and does the bare minimum necessary to handle the repetitive tasks of web .app programming and otherwise stay out of your way

1675715
python	java
does anyone know of any open source python or java web-frameworks that you can use to customize caching a site that you could building and deploy on google appengine to act as a scalability provider for your web content

1675715
python	java
i d assume you d basically need a java or python framework that you could

1675728
restart	reload
i have reload the browser google-chrome using the extension development extension and restart the browser - but i see no new button

1675730
git-repo	repo
should one git-repo be created from svn then that repo is pushed publicly for team members to clone

1675730
git-clone	git-svn
i don t think that s necessary because git-svn clone works mostly the same as git-clone to begin with

1675737
value	field
the docs in github ajax.autocompleter page reference setting an id and using a javascript function to call the id value but this doesn t seem efficient if using multiple field need multiple value in addition to the ac value

1675751
authentication	login
maybe because the login process on my apps always involves redirecting them to another page immediately after authentication .so the dummy request.user never gets touch

1675774
any	set
you should use a java.sql.preparedstatement instead and then you can set any string that you want as a parameter and you won t have your problem

1675789
selenium-ide	selenium
if i decided i wanted to do this with selenium-ide i d look into using the user-extension.js mechanism to write a new selenium action that would use javascript to fetch the source of a page and then .post it to a url of my choosing

1675791
constructor	object
.so i tried pass the father object by constructor

1675800
attributes	properties
i know this is an obvious answer but any class properties or methods marked with the attributes would probably be the first to be removed

1675801
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseover	mousemove	mouseout	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	keyup	mouseout	mouseup
possible event value click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

1675801
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

1675802
environment	restart
to answer my own question it appears that the install required the systemd to be restart inorder to see the changes to the environment variables

1675807
directory	folder
create an application.cfc in the scheduletasks folder that extends the one in the apps directory like .so

1675813
.when	ready
i know there are other ways to solve this like have the other applications sleep for 10 seconds or have this tool send a messages .when it is ready etc.

1675848
firefox	safari
i ve tested your code in safari 4.0.3 and firefox 3.5.4 and all works fine i don t know in ie8

1675878
background-color	display	background-color	transparency
if the splash-screen is just an image and some of it is see-through and some of it isn t then you can set the transparency key on your form to a certain color then set the form s background-color equals to that and then whatever image you wish to display should be loaded into a picturebox

1675894
entity-framework	ado.net
i am unable to delete a recording from the the table using ado.net entity-framework

1675896
for-loop	loops
in your last for-loop you reset summat to at the start of loops .so at the end summat only contains a single value the one you most recently append on

1675925
put	get
and don t forget to close the registrykey object .when you are done with it or put the statement to get the value into a using block

1675928
datagridview	listview
datagridview or listview viewmode details

1675946
rollback	commit
that is until you commit or rollback

1675948
backgroundworker	winforms
edit also if this is taking place in a gui like winforms or wpf you may want to consider using backgroundworker

1675953
connection-pooling	pool
mysql is used in many large website and if you are using connection-pooling then connection time don t matter and for a very busy website a connection pool may be your best bet

1675964
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
inorder to be optimal you should use manualresetevent or autoresetevent .so that your thread is resumed as .soon as the dependent operation finishes

1675965
perl	php
to programmatically make a conversion from latin numerals to these entities would required the exertion of a backend language like php perl c# etc

1675965
decimal	hex
is the unicode character at code points 1634 decimal or 0662 hex which is the more standards notation

1675969
environment	building
have a look at building for different environment with maven 2 this guide show precisely how to achieve this

1675972
python	php	python	java
i mostly work with php but have been starting to learn python and probably need to learn java if that helps

1675976
any	set
you can set myvar before passing it in like any other variables it s initializer as null

1675980
sql-server	oracle
the problem is that what if i change the database server to ms sql-server or oracle later

1675988
contains	set	display	height	display	width
the pictures that are display are all the same set width and height the same width and height as the contains div

1675989
entity-framework	nhibernate
you can use the entity-framework or nhibernate too

1675991
processor	affinity
i would assume the threading classes would be implements now or later with more robust threading code to handle maybe thread affinity on multi core processor

1675992
qpushbutton	qgroupbox
.so far i am using stylesheets but can only figure out how to assign a background-color to a widget such as qgroupbox or qpushbutton

1675999
selected	button
.when the user click the add new button selected and cloen the contents of your hidden templates and write that into your target div

1676000
perl	ruby
similar to perl ruby scheme and

1676004
jquery-dialog	jquery
.when creating a jquery-dialog windows jquery insert a ui-widget-overlay class

1676018
background-image	background-color
if however i only change the background-color attributes and set the background-image to none the change seems to work just fine meaning the background-image disappears as before and i can see the new background-color

1676019
http-get	get
the behavior i found strange is i m trying to get page via http-get methods and getting response about 404 http-error

1676024
sql-server	oracle
your overall strategy is to isolate the points where you use the mysql-specific classes to as few places as possible ideally it would only be in factory methods which can later be expanded to utilize oracle sql-server or another rdbms

1676030
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
out of curiosity why manualresetevent and not autoresetevent

1676030
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if it s i need to wait until the other thread finishes for reasons other than resource access then use an autoresetevent or manualresetevent

1676039
sql-server	oracle
if you need to later use a different connector ms sql-server or oracle you will just have to implements the interface for the different connector

1676061
internet-explorer	firefox
for example there are difference between upload from firefox as opposed to internet-explorer

1676066
system.data	.net
the classes in the mysql .net connector api implements the platform-agnostic interfaces defined in the system.data namespace idbconnection idbcommand etc.

1676079
subclassing	base-class
note that neither option truly adds properties to the base-class - you can t change the base-class structure in a subclassing

1676082
network-analysis	networkx
i don t know what exactly you want to achieve but .when it comes to network-analysis in python take a look at networkx

1676084
reflection	runtime
i am loading some assemblies at runtime and invoking methods on them using reflection methodinfo.invoke

1676093
colorbox	jquery
i am utilizing the colorbox jquery plugins

1676093
contains	elements
my intention is to only add a listener for the cbox_closed event on a elements who have an id that contains remove

1676096
xsd	xml
for example if i make my own grammars it can be xml xsd or any types of grammar after compiling it it produces to java and .net c# language files

1676102
paster	pylons
you could use nginx load balancer to proxy to pythonpaste paster which serves wsgi for example pylons that launchd each request as separate thread anyway

1676135
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
i have dabbled with various ajax frameworks namely gwt dojo extjs jquery user-interface

1676162
svnadmin	dump
edit your messages is due to the fact you have created the destination repository with the newer versioning of the server then tried to load the dump with the older versioning of svnadmin

1676162
svnadmin	dump
i don t understand the svnadmin load part have you created a dump file before with svnadmin dump

1676182
required	checked
if only some actions required it perhaps an action-filter that checked to make sure that a claim is available before execution the methods and if not sets the proper view

1676193
macros	vba
you may also write a vba macros not sure if that s what you re after though.

1676197
crossover	mutation
although there is some tendency to use crossover rate on level 0.7-0.9 and mutation on 0.1-0.3 it really depends

1676211
xcopy	cmd
this can only be one of two things a problem with the path as seen from within your batch-file or a typo in the cmd being run eg. xcopy

1676233
attributes	properties
the styles properties only reflects the contents of an elements s inline attributes not any styless applied indirectly via stylessheet rules

1676242
selection-sort	bubble-sort
i just tried my hand at writing a functional bubble-sort as a slightly simpler and degenerate case of selection-sort

1676248
arrays	loops
.so later .when you re calling row 0 row 1 etc you re not actually getting an arrays out of it unless the last result i is in fact an arrays and if that s the case loops would be unnecessary

1676264
value	field
it lets you provide a value without adding an actual field to the class if the value is constants or can be calculated at runtime

1676271
subtraction	addition
i am guessing that pixels intensities get clipped in the upper or lower bounds .when addition subtraction takes place

1676271
subtraction	addition
how can i overcome the addition subtraction problem or the speed problem with the above

1676273
arrays	loops
that way the methods will return an arrays of data and leave it up to your to loops over it and printing it out

1676284
compact-framework	.net
1 generics are supported in .net compact-framework 2.0 but i m not sure about typed dataset

1676284
compact-framework	.net	generic-list	dataset
i can tell you that untyped dataset are not recommended on the .net compact-framework for performance reasons they re terrible slow to process and take up a lot of memory in comparison to other methods such as a generic-list

1676297
double	int
error cannot convert double to const void for arguments 2 to ssize_t write int const void size_t

1676328
arguments	default
if you do want to try to use arrays though you could try with the keyword arguments it is true by default

1676329
administration	account
2 make a new local user account and assign to the administration grouping i ll call him iis_helper for this example

1676329
runas	cmd
5 open a cmd terminal and use the runas cmd to execute whatever it is that needs to be run escalated

1676329
runas	cmd
8 configure whatever service is running cruisecontrol.net in my case to execute the runas cmd instead of appcmd.exe directly the same as before

1676329
administration	account
it does attempt to run as the administration account however it still runs as a non-escalated process under the administration user .so still no admin permissions

1676329
runas	cmd
i didn t initially catch the failure because the runas cmd spawn a separate cmd windows then closes right away .so i wasn t seeing the failure output

1676332
hash	md5
using sqlite i need a table to hold a blob to store a md5 hash and a 4byte int

1676340
stderr	stdout
read data from stdout and stderr until eof is reached

1676360
environment	building
i added this well documented macros to mymacross environment events in vs 2008 macross inorder to cancel failed building

1676376
contains	elements
it won t do anything unless summat contains at least 3 elements

1676377
constructor	object
this is from the time of c#1 but now there are object constructor

1676418
uipagecontrol	uiview
basically the page control works fine everything is hooked up and works normally on all account except with certain placements of the uipagecontrol within the uiview the uipagecontrol will cease to rendering

1676450
arrays	loops
.so what i do is i create a prioritized depth stack arrays in my document class to which i add everything i want on top all the time no matter what and anytime i do any flagrant stage work such as switching out a major display object i just use a methods called rundepthstack which loops through the arrays and re-adds everything in the arrays

1676453
value	field
if you are currently using ids in hidden field try using session to store those value

1676477
contains	set
for example it can contains some numbers of fixed length bits string of characters no fixed length and maybe some set of pairs of conjugate complex-numberss

1676492
google-chrome	firefox
everything is fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 6 7 the sifr title do not appear in any divs apart from the first in the cycle

1676492

groovy	java
and because http and soap are standards this doesn t apply to the swing ui-testing tools of course these tools are not really java specific even if the tests themselves are written in java groovy for soapui

1676516
httphandler	httpmodule	httphandler	httpcontext	httpcontext	httpmodule
well for starters page.response implies that you have a current valid page object httpcontext is static and can be called at any time - like in your global-asax or and httpmodule httphandler

freebsd	bsd	freebsd	linux	linux	bsd
in your case if you re sure your .bashrc is going to be used only on gnu linux and on a bsd systemd you can checked for switchinges that exist in one of the ls but not in the other for example -d doesn t seem to be an accepted switching by ls on my bsd machines freebsd and mac os x whereas it is for gnu ls

1676530
linux	bsd
conversely -p is accepted on bsd but not on gnu linux

there s no ajax call .when the pages changes - i just show hide some divs

1676541
php-extension	xdebug
you need a to have a php-extension such as xdebug setup on your server to do remote-debugging of the manner you describe and have an application or ide that supports it

1676549
datagridview	listview
the listview is deficient in that it doesn t offer a .datasource properties like many other object containers such as the combobox listbox and datagridview

1676549
datagridview	listview
i chose to drop the listview in favor of a datagridview simply because i the requiredments didn t required a listview i added a custom first column to the datagridview to rendering an image which is why i originally chose the listview

1676549
datagridview	listview
figure out if you really required a listview by considering if you can use a datagridview instead and meet the requiredments

1676559
datagridview	listview
however you might want to trade off your listview for a readonly datagridview if you can afford to

1676563
buffering	streaming
i checked into it and what s actually happening is that the call to close made its way through the wcf plumbing until it reached system.servicemodel.channels.drainonclosestreaming.close which according to reflector allocates a buffering and keeps reading from the streaming until it s at eof

1676587
nsmenuitem	nsmenu	nspopupbutton	nsmenuitem	nspopupbutton	nsmenu
nsmenu nsmenuitem don t have a concept of selected item like nspopupbutton for instances

1676587
updating	updates
since the menu items only need to be updates .when they re show which this mechanism does for you you don t have to worry about updating the menu items yourself .when -tasksortmethod changes elsewhere

1676622
any	set
normally .when automatic is set ie will ignore any fresh caching content if the resource has never been fetched in the current session

1676631
linux	unix
to address your current situation you might consider using a tool such as devpartner for windows or valgrind for linux unix both of which i ve found to be very effective for tracking down memory-leaks as well as other issues such as performance bottlenecks

1676641
directory	folder
you can copy the exe over yourself go to the bin folder in the directory your source code is in and copy it there

1676666
scalatest	junit
you can use specifications scalatest and junit and any other java test framework theres some examples on the new wiki

1676749
xsl-fo	xslt
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source

1676757
json	xml
it s cleaner since it allows flexibility .when you will inevitably need to open up an action for a javascript json or xml call

1676781
data-members	constructor
3 assuming class b has only the two data-members show does it need a default constructor include explicit

1676794

by comparison oracle and microsoft sql-server have no-cost licenses for a 4-gb database

1676916
subtract	add
.so i would already know what the numbers were for a year a given month a given week and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range i use the various scale to quickly add up .something that gives the right results but i don t have to necessarily reprocess the full dataset i just retrieve four or five recording and add or subtract them

1676920
touch	drag
i want the user to be able to touch drag on the screens inside or outside of the large circle and it will move the smaller circle in that directions

1676931
any	set
as a result you should never do any kind of calculation with any datetime instances that is not set to datetimemode.utc

1676931
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems stores time as local time which means that it s just completely screwed

1676935
aggregate	grouping
to order a query by an aggregate value you need to use a grouping by query

1676937
csv	xml
i ve built programs that use csv and xml and and support schema validation but in these programs the schema is an output

1676937
csv	xml
then i can use that metadata to control xml production from csv input and i can also use it to produce a schema that the xml my program produces will conform to

1676963
backwards-compatibility	legacy
i m guessing this is legacy code or code trying to preserve backwards-compatibility with php 4

1676966
interpolation	splines
the converse would apply at higher levels of zoom - to the points where you would need to use interpolation like linear polynomials splines etc on the data to estimate at the value between your data pointss

1676969
revision	updates
once that s done updates your revision file with the new new revision numbers for the ssis subdirectories

1676970
javascript	dom
4 tiny mc javascript may be having issues with dom structure which in turn can be caused by doctype html structure

1677011
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
i have a libs of linked-list binary-tree methods for use .when standards containers don t fit - .when there are different types of nodes or .when i need to convert from binary-tree to list and back again

1677059
bullet	ogre3d
i m currently evaluation the bullet physics libs for a 3d spaces game i m writing using c++ and ogre3d

1677059
bullet	ogre3d
i ve gotten ogre3d and bullet integrated nicely by deriving from btmotionstate and plugging in my scenenodes but now i m having a lot of trouble calculating what value i should pass to btrigidbody applycentralimpulse and btrigidbody applytorqueimpulse methods inorder to achieve the results i m looking for

1677059
bullet	ogre
i can achieve this perfectly in ogre using .some quaternion mathematics and applying the translation rotation directly on the scenenode but i really want to apply these value in the bullet engine using the force torque methods .so it will continue to move pitch roll even after the user stops pressing key and .so friction will act on the object to slow it down as necessary

1677092
directory	folder
your webserver should be setup with a virtual directory pointss to the published folder and it would be a good idea to have a default.aspx page in the folder since the webserver looks for this page as it s starting points

1677095
identity-column	sql-server
pointed out - in replication scenarios mostly then ok but make sure to use a int identity-column as your clustering key in sql-server to minimize index fragmentation and thus performance losses

1677109
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate entity-framework activerecord or linq2sql

1677129

1677143
checkbox	button
you can add image and even controls like button and checkbox to tricheditwb

1677170
arrays	loops
do foreach loops on this arrays to get seeked elements

1677186
double	int
actually i see you using a function outvalue.aslong which i would expect to return a long value which is an int instead of a double value which is floating-point and it ll be more convenient to deal with an int in this case

1677186
put	get
we get the value into long_value and then use the printf function to put the value into string_value

1677186
value	field
in the format string the means it s going to describe a field the 0 means to zero-fill the result the 4 means to use at least four characters and the ld means you re passing in a long value

1677203
static-code-analysis	dead-code
i find myself dubious -- what the effectivity of static-code-analysis for dead-code .when you are running against a systemd with a lot of abstractions

1677203
spring	jsf
for example we use spring s dependency-injection as well as jsf

1677208
configuration	environment
jndi allows apps to reference enterprise resources databases javax.mail sessions jcr repositories etc. by named and then the named is mapped to a specific configuration according to the environment dev test prod

1677208
configuration	environment
i m assuming that in .net there are some comparable strategies for decoupling a configuration and by extension the contains package from its environment

1677230
attributes	properties
annoyingly enough setting the cssclass properties of an asp.net checkbox control rendering html like .so instead of just adding the class attributes to the input tag

1677232
bufferedwriter	writer
you should use a bufferedwriter to optimize the writes always write character data using a writer instead of an outputstream

1677232
bufferedwriter	stringbuilder
since you re ultimately writing to a file a better approach would be to write to the bufferedwriter more often instead of creating a huge stringbuilder in-memory and writing everything at the end depending on your use-case you might even be able to eliminate the stringbuilder entirely

1677239
defined	declare
for instances one field was defined as a char 12 in the database but the parameter it was comparing against was declare as nvarchar 12

1677263
thread-dump	jvisualvm
some other alternatives may be to set the process up for remote monitor and use jvisualvm from the server itself or another machine to connect over a ports and do a thread-dump

1677266
tuples	set
a graphing is a set of vertices v and a set of edges e where each elements in e is a tuples and v1 and v2 are in v

1677266
tuples	set
if the language has a native tuples types it would a set of those

1677276
trackpad	mouse
how does what is happening in multitouchsupport.framework differ between the magic mouse and a glass trackpad

1677276
trackpad	mouse
if it is based on iokit device properties i suspect you will need a kext that emulates a trackpad but actually communication with the mouse

1677285
adventureworks	northwind
how about microsoft s northwind or adventureworks sample databases

1677290
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	arguments	default
the it s needed for backwards-compatibility arguments makes zero sense to me - sure make that behavior the default for old .apps but provide an option for me to turn on unicode strings by default i.e no n prefix required. i m discovering that i need to go and mess with large areas of my .app to adapt to unicode on sql-server .when this is not an issue in oracle and postgresql

1677291
bufferedwriter	stringbuilder
if possible use bufferedwriter from the beginning on instead of stringbuilder to save memory

1677306
google-chrome	firefox
if the extension is registered try opening google-chrome backtosearch content backtosearch.xul in firefox by copying that to the location bar -- if any errors appear you should fix them

dialog	pop-up
can someone show simple swing code web resource that will positioning the pop-up dialog center-aligned on top of an existing jframe windows .when the jframe s button click

1677335
order	join
i need to split any mysql selected statement in its main parts selected from all the join if there are any where if it exists grouping by if it exists having if it exists order by if it exists limit if it exists .

1677340
linked-list	nodes
also i was wondering in java in the linked-list recursion why you can use static void in printing or search for the nodes

1677361
linked-list	tree	linked-list	arrays
even .when virtual-memory isn t an issue cache-friendliness often is and b+ tree are particularly good for sequential access - the same asymptotic performance as a linked-list but with cache-friendliness close to a simple arrays

1677361
linked-list	nodes
i have a containers libs that does cur.sor maintenance - cur.sor attach themselves to the leaf nodes they currently reference in a linked-list .so they can be fixed or invalidated automatically

1677361
binary-tree	nodes
i guess you can stripes off or recreate the non-leaf nodes depending on whether you need them or not but with binary-tree nodes you get a lot more flexibility

1677361
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
a binary-tree can be converted to a linked-list and back without copying nodes - you just change the pointers then remember that you re treating it as a different data structure now

1677361
binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	nodes
in a binary-tree this can be separated out from the algorithms - the user can create a nodes then call the insert algorithm and deletes can extraction nodess detach them from the tree but dont free the memory

1677363
value	field
if the url begins with new it rewrite the url to new.php placing the old url as the value for the title field

1677411
web-config	app-config
go look for reference material on app-config and web-config

1677412
expression	evaluation
the reason is variables is un-bound at the time of evaluation of the expression and thus will be assign to foo bar

1677418
python	perl	vbscript	perl	vbscript	autoit
note i can set the field just fine without the form being submitted using perl vbscript python autoit etc

1677421
dialog	pop-up
what kind of pop-up dialog are you talking about

1677457
order	add
the reason you may be getting different results is because while stack may grow down to add object to it the arrays is a single object and it may have ascending arrays elements in the opposite order

1677464
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately not cross-browser i did test this in firefox ie and google-chrome

1677482
pointers	stack
which way does stack grow .when a new frame is allocated -- if function f call function g will f s frame pointers be greater or less than g s frame pointers

mobile-safari	safari
mobile-safari on the iphone allows you to specify different keyboard types for text inputbox as demonstrated in the safari how-to s for iphone here

1677538
conditional	operators
my problem is that i want to join these 6 conditionalal together with or operators making each conditional a possibility

1677543
versioning	upgrade
but there may be downsides such as having to stick with the versioning of castle that nhibernate is compiled against rather than being able to upgrade the inversion-of-control containers .when i choose

1677553
shipping	tax
else a diversified approach could potentially reduce shipping bank or even tax overheads

1677567
variables	boolean
you can use a boolean global variables as exit flag in loginform

1677579
firefox	safari
edit strike that it works both ways in my test case under safari 4.0.3 and firefox 3.5

1677581
aggregate	grouping
grouping by is always tricky in criterion hql because a grouping by clause can only return the groupinging column and aggregate of any other column

1677581
aggregate	grouping
therefore it is impossible to return a whole entity from a grouping by clause only the id that you are groupinging by and aggregate

1677591
jquery	.post
if you re using .post from jquery you should use _post folder to access your variables

in c++ a member function could just access these parameters but i m having a hard time figuring out how to do this in haskell with recording or types classes or whatever

1677647
bufferedwriter	writer
as pointed out by others use a writer and use a bufferedwriter but then don t call writer.write stringbuilder.tostring

1677671
instances	self
in a nutshell a descriptor is an object which has a methods __get__ which takes three arguments self an instances and an instances types

1677672
dictionary	arrays
this dictionary can be implements using pspell aspell as dominic mentioned or you can have your own arrays as a dictionary

1677672
dictionary	arrays
if you have an arrays as dictionary you can use the levenshtein algorithm that is available as a function in php to calculate the distance between two wordss your words and the reference one

1677676
abstract-class	subclassing
the state and the transitions both are subclassing from their corresponding abstract-class

1677692
udp	tcp
lccs sounds like a fuller solution for offering p2p gaming as well as standards client-server udp or tcp based gaming

1677692
udp	tcp
it attempts p2p udp if that fails it can fallback to client dedicated-server tcp or udp communication

1677753
rollback	commit
that is start the transactional at the start of handling the request and commit or rollback as you finish handling the request

1677764
credentials	account	administration	credentials	administration	account
generally it s better to ask the user for the credentials .so that each account can be enabled or disabled by the administration

1677768
memcmp	strcmp
the main difference difference between memcmp and strcmp are

1677768
memcmp	strcmp
memcmp often runs just a little bit faster than strcmp

1677769
triggers	insert
of course if you choose to create an additional column based on existing id column you need to keep those 2 synchronized.you can do that in batch-file as a single updates or in an on-updates triggers or add that column to the appropriate insert and updates statements in your code

1677772
.when	ready
i would say the best thing to do is to just have your arrays as a public properties and dispatcher an event .when the data is ready

1677789
put	get
you can t get them to work for the end even if you put the end on top but you do have control on the last line and you haven t done anything else to it

1677793
margins	padding
i removed everything until i was sure that no padding margins border is involved in the flawed display

1677800
contains	elements
i m using tinyxml .so if imagine each class can be passed the xml streaming an arrays contains the xml data actually and then i d al.so pass the root elements for that object images fractals traversal .so it knows what it should be reading

1677848
selected	button	click	mouse
i find drag-and-drop difficult you know keeping the mouse button depressed while moving and want to offer a selected and drop where a user click on an icons and click again on the drawing-plate to drop the corresponding elements a picture

1677848
click	mouse
.when the mouseenter the drawing plate i want a 50 opacity of the bigger image follow the mouse pointers .so that the user knows by click where it is going to be dropped and if it overlap with anything already on the drawing board

1677864
postgresql	mysql
like mysql postgresql 8.0 and earlier states in their docs on indexes

1677890
any	set
can be used to set any variables or functions that are used while

1677921
derived-class	base-class
as long as you calculate and apply it relative to a pointers to the class that actually defined the field that is don t try to work out the offset of a base-class field from a derived-class pointers you ll almost certainly be fine

1677930
authentication	login
reissue a session cookies if someone arrives at a login page with a sid already associated with an authentication session

is there any way to set future time for the postings publishing dates correctly on the production server

1677983
web-config	app-config
it should add a path in the web-config or app-config settings file depending on your project types similiar to the following

1677992
smarty	twig
i recently discovered the php framework kohana which is awesome and was reading a thread about using it in conjunction with a templating-engine such as smarty or twig

1678040
unsigned	zero
an unsigned types will not become sign-extended they get zero extended the new bits will always be zero

1678040
negative-number	zero
a negative-number has those bits nonzero and positive numbers have all zero for phantom bits .when you promote a smaller value to a larger one those phantom bits become real bits

1678044
ethernet	packets
.so i m coding .some packets structures ethernet ip etc and noticed that .some of them are followed by attributes packed which prevents the gcc compiler from attempting to add padding to them

1678057
protected	public
creator must be public not protected

1678064
vb.net	vb6
exact duplicates best strategy for moving applications from vb6 to vb.net

1678064
vb.net	vb6
can any one please tell the tool which converts vb6 to vb.net

1678080
parentheses	macros
the extra parentheses mean there is only one arguments passed to the macros instead of one or more regardless of how many attributes you specify and your compiler does not need to support variadic-macross

1678100
vb.net	vb6
.when you open a .vbp vb6 project it asks if you would like to automatically convert it to vb.net

1678101
json	xml
even with the responseformat attributes added the response is still being returned as xml rather than json

1678109
contact	submit
this would allow you to .post as you wish and then redirect to contact submit a b c d

1678125
python	java
however it looks like there s nothing stopping you from using the python tool to just populate the datastore and then accessing that data as normals through your java code although this assumes you re comfortable with python which could be the problem

1678139
subtract	time	subtract	add
.when i want to display the date time to the user view do i simply just add subtract the offset

1678145
http-get	get
the get methods uses standards query-string arguments to pass form-data via an http-get request

1678146
core-animation	quartz-core
quartz lets you do static 2-d vector drawing but this is different from the quartz-core framework which you import into a project if you wish to use core-animation

1678158
user-controls	ascx
creating a pagemethods scriptmethod within an ascx user-controls using ajax json base classes and reflection

don t just add subtract the offset use the c# datetime functions to convert between utc and local time

1678167
textarea	textbox
notice the textbox and textarea has the ids of title and body

1678189
numeric	digits
xpath is different the representations for all the numeric types are fundamentally the same - a string of ascii digits

1678222
value	field
the idea behind this is that two object are equals if all of their field have equals value

1678222
value	field
if all of field have equals value the two object should have the same hash value

1678235
mockito	junit
you can start with junit and you can use mocking framework like mockito to mock parts of your code that involves using frameworks

1678238
javascript	dom
can it be used as a dom selector using .some javascript libs i am thinking .so since the id attributes has to be unique this could be used to identify multiple re.sources on a page

1678256
put	get
containers like hashset rely on the hash-function to determine where to put it and where to get it from .when asked for it

1678256
put	get
if you put a in with value v and lookup b you should expect to get v back since you ve said a.equals b

1678259
contains	set
highlightclassname would set the background-color to .something .so you can see which divs contains the search string

1678268
dictionary	arrays
.so yes you can have arrays lists dictionary - whatever you want contains button

1678275
contains	set
insert a and a hashset will return false for contains b but a list created from that set will return true because the list doesn t use hashcode

1678302
enterprise	platform
it seems you re comparing a web development framework ruby-on-rails with a enterprise development and deployment platform j2ee and a language-implementation jruby

1678313
pointers	stack
because of the way the c language works it s going to pick up some random garbage pointers from stack and try to treat it like an nsstring

1678313
printf	scanf
you should always use a format string with data you explicit control as the first arguments to functions that take format strings printf scanf nslog - nsstring stringwithformat ...

1678341
contains	any
nsstrings can contains nulls though you may have difficulty printing them and any characters following

1678343
conditional	operators
these are simply supposed to be expression that replace the entire operators phrase once the conditional is evaluated

1678347
punctuation	words
i am reading a text file which contains a words with a punctuation mark on it and i would like to read this words into a string without the punctuation marks

1678359
any	set
is there any easy way to set the contents of a webview to an html string without having to load a file

1678361
gwt	dwr
you can building this mechanism by your own or use some existing ajax framework like gwt dwr even zk to accomplish it

1678386
pointers	stack
there would be no concept of pointers which i see as a primes motivation for building such a processor as it would be impossible to smash stack

mbunit	nunit
i am looking at moving from nunit to mbunit for my unit-testing framework as it has a couple of features that i like one of them being the parallelizable attributes

1680343
mbunit	nunit
reason for asking the first question is that i have as a test simply swapped the nunit framework for th mbunit framework and in a particular test class sets of tests tend to fail .when run in parallels and pass .when run sequentially

1680395

1680479
show	next
it seems as if you are trying to get the next testimonial list to show .when infact you are actually getting the next which has a class of .testimonial which i suspect is incorrect as you are using .testid as the class for your list items

1680491

1680526
url-encoding	url
to get unprintable bytes into the url use url-encoding

1680545
instances	self
inorder to have properties scoping at the instances level you need to initializer them through referencing with the self parameter in the __init__ methods or elsewhere depending on the situation

1680550
linux	unix
but here s a great trick for you - if you create a temporary file in unix linux mac os x you can delete it immediately and you can still write to it read it etc but as soon as you close it it will go away

1680554
directory	folder
creating a branches task version1.0 directory create folder on task

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
i have defined a custom iprincipal and custom iidentity based on a website that defined both valid identities and their permissions

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
the question is .when using the declarative principalpermission attributes on top of my assembly classes how to enforce that my custom iprincipal and iidentity classes are in use and not some other iprincipal iidentity that might be authentication

1680581
constructor	object
yes you must declare in the constructor if you want that the list becomes an object properties and not a class properties

1680618
constructor	object	initializer	setter
i cant do this in the constructor because hibernate will use setter to initializer the object

1680625
firefox	safari
a click event on a disabled form field does not fire events in firefox and safari

1680625
mousedown	mouseup
opera fires the mousedown and mouseup events but not the click event

1680625
mousedown	mouseup
ie fires mousedown and mouseup but not click on the form

1680633
mongodb	mysql
we decided to use mongodb for some web application instead of mysql but want to stay with sphinx for indexing searching all data stored in mongodb

1680633
32-bit	64bit
32-bit or 64bit depending on building time settings

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
security-aware code is split into two parts the identifying party ip which authentication users and generator iidentity and iprincipal object and the relying party rp which makes use of them

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
that way you ensure that you only ever generator your custom iidentity and iprincipal object

1680635
32-bit	64bit
even things like 64bit long-long arithmetic on 32-bit platform might not be linked correctly because of the conflicting runtime libs

1680641
protected	public
iâ m trying to test if a protected methods is called in a public interface

1680645
32-bit	64bit
data size issues eg one compiler uses 32-bit int the other 64bit

1680683
dictionary	arrays
you ve cut out a bit too much information but it looks like the arrays actually a dictionary is always the same - there s a single instances that is created .when the module is first import and will be used by every items object

1680686
groovy	java
yes it is possible to use groovy ast transformation with java code

1680686
groovy	java
groovy compiles down to java bytecode and building on the java libs

1680686
groovy	java
here is an example of a mixed java groovy application

1680742
cosine	sine	spectrum	sine
try creating both a sine and cosine at the same frequency as these should have the same magnitude in the spectrum but have different phases ie the realvalue imagvalue will differ but the sum of squares should be the same

1680758
any	set
for glassfish though i believe this article will help you set up a sam serve auth module that can handle the authentication in any way you need

1680769

hi i want to upgrade the versioning of compact-framework in my htc touch phone

1680934
versioning	upgrade
but .when i try to run the application it just show the messages to quit the application and upgrade the framework versioning

1680937
value	field
if the field is bound to a datasource you have to modify the value in the datasource

1680937
value	field
if the field is bound to a variables then modify the value of the variables itself

1680952
put	get
to get scrolling support you should put your vbox in a gtkscrolledwindow

1680956
double	int
if you marked every decimal on the numbers line in blue and every double in red except for the int there would be very few places where the same value was marked in both colors

1680956
multiplying	exponent
any value represented as base 2 mantissa and exponent 1.00110101001 x 2 -11101001101001 means take the mantissa value 1.00110101001 and multiplying it by 2 raised to the power of the exponent .when exponent is negative this is equivalent to dividing by 2 to the power of the absolute-value of the exponent

1680959
protected	public
get_class_methods will pick out only the public methods not the protected or private ones

1680962
internet-explorer	safari
tested with safari internet-explorer

1680966
worksheet	excel
for example excel if i m going to access a worksheet by named which will raise an error if no such worksheet exists then i ll have a wrapper function that call worksheet named and either returns a worksheet object or nothing

1681058
any	set
is there any way to set up a similar auto cmd to execute p4 edit .when attempting to write a readonly file rather than edit it

1681070
defined	declare
if you declare a struct and don t overrides equals .net framework will use one of two different strategies depending on whether your struct has only simple value-type simple is defined below

1681070
double	int	contains	any
from my tests it appears to be any basic scalar types int long decimal double etc plus any struct that doesn t have a equals overrides and contains only simple typess recursively

1681070
zero	nan
the reason for this surprising result is that double.equals takes into account some of the intricacies of the ieee 754 encoding such as multiple nan and zero representations but a bitwise comparison does not

1681070
zero	nan
the above example used alternate zero representations but this can also occur with multiple nan value

1681081
contains	set
therefore i want to set gzip as accept-encoding in my request and evaluate if the response of the server contains content-encoding gzip

1681093
selected	listbox
1 have a listbox with 3 value out of 5 selected

1681093
selected	button
2 .when i click to selected another value without holding ctrl button it will unselected over value

1681104
arguments	undefined
testing undef --- this means that your function was called with an undefined first arguments

1681120
communication	messages
in my case i just needed to end the communication over dbus as soon as possible without trying to salvage any outgoing messages

1681129
strncpy	memcpy
remember that strncpy will not zero-terminate the result in this case .so you ll have to do it yourself which btw means that it makes more sense to use memcpy instead of the virtually useless strncpy

1681135
display	height
i need to know what the visible height of a display object will be after i change it s rotationx value

1681135
display	height
in flex the value for the display object height properties remains the same both before and after applying the rotation which may in fact be a bug

1681144
literals	hardcode
it goes without saying that using hardcode hex literals pointers is a disaster

1681154
basichttpbinding	duplex	wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding	wsdualhttpbinding	duplex
now callback contracts required two-way duplex communication .so if you re just using basichttpbinding now you would need to switching to use wsdualhttpbinding or .some non-http binding altogether which blows interop for this service out of the water

1681156
scala	java
i created a branding new project which i am using just scala in no java

1681164
value	field
that way your new systemd can have constraints that maybe the old data didn t have and you won t have to try to figure out what value to put in the required field for old data which did not have a value

1681165
decimal	hex
a hex literals is no different than a decimal literals like 1

1681185
hashtable	sorted	sorted	lookup
.when you search for a specific id in a list you would have to iterate through the list well if it s sorted you can use a binary-search while a hashtable required just a single lookup usually

1681191
specifications	w3c
w3c xslt specifications is unclear about casting priority in compari.son of string with boolean .so .some xslt proces.sor will cast the boolean to string and others will cast string to boolean

1681209
selected	listbox
if you still want to use a listbox you should use javascript and for each click event fired you should checked if the click elements is selected unselected and act accordingly

1681211
url-rewriting	rewrite
only issue i ve had with it is that you can t then use further rewrite rules - .so if the site you are serving on the subdomain uses url-rewriting you have to make it its own virtual hosts

1681225
binary	octal	decimal	octal
but woe betide the programmer who tries to assign decimal 3735928559 or octal 33653337357 or worst of all binary 11011110101011011011111011101111

1681241
biblatex	latex
biblatex however uses latex cmd directly within the document itself or styles file to generator the styles

1681245
any	set
fyi - this just turns off the explorer view however other points of integration with the filesystems the file object in c# or the command-prompt already see this view .so there probably isnt any need to set this registry key on all of your servers

1681249
low-level	hardware
in particular .when doing very low-level hardware development this is the way you access memory-mapped registers

1681262
image-formats	file-format
many popular image-formats such as jpeg or png have freely available specifications of the file-format

1681262
photoshop	layer
if you actually want to work with more complex images contains layer and such possibly photoshop or similar then things get more difficult

1681262
photoshop	layer
they additionally contains layer .so multiple chunks of pixels data maybe metadata for the layer in the case of photoshop even vector data for layer masks and other paths etc

1681263
getter	setter
as recommended in the tutorials i wrap the messages builder in a class of my own that implements getter and setter methods to access the messages s properties

1681266
contains	any
as far as i see it analysing byte code won t work because it doesn t contains any annotations

1681269
tuples	any
i can have any numbers of tupless and a tuples can have any numbers of elements

1681283
pointers	stack
the problem is that many debuggers and runtime systemd have already co-opted this particular value as a marker value to indicate unallocated heap bad pointers on stack etc

1681305
show	next
once i changed the code to reference prev next pager class named show below instead of the javascript variables it worked

1681314
rad-controls	telerik
at the moment i m using silverlight rad-controls from telerik

1681314
selected	button
those files that are selected using the browse button show up in the application in several bars

1681325
project-management	project
situation in some project-management software written in asp.net i have a create project page working fine

1681337
friend-class	base-class
i was thinking about exposing the friend-class s private interface through protected methods in the to-be-inherited base-class but that results in having to write and maintain the same interface twice

1681359
entity-framework	nhibernate
i m assuming you don t want to use anything like subsonic entity-framework or nhibernate as well but correct me if that is a bad assumption

1681367
selected	button
then selected pl sql stored program units now click the create button .so it brings up the dialogue box show in your screenshot

1681370
dictionary	arrays
the problem is it return an arrays of dictionary

1681374
python	c++
it has something to do with weather the python owns the parent or it s owned by an underlying c++ object

1681382
wxpython	gtk
you use some gui systemd like gtk or wxpython or something

1681394
environment	building
you could building a web service interface for error collections that all environment and tiers could points to

1681407
.when	ready
you should run it .when the dom is ready for manipulation

1681413
udp	tcp
one over tcp and the other one over udp

1681432
javascript	dom
otherwise the javascript is interpreter immediately as the browser reads in the particular code line usually in the html while the desired dom elements which appears later in insn t built up fully yet

1681432
.when	ready
you normally hook a function to the window.onload event but in in jquery you can hook up the ready event to the document to execute something .when the document is finished loading building

1681441
order	add
what if order matters and your patch is actually added after another patch and now what you meant to add i actually not what was added

1681448
error-code	hresult
i can edit the string field just fine but .when i try to edit a blob stopeditoperation throw a very generics exception-handling messages error hresult e_fail has been returned from a call to a com component. error-code -2147467259

1681449

im trying to implements slideshow2 but i have problems with ie as you can see in this test the slideshow works ok in firefox and google-chrome but is not working on ie7

1681461
msbuild	nant
i used cruisecontrol.net with nant extensively but not msbuild

1681462
selected	cell
the cellstyle properties is the one which will remove the lighting blue highlighting around the currently selected cell

1681462
selection	cell
what this was doing was to set the focusvisual rectangle to be show on cell selection

1681463
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
- itemtemplate scrollviewer with an itemscontrol sliceitemscontrol inside

1681463
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
- itemtemplate canvas contains an itemscontrol eventitemscontrol

1681487
traffic	packets
whatever you do .when writing a custom protocols i would checkout wireshark for monitor your network traffic to make sure all of the packets are correct

1681490
arrays	loops
one thing i noticed is that you are using a for-in loops to iterate through the arrays which is typically not done in javascript

1681493
arrays	map	contains	any
structures it seemed should map in an intuitive way onto memory in the machine but in a structure contains an arrays there was no good place to stash the pointers contains the base of the arrays nor any convenient way to arrange that it be initializer

1681493
contains	any
to summarize in my own words - if named above were just a pointers any of that struct would contains an additional pointers destroying the perfect mapping of it to an external object like an directory entry

1681498
put	get
i tried using registery key in which i stored the path of the folder in a registery key and get that path and put it in-place of utility.dll but this did not work..

1681501
populate	row
.when the radgrid is populate and the user changes a cell within a row the row is not flagged as modified until the user actually click onto another location on the datagrid

1681511
unit-testing	expectations
here you are truly unit-testing that your code behaves correctly you can also mock the socket send and se expectations for what you think should be sent according to your protocols

1681516
folder	dir
go to install dir of xampp htdocs create a new folder mydir then create an index.php and write in it

1681517
compact-framework	.net
i m trying to interface c# .net compact-framework 3.5 with a windows-ce 6 r2 streaming drivers using p invoked deviceiocontrol call

1681556
arrays	loops
to create the csv you would need to break your string into an arrays then loops through it

1681567
gitignore	git-add
if you re pushing to cpan you ll want to add the gitignore and .git to manifest.skip that way they don t go up too. then i git-add

1681602
any	set
if you didnt want to set up google-analytics or you want something more lighting weight you can create a scripting in any language your server supports to set up some simple logging

1681606
firefox	opera
it looks perfect in firefox and opera but it is absolutely horrible in ie

1681626
registration	login
i want to create a login and registration page in objective-c but i am very new in iphone programming

1681631
execute	declare
if it is declare in a package header it can be used by any pl sql code that has execute access to the package

1681637
keyboard	mouse
this is not usual because normally to close a dialog the user have to use the mouse or the keyboard and then the drag drop operation is automatically canceled

1681638
jsonp	ajax
you are making a jsonp request which isnt really ajax

1681667
boolean	int
in this case matrix of boolean but i can easily pack them into 64bit int

1681668
show	next
for instances i use a php function parsing_url to parsing an arrays of urls sometimes it returns an error what i want to do is to parsing next url once error occurs and not to show it error on the screens

1681695
ironpython	ironruby
the dynamic-languages runtime is part of .net 4 ironpython and ironruby and is also available standalone

1681695
ironpython	ironruby
john lam the lead developer of ironruby created a little libs called repl-lib which implements a simple editor repl hybrid for ironruby and ironpython which you can just drop into your application

1681716
attributes	properties
however seeing the properties is readonly i have to assume it s referring to path allowances for the attributes s construction in which case you would try

1681750
json	xml
the options for datatype is json xml scripting or none

1681752
value	field
you don t need to display this field they can be of types hidden and they will preserve the value

1681756
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
.so i have to create a uitabbarcontroller and the items instead of being the direct views are the uinavigationcontroller s with a default view inside

1681771
required	checked
also do try to find automated methods of checked your code against the standards - including your own minor changes as required

1681776
coldfusion	liferay
reason i ask is because i would love to be able to create liferay compatible portlets with coldfusion as i am not a java dev

1681782
base-class	inherited
this sounds like a perfectly reasonable place to use inherited with a base-class reportinputform and child classes performancereportinputform trendingreportinputform and statisticalreportinputform

1681801
contains	elements
the divs may contains both inline and absolutely positioning elements even relatively

1681808
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
note that the combinations of assembling dynamic-sql statements from strings which may contains apostrophes is very dangerous because of the risk of sql-injection attacks

1681820
csv	xml	csv	tsv
you could potentially argue that i just have one view - console or that i even have multiple - let s say my scripting needs to run daily and updates some .xls file on a shared but also output it as csv and maybe tsv file and be able to do xml for consumption by a client service

1681820
export	csv
right now i have 4 scripting that use various parts of that table to import export csv and i use dbi mysql to create my queries and execute them

1681826
google-chrome	firefox
on windows regardless of the browser ie firefox google-chrome this increase the form-submit button and give the button spacing padding of 6px

1681838
nsstring	nsdata
your static methods newdata is a perfectly ok practice and you can see similar methodss throughout the cocoa api just for example nsstring string and nsdata data

1681847
order	add
and to add neither java or c# does a good job on primitive arrays and their implementation is usually outperformed by an order of magnitude for any decent size dataset

1681854
checkbox	button
safari will not styles button or checkbox or drop down menus etc

1681855
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an arrays of uiviewcontroller s not an arrays of uinavigationcontroller s

1681855
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclassing of uiviewcontroller in-place of standards view controllers .when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab

1681863
zero	nan
and to be truthy a variables is anything except false null undefined nan the numbers zero or an empty string

1681870
deployment	install
because i don t want my team to have to install mri i decided to go with an xcopy deployment of ironruby that i had preload with rake

1681885
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
some years ago i had to building a dal for the company i was working for and resulted that it was easier than i though the result was an orm based on reflection who supports many dbs at this time sql-server oracle postgresql and sqlite i can shared the code for you it may help you building your own or extends it to your needs

1681887
logout	login
i have run a scan on my web .app and it is able to store the aspx cookies information go to the logout page and then go to a page without a need to login i assume using the stored cookies information

1681898
contains	elements
a parent div should naturally expand to fit its contains elements if they aren t it s usually an indication that something else has gone wrong - in your case-when you mention clearfix it suggests you re using floats inside the parent and it s not extends past its children anymore

1681907
configuration	environment
it also works great if you want to capture some drupal configuration settings that you d like to play back in another environment but there are better ways - patterns and strongarm modules - to achieve that

1681943
configuration	environment
add configuration.cache_classes false to your configuration environment development.rb file

1681963
mediawiki	moodle
i think all three software package have modules plugins for ldap drupal moodle mediawiki

1681963
mediawiki	moodle
maybe you could use the drupal database as the primary one and have mediawiki and moodle authentication with that

1681963
mediawiki	moodle
there is also the moodle integration module for drupal that attempts to accomplish the same thing only without mediawiki in the mix

1682007
webforms	asp.net
dynamically adding controls to an asp.net webforms and have them work across postback is quite a tricky one to get right but in short you ll need to do something like

1682017
.when	ready
service with boot and systemd start types are started during the time period .when only nt native binaries can run the win32 api is not yet ready

1682020
key-value	key
at the moment what i have is the systemd returning the key-value named and value in different strings converging these into a single list string value where as what i m going to need is table or equivalent representing a key which contains multiple value namedd with each value named contains a single value and finally a types this wil be a numbers representing what kind of registry value this is reg sz reg binary etc

1682022
tiff	png
look at png or tiff

1682032

.when updating via clickonce the updates windows does not use my application icons it uses the default no icons

1682284
abstract-class	subclassing	abstract-class	base-class	protected	public	subclassing	base-class

1682520
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
regardless of the browser safari firefox ie google-chrome

1682524
defined	declare
what you can do to a certain degree is defined a base-class and then use the attributes to declare that other descendants might also be received and or returned by a given operation

1682553
hashtable	sorted
it provides a more robust interface for dealing with these changes than being held strictly to a list of object but also works with dictionary hashtable priority queue persistent sorted lists etc

1682560
mouseover	mouseout
my theory is that the mouseout and mouseover events are being fired one after the other .when you mouse over a button

1682560
hide	show
stick and alert inside the hide and show functions and see if that s the case

1682566

1682647
ironpython	ironruby
the outer layer which is available on codeplex and ships w ironpython and ironruby and is in microsoft.scripting.dll and microsoft.dynamic.dll

1682659
authentication	login
if the email-address is part of user authentication register login etc then you can perfectly combine it with the user activation systemd

1682659
activation	account
send an email with a link with an unique activation key to the specified email-address and only allow login .when the user has activated the newly created account using the link in the email

1682671

i think this means the application servers will have to pull the information required for updating the application and run a scripting to updates the application that resides on the server

1682672
circular-buffer	queue
seems like a task for a circular-buffer - as long as it s okay if the queue has a fixed capacity

that results in the field being overwrite with the default value right before the insert happens

1682704
positioning	slider
the button are not child elements of the slider even though they are positioning within it

1682713
double-quotes	spaces
the problem is probably related to my second rem statement about the missing double-quotes around the path with spaces

1682718
dictionary	arrays
you just have to walk the structure yourself - write a methods that takes in a dictionary gets value for all key and .when it finds an arrays call itself again for each dictionary in the arrays

1682731
expression	brackets
within a predicates the expression in square brackets you can get the current nodes as opposed to the context nodes returned by

1682764
value	field
you re going to be looking for some non-digit value coming back in one of the field where you expect a numbers

1682786
profiling	trace
i would use the profiling and set up a trace

1682794
textbox	button	value	field
then i show the form again but .when i click on the save button i get a messages telling me that it cannot be blank as textbox value is-empty this time from the required field validation

1682795
persistent	transient
if you don t need this value to be persistent annotations them with transient and put the initalization this way

1682807
textbox	button
you need to set validationgroup on your textbox requiredfieldvalidator and button to the same value

1682818
groovy	java
even though i realize that groovy is not java it seems to be similar enough not to mention that it runs on the jvm that the skills i learn should still help me at my current job

1682824
google-chrome	safari
this could be pretty ugly but doesn t google-chrome use the npapi for plugins like safari

1682848
xenapp	vmware
it is possible to create and distribute an application without needing to install the .net for example vmware thinapp or xenapp can do that putting the framework and the executable in a single containers

1682849
any	set
since the compares against any nodes in a nodes set and returns true if all nodess match only whereas the operators compares against the first nodes of a nodes-set only

1682854

i want the user to be able to insert only int in the first three and a double in the fourth

1682860
delphi	basic
delphi basic

1682865
append	input
.when we submit a form using this types of input the coordinates x y are append to the result

1682867
mouseover	mouseout
hover takes two function parameters one for mouseover and the other for mouseout

1682867
fadeout	fadein
if you want the fadeout and fadein to be concurrent don t put the fadein in the callback of the fadeout

1682867
fadeout	fadein
the way you have it the fadein doesn t start until the fadeout is done

1682873
firefox	safari
wrapping the list in a now works in firefox 3.0 but not in safari 4.0

1682873
specifications	w3c
thanks to jennyfofenny for points out that the w3c specifications prohibits a block in my case the list inside a - and thus wins the answer tick

1682873
firefox	safari
this is why safari was automagically closing my paragraph before the list although firefox let it slider

1682877
contains	elements
divs are block level elementss which means that by default they will span the entire width of their contains elements unless told otherwise

1682877
contains	elements
also the statement made about the li incorrectly taking it s width from it s contains elements rather than it s child elementss is not totally right

1682877
contains	elements
changes the li from an inline elements to a block level elements which like the div will take it s width from it s contains elements

1682877
contains	elements
in summary block elementss span the entire width of their contains elements by default inline elementss span the width of their widest child by default

1682878
show	next
my rusty assembly show me 14 live registers with innermost loops of shifting over 64bit location length of 20 instructions with another 5 for reading in the next words from the input

1682884
any	set
is there any performance benefit to pre-compiling an asp.net web application if it s set to be updateable

1682895
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
specificially i have a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller inside display a uitableviewcontroller which is the view that display the subviews and also the view that gets shifted up

1682895
pixels	line
if i experiment with commenting out the wantsfullscreenslayout and setstatusbarhidden line with no navigation bar it sometimes shifts up just 20 pixels or doesn t actually display on the full screens but later it does without changing any code or sometimes doesn t break at all but i am not getting the full full screens with any of these

1682909
gentoo	linux
my arch linux kernel has no mention of arch but i believe my gentoo install indicates gentoo linux

1682918
void	main
another thing to comment on the program don t use void main

1682918
void	main
if you re learning from a book that uses void main the book is unreliable

1682926
textbox	button
click on the button to the right of the entries textbox

1682940
xsd	xml
we have the xsd for the xml upload

1682942
inherited-resources	controllers
by combining the inherited-resources and formtastic pluginss you can produce controllers and forms for your model just as fast as with a full-stack admin tool plugins and it will leave you with greater flexibility and extensibility

1682955
attr	rel
i added the rel attr to the tags

1682956
selected	button
the button would just have some javascript to clear out any selectedion in the selected box

1682957
debugging	trace	logging	trace
if the reason for logging is to be able to trace failures and possibly debugging the systemd i need to be able to process my login the direst of circumstances

1682964
radio-button	selected
ultimately i will use this to determine which specific radio-button is selected .so another way to phrase the question

1682964
radio-button	selected
given a string variables in javascript how can i tell which exact radio-button input elements if any with that string as it s named is currently selected

1682970
callback	methods
instead of using a reader and inputstream and attempting to switching back and forth between the two try using a callback interface with one methods for binary-data and another for character data

1682984
configuration	upgrade
problem i had trouble with the sharepoint configuration wizard completing the upgrade

1683002
revision	svn
if you set the svn keyword revision on the file which declare the tag then the literals text revision becomes a svn keyword

1683002
revision	updates
each time you updates the working copy revision will updates to read revision 1234 where 1234 is the current revision numbers

1683002
revision	svn	put	get
we had put for all our tags and applied the svn revision keyword to them .so that every time we push a new copy of code out to our production boxes we know all clients will get the current revision

1683008
operators	keyword
english keyword because it s hard to search for this times-times star-star asterisk-asterisk double-times double-star double-asterisk operators

1683028
silverlight	wpf
how feasible is it and some guidance to building a wpf silverlight .app in such a way that it can be flipped back and forth from web to desktop

1683028
silverlight	wpf
i recently was introduced to silverlight 3 and the world of xaml at twin cities code camp and one of the presenter was using some user-interface code interchangeably from silverlight to wpf

1683056
external	root
this root is what is referenced external by other parts of the software

1683058
revision	svn
we recently started using svn keyword to automatically append the current revision numbers to all our include .so it looks like this

1683066
margins	padding
if i change margins to padding it works as expected

1683092
margins	padding
margins is the spaces outside around a widget while padding is spaces inside between the widget s outer border and its content

1683113
scheme	lisp
in scheme i think in lisp too language .... means multiplying all expression in braces .so 2 means simply 2

1683121
keydown	keyup
you should already have one or more of the following events for your control keypress keyup and keydown

1683132
keydown	keyup
i ve managed to capture the enter key event must use keyup instead of keydown but i m not sure how to make the dropdown re-appear at that points

1683134
selected	button
i have another control which is a filtering outside webpart and based on data of this filtering control which the user selected and which i would get on postback after click of button i have to show the filteringing charts results

1683137
silverlight	wpf
note that an out-of-browser silverlight .app is still fully sandboxed like an in-browser silverlight .application unlike a wpf .application which is full-trust and has complete access to the user s machine

1683143
order	add
for transactional data like an order we don t caching them but we allow the user to create new ones offline and then add them to the systemd .when they come back online

1683150
revision	svn
see if you can customize the keyword in svn to generator a revision numbers without special characters

1683162
managed-code	native-code	native-code	porting
we work in native-code but porting the codebase to managed world is my personal idea because i can see a lot of functionality that can be achieved in a better way if the code is written as managed-code

1683184
attributes	properties
however .when it rendering a new button it keeps providing the value properties as and ignoring the attributes that i add

1683188
attributes	properties
with sun java 1.6.0_16 the standalone attributes is only set in the output document if you set the output properties and the content is also correct

1683190
ffserver	wowza
if we use a streaming media server like fms wowza ffserver prevent people from downloading videos

1683203
static-class	inherited
i know that enums do not support inherited since they are value-type and are therefore sealed .so i m probably looking for .some kind of static-class implementation

1683209
order	join
you can also reverse the order of the join first finding the highest rating and then finding the lowest price among those with the higest rating

1683219
bugzilla	trac
i ve never used trac but bugzilla works really well as a free bug tracker

1683228
parentheses	keyword
also be careful not to follow the printing keyword with a left parentheses unless you want the corresponding right parentheses to terminate the arguments to the printing mdash

1683283
value	field
put an index on the calculated value field

1683289
json	xml
do you have a preferences for xml vs json for ajax request

1683289
json	xml
you need to send back a response to the jquery async request in a form that is useful to jquery xml or json ideally but on the server side it just looks like a normals request which happens to use a view that rendering xml or json instead of html

1683289
json	xml
on the server side you need a controllers that will be mapped to the incoming request and which will send back json or xml to be process by jquery

1683298
object-reference	instances
it technically works ie passes compile but inside expression-blend 3 i get an error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1683341
groovy	java
since groovy can work with compiled java classes sometimes the easiest way to access a soap-based web service is to just generator the stubs and write a groovy client that uses them

1683341
wsdl2java	wsimport
use your wsimport tool jax-ws or wsdl2java jax-rpc to generator the stubs and write your groovy class as usual

1683346
file-descriptor	stdin
i m assuming that in this case you mean to convert it to a string and set it over stdin to the subprocess which would convert it back to an int to use as a file-descriptor

1683371
json	xml
put a text xml json file into the .app and read it from there

1683394
ref	out
ref is two ways both in and out

1683394
ref	out
.so in what scenarios would you combine the use of the ref and out keyword with passing by reference or passing by value

1683412
sql-server	mysql
i remember doing this for about 6 months .when we couldn t get the mysql drivers to work with the ctp of sql-server 2008

1683423
ref	out
you would never combine ref and out on 1 parameter

1683423
ref	out
you can of course combine ref parameters and out parameters in one methods

1683423
ref	out
the difference between ref and out lies mainly in intent

1683423
ref	out
ref signals 2-way data transport out means 1-way

1683426
show	next
next write down simple rules to show how you want the flow of the comparator to be

1683428
keyword	term
edit i have corrected this answer to reflect that the out keyword in c# does not do what you might expect it to eg a true out parameter in the computer science sense of the term

1683428
ref	out
you can t use out and ref together

1683428
ref	out
out keyword pass by reference ref with no definite assignment requirement before call

1683428
ref	out
as you can see both out and ref actually pass by ref

1683431
selection	highlight
i would use a multitrigger to allow the mouseover highlight to continue to work after selection such that your listviewitem s styles will be

1683448
ref	out
ref int num for an in out parameter

1683448
ref	out
out int num like ref except function must assign a value to it before returning

1683448
data-access	ado.net
sometimes data-access providers like some ado.net methods use output parameters to deliver information back

1683451
triggers	insert
you could use triggers whereby you audit insert updates and deletes

1683461
any	set
is there any way to randomly generator a set of positive numbers such that they have a desired mean and standards deviation

1683536
http-get	put
using s3 you d then upload the images using http put and both the editor and web browser would access the images as usual using http-get

1683537
listbox	textbox
on my form i have a few listbox and a few textbox

1683554
oracle	mysql
if the legacy server is a non-sql server database like mysql or oracle then you are probably best off using ssis and data flows

1683559
keydown	keyup
i had some trouble with the keypress event which has a different signature but the keyup and keydown work fine this way

1683569
if-statement	for-loop	expression	brackets
could save you from using brackets for an if-statement and could also induce headaches later or allow you to have multiple expression in a for-loop s control flow which is actually a pretty legitimate use of the comma-operator

1683574
append	input
i think the best way would be to make multiple input have the named of column_named then append the only .when the form is submitted

1685008
hash	md5
it will be tricky if not impossible and if you ask me definitely not worth the effort to do all this in xslt but at least you now have got the information that this hash was created using md5 on the gif file

1685034
json	xml
store in this column as serialization lob of the attributes in whatever format suits you xml json yaml your own homemade dsl etc

1685054

the advantage of using an orderdictionary is that you shouldn t worry about how you add the items they ll be order for you

1685158
contains	elements
if the first parameter b does not have enough capacity not size to contains all of a s elements then it will throw an indexoutofboundsexception

1685158
required	checked
it s an optimization to required the copy-paste collections to be preallocated b but i generally do not think that the feature is worth it due to the requiredd checked given the constructor-based alternatives like the one show above that have no weird side-effects

1685270
directory	folder
one way to do this .when deploying is to simply make a virtual directory under project_1 that points to the common images folder

1685270
cassini	iis
in development you could either copy the folder into the project or run them under iis instead of cassini built-in vs webserver

1685270
directory	folder
personally i just copy the folder into each project during development because i move the images folder outside of the project directory and use virtual directory .when deploying anyway

1685493
repr	eval
then there s generality -- not every serialization object can properly round-trip with repr and eval while pickling is much more general

1685493
repr	eval

you need to use formview databound event instead of formview itemcreated event to set value try like

1685580
numerical	matrix
i was merely trying to impress on wert the op that shy of a few typically local tricks aimed at either improving performance or numerical accuracy the multi-step process for converting a matrix to its reduced row echelon is pretty much the way to go

1686288
widget	button
note this button is a custom widget with gtkhbox+ gtkimage+gtklabel in it

1686300
widget	button
you need to add such a callback and have it return the desired positioning by reading it out of the button widget s gdkwindow

1686300

...if you re interested in just the first three elements of a large arrays why don t you use a for-loop instead of a foreach

1686616
controllers	routes
can i make a small suggestion using routes which are based on the default routes controllers methods id should ideally not be used instead use named routes or the proper restful routes given for free .when you declare your routes eg

1686652
contains	elements
in the case of arrayss and associativity arrayss being cast to int what you get is the cardinality of the arrays the numbers of elements it contains

1686692

getter	setter
it would still be possible to mix annotations and written down getter or setter to cover cases .when it should do non-trivial sets and gets

1686987
linked-list	nodes
to me his shout seemed quite confusing as was making a person really a nodes in a linked-list of person object with chaining handling some of the linked-list management but person also doing linked-list things along with person things

1687018
entity-framework	ado.net
for fastest way you can also have a look at ado.net entity-framework

uppercase	tolower
but for the uppercase to lowercase conversion youâ ll either need a mapping like the internal tolower function or you use php for both

1689964
dictionary	map
to answer your question of what can go wrong the hashcode generator by your function will be used to find the place for instances of your class if you put it in a hashtable dictionary map

1689965
any	set
now in this case about-box is derived from windows rather than user-controls .so there may be .something here but is there any rea.son you need to set owner to .something other than this

1689996
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free
malloc realloc free memory-management is not actually aware about threads

1690011
attributes	properties
you can use a custom controlleractioninvoker and inject properties dependencies you can t do constructor-injection because the framework handles initializer of attributes

1690016
subclassing	accessor
the first is preferred because if you go through the accessor it can triggers kvo notifications which can cause weird issues if your subclassing the object

1690023
scheme	lisp
lisp including scheme are dynamically typed and the lisp way is to have many functions over a single data structure rather than different data-structures for different tasks

1690028
contains	any
behaving more like a zip archive file xps document contains all the files necessary to recreate a document on any systemd

1690038
filtering	sorting
it depends - if the database doesn t need to do any sort of filtering or sorting on the data in the delimited strings and the data was originally sent to the database in a delimited format why not

1690043
value	field
a field should always hold only one value

1690043
value	field
but if a field is holding more than one value through the use of delimiters then that field needs to be parsing each time you need the answer to any of these basic functions

1690059
project-management	project
maven is a project-management tool which encompasses a project object-model a set of standards a project lifecycle a dependency-management systemd and logic for execution plugins goals at defined phases in a lifecycle

1690059
packaging	building
maven uses conventions over configuration with lots of useful default directory location a defined lifecycle a set of common plugins that know how to building and assemble software maven provides a common interface to building project unlike ant you know how to do things like running tests packaging etc with every project no need to open the building scripting to find out how it s done maven implements reuse through maven plugins building logic is embedded into plugins for dry purpose you don t have to repeat yourself over and over you don t have to copy-paste parts of your building scriptinging maven has a project object-model that allows you to describe your project through meta-data this enables dependency-management remote repositories reuse of building logic tool integration artifacts search...

1690059
buildr	maven
buildr maven vs

1690066
value	field
a database field should contains atomicity data that is the whole value is meaningful but part of the value is not

1690066
value	field
for example i might decide to store a per.son s named in a field called fullnamed .so the value are john smith and mary jane etc

1690067
python	c++	python	java
it s nice if you want to also make other language wrapper for your c++ api though since you can do c# .net python java etc with one set of apis.

1690080
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary
this will include standards types such as strings double and data-structures arrays dictionary along with binary files

1690080
json	xml
i ve also seen xml and json though i d still be stuck with the issue of converting object such as a python dictionary into an objective-c nsdictionary or vice-versa

1690080
json	xml
from what i ve gathered xml json may be difficult to use with binary-data requiring converting it into text first before encapsulating it

1690092
key-value	key
the reducers then needs to emit a tuples as key with the first component of the tuples being the path to the directory where the files with the key-value pairs should be written

1690094
configuration	installation
i think there is a problem with eclipse configuration over tomcat and it must use the tomcat installation configuration

1690163
object-reference	instances
i always get a null reference error object-reference not set to an instances of an object. .when try to edit a row in telerik rad control in runtime

1690167
32-bit	64bit
for example in c++ the size of a long-integer is 4 bytes 32-bit on a 32-bit machine and 8 bytes 64bit on a 64bit machine

1690175
32-bit	64bit
most of the time it s about the size of the registers on that machine whether they are 32-bit long or 64bit long or something different

1690179
contains	elements	contains	any
added the specifier field for the child elementss in case the messages elements contains any other kinds of elementss

1690184
value	field
.so looks like numbers 2 would be the best approach with a field that defined the status of the recording new complete and either checked-constraints or a triggers to checked whether or not all the optional mandatory field have a value

1690202
carbon	cocoa
as you are aware cocoa in a carbon application can be tricky

1690209
postback	ajax
i fire an ajax request with filtering data and set the value in a session variables before page does a postback this way i get the data at all places events and pass on the same as parameter where required

1690210
value	field
if you re storing a snapshot of an item and would like to come back and see which options were selected at that time i can see storing value like this into one single field

1690217
postgresql	mysql
another option is to use postgresql -- unlike mysql it has timezone support for datetimes built-in

1690242
32-bit	16-bit
old or small embedded cpu s may not have 32-bit wide registers .so adding two 32-bit value might required splitting the data into multiple 16-bit registers and perform several additions -- which takes more time

1690244
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
google-chrome firefox opera ie

1690280
positioning	slider
i try to make a slider similar to the iphone unlock slider that forwarding to a linked site .when complete and returns to its initial positioning .when the slider wasn t dragged to the end

1690280
positioning	slider
problem here is that the droppable don t work as fine as i hoped sometimes i move the the slider on the invisible droppable which indicates if the slider is dragged to the end and nothing happens sometimes it works fine i think this may be due the different positioning of the cursor on the slider

1690280
positioning	slider
on both tests i didn t figured out who i could return the sliderr back to its initial positioning with a slider effect

1690281
value	field
then the field could be null but .when the value changes to fully registerd a triggers could ensure all the required field are filled out

1690289
any	set
set up any relationships to other tables .when the user converts to a complete user not .when the new user is created

1690338

1690433
constructor	object
if you want an object to have a named just pass the named along in the constructor

1690438
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop can start with the second elements of the arrays because you have already initializer maxvalue with the first elements

1690453
button	popup
i could easily make an .app that popup a windows that allows you to push a button to bring up the ikpicturetaker but this is not quite what i want

1690463
for-loop	arrays
also since it is an arrays you shouldn t use the for...in statement a normals for-loop it s enough i think something like this

1690515
variables	boolean
the standards way of doing this is to add a boolean variables initializer it to one value checked it before running that code and flip it .when it runs

1690521
put	get
if you put that somewhere like in your application delegation s applicationdidfinishlaunching methods you ll get the picture taker windows startup

1690533
textbox	button
.when you hit the refresh button it updates the time in the textbox within the updatepanel at the same time it also updates the time in windows title bar

1690561

1690563
forms-authentication	credentials
according to this the way to go is implements forms-authentication checked the provided credentials against ad and then impersonate

1690565
implements	abstract
the types sumofints must implements the inherited abstract methods step.makeastep s t

1690571
margins	padding
this might not be relevant in this particular case hopefully the advice from previous answers should solve your problem but if you re finding you re getting unexpected extra spaces around elements make sure that you ve removed the default padding margins etc

1690571
margins	padding
that browsers often add to elements and of course different browsers often add different amounts of padding margins etc

1690571
margins	padding
if you make sure you ve zeroed margins and padding etc

interface-builder	iboutlet
if you had allready made the connection in interface-builder to an iboutlet you delared in your owning class you would be able to set it in code like this

1690735
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button	interface-builder	iboutlet
you could also set the properties directly in interface-builder by selected the checkbox as show below however in your .app you are going to need to wire the button up to an iboutlet anyway to implements your conditional logic.

1691125
boolean	int
anyadults ages int - boolean

1691125
parentheses	braces
using the compiler as a cognitive crutch is the same technique the poorer students currently unsuccessfully employ to balance their braces and parentheses

python	ruby	python	java
for example i see code in java calling methods in import libs but it doesn t seem different enough from python or ruby code - both are scripting languages right

1691218
udp	tcp
also beware that this only works with udp -- there s no such thing as multicast tcp -- and that getting it to work across router may be difficult

1691219

1691243
contains	any
.so i m using sql full-text-search and from what i read contains returns matches near words while freetext returns words that have similar meaning however i can t find any examples that validation this

1691248
scala	java	python	ruby	python	java
python can be compiled to jvm-bytecode with jython and i believe ruby also can -- then the engine running the python or ruby code in question will be a jvm the same engine that runs java code or scala code etc etc

1691248
ironpython	ironruby
similarly with .net and ironpython or ironruby -- then the engine is micro.soft s clr just as for c# boo and .so on

i think you have the usage of immutableobjectattribute confused -- it means that the object s properties should not be editable in a form designer or similar design-time user-interface not that the object is itself immutable

1691279
attributes	properties
this attributes is typically used in the properties windows to determine whether to rendering an expandable object as readonly

1691279
attributes	properties
as such this properties is used only at design time. .so this attributes isn t really about immutability it s about disabling the display editability of subproperties in an editor like a propertiesgrid

1691280
attributes	properties
reflector show that the only methods using this attributes is the internal system.windows.forms.propertiesgridinternal.gridentry.flags properties getter used by design properties grid

1691286

but i cannot simply add the related_name value to my modeladmin -derived field list

1691310
derived-class	pure-virtual	derived-class	base-class	pure-virtual	base-class
i m not sure whether i d implements a virtual compare function with a dynamic_cast i would be reluctant to do this but if there was a proven need for it i would probably go with a pure-virtual function in the base-class not which was then overrides in the concrete derived-classes as something like this using the for the derived-class

1693106
put	get
personally i don t get an exception-handling but it very much depends on what you put inside #template

1693111

i ve frequently written malloc front-ends as a speed optimization for memory that doesn t need to be free in a steady-state

1693339
background-color	transparency
i have the following code which tries to combine a vertical mirrored image with a transparency to background-color gradient

1693350
debian	linux
operating systemd linux debian

1693362
mouseover	mouseout
but adding inline mouseover and mouseout events to the tag works perfectly well

i m interested in all kinds of solutions if any python java low-level api gql.

1693375
.war	jar
i also have a .war project not part of ear contains the previous ejb jar which has a dependency on the ejb jar mentioned

1693375
.war	jar
if i use ejb jar as libs in .war it seems that glassfish tries to inject ejb annotations in the ejb jar and i get tons of errors since .war obviously doesn t know about some internal ejbs used locally by the ejb jar

1693376
web-services	api
with a modicum of elbow grease and some previous experience in calling out to web-services you shouldn t have any trouble getting the information you need from the api

a mac-address is supposed to be unique but most nics allow them to be reconfigured quite easily allowing your license key to be used on any other computer by just reconfiguring the mac it must simply be out of the subnet of the other computer using the same mac

1693429
strcmp	strcat
of strcat a b strcmp a b retrieve first elements of strfind a b etc

1693429
interpreter	runtime
since matlab is interpreter it has to lookup the definition of a function-object at runtime

1693448
where-clause	sql
modifiy your sql with a where-clause -

1693455
child-process	spawn
i spawn a child-process and need to know what files it modifies creates or deletes

1693487
silverlight	wpf
it s specific to wpf but should be mostly relevant to silverlight too and might give you some ideas about how to go about trapping these issues

1693524
entity-framework	nhibernate
after some research it seems that nhibernate linq-to-sql and entity-framework are the most commonly used ones

1693525
child-process	spawn
you ll need to do this for all of the filesystem-related call that you want to trap open close read write rename etc. you should be able to set up the dyld_insert_libraries environment variables before you spawn your child-process without needing to be root

1693529
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	java
i would like to know of any similar repositories for php python ruby java c++ javascript etc... or better a comprehensive list of such repositories

1693529
latex	tex
tex latex ctan

1693544
selection	highlight
i haven t used nerdtree but if the file is highlight it might not work quite right it will try to filtering the selection through the cmd you provide

1693544
selection	highlight
for example highlight some text and press and you should see which are markers for the current selection

1693548
put	get
below is the code but .when testing and looking at the headers that firebug report if i take out the response.end it is a 302 redirect i assume because i set the 301 but then call another action which makes it a 302 but if i put in the response.end i get a 301

1693567
pecl	pear
for php there is pear for components and pecl for extensions

1693572
implements	extends
in actionscript 3 you can figure out whether object o is of class c or of a class that extends or implements class c directly or indirectly using.

1693572
implements	extends
what i want to do is to test whether class cc extends or implements class c directly or indirectly without having to initializer an object

1693585
postgresql	mysql
use postgresql copy and mysql load-data-infile

1693612
textbox	button
however .when i hooked it all up with form button multi-line textbox to replace the response and error-log i cannot get anything to work

1693612
textbox	button
how do i get it to be responsive accept button click during looping and live updates the multi-line textbox

1693614
any	set
last not least - delay_key_write is set to 1 for a given table though it didn t add any speed-up in comparison to .when it was disabled

1693620
iframe	popup	contains	elements
you might want to consider using a div elements popup windows that contains an iframe

1693638
shell	bash
i have to access this list from some unix shell scripting perl bash etc.

1693655
webserver	security
that is a corruptible security hole as malicious code can be manually added to the query-string to cause a xss or buffering overflow attack at your webserver

1693660
ruby-on-rails	grails
it let you quickly create application basic crud like ruby-on-rails or grails styles

1693660

on unix or linux you can do your write to a file-descriptor

1693692
contains	set
is there a way that i can link to a page contains a jquery user-interface tab set and pass the selected variables in the url link to automatically show a particular tab depending in which link was click to reach the page

1693694
defined	declare
also make sure that you defined all of the non-pure-virtual methods you declare

1693694
defined	declare
if you declare a pure virtual-destructor you need to defined that too

1693702
double	int
the converter only handles the typical conversions between the basic systemd types that implements iconvertible string int double datetime etc

1693708
versioning	upgrade
probably upgrade to later gf versioning will help

1693718
interface-builder	iboutlet
1 checked that the properties definition of username_textfield in the secondmenu header is defined as an iboutlet and that 2 it is actually linked up in interface-builder

1693721
jquery-slider	slider
i am using the jquery-slider control for use as a double sided slider

1693725
lightbox	thickbox
since many browsers block popup by default and popup are really ugly i recommend using lightbox or thickbox they are prettier and are not popup they are extra html markup that are append to your document s body with the appropriate css

1693727
actionscript	mxml
i ve figured out how to compile .mxml files at the command-line using bin mxmlc - now i just need to learn mxml actionscript and the various apis

1693759
command-line	cmd
but to have an unobtrusive friendly interface i need a command-line tool to send at cmd and receive response to from my mobile phone through my com ports

1693774
user-interface	look-and-feel
your user-interface will look-and-feel much more dynamic including nice features such as button that animate .when you pass the mouse over them

1693774
switching	screens
a couple of hours later i had railroad tracking i could draw anywhere on the screens using bã zier curve and they would join and switching automatically

1693787
contains	any
if the class contains any non-pure virtual-functions then the compiler will assume that they have an implementation somewhere and its internal structures vtable and typeinfo might be generator in the same object file as one of those

1693788
layoutsubviews	drawrect
you might still have to pass a bunch of information from the delegation to the cell class like a model object or some contents and you might have to duplicates some code from your cell s layoutsubviews or drawrect but at least all of the logic would live within the cell class

1693793
scheme	let
on the other hand putting all of the filteringing into the udf would let sql-server determine whether it s easiest to filtering by id first more likely assuming a standards indexing scheme and then apply the locale filtering or vice versa

1693828
tcp-ip	telnet
telnet is based on the tcp-ip protocols

1693828
tcp-ip	telnet
if the .app is already there and already communication to the console via stdin stdout you can rig a telnet interface on to it using a some configuration in your internet daemons x inetd or by misusing the swiss army knife of tcp-ip netcat

1693847
buffering	streaming
.when dealing with file upload especially big ones you should process those files as streaming which you slurp into a medium-size in-memory buffering and copy directly into your output file

1693851
stripes	wicket
i ll building some sample apps tomorrow using spring-mvc stripes and probably wicket and see them in action

1693864
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox solution 2 will return the 3rd character in that string

1693866
value	field
nodes reference auto-create and nodes reference field appear to have more value-added for determining value in the new nodes

1693870
attributes	properties
one way is to apply the setterproperties attributes to the properties itself

1693878
value	field	getter	setter
regular properties expose getter and setter but have a private field to actually store the value

1693878
value	field
properties are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read write or compute the value of private field

1693901
malloc	strdup
alternatively if you can t change the messages class you ll have to explicit copy the string yourself using strdup or malloc + strcpy and then you have to remember to deallocate the string copies at some later points

1693902
spring	jsf
main idea is to use jsf with spring aop for modularizing cross-cutting-concerns like logging

1693904
overwrite	preserve
on the other hand i could open the file and overwrite the data with the contents of the new one which would preserve all metadata but would not be an atomicity operation

1693915
json	xml
instead i would create an api to the database on the website perhaps implements a restful interface or having queries that return data in an appropriate format such as json xml or even plain text

1693923
any	set
if you re in a shared-hosting environment like dreamhost they have process watches that will kill off any php process after a set time limit

1693941
any	set
.when i do put row ids in html and the business model says a user should have access to a certain set of rows such as those he she has insert i might design a db table to include a userid column and include it in any db operations pseudo code where rowid table.rowid and userid table.userid

1693945
python	php
the input 7|12|1|14|2|13|8|11|16|3|10|5|9|6|15|4 returns 0 by the php -code while 1 by python code 1 means that the sums of the 4x4 magic-square are the same while 0 means the reverse

1693945
python	php
how does the logic of php code differ from python

1693962
value	field
a generally easy way is to store the count of all items and the sum of all those value in two separate field

1693969
value	field
automatic properties also create a private field behind the scenes return its value in the get and set its value in the set

1693975
value	field
once he has leave the control the program will validation the control s value and any of the others validation which are concern with that control and with other controls that are all non-empty have been field in already

1693975
value	field
as i mentioned i need a methods here that get all the input all the field of the class and somehow perform all the validation checkeded on the non-null value if there is a validation checked that concern to a few parameters and even one of them is null the validation shall not be execute

1694000
put	get
if i put the url from the first alert into a browser i get a valid page back

1694007
constructor	object
if however you re accessing the object-model from an add-in the code above isn t fully correct instead of creating a new outlook.application object via the constructor you you need to get a reference to the trusted outlook.application object from inside your add-in like this

1694020
authentication	login
i am a small time internet hosted .app saas developer .when i launchd i expect most of my customers will authentication login to my .application using the standards email + passwd technique

1694020
azure	saas
the azure cloud will probably be used to hosts my saas .app if that helps clarify the options

1694022
innodb	myisam
although i could tell you in short the difference between the primaries engines myisam and innodb are in transactional support foraing key support locking level myisam locks the entire table innodb has row level locking and mvcc

1694035
togglebutton	expander
the default templates for treeviewitem uses a togglebutton not an expander

1694035
checkbox	button
like checkbox instead of radio button

1694037
callback	methods
you could use the ajax ... methods but it would be easier to use get ... with a callback like this

1694040
declarative-programming	imperative-programming
refer to declarative-programming and imperative-programming

1694040
declarative	imperative
basically with declarative languages prolog you specifiy what you want to accomplish without specifying how to accomplish it which contrasts with imperative languages

1694056
malloc	free
there should be no code changes as it can simply replace the built-in malloc free

1694060
selection	cell
for posterity the program i created using this information clears all the cell of the current table and returns the selection to cell a1

1694076
latex	tex
for those who consider tex and latex programming languages there s the comprehensive tex archive network - ctan

1694078
response	timeout
i am wondering .when i read a response streaming and a timeout occurs can i retry the read

1694098
malloc	free
if you write a wrapper using entirely c-based api s only c-compatible structures memory managed by malloc free etc. then you might be able to use pobedim s solution

1694098
32-bit	64bit
i ve done this .when trying to use closed-source 32-bit code in 64bit apps and it works well enough

1694099
cos	sin
plus you should compute the sin and cos value once store them in temporaries and reuse them

1694105
updating	updates
another more realistic downside is that with the naive code that i ve show massive books updates may be way slower since they ping author for updating their data on each updates no matter what

1694115
contains	elements
if an elements contains null then that might represent no exit in that directions

1694125
explode	implode
user seperates colors by comma along with quantity .so color quantity match .when i explode implode them into arrayss thus allowing me to manage the quantity .whenever .something is purchased by their key after doing an arrays search for the color

1694138
jsonp	ajax
the only types of data that you will be able to get via ajax from another server is jsonp

1694149
udp	tcp
beyond this we re getting into specifics -- you tagged both tcp and udp which is it

1694160
value	field
then for each row get the value in essays field and use a regular expression function to get numbers of occurrences for the value in your variables

1694167
keyboard	mouse
the advantage of this over handling right-button mouse messages is that your users will be able to use the keyboard equivalent to right-clicking

1694186
attributes	properties
it combines the types specified in the targettypes attributes of the styles with the string in the setter properties attributes to find the dependancy properties instances

1694186
attributes	properties
it can then use the types indicated by the dependency properties to convert the string in the setter value attributes

1694194
directory	folder
.when you run it from within netbeans working directory is likely netbeans bin folder .so dll can t be found

1694208
arrays	loops	nested-loops	loops	nested-loops	arrays
how can i create a series of nested-loops for each consecutive arrays .so creating arrays loops within the previous one

1694208
arrays	loops
routine that will do a recursive nested loops starting with the very first arrays aka arrayslinks and building another loops inside the first and .so on

1694219
shell	bash	bash	ash
this will work on any pthreads shell including those systemd where bash is the login shell and bin sh is something smaller and faster like ash

1694219
shell	bash
i like bash and use it for my login shell but i avoid bashisms in cmd files

1694225
webserver	upload
typically this is to a protected folder on the ftp site on your webserver the same server where you upload your web content but not in a folder that is publicly accessible

1694245
environment	execution
the caching effectively gets wiped out whenever you re load the page because the browser will spin up a new javascript execution environment

1694262
traffic	packets
you could simulate the traffic using a agent types called packets that will be spawned and send from a agent called bots to another agent called bots or server

1694271
linux	bsd	any	set
on linux and bsd at least you can set up remapping rules that redirect packets from the visible ports to different ones where the apps are listening according to any network related criterion maybe network of origin or some simple forms of load balancing

1694303
contains	elements
well what you have here is a two-elements arrays where each elements contains a one-elements arrays that contains the arrayss you want to iterate over

updating	updates
that way everytime the user updates the content of the div an ajax call can be made updating the server side representation of the div

1694316
callback	methods
the main difference between query and the other methods is that you ll have to implements one of the callback interfaces either rowmapper rowcallbackhandler or resultsetextractor to handle your result set

1694316
populate	row
you only have to implements a single methods maprow where you populate the types of object that goes in your row and return it

1694316
callback	methods
the queryforlist methods are valuable in that you don t have to implements these callback methods

1694316

1694407
interpreter	runtime
some other form of instruction is read and interpreter by a runtime which in turn execute native machine instructions

1694407
intermediate-language	interpreted-language
c# is not an interpreted-language even though it employs an intermediate-language il this is jitted to native instructions before being execute .so it has .some of the same speed reduction but not all of it but i d bet that if you built a fully fledged interpreter for c# or c++ it would run slower as well

1694420
dialog	pop-up
types nav in the pop-up dialog rather than windows | show view | general | navigator or wherever it is

1694434
any	set
you can t set the innerhtml without losing the existing content .so unless you re happy with serialising and re-parsing that which wipes out any non-serialisable data like form contents javascript properties references and event handler you end up setting the innerhtml of another elements and moving each child over one by one

1694672
required	checked
a mutex or semaphore would be a better option than a simple boolean flag because it doesn t required checked the state of the flag repeatedly

1694682
priority-queue	queue
you could implements some sort of scheme where you kept your own priority-queue of threads waiting and each thread added itself to that queue immediately before it was to begin waiting and then it would checked the queue .when unblocking but this would add a lot of complexity and a lot of potential for serious problems race conditional deadlock etc.

1696309
g++	gcc
you should use g++ not gcc to compile c++ programs

1696310
g++	gcc
you probably should use g++ rather than gcc

1696321
any	set
in any case executable permissions have already been set .so no need to chmod anything

1696355

using eclipse add remove software i am using the add archive and choosing the zipfile i just distribute

1696724
double	int
int can hold a smaller range than double

1696724
double	int
you could keep your numbers as a double and use floor to round down to an int

1696726
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
and you d also have to overrides all the variations of malloc like realloc calloc etc

1696760
any	set
.so here s my question is there any way i can make the textbox s scrollbar functional but still leaving the enabled set to false

1696780
sql-server	mysql
but if you can t afford sql-server or if licensing is an issue mysql is the way to go

1696787
any	set
the exception-handling class doesn t give you any opportunity to set the methods named

1696787
testng	junit
your test annotations doesn t tell me if you re using junit or testng because i can t see the static import but in either case you can run a test to see if a particular exception-handling is throw by using the expected member in the test annotations

1696804
enterprise	licensing
if you have an msdn subscription you get the developer edition of sql-server which is the whole enterprise edition with restrict licensing

this allows you to connect to from .net using the connectors oracle postgresql ms-sql mysql sqlite ...

1696844
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
you can #define your own malloc realloc calloc and free functions wrapping the real functions behind your own counter

1696844
malloc	free
you can trap malloc free etc by writing your own shared libs and forcing your process to use it instead of the real versioning via ld_preload

1696844
malloc	free	dlopen	dlsym
you can use dlopen dlsym to load invoke the real malloc free etc

1696844
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	dlopen	dlsym
but be aware of reentrancy situations .when coding this libs and that your process will initially invoke malloc calloc realloc before dlopen dlsym can complete loading the real functions

1696868
web-applications	security
commons security threats for web-applications may be a consideration as well

1696890
specifications	w3c
either example is perfectly valid you can even throw into the mix or . as separators according to the w3c specifications

1696893
zipfile	archive
it seems that the zipfile is not in the format of an archive updates site

1696905
value	field
show the current value of this field by just printing the filename or url a clickable link to downloading it or if it s an image just show it possibly as thumbnail

1696905
value	field
note that there s no way to upload an empty file .so you need .something like this to clear out the field s value

1696908
python	c++
i ve only recently come to really grasp the difference between static and dynamic-typing by starting off with c++ and moving into python and javascript

1696912
oracle	mysql
ms sql mysql oracle or even entity-relationship-model access

1696913
division	modulo
the modulo will give you the remainder of a division

1696917
subtract	add
the operations on these dynamic data typess add subtract compare are usually implementss by a virtual-method table which is for each data types a numbers of pointers to functions that implements the desired functionality in a types-specific way

1696941
revision	svn
the nant building scripting currently uses revision properties to keep tracking of branch versioning for merging and reintegration svn s built-in merge ability gets confused too easily

1696944
directory	folder
all directory and files created within that folder are being assign to the user _mysql and grouping wheel with the permission of 700

1696949
dynamic-cast	base-class
i thought about adding a gettype settype function to the base-class and then use a dynamic-cast

1696951
hash	md5
the user table must have a field for the md5 hash passwd google php md5 username and id

1696952
contains	elements
second in my code .when i say to use alert or some other accessible notification i mean use the alert methods or if you use a dom elements to contains the notification make sure you use wai-aria live region and roles attributes to make the notification accessible to assistive devices

1696961
any	set
and userid and passwd always asked while showing of crystal report if there is any solution for set one time userid and passwd through coding in c# though it s never asked again again about it for other user

1696963
derived-class	base-class
you simply call a base-class member function and the proper derived-class member function is called at runtime

1696985
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
many product developers want to write a .net application which will work seamlessly with any popular rdbms like sql-server oracle db2 mysql

1696991
json	xml
for the serialization you could use json or xml

1697003
entity-framework	ado.net
the microsoft ado.net entity-framework is an object-relational mapping framework from microsoft which is designed to let you write code which is somewhat db-agnostic

1697003
postgresql	mysql
all major dbms s have support for the entity-framework although for many mysql postgresql you ll need to downloading something separate from your .net install

1697003
entity-framework	nhibernate
that said the current versioning of the entity-framework is pretty limited in a numbers of dimensions-- other o rm frameworks like nhibernate subsonic etc

1697007
iprincipal	iidentity
in this sense i distinguish between the user s .profile the user class and their authentication authentication tokens non-persisted classes that implements iprincipal and iidentity .so that they can participate in the various and thread.currentprincipal scheme used throughout the .net

1697007
database-table	unique-key
this means that my role named are essentially magic well-known strings in effect being a unique-key in a roles database-table

1697014
httpwebrequest	webclient
webclient is useful for those situations where you just want to do an operation eg .post get form upload and cant be bothered to create and manage the httpwebrequest requeststreaming httpwebresponse and response streaming

1697027
protected	public
derived - is the object the inherited his father s public and protected members

1697031
pure-virtual	subclassing
typically it ll have some virtual methods or even pure-virtual that subclassing can overrides to specialize

1697034
row	col
use fluid-layout the wave-shaped first button first for the state grouping to animate the change from one grid col row to another

1697048
32-bit	64bit
however that depends if you are running 32-bit or 64bit

1697068
attributes	properties
among other properties these news items have two attributes for created date

1697085
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
both the base-class and the derived-class will have a table of pointers to their virtual-functions

1697085
virtual-functions	base-class
if b adds more virtual-functions that aren t in the base-class b s table of virtual methods will be larger or there may be a separate table depending on compiler implementation

1697096
rtsp	rtp
using a server that streaming the content over rtp rtsp like wowza fms et al prevents the current realplayer downloading from capturing the content

1697102
32-bit	64bit
on the other hand if you use it as a generics unsigned-integer to count the numbers of stars in the universe for example you might have a problem on 32-bit systemd not sure about 64bit systemdd

1697108
32-bit	64bit
on a 32-bit systemd they ll all be 32-bit wide while on a 64bit systemd they will all be 64bit wide

1697108
32-bit	64bit
this is what you want - the size of a buffering can t possibly be any larger than a 32-bit size_t on a 32-bit systemd but it can be far larger on a 64bit systemd

1697108
32-bit	64bit
aside from anything else the size of a long varies depending on the platform 32-bit on most 32-bit systemd 64bit on 64bit unix systemd 32-bit on 64bit windows

1697112
derived-class	base-class
if the derived-class overrides a virtual function then the overrides function will always be called on object of that class even through a reference to the base-class

1697153
python	c++
i want the files to be readable from various languages at least python and c++ .so .something language specific like python pickle is out of the game

1697155
innodb	myisam
have a look at count vs count col at www.mysqlperformanceblog.com they discuss this topic for various col types not null or not with index etc and this for myisam and innodb tables

1697163
oracle	mysql
i know the question is about mysql but for what it s worth count is recommended for oracle which goes to show that this is database specific see comment above from balusc

1697174
gridview	listview
for example in most cases the listview will do everything the gridview can and produce clean seo-friendly markup

1697176
contains	any
.when i checked my table dt it does not contains any recording in it

1697180
webforms	asp.net
i suggest starting by reading a blog .post by the gu url-routing with asp.net 4 webforms vs 2010 and .net 4.0 series

1697180
webforms	asp.net
mapping urls using asp.net webforms

1697184
webforms	asp.net
url-routing with asp.net 4 webforms vs 2010 and .net 4.0 series by scott guthrie

1697185
key-value	key
as for the key-value thingy what you need to ensure is that the key itself is well defined as for your lookup

1697188
google-chrome	safari
can you tell me why my searches are working ok in ie8 but get stuck with safari and google-chrome

1697188
google-chrome	safari
but still dont work on safari and google-chrome any advise

1697196
base-class	inherited	member-functions	base-class
the derived object inherited all the data and member-functions of the base-class

1697196
protected	public
depending on the nature of the inherited public private or protected this will affect the visibility of these data and member-functions to clients users of your class

1697196
private-inheritance	member-functions
because of the private-inheritance all data and member-functions of a although available to the b class within the b class will not be available to code that simply uses an instances of a b class

1697196
virtual-functions	base-class	base-class	inherited
this is compiler systemd dependent but the most common methods used is that for an instances of a class that has any virtual-functions whether declare directly or inherited from a base-class the first piece of data in such an object is a special pointers

1697196
constructor	object
there are single instances of these tables - the constructor for an object will set up the vtable-pointser in each newly created object to points to the correct vtable block

1697198
progress-bar	progress
use it to load your songs on a background-thread and report progress to the ui-thread that will updates your progress-bar

1697202
key-value	key
you already recognize that a relational solution makes sense .when you have many separate dataset tables that must support relationships between them foreign key constraints which is almost impossible to enforce with a key-value store

1697202
key-value	key
another area that key-value storage works well is .when the key or value is opaque such as .when the stored item is encrypted only to be readable by it s owner

1697205
unsigned-integer	int
it is not necessarily the same numbers of bytes as the largest unsigned-integer types unsigned int unsigned long etc

1697208
return-value	arguments
c is a strongly typesd language and in particular the types of an arguments or return-value is critical and can significantly impact code-generation

1697234
auctex	latex
i m also interested in which of these modes provide a way for the spell checker to skip part of a buffering depending on its syntax for instances inorder to skip math mode parts in a latex document which are highlight as brown in auctex mode

1697236
oracle	mysql
i ve no idea if such a thing exists in mysql but row-level-versioning in oracle enables you to defined access rights on row-level in the database .so that means regardless of what tool is being used to access the data the user only ever sees the same selection as determined by his her credentials

1697236
where-clause	sql
.so if my username role is only allowed to see data limited by .some where-clause that can .append to each and every selected that .appears in the database regardless of whether it comes from a web .app a sql querying tool or whatever

1697238
implements	abstract
remove _children from containers instead make virtual abstract function ienumerable getchildelements that each descendent would implements and return its own of child elements

1697238
base-class	inherited
you can even make second base-class like untypedcontainers containers that would declare overrides getchildelements to return _children and inherited document from it

1697240
derived-class	base-class
more theoretically if you derive one class from another you have a base-class and a derived-class

1697241
exception-handling	try-catch
the first and second try-catch blocks are exactly the same thing they simply rethrow the current exception-handling and that exception-handling will keep its source and the stack-trace

1697241
exception-handling	try-catch
.when it throw the exception-handling it will change the .source and the stack-trace .so that it will appear that the exception-handling has been throw from this methods from that very line throw e on the methods contains that try-catch block

1697243
while-loop	infinite
then there is a perceptron learning algorithm which for some reason is not converging to 0 globalerror should converge to 0 and therefore i get an infinite do while-loop

1697264
json	xml
my issue was caused by an oversight in the client-side networking libs i was using that erroneously reported my xml json as a multipart form

1697268
contains	elements	contains	any
that will be more meaningful and in that case you will always have some result even .when xml file will not contains any keyword elements

1697273
any	set
my question is what is the purpose of defining a variables in the class definition in python if it seems like i can anyone set at any time any variables without doing .so

1697287
required	checked
.so getting abc.x required first checked for an instances variables

1697295
http	ssl
enable your webserver to use http ssl

1697368
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
create a simple contains div for the entire set and set the width to the combined width of three images plus any padding you have for borders and the like

1697396
superclass	abc
notice that if x is not in abc.__dict__ then the __dict__ s of abc s superclass es are searched

1697403
udp	tcp
dns primarilly uses udp and some dns servers will refuse all request over tcp

1697410
sqrt	sin	sqrt	cos	cos	sin
here the functions sin cos and sqrt all have the same prototype schema function taking a double arguments and returning a double value

1697424
credentials	security
if i supply different credentials policy for each request this can be a security hole

1697432
contains	any
are there any autocomplete libs i can use some sort of data file contains commonly used functions in java c php etc

1697436
subclassing	base-class
also if all subclassing should be required to implements idisposable then the base-class should implements idisposable as well -- this causes the compiler to enforce it

1697458
child-process	spawn
systemd will execute the supplied cmd in a child-process that it spawn

1697458
child-process	spawn
if you want to spawn a child-process using execute you ll have to fork your process beforehand

1697462
children	nodes
you d like the process to short-circuiting on the children of a nodes if any child produces a match

1697479
loading	gif
i want to show loading gif while i fetch my actual content from the server

1697479
loading	gif
the problem i am facing is that i want to show this loading gif as a modal box

1697486
selected	checkbox	radio	click
on a side note if you re expecting ie 6 support the change event doesn t triggers until the checkbox radio selected blurs .so you may want to handle those differently click still works nicely for checkbox radio

1697498
value	field
store that single field or any other unique id as your key serialization each recording as a string using json or similar and store that string as the value

1697498
lookup	any
if you want to lookup recording by any of several field sqlite might be easiest for development purposes

1697498
key-value	key
it is possible to building column-like behavior on top of key-value stores by serializing your recordinging and insert the column value of each recording as additional key whose value contains the primary key of your recording

1697513
loading	gif
it s the same as if you were using a loading gif

1697519
multiplying	subtract
an alternative especially if the maximium size of the dividend is modest is to multiplying by the reciprocal of 3 as a fixed-point value with enough bits of precision to handle the maximum size dividend to compute the quotient and then subtract 3 quotient from the the dividend to get the remainder

1697527
contains	set
insert a div that contains everything within the iframe and set the background on that

1697536
webserver	upload
perhaps 50mb is the maximum allowed filesize upload on the webserver

1697536
webserver	upload
can you find out what the allowed maximum upload filesize on the webserver is

1697544
sorted	lookup
as as human i always thought that lookup in something sorted is the way faster than lookup in not sorted

1697549
credentials	integrated	credentials	ntlm
it depends on the authentication mechanism used - if the user logs into the page with ntlm windows integrated then the webclient cannot reuse the credentials

1697570
dictionary	hashmap
the un.sorted dictionary is probably a hashmap .so lookup is almost o 1 assuming not too many collision while a lookup in a .sorted list is best case o log n

1697590
type-safety	generics
think about it this way with generics the whole idea is to provide type-safety

1697615
arrays	map
unless you have multiple kinds of collections lame example suppose you have an arrays but also a map of salesgroup then salesgroups would not be the best choice but you d rather pick salesgrouparrays salesgroupmap etc.

1697626
configuration	logging
the logging section is in ahother file configuration loggingconfigurationuration.configuration

1697629
value	field
a common way is to put a hidden form field beside the checkbox and then via javascript set the value for that .when the checkbox is changed

1697629
hidden-field	checkbox
but the hidden-field is a way to go .when you don t neccessarily know on the page that is posted to how many checkbox there are on the requesting page

1697633
selected	checkbox
.so you can only determine the unselected checkbox by determining the set of all available checkbox minus the selected checkbox

1697643
codeigniter	kohana
i notice that some php frameworks such as kohana and codeigniter would look at the classname of a class to perform auto-loading

1697663
python	php
is there a solution in either php or python that can checked

1697666
put	get
i d prefer to embed some usage tutorial videos within my .app but its going to put my .app at around 20mb uncompressed and i doubt compression will get it below 10mb

1697674
wamp	php
i used wamp and xampp but now i install separately on my vista machine apache 2.2 php 5.3 mysql 5.1.4 and for writing code notepad++

1697686
substitution	replace
here naive quote substitution means that quotes followed by words characters are replace by one or two as appropriate back ticks and all others are replace by one or two single-quotes

1697698
required	checked
it is impossible to pass empty arrays to the function which is not generics and required additional checked on caller s side

1697700
sqrt	exp
p s exp - theta-p 2 2 s 2 sqrt 2 pi s 2

1697716
.net	wcf
like the title says we need to set up wcf service between a .net .app and a adobe air .app

1697726
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
how can i open a pdf file and read some of it s contents with python this language is preferred however ruby perl or php are fine too in case it is recognized not just an image or report that it s impossible without ocr

1697739
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
is it possible to read it s contents with python perl ruby php

1697754
double-pointer	pointers
you are allocation 11 pointers to class nodes and storing it as a double-pointer in variables x

1697754
for-loop	arrays
if you load this arrays using a for-loop double-check your indexing

1697758
profiling	trace
the latter change has dramatically reduced memory consumption in some scons usage scenarios but was almost impossible to trace with a memory profiling

1697780
constructor	object
you can treat it just like a class s constructor .so you should make sure that it behaves like a constructor either return a valid object or throw an exception-handling

1697792
invokerequired	begininvoke
you need to use invokerequired and begininvoke

1697799
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
on windows i have tested my site on google-chrome opera ie firefox

1697799
firefox	safari
on mac firefox i safari

1697802
selected	button
the val function only works for input elements input selected textarea button

1697822
any	set
if i set or any other numbers not 0 it works fine

1697839
digits	zero
area codes can vary between 2 and 5 digits the leading zero is not counted

1697865
required	checked
it is obvious stm required on-line data conflict checked

1697865
required	checked
however such conflict checked in pure software required very huge time overheads

1697898
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in all other browsers firefox safari opera probably ie8 it works nicely and fits to minimum width

1697900
digits	zero
area codes can vary between 2 and 5 digits the leading zero is not counted

1697901
debugging	trace
the best way i found to debugging it was to trace through it line by line knowing what operation should be performed and making sure by hand calculation whether the correct operation was indeed performed

1697906
fflush	stdio
this basic_filebuf contains it s own buffering by inheriting basic_streambuf and actually contains a __basic_file itself containss an underlying plain c stdio abstraction file or std __c_file in which it fflush the buffering

1697911
logic-programming	declarative
of course the points is not that there must exist an optimal physical storage design but that whatever physical storage design can be abstracted away by a nice declarative language based on relational-algebra calculi and sql is a bad example or more directly on a logic-programming language like prolog for example - see my answer to prolog to sql converter question

1697918
put	get
might be an issue with the way you structured your productsummarycontrol because even if you don t put binding the datacontext will get automatically inherited to the control

1697928
ocaml	sml
also not really what you re looking for at the moment but if you want a good ml book it s actually a dialect of ocaml but old enough to not be that different from sml then look at cousineau + mauny

1697933
configuration	environment
.app wide configuration common to dev test prod environment

1697933
configuration	environment
place items for development in rails_root + configuration environment development.rb or something like

1697940
contains	set
is it possible that the browser is interpreting the response from the serveresource call according to the character set specified on the page contains the portlet instead of what you intend

1697941
instances	private
this is often fixed by having a non-recursive wrapper function that initializer the state variables and passes it to a private recursive function that does the actual work and takes the value as a parameter instead of using a static instances

1697949
udp	tcp
if you are using netfilter s conntracking module that may also need tuning to tracking that many connections this is independent of tcp udp sockets

1697953
primitive-types	reference-type
primitive-types are pass-by-value and reference-type by.

1697954
removeclass	addclass
i have already tried some hacks like addclass fake removeclass fake on a root elements but did not succeed

1697954
simplemodal	jquery
the corresponding code for calling jquery simplemodal plugins

1697977
json	xml
it s pretty similar to xml serialization in that you create a bunch of data classes dress them with attributes and chuck the json into a deserializer

1697983
emacs	vim
there should use emacs or vim with a makefile

1697983
textmate	emacs
emacs is also cross-platform unlike xcode and textmate

1697985
hide	show
setting the class of each row to hide or show it using visibility collapse to hide it and keeping the dom elements in the table

1697985
hide	show
keeping a dom elements for each data item detaching attaching it to the table to hide and show it

configuration	environment	environment	building
we have building configuration for each environment devel building qa

1698000
configuration	environment
this generator the correct configuration files for each environment

1698000
configuration	environment
the idea is taken from managing multiple configuration file environment with pre-build events but extended with the templates replacement

1698013
user-interface	drawing	keyboard	mouse
cocoa s user-interface elements are implements as a combinations of two parts a control a complete subclassing of nstextview and a cell which handles the actual drawing and keyboard mouse integration

1698014
arrays	loops
now that the arrays is just a set of pointers and it s terminate with a null-pointer loops can look something like

1698025
javascript	dom
using innerhtml for large changes in the dom is way quicker than manipulating the dom with javascript

1698025
javascript	dom
consider .when code in javascript modifies the dom the underlying engine has no way to know that other changes are about to immediately follow nor can it be sure that the javascript will not immediately examine other properties of the dom

1698025
javascript	dom
hence .when a change is made to the dom by javascript the browser needs to ensure it updates all .sorts of other properties .so that they are consistent with a completed rendering

windows-server	windows-vista	32-bit	64bit
windows-vista home premium 32-bit windows-vista business 64bit and windows-server 2008 64bit

1698031
windows-vista	windows	64bit	x86
i compiled the program targeting x86 for windows-vista home premium and x64 for the 64bit windows machines

1698031
32-bit	x86
windows-vista home premium 32-bit x86 assembly the first call to getresponse was completed in around 150ms while all consecutive call took around 10ms

1698031
64bit	x86
windows-vista business 64bit server 2008 64bit x86 and x64 assemblies the first call took around 1000ms while each consecutive call completed in 500ms

1698031
32-bit	64bit
the rea.son we get different tcp ack pattern in the last two step piggybacked in 32-bit while separate tcp ack frame in 64bit is that the new web request is delayed for 309+96ms in the 64bit case .so the tcp stack output a separate ack frame it can not wait for the application layer

1698043
subclassing	base-class
i have setup the subclassing map but .when i save it neither attempts to save any of it s base-class properties or any of it s new ones that i have assign in the mapping

1698043

why is it that .when i attempt to save my class newuser that it doesn t attempt to save any of the other properties set whether from it s base or newly declare properties

1698054
uitableview	uiview
i created a rectangular uiview with a clear rounded-corner interior and then laid that on top of the uitableview

1698060
arguments	default
systemd will invoke your systemdd default cmd shell which will execute the cmd string passed as an arguments that itself may or may not create further process that would depend on the cmd and the systemd

1698060
spawn	exit
with spawn you can get the process s exit code

1698091
temporary	copy
probably the easiest way to .solve a temporary debugging issue is to patch y.tab.c .so that the line al.so drops a copy in a global

1698154
exception-handling	try-catch
can i somehow force visual-studio to break on every exception-handling including those throw inside try-catch blocks

1698159
python	ruby
usually people use hugs for small testing-type prototype analogously to how ruby users would use irb and python users would use the interpreter but for actual shipping code ghc is by far the most popular target analogous to how python users would compile import modules to cython

1698164
getter-setter	setter	getter-setter	getter	getter	setter
in eclipse however you can automatically implements getter-setter methods for field with source generator getter setter

1698206
subtraction	addition
if you are going to implements the swap of two characters without a temporary variables which is a neat trick but not something that you should actually use in practice it would be prudent to either use the bitwise xor instead of addition subtraction or use unsigned char instead of char because overflow in signed arithmetic is undefined in the c99 standards and guess what gcc started to make use of this undefinedness for optimization purposes

1698213
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following code in firefox 3 google-chrome and ie 8 and in all cases nothing reflowed

1698238
hide	show
adding a class and using css to show hide the elements will probably be the fastest coding and performance wise especially with .so much items

1698251
filesystems	symlink
be careful with the symlink option though since it will create valid directory of infinite length on your filesystems whatever sub redir-target sub redir-target ... and some scripting cannot cope with that

1698257
boost-variant	boost-any
as for storing and casting you may be interested in boost-any or boost-variant

1698260
subtract	add
.when you add or subtract two char s and the result is more than 8 bits it will wrap around to some other value but this process is reversible

1698276
constructor	object
as an alternative you can just pass the mock object into the constructor of the class under test for constructor-injection and bypass the inversion-of-control containers entirely in your unit tests

1698299
maven-central	sonatype
for java people there s the maven-central repo and also sonatype s mirror of most public repo

1698301
show	next
what i remember is that the formatted source code part which should be visible on the next page was just truncated and did not show up at all

1698303
constructor	private	constructor	object
i ve considered setting the connection properties s setter s access modifiers to private and having it set in the constructor but the problem with that is that i need to create a new object to replace the placeholder peer in the disconnect list to add it to the connect list

1698303
instances	private
my question is should i stick with having the setter as internal or is making it private and replacing the placeholder with an entirely new instances a good approach as well

1698307
instances	private
make the accessor private or better yet mark the field as readonly and generator new instances .when changes need to be made

windows-vista	windows
although microsoft recommends using a newer replacement api available only on windows-vista and later there is an api which works for all versioning of windows from xp onward adderexcludedapplication

1698409
callback	methods
because the timer is now not firing periodically but is being restart by its callback methods then the callback is guaranteed to be single-threaded with no queue

1698414
directory	folder
but instead of placing the c runtime dlls in the same directory as your exe try copying the whole microsoft.vc90.crt folder from the redist folder in the visual-studio install c program files x86 microsoft visual-studio 9.0 vc redist x86 microsoft.vc90.crt on my machine

1698423
keyboard	mouse	keyboard	hid
the idea is that some hid devices may be recognized as mice keyboards by x terminal but a second mouse or keyboard could be used for something else but to do that you need to make sure they aren t sending spurious input into an open terminal

1698445
32-bit	64bit
i recently move from vista 32-bit to windows 7 64bit and i notice visual-studio 2008 is slower .when it comes to initialising certain things like the delay .when you first use the toolbox is longer opening a project for the 1st time is longer etc

1698826
python	c++	python	java	binary-tree	tree
in c# java python c++ using the stl and other high-level languages most of the time you will use one of the built-in library-included types to store your data at least the data you work on at the moment .so most of the time you won t be using a binary-tree or another kind of tree explicit

1698841
svg	vml
