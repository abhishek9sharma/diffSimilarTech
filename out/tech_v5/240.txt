value	field
comma separated value in field or any other similar trick is poor practice and often resorted to either as a stopgap measure you find out that you needed a multi-value .when it s too late to change the datamodel or some legacy cruft

2400080
value	field
by having multivalue encrypted in a field you lose all the benefits of having a rdbms model in particular you make finding sorting comparing value in the comma-separated field s hard if not impossible to use along with the rest of your data

maybe you refer to method-overriding which is indeed part of polymorphism

2400300
method-overriding	polymorphism
.so i d say method-overriding and method-overloading and convenient features of .some language regarding polymorphism but notthe main concern of polymorphism in object oriented programming which only regards to the capability of an object to act as if it was another object in its hierarchy chaining

postback	ajax
as i have mentioned before the ms ajax web service call is built dynamically and .when the ms ajax web service call is construct it will be passing a usercontext which contains the postback value __dopostback ctl00 contentplaceholder1 btnselectuser .so .when the javascript eval is called it simulate a asp button click postback

2400897
postback	ajax	selected	button
then you click the btnselecteduser asp button to show the javascript modal-dialog and in the dialog you add some users and once you hit the selected button inside this modal-dialog a ms ajax web service is triggers as mentioned above and once this web service is complete it eval the asp hidden-field s value __dopostback ... ......and do the postback manually

2400897

2401076
google-chrome	firefox

2401086
stateless	stateful
the web is essentially stateless and asp.net-mvc helps you to go down to the metal that is asp.net-mvc does not try to make something stateful that isn t which is mostly the path of ye olde asp each request is a request of it s own and it shouldn t know anything about any other request that has been performed in the past

2401087
tokenize	parsing
since your example of syntax is quite simple it should also be possible to simply use stringtokenizer to tokenize and parsing these kind of scripting

2401127
contains	any
alternatively you can note that named do not contains any digits and i have not seen any drivers s license numbers which containss digits

2401132
constructor	object
on the other hand if you try and access .some local hardware device that does not exist and will never exist within the scoping of your program for example a graphics card that is not present then i think this is a case where you want to know this in the constructor .so that the constructor can throw and the object can not exist

2401132
constructor	object
throw in the constructor means that the object will not exist and thus functions can t be called on that object

2401132
constructor	object
.so i think that you should do enough in the constructor to ensure you have a valid usable object created

2401150

i think the problem is i mean the second warning is that you re comparing nsstring object which could be set to null to an nsnull object

2401286
groovy	java
it s based on groovy instead of java but since groovy is really close to java it won t be a problem actually it s easier than java in many aspects a grails application is actually a java ee application

i found this for nginx webserver

2402258
arrays	loops
i can easily do this by adding in an sql statement placed inside the events loops which pull out the selected category by updating the event id in the statement each time it loopss but i m sure there is a more elegant methods which uses one sql query which creates an arrays that can then be used within the events loops - i m just not sure where i should start looking

the other way i can think of it is to use autoit which is a basic like syntax and to automate the process of logging on and feeding a rmdir directory_named perhaps to make it more flexible supply the hosts userid passwd and the directory named to the autoit scripting which can by the way be compiled to a standalone program.

2403307
extends	super
i just wanted to add that there is a rea.son for this there is a strong aversion to adding keyword because such additions break existing code .so .when new features are added existing keyword are used if they make a rea.sonable fit such as super and extends for generics and default for annotations or they are just skipped as in the colon used in the enhanced for-loop

2404017
macros	vba
vba remains supported and all the work goes into macros

2404017
macros	vba
eventually macros become the preferred methods for all programming in access with vba eventually deprecated and finally eliminated

2404017
macros	vba
because by that points macros are .so versatile and robust not programming language will replace vba

2404017
macros	vba
i don t know if the access team is addressing this or not but for me it s a real step backward in terms of manageability particularly if the beefing up of macros ends up causing vba to be deprecated and then not replace with a correspondingly powerful programming language with a good ide

2404574
partition	rownum
for example you can get an ordinals column within a grouping by partition on the groupinging field and using rownum over the rows within that grouping

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
add the mouseover handler to #div_1 and the mouseout handler to #div_2

2404581
mouseover	mouseout
this way #div_2 is show .when you mouseover #div_1 and it is hidden .when you mouseout of #div_2 instead of as soon as you mouseout of #div_1

2404594
aggregate	grouping
partition by is analytic while grouping by is aggregate

2404604
32-bit	64bit
why don t you just call the .net reactor support and ask directly why you get 32-bit assemblies that is if they claim their product produces 64bit assemblies

2404604
32-bit	64bit	platform	anycpu
by the way .when i building my .net assemblies i use the platform option with anycpu which indicates that the resulting assemblies can run on any versioning of windows on x32 windows run as 32-bit assemblies and on x64 windows run as 64bit assemblies

2404605

it works with json how can i do it with xml

2404690
contains	any
to me it sounds like you want to create a list which contains any kinds of items

2404690
contains	elements
have all the classes you want in the collections implements this interface and then you can have a list contains elements implementss this interface

2404706
spaces	output
without a spaces beween the value .so the output would be #field_1.field_label - ie likes specifics

2404717
trojan	virus
if your goal is to create a virus or a trojan horse that hide its payload in a ram drive i question your motives

2404731

i have one idea that involves first defining one or more abstract typess interfaces such as inumeric - or more abstract than that and then defining struct that implements these and wrap typess such as int while providing operations that return the new types integer32 inumeric

2404738
authentication	login
isn t the authlogic_facebook_connect supposed to bypass login passwd authentication

because you might want to control the postback using an ajax call

2404809
value	field	radio	click
but i can see that the .post generator by click the confirm button contains the foo and bar value for the hidden field but not the choice of the radio button

2404814
value	field
if you need to enforce uniqueness and the field value are already there use triggers

2404818
getter	setter
synthesize will generator the getter and setter for you

2404866
constructor	private
.so you make your constructor private and create a static properties that handles the lazy-evaluation initializer

2404877
logging	trace
i use postsharp for basic logging trace exception-handling

2404903
pointers	stack
this goes back to proper code design even in c++ if you had a c++ string class and created it without a pointers than the entire dataset would be stored on stack and .when that variables would be copy-paste all the members would be copy-paste

2404915
doubly-linked-list	hashmap
because hashmap are rarely iterated and rely on insert and order a doubly-linked-list might give it a performance boost

2404928
json	csv
it can return in json which is trivial to parsing using touchjson if you need the extra data or csv which will be even easier if all you need is latitude-longitude

2404936
linked-list	hashmap
linkedhashmap however is the same data structure as a hashmap but with a linked-list woven into it to make iterator faster and consistent

2404953
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
internet-explorer has a very nasty quirks-mode which activates .when your webpage seems to disobey the w3c standards

2404953
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
in quirks-mode internet-explorer tends to rendering things just a big bit different than other browsers to keep compatibility with older website which where written specifically for internet-explorer s weird renderinging engine

2404953
internet-explorer	doctype
one way to let internet-explorer think that your webpage actually conforms to the standards is to insert a doctype as the very first line in each webpage

2404972
javascript	dom
i m not really looking for jquery plugins tutorials - it s more like usage of one object in document in javascript jquery is mentione only because it will be used to modify dom and simplify selectors jquery plugins maybe just for that one little function add

but than i have realized that the constructor should do nothing i do need to specify value of field

2405064
for-loop	arrays	put	get
i need to get a range of pages using ajax and put them into an arrays where their given place in the arrays is equals to the i of a for-loop it s a caching-like function for blog pages and the range of the for-loop is entirely variables

2405086
literals	hardcode
write a small executable that does nothing but execute the literals sql cmd with the parameter value hardcode into the sql and see if that will run on the work station that s giving you the problem

2405090
any	set
that way you can accept characters from any character set and store them as iso-8859-1 because base64 will output a subset of the ascii character set which maps exactly to iso-8859-1

2405093
textbox	button
in the event handler of the button which shall run the selection by the textbox content

2405115
derived-class	base-class
as an aside i have also tried making a base-class and a derived-class and putting the catch statement for the base-class before the catch statement for the derived-class

2405134
hide	show
all the columns are include in the report-designer and i use parameters to hide show columns based on the user s choice

2405137
derived-class	base-class
that makes it possible to write handler that can never be execute for example by placing a handler for a derived-class after a handler for a corresponding base-class

2405163
integration	payment
you mentioned virtuemart this also can be a bottle neck virtuemart installation depend on the shop category and product no. shipping integration payment methods images process

2405164
attributes	properties
you can put certain datacontract-related attributes on properties to include or exclude them from the serialization process in wcf

2405164
.net	wcf	attributes	properties
basically with wcf in .net 3.5 sp1 you don t have to specifically labels your classes and their properties with special attributes anymore

2405164
attributes	properties
put the attributes on your field and properties that you do want to be serialization

2405164
attributes	properties
basically for each types in your wcf service you need to make a decision which field and properties to include - mark those with the attributes

2405166
boolean	int
if you need to be able to answer the question of whether an x y z triplet is in your dataset you either store an impossible w value -1 perhaps if they re otherwise positive int or int_max if they re otherwise finite or at each points you store a struct of a w int and a boolean is_present flag and set the flag to true false for whether that index is present in your dataset

2405181
show	next
this works great in firefox and ie8 but in ie7 and earlier the whole sprite show up in-place of one of my original images - that is icon1 is next to icon2 next to icon3 and .so on

2405190
value	field
i ve always used ajax to load the contents of a dom elements but now i m trying set a form field value with the result-of the following query

2405195
configuration	environment
what we do is store the url s in an sql compact database could also simply be in the configuration file we store the environment specific url s in a separate xml file then as part of the build-process the urls are updates in the sql db

2405195
any	set
then to points to any given environment we just have to change the buildenvironment setting and all urls for the wcf service and other environment specific info are automatically set to their correct value

2405218
application-pool	was
i was able to fix this in my dev environment local machine by changing an advanced setting on my default application-pool

2405234
getline	strtok
actually if it s within the constraints of your assignment i d recommend abandoning and strtok in favor of string istringstream and getline

2405259
contains	any
many participants specifically mention the need to have local dependencies not contains in any repositories local or otherwise and elaborate on the solutions they ve come up with for such scenarios

2405261
display	height	display	width
i have a winforms gui in c# that allows a user to draw a rectangle on a display of a tiff and save the positioning height width etc

2405267
contains	any	contains	elements
note in your case using the iterator is rather pointless though because you know the second arrays does not contains any elements with post in it and the first arrays is not nested

2405277
triggers	insert
this may include some false positives like references to the insert table in a triggers etc

2405287
constructor	private
as far as i know the only actual use for an empty constructor is .when you make it private to prevent anybody from initializer the class like .so

2405288
multiplying	transpose
transpose and multiplying the rotation matrix does not change the rotation matrix --- a rotation matrix is orthogonal which means it s transpose is equals to its inverse and therefore r t -1 r

2405289
32-bit	16-bit
if i understand correctly this is just a convenient way to return the 32-bit of memory required to create two 16-bit samples

2405307
arrays	loops
using this you will get arrays of category object for each .post loops is currently process

2405316
value	field
the problem lies with the fact that .when the user click on the submit button the .blur event is called setting the value of the zipcode field to zipcode

2405325
arrays	map
the trends object is a map from date object to an arrays of trending topics

2405336
google-chrome	safari
for some reason .when a user attempts to printing any article of this types from a webkit-based browser i ve confirmed this in both safari and google-chrome the pages are all blank

2405336
internet-explorer	firefox
on the flip side everything behaves as expected in both firefox and internet-explorer

2405341
registration	login
however this doesn t work as well for user-controls or other common pages you might want to be using such as login registration etc

2405341
directory	folder
then ensure that you create a bin folder in each of the virtual directory and copy the libs into there as well

2405344

.some characters appearing in an unquoted uri such as parentheses comma white spaces characters single-quotes and double-quotes must be escaped with a backslash .so that the resulting uri value is a uri token

2405383
32-bit	64bit
and of course the pointers sizes will vary depending on if it runs as 32-bit or 64bit

2405433
buildpath	libs
the solution is to remove things from your classpath and instead add specific libs to your eclipse buildpath

2405442
integrated-security	connection-string
from the description i m guessing that you re using integrated-security in your connection-string

2405476
bad-request	http-status
on the wire it seems that the http-status 400 bad-request is returned

2405477
decimal-point	digits
if you set a scale then that takes away from the numbers of digits to the left of the decimal-point

2405477

delta	diff
for each explicit delta identified by the diff tool what s the coverage data and for all code not changed according to the diff tool whether the new coverage is less than the old coverage

2405494
functional-programming	imperative
one of the great benefits of f# is that it allows you to mix the functional-programming styles with other styless namely object-oriented and imperative

2405499
key-value	key
it will search for a constants definedd with defined called key -- and if there is none if will take the key-value

2405503
build-server	teamcity
how about using a build-server cruisecontrol.net bamboo teamcity etc

it works because php automatically converts a bare string an unquoted string which does not correspond to any known symbols into a string which contains the bare string

2405529
python	java	python	c++
interested in mainstream platform .net java c++ python javascript etc

2405535
revision	svn
there is my question is there any way to have that libs files hooked to google-code svn and simultaneously my project in my repo it s parent to that libs .so i can commit libs files into my repository .when i decide that outer project revision is ok

2405539
constructor	object
also wrt your small amendment if the purpose of tbest.fromstring is to create a new tbest object then it ought to be declare as a constructor not a static anything

2405541
hide	show
use to hide and to show

2405546
subclassing	base-class
.so each subclassing simply reads and writes to from a delphi streaming and the base-class serialization that to a variant

2405607
linux	osx
they developed their own simulator which only runs on osx but could probably relatively easily be ported to linux

in fact in a typical implementation raw memory allocation for call are eventually process by some implementation-specific malloc free -like pair which means that doesn t really have to care about how much memory to deallocate it simply call that internal free or whatever it is named which takes care of that

2405789
input-field	textarea
.when this input-field this is a textarea is read on the linux machine we want to split the data based on newline character

2405803
windows-xp	windows
we are testing the appearance of our exe s icons using windows-explorer under windows-xp vista and windows 7

2405804
entity-framework	nhibernate
this is entity-framework but it can be easily done in nhibernate too by adding where clauses to iquery

2405814
constructor	object
without inheriting from object jsonpickle cannot correctly decode classes that take one or more arguments in the constructor it seems

2405817
contains	set
means that .when someone hovers over the a your img is in the img background will be set to none--which means it will show your a s background since it contains the img

2405823
radio-button	checkbox
by the way a checkbox is not the same as a radio-button and you re actually not passing the id s to the function but instead the whole elements

2405827
aggregate-functions	sum
my cube has a measure called amount with a aggregate-functions sum and transactionnumber with a agregate function count and a time dimesion transactiontype dimension and others

2405828
any	set
as gavinb points out you need to use the non-sub variant once to set the overall dimension but i don t agree that calling the non-sub variant repeatedly is any slower than using sub for updates -- the gpu is still free to overwrite the existing textures in-place as long as you are using the same textures id

2405835
click	mouse	mousedown	mouseup
as others have mentioned the right mouse button can be detected through the usual mouse events mousedown mouseup click

2405838
safari	opera
opera and safari

i had started this .app on a 32-bit windows-xp box and i am now running it on a 64bit windows 7 box

2405869
callback	methods
note this will not handle errors encountered during the asnchronous methods callback - it will need it s own similar exception-handling

2405872
contains	elements
i think it might be being applied in the end to the wrong place and as such wouldn t work such as a contains span - although in theory an elements inside another elements should be open to control by this properties

2405878
boost	tbb
before doing anything else read the section what is a thread from amit above then start looking at either the specifics of pthreads windows threads tbb boost threads or any other libs wrapper looks interesting to you

2405896
lighttpd	apache
apache has mod_proxy nginx has http-proxy lighttpd has its own mod_proxy.

2405915
put	get
get article 123 edit - display article 123 in edit mode fetched via get process via put overloaded as .post

2405915
put	get
a better implementation of the above might be to put the add edit delete keyword into a get parameter - since they do not change the resource we re working with it might be better to keep the base uri same for all of them

2405916
postgresql	oracle
this works and i can load oracle or postgresql properties successfully and i can selected from either database

2405917
subscription	in-app
users will need to renew their subscription by making separate in-app purchases

2405931
double-quotes	single-quotes
note also the use of the single-quotes which allow double-quotes to be used inside the attributes

2405932
windows-server	windows-xp
the same vbscript works correctly on a 32-bit windows-xp machine and a 32-bit windows-server 2003 machine

2405935
contains	elements
the form is submit to the url contains in the action attributes of the form elements

2405939
bytearrayoutputstream	outputstream
i don t know how good the rubyzip implementation is but with java.util.zip implementation the outputstream can be set to bytearrayoutputstream fstream filteroutputstream objectoutputstream outputstream pipedoutputstream ..

2405951
default-value	default
i m using the new in 2.6 built-in function next specifically i m calling next iterator default returns the next item of the iterator and thus the first since this is the first time we re advancing that iterator or the default-value if the iterator s finished which means empty if it s finished before we ever advanced it

2405951
parentheses	keyword
the rounded parentheses and for and if keyword mean this is a generator-expression also known for brevity as genexp

2405973
difference	factors
4 machines each running standards edition one and each with 2 quad-core cpus would have a list price of 8 x 5 800.00 46 400 - a factors of 16 difference

2405973
enterprise	licensing
if you don t have a huge need for database operations across clients and you don t need enterprise edition features and you need this level of cpu power or expect to grow to need this level of cpu power the licensing costs are going to be a huge downside of the one-instance approach

2405976
haskell	python
if you want to turn python into one of the very few languages that allow user-defined infix operators such as haskell you re better off designing a way to alter the syntax dynamically for the purpose implements it as a patch to python parsing and start lobbying for it -- if it improves reliability as much as you say then it shouldn t be that hard to get guido s approval for a clean easy-to-explain implementsation if guido as i suspect should sternly reject it instead then you may want to ponder who s a better judge of language reliability you or the designer of one of the most readable widespread languages

2405979
implements	final
a final example is the fact that timertask implements runnable

2405997
design-time	designer
you could also use visual-studio s designer gui to create a user-controls which is more reusable since you will be able to drag and drop it on to any form at design-time

2406007
decrement	increment
the only .solution i can think of .so far is to have a module importtracking that contains a dictionary importingmodules a function importinprogress file which increment and throw an error if it s greater than 1 and a function importcomplete file which decrement

2406008
ruby	php
my experience has been with programming web apps for apache servers in php and ruby

2406008
webforms	asp.net
.when i got a job maintaining a web .app written in asp.net webforms i dove into learning the microsoft way of building web .apps

2406008
webforms	asp.net
these were all questions that im sure that many web programmers face with asp.net webforms

2406008
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i was used to using asp.net-mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails and cakephp to create web apps the way they were meant to be programmed

2406028
windows-server	windows
i want to make windows service in .net which has to run on windows-server 2003 2008

2406040
spring	guice
.so basically should i stick with tried-and-true spring acegi or try .something based on guice

2406056
python	php
circular import in python are not like php include

2406058
implements	abstract
as said before a friend pointed out that system.windows.forms.form implements a base-class that is abstract

2406060
subclassing	base-class
say i have a base-class with 2 subclassing x and y and one virtual function .so there will be two virtual tables

2406095
any	set
i was thinking it might be better to create one timer equals to the smallest interval in the set of items and then on each updates increment a counter and then checked to see if the counter is now equals to any other intervals

2406097
contains	set
each set contains bunch of checksums

2406103
while-loop	loops
.so in this while-loop example i have used 1 labels for the subroutine and 2 more for loops itself

2406136
.net	wcf
.so the question is does anyone know if it is possible to pass an in-memory certificate to a wcf .net 3.5 service for ssl transport level encryption

2406151
unix	bsd
mac os x was based on bsd unix .so is it possible

2406157
double	int
you can t overload + for int types and similarly you can t overload for double types

2406159
linux	osx	linux	bsd
osx is based on bsd not linux

2406166
primitive	int
unfortunately in java an int is a primitive types and vector can only store object of types object

2406172
imagebutton	imageview
how can i prevent my bitmap from being scale automatically in an imageview or imagebutton if the view or button is stretch using fill_parent or using weight

2406180
processor	cpu
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processor it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encode in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

2406201
updating	updates
if your code does not fall into one of these areas of necessity i wouldn t bother keeping them up-to-date but instead only updates them as necessary as updating from release to release may actually introduce bugs into your application

2406232
logout	login
i have login and logout in the navigation but obviously i should only display the 1 action that makes sense

2406234
contains	any
suppose you want to ask the question does this list of pointss contains any points inside this rectangle

2406239
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
is it possible to programatically create a new panels within a current document that contains duplicates elements

2406239
value	field
i am also interested to learn how these field are identified within the xaml that would allow me to databind or programatically reference the created field-for insert of the value into a database etc

2406255
beautifulsoup	html5lib
the main alternative i think would be html5lib -- i haven t tries it on .app engine but i believe it does run there quite slowly -- if that s a problem i think you need to stick with beautifulsoup this service runs on .app engine and is based on html5lib

2406258
arguments	default
container.remove has an optional second arguments autodestroy which means the component being removed is also destroy permanently for tabpanels this default to true

2406258
hide	show
either pass autodestroy false this can be set at the tabpanel level as well and hide existing components after removing them then simply show them on subsequent click or you ll have to reinstantiate them before adding each time

2406265
datagrid	listbox
you should use a listbox or listview or a datagrid

2406267
itemscontrol	grid
edit as benny says in his answer if you are wanting to display a collections of data then an itemscontrol is definitely a better way to go than programmatically adding to a layout grid

2406288
swing	awt
why don t you learn swing instead of awt then you can use a jtextfield

2406324
getter	setter
modify the getter setter not via configuration though

2406351
toolchain	platform
i d imagine to develop iphone ipod apps on an alternate platform you d need to get apple s include legality is likely to be an issue and apply all their toolchain patches plus a million other things i m probably overlooking

2406353
directory	folder
however i have migrate the mockups folder to the root directory and in implements these rules for the site some files are not being served in the pdfs folder

2406372
base-class	inherited
inorder to make it work .when a depends on x y and z through a reference or a pointers i would need to have a base-class say x_interface from which i can inherited x_real and x_fake

2406374
32-bit	16-bit
.when you try and assign that int to a char there is a possible loss of precision 32-bit signed to 16-bit unsigned

2406402
fieldset	margins
7 which is the majority of my target audience intranet where ie7 is the company standards the list display about 10px below the fieldset which is what the bottom margins of the fieldset is set to

2406410
c++	lua
i m using swig to wrap c++ object for use in lua and im trying to pass data to a methods in my lua scripting but it always comes out as nil

2406411
subscription	in-app
fitnessbuilder implements in-app subscription

2406416
python	java
i want to know in java or python code how to implements the trie particularly the nodes or should i implements it recursively

2406426
contains	elements
children elements within the div might already contains event handler if .so the attach should chaining it

2406459
constructor	object
make a new constructor that takes the button object is a key

2406466
beautifulsoup	mechanize
otherwise you can look at doing it more manually with something like beautifulsoup or mechanize which provides a mechanical browser implementation

2406466
beautifulsoup	mechanize
beautifulsoup and mechanize should both work out of the box on .app engine - it provides a wr.apper around httplib and urllib that uses urlfetch as a backend

2406484
sql-server	oracle
the sql-server 2005+ equivalent to oracle s connect by level is the recursive cte ansi standards btw

2406488
protected	public
the jvm only knows package-protected protected public and private visibility

2406493
environment	execution
you are using the 32-bit scripting hosts they do an excellent job of providing a 32-bit execution environment for com servers

2406499
value	field
where types is any types that has a field called value

2406512
multiplication	subtraction
once you understand what the code does my suggestion would be to implements vector subtraction and multiplication

2406515
decrement	increment
one additional thing to be aware of .when overloading the ++ and -- increment and decrement operators is that there are two versioning of each - the prefix and the postfix forms

2406516
webserver	upload
how do i upload a file from a java servlet to a location on a webserver within tomcat webapps

2406523
linux	unix
assuming you re deploying to a unix linux environment it shouldn t matter much whether you re using git or svn as far as your local development-environment is concerned

2406523
virtualbox	vmware
another good option that you might want to investigate is running linux inside of virtualbox or vmware on your windows machine

2406526
double	int
for example you can typically use the binary + operators to add numeric value floats int double etc.

2406528
triggers	insert
if you use an after insert triggers then you can updates the newly insert row as in the following example

2406540
svnadmin	dump
running the following vbscript to call svnadmin dump fails no dump is being created

2406540
svnadmin	dump
may i know how i can read the output information and also why i needed to create a new cmd interpreter using comspec c before the svnadmin dump cmd would execute correctly

2406544
constructor	object
first make sure that the object you depend on x y z are passed in at the constructor this way you can easily pass in fakes .when you are testing

2406590
authentication	login
i prefer the authentication cookies to contains a timestamp the original login ip to prevent cookies hijacking and to be fully encrypted with a site key

2406592
getter	setter
the second case is better .when you want to provide a setter deleter docstring as well as the getter or if you want to add a properties that has a different named to the methods it derives its value from

2406595
hide	show
if you are sure that at some points the runtime user is going to want to create a datagridview why not create it in advance visually styles it create columns etc. and then hide it .when the form loads then show it on demand

2406595
.when	ready
harvest what you need from the automatically generator code in designer.cs file and then .when you are ready delete the datagridview instances on a form and do your own thing at runtime

2406601
archive	backup
however a more elegant approach might be to scheduling a full backup to a new file with today s timestamp and archive it

2406606
contains	elements
the typical configuration file include a root elements contains attributes that specify the following

2406628
switching	screens
is there a way to switching views in a viewflipper just like on home screens where we have small dots at the bottom of the screens and on click on them we can switching views

2406636
overlap	margins
with dense cases the switching statement might be faster but the switching and the virtual function dispatcher overlap a bit .so while the switching is probably faster the margins is .so small we can t even be sure it is faster not to mention being enough faster to care much about

2406648
.net	wcf
code samples from essential wcf for .net 3.5

2406668
web-inspector	webkit
android uses webkit .so the web-inspector should give you a fairly good idea of how the javascript will perform on an android device

2406675
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
although you tagged as firefox google-chrome safari and opera 10.5 also have support for audio

2406676
primitive	int	decrement	increment
for example if you use the increment decrement operators ++ and -- on an object the compiler will not understand what needs to be increment decrement in the object because it is not a primitive types int char float...

2406676
decrement	increment
operator-overloading basically tells the compiler what must be accomplished .when the increment decrement operators are used with the object

2406676
decrement	increment
also you must pay attention to the fact that there is postfix increment decrement and prefix increment decrement which becomes very important with the notion of iterator and you should note that the syntax for overloading these two types of operators is different from each other

2406676
decrement	increment
here is how you can overload these operators overloading the increment and decrement operators

2406681
listitem	selected
but why the event doesn t fire for the same listitem index .when selected again..

2406690
selected	button
this selecteded all input textarea selected and button elements inside the div

2406697
base-class	inherited
you will model the class the way you have where toddler and oldman inherited from man base-class

2406708
line-endings	newline
but if you know your line-endings will be newline n and not carriage returns r then you are probably safe with a simple one line str_replace

2406708
line-endings	newline
in which case i would suggest normalizing the line-endings first making it consistently the same thing .so we aren t guessing and then replacing those empty line with .some kind of safe token you can go back and replace with your newline

2406708
explode	implode
i would show yet another versioning that may shorter and involves using implode and explode but i m sure that s enough for now

2406721
umask	sudo
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo

2406743
versioning	upgrade
we had lots of tug-of-wars with customers that didn t want to upgrade for whatever reason or wanted to do their own qa on the new versioning

2406749
formatting	printing
you can ask it to pretty-print the ast using its own formatting conventions you can changes these or do fidelity printing which uses the original line and column information to maximally preserve the original layout some change in layout where new code is insert is unavoidable

2406757
any	set
freebase suggest is a jquery plugins that does autocomplete against any of its set of category

2406786
python	java	python	php	python	c++
the sd source code search-engine is an interactive tool for searching source code for many languages c++ c# java php cobol fortran python ...

2406786
keyword	lexical	operators	keyword
it understands the lexical syntax of each language at the same level of detail as the corresponding language compiler .so it knows and can distinguish easily keyword identifier numbers operators punctuation and whitespace

2406786
click	mouse
the search-engine can be given queries in terms of these entities and constraints on their value and will search the code for all matches will display the matches and then will let you inspect source code for each match with a single mouse click

2406839
linux	unix	toolchain	platform
the low-level toolchain for xcode the gcc compiler family the gdb debugger etc. is all open source and common to unix and linux platform

2406839

but the ide--the editor project-management indexing navigation build-systemd graphical debugger visual data-modeling scm systemd refactoring project snapshots etc.--is a mac os x cocoa application and is not portable

2406847
expressionengine	wordpress
is there any cms such as expressionengine or wordpress that allows a user to click a button and convert all the text to another language it would have to be human generator otherwise it has too many mistakes probably

2406848
wamp	php
like c wamp bin php php5.2.8 php.exe sous wamp

2406876
defined	declare
here s part of an answer while you re defining fibonacci it hasn t been defined yet but it has been declare

2406881
decimal-point	digits
also i need to checked if the cents part after decimal-point not more than 2 digits and throw an error messages if exists

2406885
alpha	rgba
rgba include opacity that s the a for alpha --it s not the same as rgb

2406924
linux	bsd
i have a command-line program in nix linux bsd etc.

2406929
beautifulsoup	html5lib
for normalizing html using a pure python libs i have had better experiences with html5lib than beautifulsoup

2406930
decrement	increment
you would write add and other arithmetic methodss possibly increment and decrement as well requiring a methods call such as my_int.add 5

2406936
println	output
for text output you can use java.io.printwriter in which it s println and related methods with parameters output the correct newline sequences for the current platform

2406959
boolean	int
in python you can concatenation boolean value and it would return an int

2406972
ref	out
i did some search on internet and figured out that i need to pass the arrays from c# using ref

2406972
arrays	loops
but if i try to call the function from c# in a loops the second time the input arrays in c# is showing up as an arrays of one elements

2407008
any	set
personally for field that you seldom need and null is an option you should always set the column to allow null and dont set it with any default-value in your db or code

2407013
authentication	login
in this application i am using login form to authentication the users

2407013
authentication	login
only authentication users can login into the systemd

2407018
pascal	delphi
there are free serialization libs for delphi also for free pascal

2407018
json	xml
json and xml are cross-platform cross-language which might be helpful for future interfaces to other systemd like php-based web shop for example

2407021
scrollable	resize
the idea here is to provide an intermediate canvas that gets resize and as a result resize the scrollable area

2407030
default-value	default
if you defined a default-value and happen to forget to set a value in your insert the default will apply and satisfy the not null constraint

2407035
default-value	default
also note that text-align left is a default-value if the directions properties is ltr left to right which is default

2407077
any	set
is there any way to set an istream to different value based on a conditional

2407080
button	popup
i want show a popup dialog box .when i click on to button

how to use ssh scp from the windows command-prompt

2407098
qstandarditemmodel	qtableview
i am having a qtableview that has data loaded with a qstandarditemmodel in the form

2407098
qstandarditemmodel	qtableview	qstandarditemmodel	qwidget	qtableview	qwidget
i know qwidget settaborder qwidget qwidget but since i am setting the data through qstandarditemmodel how can i acheive the desired tab order in qtableview

2407102
constructor	object
in the above function i use a simple regular expression to extraction the digits then i building a new date object using the date constructor with that parts note the date object handles months as 0 based numbers 0-jan 1-feb ... 11-dec

2407107
numeric	digits
they can even be just digits as it is in your case and there s no issue with accessing them with numeric indexes key

2407123
authentication	login
in this application i am using login form to authentication the users

2407123
authentication	login
only authentication users can login into the systemd

2407134
paintcomponent	draw
you can create a bufferedimage and do custom painting on it and then draw the image in your custom paintcomponent ... methods

2407166
python	java	python	ruby
i have very definitively come across the simulating a 6-faced die which produces a random int between 1 and 6 all outcomes are equally probable in java python ruby and bash

2407192
exception-handling	try-catch
unless you use a good ide like eclipse 3.5 which has an auto wrap in try-catch feature auto-detecting any and all exception-handling to

2407192
exception-handling	try-catch
but even wrapping in a try-catch block will usually result in the same output as if you leave the exception-handling uncaught if you simply use e.printstacktrace .

2407216
value	field
once you have your new object and the value and properties named from the database field you could use this

2407245
margins	padding
if you dont want the margins but only want the padding and border just do outerwidth

2407253
selected	checkbox
note that the nodes country city colors blue ... all will be implements as jcheckbox es .so that user can selected particular colors for each city or for the whole country by selecteded their corresponding checkbox

2407253
selected	checkbox
means if a user wants city1.1 to have colors blue and violet and city2.1 to have colors red then he first have to selected the city1.1 checkbox and then selected blue and violet and after that .when he selecteded city2.1 then the checkbox blue and violet are deselecteded automatically .so that user can selected the colors for city2.1

2407305
any	set
after some time messing around with testing pure css and css javascript i m sure you can t set the color of any other elements to the default link-color of the browser - but like machine said you can try using classes to do this but you won t be able to use the browser default you have to set your own colors

2407308
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the elements indic are difirefoxerent in ie and in google-chrome firefox as .eq 2 returns difirefoxerent value depending on browser

2407308
google-chrome	firefox
the elements i m looking for show up as .eq 2 in firefox google-chrome but .eq 3 in ie

2407319
ubuntu	linux
am new in qt programming and i would like to develop a program which i want to run in windows linux ubuntu and mac

now you can use the options and selectedindex field on the javascript representation of your to access the current selected value

2407322
fiddler	charles
try fiddler or charles

2407340
margins	padding
try using padding on the li instead of margins on the div

2407346
decrement	increment
you likely have a memory leak because you call getactiveobject and queryinterface which upon success increment the reference count on the object but don t call release later to decrement the reference count

2407348
windows-mobile	windows-ce
you can use visual-studio to target mobiles have windows-mobile os or windows-ce or pocket pc for other oss you have to see the sdk that the manufacture company provide

2407349
windows-mobile	symbian
windows-mobile and symbian devices natively support c++ and their own proprietary apis but you can use frameworks like qt to make things easier and portable between the two

2407356
versioning	upgrade
our upgrade process now involves building synchronized replicas of the two versioning taking extraction from the livequery logs and playing these against both versioning and comparing the results

2407358
ping	lan
i can ping the lan ip-address

2407365
google-chrome	firefox

2407418
internet-explorer	firefox
i tested this both on firefox 3.6 and internet-explorer 7

2407434
user-interface	drawing
now that you ve optimized your code and minimize the amount of actual user-interface drawing it s safe to set the timertask interval to a lower value such as 50ms .so that you have a smoother timer updates

the most common reason for this fail is that the headers have already been fflush and body output has started before php gets to the header scripting

2409732
display	height	display	width
my problem is that the viewstack does not display the whole content of the containers childs only a part of it and display a vertical scroll although the width is stretch to fill the whole width of the containers hbox why doesn t the viewstack stretch to show the 100 height of its child and does it for the width only

2411440
postgresql	oracle
if this works with oracle and postgresql and my understanding is that it should the customer would only have to setup a datasource which is imo the ideal scenario

2411480
getter	setter
.so any package derived-class that needs or required a quantity may do .so by overrides the getter and setter of the quantity properties

2411483
revision	updates
if you don t want the commit to be visible anywhere you can commit the change updates to the previous revision merge the new branch apply the temporary committed patch and stripes that temporary branch

2411513
asp.net-mvc	wcf
personally i keep it in another project if the data-layer will need to be shared by multiple interfaces asp.net-mvc wcf wpf

2411530
findwindow	sendkeys
i found stuff about using findwindow and sendkeys for this but i donâ t see how thatâ ll work unless the button had a keystroke assign to it which it doesnâ t

2411553
textbox	button
if you don t want to use that you can simply use asp textbox button etc and basically create your own login form

2411561
sniffing	packets
you can use libpcap to help with the packets sniffing

2411568
silverlight	wpf
i see that there is a markers properties on the mediaelement.js but this seems to be available to the silverlight mediaelement.js not the wpf mediaelement.js

2411642
safari	opera
it claims to work in ie opera and safari by simply being a javascript file

2411649
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari - developer-tools

2411658
innodb	myisam
let s say you re adding an index to a couple tables or changing a table types from myisam to innodb or something then with a large enough table those things could be done in 5 to 10 minutes depending on your hardware

2411665
google-chrome	safari
for safari and google-chrome the developer-tools

2411677
mstest	nunit
i have a nice way in between mstest and nunit

2411677
mstest	nunit
you can use the mstest framework to run your test testclass attributes and testmethod attributes for each test but use the nunit assert api

2411680
arguments	default
a fix is to take advantage of the fact that default value for arguments are early-bound as i pointed out about the first issue

2411680
default-value	arguments
now lambda s i is an arguments with a default-value not a free variables looked up by lexical closure any more and .so the code works as intended there are other ways too of course

2411685
constructor	object
you can almost always use the shared singleton approach used by most of the cocoa object that have a singleton constructor

2411695
subtract	add
in sql-server i d just add 1 day to the date and then subtract 1 second

2411696
tasklist	cmd
if i checked the portss in cmd with netstat -a -no there is one entry with ports 80 but it s from ip adress 0.0.0.0 and the corresponding pid i cannot find in the tasklist

2411706
linux	unix	ubuntu	linux
in my current installation apache2 ubuntu linux the line is found in etc apache2 conf.d charset but in other linux unix setups can be in etc apache2 httpd.conf or etc apache httpd.conf if you are using apache 1

2411706
linux	unix
grep -r adddefaultcharset for apache 2 unix linux

2411721
instances	private
for instances the compiler warning warning may not respond to -|+ function appears .when i try to compile the following code which all appears in my implementation file since i desire to create a private static utility function for this class

2411729
contains	elements
if it contains elements that are not supported by the cms the cms should report what those unsupported elements are

2411734
dialog	pop-up
from then on there are several options - one is to bundle it with the release attach a link to the file to one of the project and selected copy local true or to embed it into one of the project and use it in a pop-up - this can be done with the install project or as part of the about dialog

2411743
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
as long as you re comfortable with function-pointers and dynamic-memory-allocation implements most of the principal c++ features is reasonably straightforward in c

2411765
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2411765
perl	ruby
perl java c# and a little ruby are jockying for elbow-space.

2411781
hdpi	mdpi
the android documentation says that best practices are to make two drawable directory - one for hdpi and one for mdpi

2411781
hdpi	mdpi
it al.so says that if the mdpi directory doesn t exist and a mdpi device is running the .app it will scale down the hdpi ones .so everything looks good

2411781
any	set
is there any reason not to just make one high resolution set of graphics

2411791
sql-server	mysql
i d be interested in solutions that work with mysql or ms sql-server

2411827
linux	unix
is there an equivalent cmd on windows for the unix linux sync cmd

2411837
variables	boolean
regular boolean expression are functionally equivalent to cocoa predicates and you can rearrange and assign them cleverly to some nicely-named variables

2411850
inspector	webkit
webkit based browsers have inspector and debugger in menu

2411865
put	get
it would be much simpler to code if get and put were reduced to their bare bones no timeout no no-waits etc and all subqueues used a single overall mutex very small overhead wrt many mutexes and much easier to code in a deadlock-free way

2411870
value	field
this is a data types that gets updates by sql-server internally - you cannot set or insert a value into such a field yourself

2411894
where-clause	sql
in the sql query of linqpad we see the good where-clause

2411897
attributes	properties
i would say to use the xmlserializer and decorator your packets and packetslist class s properties with the appropriate xml-attribute attributes to control the way the output is formatted but since you need to write attributes corresponding to a collections p0 p1 p2 etc. this will not work

2411903
formatting	printing
i need to printing floating-point numbers with the following formatting requirements

2411907
contains	set
unless your text contains huge strings with no breaking characters in them a div should merely set itself to its parent s width as default behavior

2411925
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have tested it in firefox google-chrome safari and ie8

2411927
udp	tcp
if your purpose is to study network-programming and you re more interested in udp versus tcp for instances then udp is a bad choice for a chat application as it does not guarantee much about data-integrity or order

2411936
floor	ceil
chances are you need to learn about floor and ceil too.

2411957
communication	messages
it s fast but if you use it for communication over the internet there s no guarantee your messages will be recieved at all

2411957
packets	lan
even if it s lan your packets can still be lost

2411963
silverlight	wpf
i m not familiar with flex but in wpf silverlight stuff like that would go into the code-behind though for the most part visualstatemanager is more than enough to deal with state animation .so you can keep everything in xaml

2411966
png	gif
i m wondering if thereâ s a way in java or a third party libs to checked the allowed files formats jpg gif and png before reading the entire file

2411972
xmlhttprequest	cors
cross-site xmlhttprequest with cors

2411976

i changed it to -1 and voila the facebook dialog works on safari and firefox all new versioning

2411979
selected	button
i have a program in which a user selected a row in a datagrid and then click a start recording button

2411979
any	set
however .when the datagrid is set to be disabled it deselects the selected row which screws up any binding i have to the datagrid s selecteditem properties

2411979
windows-vista	windows
edit this does not happen in windows-vista but it does in windows 7

2411981
contains	any
for python 3 strings are in fact binary strings and unicode object are the right text object as they can contains any unicode characters

2412005
double-quotes	single-quotes
json key to object dictionary must be quoted using double-quotes not single-quotes

2412008
put	get
note that if you put this in a .bashrc you ll get bitten .when you run sudo since the env variables won t be defined there

2412016
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate sees entity-framework as an old and broken solution and itself as the holy grails

2412024
revision	updates
the usual approach to making sure a javascript file gets updates is embedding it with a get parameter that marks the versioning revision

2412024
revision	updates
.when you updates the scripting s revision and change the get parameter the browser should forget the caching versioning and re-load the file

2412027
webforms	asp.net
i am working on an asp.net webforms application using mvp pattern

2412045
arrays	loops
in c i want to loops through an arrays in this order

2412048
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
while webkit has had a stupidly fast javascript implementation for quite a while and google-chrome even before firefox has only recently got tracemonkey and don t even get me started on internet-explorer

2412061
python	java	python	ruby
python ruby and java are all excellent choices

2412064
configuration	installation
if no the problem is definitly not with zf and is a configuration installation problem of php

2412103
double-quotes	single-quotes
as alex gaynor mentioned your json is invalid since it s using single-quotes rather than double-quotes

2412124
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
i could make shareddata of types concurrenthashmap but do the hashmap it contains also have to be of types concurrenthashmap

2412134
constructor	object
if the date string has the tz info why do i have to supply a tz object in the datetime constructor and again with settimezone

2412141
python	ruby
i ve been writing a couple of apps which use c# as the gui but under the hood do all the work via scripting which may be python ruby etc.

2412160
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
each individual hashmap contains in your outer hashmap is not guaranteed to be thread safe unless you use concurrenthashmap as suggested in your question

2412164
java.util.concurrent	guava
the contents of the map is not thread safe because it needs to be either wrapped with preferably a guava immutablemap implementation or java.util.collections.unmodifiablemap or use one of the map implementation in the java.util.concurrent

2412164
contains	any
any contains maps need to be immutable or one of the concurrent implementation as well

2412170
put	get
if you are trying to make a certain order traversal of your arrays more efficient you could always transform the incoming matrix before you put it into the arrays and then do the transform again .when you get it out

2412171
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you should use mouseenter and mouseleave

2412171
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve had this same problem before and using mouseenter mouseleave fixed it

2412178
fflush	gets
you must use fflush after each println or activate automatic fflushing on the printwriter .so the data gets really sent

2412215
python	php
i had to come back to web development at my new job and if not pylons python maybe i would have chosen to live in jungle instead in my subjective opinion php is for kindergarten i did it in my 3rd year of uni and i believe many self-respecting or over-estimating software engineers will not want to be bothered with php code

2412215
python	php
the website still is and will be php but we are developing other applications including web in python

2412216
portrait	screens
for example if the phone is in portrait mode i want this home screens widget to be 2 cell 2 cell on the home screens

2412240
intel-mkl	eigen
i decided upon using eigen and trying intel-mkl under linux one day

2412247
datagridview	listview
i accomplished this by simply deriving from the necessary control classes in my case from listview to doublebufferedlistview and from datagridview to doublebuffereddatagridview

2412247
datagridview	listview
for the recording this is not a simple matter of calling beginupdate endupdate already doing that on listbox and listview controls or suspendlayout resumelayout already doing that for the datagridview control as well although i don t think that s even particularly important since as i said i m just updating the value in certain cell

2412262
stderr	stdout
read scripting stdout and stderr into separate buffering until scripting terminate

2412265
instances	self
.when you use the colon in function ai unitcreated unit it creates a hidden self parameter that receives the ai instances

2412285
getter	setter
its getter and setter manipulate the ismale properties value

2412293
required	checked
do read the docs or source to checked whether any given methods required the entire file or can operate on the first few bytes

this week iâ m going to try and start the move from windows-xp to windows 7 on my development pc at work

2412320
checkbox	button
you can have a checkbox radio button dropdownlistfor et

2412330
tiff	png
if you want to stick with what s in java you probably have to use tiff png or jpeg -- there are third party image endcoders for example my company atalasoft makes a .net versioning of these advanced encoders -- there are java vendors out there as well

2412344
directory	folder
if i have a development area that i deleted files from a certain folder directory .when i import them back into the repository on the server is svn supposed to remove the deleted files on the server too

2412372
json	xml
but i think the cmd can only deal with files in xml yaml python or json format see here

2412374
required	checked
of course it required some error checked

2412390
contains	any
b if yes -- how is o.gettypes able to extraction the metadata about o since programâ s assembly doesnâ t contains any metadata on types t here iâ m assuming that object.gettypes consults assemblyâ s metadata .when trying to gt information about particular types

2412420
display	width
i want to display 4 or 5 boxes vary which occupy s 100 of the page width .so it will span start to end of page

2412428
jquery	dojo
you might want to look into using processing.js for visual needs and either dojo or jquery for your core

2412445
reflection	runtime
reflection is not the fastest way to go but it s an easy way to get runtime flexibility

2412446
directory	folder
you will have to make the new virtual directory be an application .so it can have its own bin folder

2412455
filtering	grouping
you can grouping filtering and sort items based on various field

2412462
xsd	xml
you could building an xsd schema for your xml and using the xsd.exe tool you could generator the class in which your xml could be deserialized into it

2412472
authentication	login
login form or authentication user info cant be display statically

2412478
any	set
if you open the file with vim and use the ex cmd set list it will show you any invisible characters that may be causing this issue

2412516
postback	ajax
this can be done using an ajax callback to the server assuming you are trying to avoid a postback

2412520
put	get
i am able to get a very similar example of a chat client-server from the boost site working but .when i attempt to put the code into my own program it stops working

2412531
attributes	properties
first create an attributes used to mark the decimal properties you need

2412538
instances	private
as far as the general question of using the private properties instances variables by itself over the public getter i don t see any advantage by using the getter

2412563
constructor	object
i m creating an object data-access-layer that takes 2 interfaces in the constructor iunitofwork and irealtimerepository

2412566
environment	execution
most likely your execution environment is not set up in the right way textmate does not know how to execute a perl scripting and display the results to you

2412575
selected	button
click the series button and selected ser for the series

2412576
display	height	display	width
i use some similar code but it handles different fonts sizes up to 10 000 and takes into account the available height as well as width of the area the text is being display in

2412610
textbox	button	contains	set
it contains a form a button and a textbox to show a songtitle set by pressing the button

2412611
annotations	mapping
since i have ejb3 annotations files as my grails domain classes i had to create my own hibernate.cfg.xml for the mapping

2412617
ubuntu	debian
you can also use auto-apt . configure on ubuntu and probably also on debian

2412622
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
on paper binary arithmetic is simple but as a beginning programmer i m finding it a little difficult to come up with algorithms for the addition subtraction multiplication and division of binary numbers

2412626
subtract	division
getting the day of week from such a numbers is as simple as subtract and getting the remainder of a division

2412678
highlight	selected
i want the text to highlight whenever a user selected that box

2412678
click	mouse
by either tabbing or mouse click

2412689
selected	button
use a repeater for the data lists and cmd button for selected and deleting

2412719
filesystems	hardlink
remember in mercurial that clones are incredibly fast and cheap -- on modern filesystems they use hardlink under the covers .so they re not even taking up much spaces on disk

2412725
positioning	slider
.when i mouseout the slider is reversed back to it s original positioning

2412725
toggle	slider
any ideas on this i was thinking of using the slider and toggle methods maybe

2412734
webforms	asp.net
i usually use asp.net webforms for gui maybe one of most stateful technologies

2412734
haskell	c++
not like monads in haskell but which can be used in more traditional business applications and languages - java c# c++

2412754
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it should depend heavily on whether you re using webforms or asp.net-mvc

2412761
sql-server	mysql
al.so i don t have mysql install .so i tried this in ms sql-server but it should be pretty close

2412776
selected	button	click	mouse	highlight	selected
if i click a nodes to selected it .when the mouse button is depressed the background is draw correctly with the highlight color

2412803
python	java
the referenced page gives examples in java and python

2412839
uilabel	uiview	order	add
in the meantime you could construct a custom uiview with uilabel and colored line to act as the legend for the graphing then add it as a sibling to the graphing not a subviews or it will not be rendering properly and order it to show above the graphing

2412843
switching	screens
keeping in mind a memory usage and b time to switching screens

2412845
country-codes	iso
checked iso 3166-1 for country-codes

2412846
e-commerce	product
every time i building an e-commerce application i need to invest a considerable amount of time into categorising product

2412863
selected	listbox
i want to pass the multiple selecteded value from listbox as parameters to my selected sql query

2412892
e-commerce	product
sometimes they may even classify product differently based on who the customer is and how much they like them but you can t do that on a public e-commerce site

2412893
32-bit	64bit
updates after .some more reading i see that this problem is totally general you can t mix architectures in the same process .so 64bit java cannot dlopen a 32-bit libs like fmod

2412893
32-bit	64bit
shouldn t it be possible to get a 64bit dylib from my source code that dynamically include 32-bit libs

2412909
z-index	overlap
but even though the dialog s z-index and that of its containers are higher than that of the equation editor the editor still overlap the dialog in ie6 and 7

2412911
put	get
other ways are to mark a project id in cookies but that kills linking .so that as .someone leaves and comes back they get put back there

2412914
selected	listbox
probably the best way to start is to iterate through the listbox and get only the items that are selected

2412920
python	java
i have had good success in java and python using this

2412928
overlapping	z-index
if your overlapping elements is absolute you either need the new elementss containers at a higher z-index or absolutely positioning the new elementss

2412937
dialog	pop-up
.so you would just have your menu item action display a pop-up dialog or .something like that

2412969
attributes	properties
i then specify the class attributes of the tag to be the types of object i passed in with all the object s properties serialization into the tag s attributess

2412970
implements	extends
he means that you can extends the class android.widget.textview or canvas or some other renderable surface and implements your own overrides versioning that allows embedded images with text flowing around them

2412983
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
the web-inf web.xml file is the web application deployment-descriptor of your application

2412999
subclassing	base-class
thats ok if you only create one subclassing but you need to be very conscious of that and the fact that any 3rd party libs you call don t also use the same base-class for the singleton they create but you don t know about

2412999
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
worrying about whether to overrides alloc or allocwithzone is again a subclassing thing but really anyone who inherited from a singleton superclass and then screws around with its allocation methods deserves the bad behavior they get

2413005
vim-plugin	nerdtree
i ve just started using the nerdtree vim-plugin for my project

2413008
spring-roo	spring-mvc
you may find interesting the spring-roo project which creates a spring-mvc based project directly on the ide or via the command-line

2413009
compression	streaming
the compression is done on the java side as we streaming into the blob

2413011
dictionary	arrays
your dictionary class contains an arrays of pointers

2413021
attributes	properties
to set the correct properties you should match named of the properties with data saved in the attributes on the properties of the user s object

2413032
filtering	sorting
the code below completely works for sending receiving json parameters from and to jqgrid inorder to have correct paging sorting filtering with single search only utilizing linq

2413032
any	set
those parameters will still be set correctly .when you actually do a search and then reset to empty .when you reset or want the grid to not do any filtering

2413041
required	checked
this required some special checked at a couple of points but overall the hack isn t too intrusive

2413048
value	field
if it will be kicked off .when a field on the parent entity changes to a certain value then do this

2413048
value	field
the first step should be to wait until the relevant field on the parent entity has the correct value

2413052
webforms	asp.net
from personal experience i should mention that asp.net webforms is technically very hard to test

2413052
webforms	asp.net
to overcome that i would suggest to apply mvp pattern for asp.net webforms

2413052
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as opposed to webforms asp.net-mvc is .so much easier to test

2413075
modularity	paradigms
the modularity stuff is great - you basically code up individual project as if they were miniature .applications in their own right and you rely on the region management paradigms to composite your multiple modules into one cohesive .app

2413077
windows-xp	windows
on two windows-xp machines and two windows 2000 machines this works fine

2413097
derived-class	base-class
i would think that if the const qualification of the parameter affects the types of the function i should get this error if the const qualification of the parameter in the derived-class virtual function does not match the const qualification of the parameter in the base-class virtual function

2413097
double	int
if i change the types of derived foo s parameter from an int to a double i get the following warning in addition to the aforementioned error c2259

2413111
arrays	loops
it s using multiple function-calls and arrays are passed around by value by default but those functions are operating at native-code speeds while solutions using loops are going to be running at php speed

2413131
solaris	linux
after you downloading it in a src folder you have windows solaris shared linux

2413141
required	checked
required checked code to determine

2413149
http	ssl
first if you re not familiar with ssl self-signed certificates keytool key store trust store in one words pki i d suggest to start with the fifteen minute guide to mutual-authentication and java secure http client key management

2413150
any	set
this gives me back all project that have any of the parts thus the result set is project a b c and d

2413150
where-clause	sql
the sql where-clause generator looks something like

2413153
postback	ajax
if you want to call a methods at will in respond to user action you can either triggers a postback or use ajax to make an asynchronous call to the server side code

2413166
stderr	stdout
to redirect and append stdout and stderr to a file while also display it on the terminal i do this

2413175
eigen	gsl
in addition to mentioned ones from which i prefer gsl and eigen there is also simple libs called tnt which is very nice for simple tasks

2413187
hide	show
i have divs show and hide with an animation using the following scripting i include the jquery libs

2413208

upon troubleshooting it seemed that the only thing new about the environment which was previously working fine was the installation of webex on the client machine

2413286
ellipse	line
imagine there s a lot of classes for specific curve types ellipse circle arc line bezier etc.

2413297

2414004
groovy	java
i am hoping to use groovy more as a functional language than i can with java but one area that seems to be a problem is .when i call to a stored procedure as i am passing perhaps 40 parameters in a single call but i also need to do some prep work at the moment before i even call

2414014
ironpython	ironruby
if you absolutely have to use both languages in a project your best option would probably the combinations of jython and jruby or ironpython and ironruby

2414619
contains	elements
if the aggregate or union contains elements or members that are aggregate or union these rules apply recursively to the subaggregate or contains union

2414619
contains	elements
if the initializerr of a subaggregate or contains union begins with a left braces the initializerr enclosed by that braces and its matching right braces initializer the elements or members of the subaggregate or the contains union

2414619
contains	elements
otherwise only enough initializer from the list are taken to account for the elements or members of the subaggregate or the first member of the contains union

2414619
contains	any	contains	elements
any remaining initializerr are left to initializer the next elements or member of the aggregate of which the current subaggregate or contains union is a part

2414622

2414744
nested-loops	arrays
depends on the size of your input arrays several tradeoffs there -- your nested-loops are simplest for small input like your examples

2414744
arrays	map	arrays	loops
if you have huge arrays and have control over their construction consider keeping a map object in javascript around acting as a lookup set if you re creating a in a loops anyways you can building the set in parallel.

2414746
linux	bsd
some oses like linux or bsd are better but they still can not maintain accurate timing resolution to sub-microsecond for example the accuracy of nanosleep on linux is about 1 ms not less than 1 ms except you patch the kernel to some specific scheduling that give your application benefits

2414746
processor	affinity
you can get better accuracy by running you timer pooling routine inside a separate thread and set that thread affinity to one core processor and set the thread priority the highest you can get

2414771
groovy	java
first of all if you use joint compilation your java code will be able to interact with your groovy code easily

2419123
reflection	runtime
technically i could solve this with a base interface tablecolumn below and reflection but i don t really like that as apart from trading compile-time errors to runtime errors it makes the code ugly to me

2419146
python	c++
for the numerical calculations i do writing straight c++ is just faster than using straight python

2419155
http	ssl
whether that works for you or not depends on why you need ssl with stunnel your client webbrowser will think it s http but asp.net cassini won t

2419157
difference	zero
such optimization is normally not used in c++ applications the standard-library implementation .so do not expect to get any difference between allocation a std vector filled with zero versus .some other value

2419163
ubuntu	linux
just wondering if there is any benchmarking software that i can downloading that will run on both windows preferable windows 7 and linux ubuntu 9.10

2419196
required	checked
before running the methods i d like to checked if all required class-variables are initializer

2419209

2419210
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
it is less expressive than perl ruby python etc

2419210
python	c++
it is not as if we will all move to python one day and c++ will be retired

2419213
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
why aren t python ruby and php written in itself

2419232
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
catching an illegalargumentexception to rethrow another runtimeexception with a clearer messages might look like a good idea but it is not

2419237
implements	extends
given that statusnet implements an api very similar to twitter i could probably modify extends twitterizer to do just that

2419243
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
the latter actually is one of the reasons the calloc function exists on some platform it can be implements significantly more efficiently than a mere malloc followed by a memset to zero

2419256
any	set
alternatively set any header you want using .ajaxsetup like this

2419258
linux	unix
what s your best written most complete source on unix linux pthreads signals

2419260
perl	c++
there was a time .when c++ was used to write web-applications which quickly gave way to perl scripting because the trade-off between production and performance

2419274
g++	gcc
in that case it sounds like your gdb is out of date compared to your gcc g++ versioning

mobile-devices	tablet
it s going to be in all nokia and intel mobile-devices smartphones netbooks tablet

2419286
constructor	object
.when you initializer a new object by calling constructor

2419286
constructor	object
.when does the code in the constructor actually gets invoked in relations to object creation heap

2419324
updating	updates
updates after playing around with this for a few hours went with a multi-query solution and used a table that only contains parent attributes to determine which items needed updating

2419328
javascript	dom
it offers a lot of flexibility and has a very broad reach but at the end of the day you are still working with the dom and will be limited to what can be accomplished using javascript and angle brackets

2419339
hide	show
i have tried programmatically hiding one and showing the other with hide and show but the problem is that the hidden widget occupies spaces in my qgraphicslinearlayout even .when it s hidden leaving an empty gap

2419339
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
however i am working with a qgraphicsscene and .so my widget don t inherited from qwidget but rather qgraphicswidget .so i can t add them to a qstackedwidget

2419341
cross-validation	svm
.so instead of training and doing cross-validation for an svm with a value x for your c parameter then doing all of that again for value x+1 for c x+2 etc

2419345
constructor	object
you may want to change the constructor on productsdal .so that the mandatory field have to be set .so that it is not possible to create productsdal object that do not have their id and description set

2419371
aggregate	grouping
in postgresql for example you would get an error that story_id is not part of an aggregate query and not in the grouping by clause .so it wouldn t know what row to return

2419377
nsundomanager	undo-redo
i have a core data document-based .app which support undo-redo via the built-in nsundomanager associated with the nsmanagedobjectcontext

2419378
arguments	default	visio-vba	visio
by default in visio-vba any public subs with no arguments get added to the visio tools- macros menu in a folder namedd by the document holding the macros in this case macros and then separated into folder by module named

2419378
macros	vba
i m not sure of any other ways to execute the macros interactive with vba

2419379
arrays	loops
loops through each elements in the arrays

2419391
configuration	environment
i m trying to work out how to stop ruby-on-rails unloading my module at the end of the request or alternatively find another way to cleanly provide environment specific configuration for my modules

2419393
getter	setter
it then has getter methods to expose these value but no setter methods. the stockmarketdata class is basically a holder for stock market data value

2419393
constructor	private	constructor	object
1 my current implementation make the central calculatestockmarketdata methods private and call it from the stockmarketdata methods constructor passing today s date .so that whenever you have a stockmarketdata object it s already filled

2419399
digits	base
it s similar to how count works except the base for each digits can be different

2419423
buffering	streaming
of course those are not silver bullet for streaming media it s pointless to use output buffering or response size

2419426
pointers	stack
using a pointers or reference to a function s local stack variables after that function has returned

2419426

i am using inno-setup in windows and an .application bundle in osx but i have no idea how to get my .app install in linux are there any opensource install creators for linux

2419435
command-line	cmd
that include the cmd of every rules execute in the building whether or not was used to prevent make from printing the command-line

2419442
constructor	object
passing this to another methods object from inside the constructor can be rather dangerous

2419442
constructor	object
many guarantees that object usually fulfill are not necessarily true .when they are looked at from inside the constructor

2419442
value	field
for example if your class has a final non- static field then you can usually depend on it being set to a value and never changing

2419442
constructor	object
.when the object you look at is currently execution its constructor then that guarantee no longer holds true

2419450
constructor	object
calling a database from a constructor can make for difficult debugging more fragile inflexible code and cause performance problems if your usage of the object changes

2419464
constructor	object
i think it is best to use the constructor for creating a valid object and then execute the actual business-logic in another public methods your #2 .so that the construction of the object can happen at a different time than the actual business-logic

2419465
caliburn	prism
with silverlight and the frameworks that are available prism caliburn etc you can produce incredibly flexible and scalability uis .so that gets a big thumbs up from me

2419465
silverlight	wpf
with a good pattern mvvm being the most powerful and common in silverlight wpf these layer should be able to interact well and should provide a good architecture for your project

vhdl	rtl
first the vhdl is analyzed inorder to detection rtl templates consisting in rtl elements flip-flops arithmetic-expressions multiplexers control logic

2419484
constructor	private	value	field
my question is how would i write a constructor that sets private field of the class to the value received

2419484
constructor	private	value	field
.so if i have example 12002 digestive 83 i need a constructor that sets private field of the class to these value received

2419485
debian	rpm	ubuntu	debian
you can also provide distribution specific install like a rpm on redhat or centos or deb for debian ubuntu although once you have the makefile spitted by autotools making these is a breeze

2419485
autotools	gnu
autotools also known as the gnu build-systemd is a little scary on the first sight and the new user is puzzled .when meeting things like the ancient m4 macros systemd co

2419496
document-ready	.when
then read window.location.hash .when the document-ready event fires and react to any elements id in there

2419512
any	set
this would mean the value is untouchable from the properties if a set operation is attempted it won t do any damage and should still bind.

2419530
silverlight	wpf
i ve seen a silverlight solution that involves the usage of merged dictionary to shared files between silverlight and wpf project but it s not clear to me that this would even apply to my wpf + image issue

2419549
background-image	background-color
here iâ m using the same background-image but the different background-color and image repeat should show you that itâ s three different elements

2419549

in windows 7 if you go to control panels add remove programs turn windows features on or off there is a microsoft .net 3.5.1 wcf non http activation item

2419637
buffering	streaming
in your program the printf output is buffering to the standards output streaming of your c program

2419637
buffering	streaming
then the output of date is buffering to its own standards output streaming

2419639
selected	textbox
if the user selected to edit the recording i enable the form to accept changes and since it is mainly textbox i just change the readonly properties of those

2419644

whatever value one selected from the context menu the textbox then display that value

2419880
protected	public
one of the rulesets i believe from stylecop enforces putting public functions first then protected static then protected then private static and finally private

2419880
protected	public
what is stylecop s reasoning for wanting the public protected private order

2419890
numeric	zero
i would like to create a function that checked if a numeric value passed as an arguments has a value greater than zero

2419890
numeric	zero
can i try to cast the object passed as the function s arguments to one numeric data types .so i can then compare it to zero rather than checked for each types in my if-statement

2419896
any	set
the contract says .when it fails getlasterror is set to a meaningful value it does not say that the last error value has any meaning to the caller .when createdibsection does return

i m writing a scripting to output google-analytics-api data and insert it into a bar-chart using google charts api

2420043
memmove	memcpy
i am making a simple byte buffering that stores its data in a char arrays acquired with new and i was just wondering if the memcpy and memmove functions would give me anything weird if used on memory acquired with new or is there anything you would recommend doing instead

2420054
value	field
in wordpress you ll notice that it automatically knows this and assign a named and mail field value through cookies

2420057
any	set
the perforce review daemons is just a python scripting available here that runs on the server or any machine for that matter and polls check-ins on a regular interval and then mails users based on what they have set in the review field of their clientspec

2420065
nested-loops	arrays
if this is guaranteed to be the case in reality you should do as andrey says and use nested-loops on the arrays themselves breaking if .when you find an inequal pair of entries

2420072
memmove	memcpy
using memcpy memmove should work fine on that kind of data

2420079
firefox	safari
it worked in safari but not in firefox this cuts out too many customers for the website i m designing for

jquery	.post
i have written a blog .post on this using carmen and jquery

2420096
modifiers	final
i can see that collections.unmodifiableset returns an unmodifiable view of the given set but i don t understand why we can t just use the final modifiers to accomplish this

2420097
pointers	stack
as soon as you have a valid variables in your hand allocated by new malloc or on stack it is just a pointers to memory hence memcpy and other functions from this family will work as expected

2420111
postback	ajax
if javascript is on you will process onsubmit and do an ajax call to save the file if javascript is off you will do a full page postback and save the file from the server-side

i am insert a value into all field apart from the personid column set to identity increment

2420124
value	field
where all field return a value no null value

2420134
wordpress-plugin	wordpress
i am looking for preferably a wordpress-plugin as the site is built-in wordpress already that would make managing thousands of pages a lot easier

2420136
children	tree	children	nodes
as you descend down your parsing tree you ll probably want to send whatever the new root nodes is .so that children can be added to it

2420136
children	tree	children	nodes
since the parsing function returns the root nodes which will reference any and all children nodess you ll have full access to the parsing tree after parsing

2420154
implements	super
i think it s super lame to implements two cmd handler and it certainly won t scale well if you have to add more email sources

2420165
formatting	printing
if you need some rigid formatting or want to printing something like a words .doc or pdf you need to just push the user the file and allow them to handle printing it on their own

2420179
python	php
i don t blame you the built-in soap libs for php is complete and total embarrassment especially .when compared to python web-services

2420180
thickbox	jquery
i have what is hopefully a quick question about using thickbox and jquery to display an overlay video on a website

2420190

i appreciate the technical side of reformatting but i am points out that there is risk involved in anything non-trivial and unless you put the right person on it it might get mucked up

2420208
click	mouse
if you don t want to lose focus then you will have to temporary take a screensshot of the whole screens and display that in a screens filling windows which listens for a mouse click as usual

2420212
shell	bash
i hope you ve got your apache log types set to combined and a bash shell at your disposal

2420214
thickbox	jquery
you can use jquery s plugins to get the query-string information and then call the thickbox to load appear in your event -

2420217
sql-server	mysql
if they are different backup the cake directory on the sql-server instances and replace it with the one from mysql

2420217
linux	unix
hopefully you have unix or linux because grep -r in will help you out immensely

2420218
hash	md5
take a hash md5 should be good enough of the building before and after the reformatting - if it s the same for every file that clearly means it can t have altered behavior

2420230
derived-class	base-class
a derived-class function explicit overridess a base-class virtual function having the same named parameter-type-list and cv-qualification by using the function modifiers overrides with the program being ill-formed if no such base-class virtual function exists

2420234
curly-braces	braces
think of if-statement without curly-braces and 2 statements within those imaginary braces

2420248
versioning	migrate
it seems as though to use it in a production application where my schema changes i would want to write a scripting to migrate data from versioning x to versioning x+1 and then in versioning x+2 actually remove the properties i am trying to get rid of for versioning x+1 as i cannot write a javascripting to modify properties that no longer are part of my types

2420252

adding the border-color attributes programmatically does not use an inline styles but uses the html border-color properties which browsers apply to all borders inside the table.

2420366
value	field
what you need to do to convince these applications that you have in fact generator a click is to explicit set the value of the click state field on the mouseup event to 1 it default to 0

2420366
mousedown	mouseup
as an aside if you were simulating a double click you would need to set the click state to 2 for both the mousedown and mouseup events of the second click.

2420387
perl	php
i cannot run any service on my hosting provider they only allow php or perl scripting

2420389
value	field
as far as i understood the static initialization block is used to set value of static field if it cannot be done in one line

2420389
value	field
for example we declare a field as static without a value assignment

2420389
value	field
and then write several line of the code which generator and assign a value to the above declare static field

2420402
hide	show
and use the show hide methods.

2420422
aggregate	grouping
if you find a way to extraction the information you need - grouping and sum once and then store that aggregate data into a separate fact table - you should have both fast and quick queries on the dailytimecard table and the rest of your systemd should be less burdened with keeping the indexed view up to-date all the time

2420434
javascript	dom
that is a dom function called with javascript

2420436

jquery	.post
it seems like the jquery is aborted midway as any alert i put in the .post or ajax callback functions are being ignore

2420553
sigaction	signals
.so my suggestion in this case is man sigaction man signals

2420568
value	field
.when total sum is changed manually the value is distribute to pull field

2420569
callback	methods
then you should write c-style callback that extraction that object by calling fmod_channel_getuserdata and then call your c++ instances methods on that object

highlight	selected
what i observed .when watching the default windows behavior was that the text and highlight weren t draw until the nodes was selected and had focus

2420694
decrement	increment	unspecified-behavior	undefined-behavior
even more important since it results in undefined-behavior not just unspecified-behavior is that you generally can t use an operands to the increment decrement operators more than once in an expression

2420694
expression	evaluation
between the previous and next sequences points an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

2420716
emacs	vim
alternatively if you use the vim or emacs xemacs editor they have cscope support built-in

2420716

2420796
mousedown	mouseup
one thing you should al.so do is set the click count properly on both the mousedown and mouseup events like .so

2420796
click	mouse
see also simulating mouse click on mac os x does not work for some applications

2420803
arrays	loops
over time the data for all the tests is getting larger for each iterator .so of course by iterator 100 the array_key methods is faster because it ll always have the same key where as the foreach loops has to contend with an ever growing dataset and store the value in arrays

2420813
remote-debugging	debugging
for those who really want to know i m insert code at runtime into linux kernel data spaces inside a viewmodelware viewmodel and debugging it from gdb remote-debugging the kernel via viewmodelware-workstation s built-in gdb stubs

2421165
realloc	malloc
and it returns a std string .so you would have to use malloc realloc to handle that

2421195
perl	awk	python	perl
otherwise for trivial searches any scripting-language like perl python or even awk suffices

2421218
firefox	safari
in the browsers i ve tried firefox 3.5.8 and safari 4.0.4 no object has a checkvalidity methods .so i can t run the validation even though i can defined them

below is the code that i m using in ms-access to list the data according to what is selected in combobox and what is input in textbox

2421371
webserver	nginx
one of the most practical simple changes i made to web log analyzing was to leave the default ncsa log format produced by the nginx webserver to instead use tab as the field separator

2421375
n-gram	words
second the reason i got into the n-gram approach is that i don t want to limit the words count n to a specific length

2421375
minimum	max
the only problem with this example is that you have to specify the minimum words pattern length and i want it to be dynamic from 2 to max found

2421377
variables	boolean
pressing 9 boolean variables incoming_message is used for ultra-simple simulation for your server-messages

2421401

2421402
filesystems	fat
and fat is a simple enough filesystems that you can crawl through it with nothing but a hex editor and some patience

2421404
document-ready	.when
what happen to me is that the tag are generator by .some other scripting .so .when document-ready fire up it cant register click event to checkbox since these checkbox are not really there yet

2421414
any	set
you usually don t have to do this in plone as it is set up to triggers the javascript asynchronously .so it shouldn t block any rendering which is what the performance tip is about

2421420
exception-handling	try-catch
i d encourage you to expand upon this by implements a try-catch and handling exception-handling

2421422
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

2421441
aggregate-functions	sum
this is because .when we grouping by two columns it is saying grouping them .so that all of those with the same subject and semester are in the same grouping and then calculate all the aggregate-functions count sum average etc. for each of those groupinging

2421453
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
you do not implements your own sorting algorithm if quicksort mergesort and heapsort is available

2421453
any	set
for anyone who will give it a try to implements a good parsing language the smallest set of operators to directly transform any input data to any output data if

2421473
firefox	safari
this works in firefox i can t vouch for safari

2421478
any	set
since they are both just a set of directory on the windows-server filesystems you can use any directory comparison tool

2421484
litespeed	apache
although not exhaustive the possible return value include aolserver apache apache2filter apache2handler caudium cgi until php 5.3 cgi-fcgi cli cli-server continuity embed isapi litespeed milter nsapi phttpd pi3web roxen thttpd tux and webjames

2421492
nested-class	inherited
i ve often seen statements to the effect that there is nothing special about a nested-class compared to an unnested-class but in this example one can see that a nested-class at least according to gcc 4.4 can see the public typedef of a class that is privately inherited by the closing class

2421499
c-preprocessor	macros
is there a way to make the gnu c-preprocessor cpp or some other tool list all available macros and their value at a given points in a c file

2421536
lookup	any
join recordinging for lookup and general denormalization recording building akin to sql join but applicable to any input of reasonnable size

2421536
csv	xml
standards components will only read generics file-format xml rss csv fixed len dbmses... therefore structured or semi-structured

2421536
python	java
you d therefore need to write your own parsing logic in python or java respecting the snaplogic api of course .so the module can later play nice with the other ones

2421555
textbox	button
i want to use some kind of triggers to change a button in my windows to .when the textbox properties validation.haserrors of my textbox is true

2421558

2421578
defined	declare
classes 9.1 9.7 and enumerations 7.2 defined in the class and arbitrary types declare as members by use

2421580
selection	cell
the trick here is to add the transparency view to the cell s backgroundview and set the cell selection styles to none

2421590
private-members	private	access-specifier	base-class	derived-class	base-class	protected	public
... if a class is declare to be a base-class for another class using the private access-specifier the public and protected members of the base-class are accessible as private-members of the derived-class

2421595
selected	button
once i selected multiple items for deletion i will allow users to press a button called delete selectedion

2421595
dialog	pop-up
if user presses the button a javascript dialog box will pop-up asking user to confirm the deletion

2421611
dictionary	arrays
in many simple cases like the one in your question it is convinient use most natural representation of tables in objective-c arrays of dictionary

2421611
dictionary	arrays
table is indexed collections of recordinging - .so it is an arrays and each recording is collections of key-value pairs - .so it is a dictionary

2421616
configuration	environment
we have 2 different server environment using the same hibernate configuration

2421616
jndi	jdbc
i have also tried to put the direct jdbc configuration together with jndi configuration into the configuration file but it looks like hibernate always favors jndi over direct jdbc configuration if both exist

2421618
boolean	int
types one of string int hexcolor boolean

2421618
default-value	default
on creation each setting is assign a types the readonly flag default to false and a default-value

2421623
command-line	cmd
if you don t want to go that route you can use the execute task to executeute command-line cmd to perform those operations for you

2421624
perl	php	perl	awk	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
any programming language that allows you to open and read files do string text manipulations can be used eg perl python g awk ruby php even java etc

2421650
textbox	button
in this case the styles is reusable for other button and textbox pairings

2421690
.war	jar
i ve been using the same approach as jens on a numbers of project both with maven 2.2.1 and now with maven 3.0-alpha-6 pom modules defined the module structure of your project tree jar .war modules are the leaves of the tree

2421690
contains	any
for instances if you decide that a jar module required sub-modules you will need to convert the existing jar module into a pom module and then distribute its contents to the newly created jar sub-modules as pom modules cannot contains any code themselves

2421707
configuration	environment
we have 2 different server environment using the same hibernate configuration

2421707
configuration	environment
well it may not be the expected answer but i have the feeling that you are creating the problem yourself here if your environment are different use different configuration

2421730
double-quotes	single-quotes
single-quotes indicate a character as opposed to a string which is wrapped in double-quotes

2421737
attributes	properties
the control s uniqueid properties is rendering as the named attributes

it just has to translation math written in latex into math written in mathml

2421792
widget	button
the button that display the widget is inside a table

2421797
linux	unix
these unix linux command-line tools may look scary to a windows person but there are reasons for people who love them

arguments	default
if an undeclared function is called the compiler will assume that it returns int and it will pass argumentss to it after subjecting them to .so called default arguments promotions

2421838
double	int
but later it discovers that it is actually a void prn double int

2421840
mathml	latex
latex2html is about as good as you re going to get and here s an old description of a latex to mathml converter from the maintainer of latex2html

2421845
node.js	django
i have done some work on a pretty complete ports of the django templates language for simon willisons djangode project utilities functions for node.js that borrow some useful concepts from django

2421851
mousedown	mouseup
the display is safe to move to mouseup instead of mousedown

2421851
click	mouse
the trick is actually reading the named of all of the events -- yes i know there are a lot -- then making a list of the interesting ones in your case you named selectedindex changing and mouse click

2421864
textbox	button
now with this i can set the button styles to disabled .when validation errors occur in the email textbox but i want to do it also .when it occurs in other textbox in my windows

2421882
json	xml
activeresource gives you a choice of json or xml as the wire format

2421885
fatal-error	error-log
the only way to get a fatal-error to display edit outside the error-log is to set in your php-ini file

2421900
textbox	button
a better approach however may be instead of binding the button directly to other user-interface elements have your data object -- the same object that your textbox are binding to -- expose an isvalid properties with suser-interfacetable change notifications and bind your button.isenabled to that

2421909
google-chrome	opera
here s a link to a sandbox where you can see opera and google-chrome in action

2421914
selected	button
these 4 things work but because of the boolean flag i m using if the user click somewhere else or selected an item i have to click twice on the button before it show up again

2421922
any	set
in addition if i set any of the properties in the control s properties editor configurationmanager.language for example i am able to types in that language and see syntax-highlighting occur

2421939
json	xml
you then need to write a separate service which gets the xml or json required for your page

2421941
onresume	onpause
the best solution i can think of is to flip a boolean on off whenever onresume or onpause is called in all my activities but this seems like a lot of footwork

2421949
jquery-plugins	jquery
for example .when you create jquery-plugins you pass in jquery or like .so

2421951
jquery-plugins	jquery
it s often used in writing jquery-plugins since jquery allows you to disable the variables points to jquery using jquery.noconflict

2421957
required	checked
checked errno it will be either eagain or ewouldblock and those aren t required to have the same value checked for both

2421959
connected-components	edges
this is a graphing whose nodess exist in many connected-components at once because a nodes s relationships are a collections of edges groupinging such that only one edges per edges grouping can be present at once

2421964
instances	destroy	.when	ready
they way asp.net works is that it runs through its pipeline to process a request and .when it s done has rendering the output html ready to send to the browser it destroy all instances created within the request including your page and the contains file-watcher

2421968
git-add	git-rm
won t add deleted files to your index you ve got to either use git-add -u or git-rm filename.txt

2421993
authentication	login
.so if i want a standards interface where you click on a google yahoo logo and it forwarding itself via javascript to the authentication page where you login if you already aren t logged in kicks you back to your own page would i need api key

2421994
constructor	object
how do i invoke a function or rather a constructor i have the constructorinfo object for which i know it doesn t required any parameters

2421996
attributes	properties
first of all i d like to points out that key-value pairs aka eav model are a poor choice for representing this kind of data and this question is a perfect example of why - it s much much harder to search for arbitrary collections of attributes than it is to search for specific properties

2422011
dynamic-linking	static-linking
i m trying to convert a project in visual-studio 2008 from static-linking of the crt to dynamic-linking

2422024

2422078
selected	checkbox
i need to display that table with checkbox in a grid .so the user can selected .some rows and send it back to the server

2422078
value	field
if i can create a key with a few field can i use those field as the value in the checkbox

2422088
panels	grid	scrollable	panels	scrollable	grid
append multiple grid to a single scrollable panels is the right way to do it unless you want to break them off into individual tabs

2422090
python	c++
let s say i need to use python and c++

2422090
python	c++
i can call python function from c++ with python-c-api and reverse is possible with swig or equivalent

2422095
arrays	loops
your best option here is to loops over an arrays of jndi named 1 and to do a jndi lookup for each to feed your list

2422096
object-reference	instances
however .when i do that i receive a nullreferenceexception the infamous object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2422138
worksheet	excel
you can use vsto to create an excel worksheet add a listbox set it s selectionmode to multisimple or multiextended

2422141
findstr	cmd
for this you can employ the help of a nice little tool called findstr which searches for patterns in files or cmd output

2422141
contains	any
which will find any line in the output that contains 64 somewhere

2422141
parentheses	operators
the is the escape character in cmd and in this use it s effectively a line-continuation operators .so the parsing accepts the opening parentheses on the next line as part of the current statement which usually would be terminate by a line break

2422153
any	set
hence the load event does not let me make any programmatic changes to the control until i ve set it visible

2422159
firefox	opera
ie8 firefox opera

2422159
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

2422168

2422186
panels	grid
framework given panels are stackpanel grid canvas etc

2422194
file-descriptor	stdin
in linux this is done with the selected systemd call but selected has the limitation that it can only specify a re.source that can be as.sociated with a file-descriptor .so devices stdin files network ports are fine

2422194
device-driver	hardware
yes in cases where code has direct access to hardware interrupts for all events that it wishes to handle such as an embedded systemd or device-driver you can write truly event-driven code with multiple entry points that does not busy wait or sleep

2422194
device-driver	hardware
other than in a device-driver or very specific systemd code using signals you can not have the kernel or hardware automatically call a certain function if the user click on a certain menu item instead your code is running detection this event itself and call the correct event handler

2422199
onresume	onpause
.so register a callback supplied by the activity with the service in onresume and unregister it in onpause

2422199
onresume	onpause
you could accomplish the same thing with a broadcasting intent register unregister the receiver in the activity in onresume onpause if you wanted

2422200

nsstring	nsdata	nsarray	plist	nsarray	nsdate
also make sure that the you use only the following data types in your dictionary otherwise it will fail to write to a plist nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

2422561
show	next
the arrays is looped through and each object printed in the main function and the ostream is overloaded in a per.son class .so i tried to use global-variables as well as static-variables and all of those produce incorrect numbering show 0 1 the first time for 2 object then change to 1 2 on the next display

2422570
32-bit	64bit
.so for 32-bit os you get 1.3gb and for 64bit os the limit is too large to hit for today s applications

i m trying to design a main which is divided into three sub panelss a tree list a grid and a panels

2422673
panels	grid
the way it works is that you have a tree list west with elementss you click on an elements which populate the grid centering then you click on an elements in the grid and that generator the panels west

2422673
panels	grid	centering	fixed
now the problem i face is that the centering layout the grid has been defined in the code with a fixed width and the west panels as an auto width

2422673
panels	grid
but .when the interface gets generator the grid width is suddenly taking all the spaces in the interface instead of the west panels

2422673
contains	elements
the exploits_tree is the tree list contains some elements

2422673

i have a large form with some field value dependent on previous elements

2422792
value	field
.when i refresh the page click reload or click back the previous value selected are still there but the dependent field are not reflecting the other elements s value

2422801
for-loop	arrays
if i copy the code for-loop that printing out the value to the sub-menu nothing is printed presumably because it can t access the original arrays and has made a new blank one

2422858
recording	playing
then run a timer that fires every ten minutes or whatever which stops the recording of that streaming and creates a new server side streaming playing the client streaming

2422859
instances	private
this is the first instances i ve ever witnessed where adding a private methods and never calling it can speed up a program by a factors of 4

2422878
implements	super
especially if i want to implements my entities not only as a corresponding employee entity class but rather multiple classes such as manager assistant manager engineer etc each inheriting from employee super entity class some entity having attributes that don t actually apply to all for example manager gets perks others don t the corresponding table column would accept null of course

2422889
boost-asio	boost

innodb	myisam
.so no need to change the myisam to innodb if you don t need you can just change the collation

2423028
for-loop	arrays	arguments	default
yes in the first example the for-loop is acting as a topicalizer setting which is the default arguments to many perl functions over the elements in the arrays

2423028
arrays	loops
this matters if you plan on setting the arrays s value inside loops

2423050
comet	chat
should you decide to building a chat application yourself - something that does not sound like a viable solution for something you need immediately - you might want to have a look at the aspcomet libs which provides a service-layer on top of asp.net to help you use comet techniques long-polling etc

2423062
contains	set
the fix in this case was quite simple as i was able to replace the linked-list with a hash set which performs contains much faster in o 1 time

2423107
value	field
.when you add the column its value cannot be null - using a default is not an option unless it is removed later on because the database logic is used in the server side validation .when a user enters a new recording .when the application tries to add a recording with this field having a null value the database throw an error that the application catches and returns to the user prompt them to correct it

2423120
switching	screens
how do i switching between the two screens on the qt

2423158
any	set
i don t believe you can configure any gc setting on a per appdomain basis which is essentially what would happen .when you only set it in a web-config file thus on a per application basis

2423195
any	set
it show how to combine state machine representing application logic with presentation layer and get cool animation effects for free of course if you don t need eye candy you can set widget properties without any animation

2423234
virtual-keyboard	focus
but i m having problem with my virtual-keyboard stealing the focus from the application being used

2423256
subclassing	base-class
it s easier to ensure interfaces match and provide a guarantee by using a contract such as subclassinging a base-class that has abstract-methods that you have to provide an implementsation for in your subclassing or implements a shared interface

2423256
contains	any
interfaces don t contains any code they re just what they say on the tin - a blueprint for a certain interface

2423256

however you can use the invariant culture to convert a numbers to a string and later parsing it back from any computer with any culture set

2423426
put	get
you get this note that i put all classes as static nested classes into main

2423428

sql-server	mysql
sql code to illustrate - this is t-sql and is sql-server friendly but i didn t have any mysql handy

2423517
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
use a technical primary key of say a numbers auto-incremented in mysql sql-server from a sequences in oracle

2423522

if your hosts does not respond to arp request it can never correctly receive tcp or udp packets

2423549
document-ready	.when
.when the document-ready i m creating three smilar table like these

2423565
core-location	mapkit
you have to include the core-location cfnetwork and mapkit frameworks also

2423570
arrays	loops
i know i could just return the points from core data to an arrays and then loops through that looking for the min value for distance between the points but i d imagine there s a more efficient methods possibly leveraging core data in some way

2423586
selectedindex	selecteditem
there is always selecteditem to get it not selectedindex .

2423600
png	gif
some things are better with jpg some with png or gif

2423601
fadein	hide

2423608
spaces	output
we read the input arrays right-to-left i-- and .whenever we find a spaces or .when we eventually hit the left wall we copy for k the words we found to the output arrays

2423616
nsstring	nsdata
but it is the mystring nsstring data types not the data nsdata data types that equals the right value

2423624
hide	show
.so i d generally prefer to have a table with all the rows you re ever going to show perhaps with class attributes to classify them and a jquery plugins to show hide selection of rows based on the context

2423639
nsstring	nsdata
how do i convert a nsstring value to nsdata

2423668
configuration	upgrade
changing the configuration from code is not easy shipping lots of comfig files is not an option as it is too hard to merge our changes into any changes a customer may have made at the time of an upgrade also we don t want customers playing with wcf settings

2423668
xsd	xml
the few time we have used wcf to talk to a java systemd we found that the xsd that the java systemd gave out did not match what xml it wanted anyway .so had to hand-code a lot of the xml mappings.

2423676
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is this works great in firefox and google-chrome

2423676
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works great

2423686
printf	scanf
libs function will use the file pointers printf scanf

2423689
git-branch	git-rebase
git-rebase the local git-branch onto the master git-branch then dcommit and that way it looks like you did all those commit in sequences .so svn people can see it linearly as they are accustomed to

2423690
printf	feof	user-input	output
is more useful .when you work with text files and user-input output because it allows you to use api functions like printf sscanf fgets feof etc

2423690
file-descriptor	pipe
file-descriptor api is low-level .so it allows to work with .sockets pipe memory-mapped files and regular files of course

2423702
.net	wcf
thechnology .net sql-server wcf all entity must be serializ over wire special complec data in extended properties

2423704

2423740
attributes	properties
i did discover an disableautoqueuecreation attributes and i tried setting it to false on the various configuration elements and i even discovered it was available as a properties on the rhinoservicebusfacility .so i tried setting it there too

32-bit	64bit
the application itself is any cpu but the com component has a 32-bit and 64bit versioning

2423784
32-bit	64bit
assembly1 uses com component foo foo has a 32-bit and 64bit versioning with the same filename we did not create foo it was made by a third party

2423784
32-bit	64bit
one way that would work is to create separate .app manifests for 32-bit release and for 64bit release

2423797
jedit	emacs
try jedit epsilon emacs vi...

2423806
silverlight	wpf

2423816
base-class	inherited
.so i would like to implements comparator in a base-class foo and inherited it in other hashers such as bar

2423829
groovy	java
because java is statically typed unlike dynamic-languages like groovy that will be horrible and probably full of casting but you can do it

2423830

it also depends on the database server how much resources is needed for each connection - afaik postgresql fork new process for a connection which is pretty expensive while mysql uses threads

2426466
boolean	int	twos-complement	complement
bcpl only had a single types - the words - which was interpreter as false in boolean contexts if 0 and as true if 0 meaning the complement of 0 which would represent the value -1 if interpreter as signed twos-complement int

one caveat arraylist can only hold object int not primitive int

2426701
firefox	opera
firefox and opera are very very fast in this

2426707

it works from a crud perspective but because it s a bag it ends up deleting the rating contents any time i try to do a simple updates insert to the rating properties

2426718
any	set
the first methods just a straight-up set would be least likely to cause any issues

2426721
hide	show
you would have to execute a javascript function on page load that compares the time set in the cookies with the current time and show hide the elements accordingly

2426747
double-quotes	single-quotes
your first example is using single-quotes for the attributes quotes and within the value itself .so just change one of them to use double-quotes

firefox	safari
it works in firefox but not safari

2426807
googletest	gmock
i ve started the process with gmock and googletest

2426808
scriptaculous	jquery
javascript frameworks like jquery or scriptaculous often have optimized code for this types of activity and handle these problems internally for you

2426809
typemock	moq
.so after doing much research i have decided on moq because it s nearly as good as typemock and has super clean syntax etc

2426809
typemock	nmock	typemock	moq	nmock	moq
we need to make this decision asap as we are under tight deadline and do not want to change frameworks again went from nmock to typemock and now want to make final decision and move to moq or have 2 seperate ones per language.

selected	cell
.when doing find and replace replace all with 2 cell selected after the first replacement the worksheet_change function finished with the whole spreadsheet selected

2426843
dictionary	map	contains	lookup
however it seems what you really want is a map from .source - dest file .so in this case i d make a class to contains the destination filename and the file and then create a dictionary to contains this lookup

2426845
credentials	account
hence why not set up a new developer account the sole purpose of which is to be the holder of this one .app and .when you sell the .app you can just transfer the developer-account credentials to the new owner

2426845
put	get
of course your transfer contract will have .some verbiage explaining how in the interim any moneys you get from apple will be fwded to the new owner put a time limit -- like 90 days -- on this .so they don t take forever to updates the info.

2426917
contains	elements	value	field
each arrays elements represents a row and within each row is another arrays that contains the field named and value

invoking the put or get

2426959
authentication	login
i assume you mean sql or mixed-mode authentication the ability to login using your sa account

2426975
ssas	ssis
i install all of the service for 2005 the database instances report service instances ssas and ssis

2426985
32-bit	64bit
however the issue is complicated further by the fact that the 32-bit modem control panels doesn t work in 64bit windows it display but add button has no effect

2426985
32-bit	64bit
i was already turning off wow64 redirection in my rundll .solution on 64bit platform and that worked fine but you can t load a 64bit libs in a 32-bit .app .so i had to spawn a new process to do this

2426989
getter	setter
synthesize generator setter and getter that look like this

2427034
python	c++
i am doing some input output between a c++ and a python program only floating-point value python has a nice feature of converting floating-point value to hex-numbers and back as you can see in this link

2427034
python	c++
and convert the python output back to c++ double float

2427043
margins	scale
rotation doesn t change scale .so your rectangle will always be 100 x 200 pixels within the margins of error caused by bitmap rendering

2427059
removeclass	addclass
you can always use removeclass to get rid of one versioning and addclass to add the other

2427064
internet-explorer	firefox
is basically how you have to catch events in internet-explorer anyway .so it will work in ie and firefox for sure

2427065
void	main
something else main must never have return-type void this is invalid c++ and many compilers will reject it

2427066
hash	md5
i am not at all sure that this is a good .approach but if you want to go ahead with this you can compute a hash of the configuration file say md5 and recompute and compare every time the .app starts

2427067
removeclass	addclass
.when you use addclass it adds append a class unless you remove .some first using removeclass .so you do like this

2427093
default	reset
anyway though if you need to reset your object to the default state rather than relying on the ability to do a vector-wide reset of the object you could also just make a call on your object called reset to set them to that state and call it before you re-process using those same object

2427094
any	set
.when you set the global session by calling or if you initializer any fbsession object fbsession doesn t retain it as it should .so make sure you retain the session object even if you don t actually use it or even keep a reference to it

2427103
qpainter	qwidget
what i am trying to do is rendering a qwidget onto a different windows manually using a qpainter

2427111

thus there will be a verifiable set of rsa key b that can t be change because the private-key a used to verify them is in the office and the public key a is hardcode

2427118
.net	wcf
this is new in .net 3.5 and it allows wcf serviecs to persistent their state into a provider-based persistentent store typically a sql-server backend database but there s also a filesystem-based provider and it s extensible - you can write your own if need be

2427132
export	report
i m looking into ssrs with intention of export a lot of the report to excel

2427132
export	report
the problem is that .when you export it changes cell sizes and removes borders to try and keep the original report format

2427132
export	report
.so that the report export to excel with the usual excel formatting

2427139
hash	md5
i agree with david in that using a md5 hash is a good and simple way to accomplish what you want

2427147
cryptography	security
for added security you can replace the simple hash with a cryptography signature

2427154
hide	show
instead of hiding all rows and then showing one row put .some logic in loops .so that you hide or show each row depending on the id

2427156
python	c++
finally i d like to code the gui part in a language like python or scheme which makes me a bit hesitant to use c++ because i understand it s harder to interface that to interpreter

2427177
export	csv	export	report
you could export to a csv and import that into a spreadsheet possibly with some sort of templates sheet for the particular report

2427196
linux	bsd
one arguments for the apache mysql php stack is that it s available on most major platform windows linux mac bsd ... and most webhosters provide it as well

2427219
localization	translation
it searches for and returns a localization or translation of the string it is given

2427221
.war	jar	entitymanager	entities
we have a very comfortable setup using jpa through spring hibernate where we attach a persistenceunit.postprocessor to our entitymanager factory and this .post processor takes a list of project namedd scans the classpath for jars that contains that named and adds those jar files for scanning for entities to the persistence-unit this is much more convenient than specifying in persistence.xml since it can take partials namedd and we added facilities for detection the different classpath configuration .when we are running in a .war a unit test an ear etc

2427221
spring	seam
now we are trying to replace spring with seam and i cant find a facility to accomplish the same hooking mechanism

spring	seam
one solution is to try and hook seam through spring but this solution has other short-comings on our environment

2427228
value	field
value in a concrete field

2427229
lookup	any
elf files are executable linkable format which consists of a symbols lookup and relocatable table that is it can be loaded at any memory-address by the kernel and automatically all symbolss used are adjusted to the offset from that memory-address where it was loaded into

2427230

2427232
hide	show
is it possible to combine a slideshow and show hide div functionality

2427338
output	cat
interesting the following yield no output same as above but piping sed output through cat

2427338
output	cat
why can i not pipe the output of sed to another program like cat

2427383
selected	cell
.when the user selected a cell i call reloadsrowatindexpath to increase the height of selected row

2427390
perl	php
the way around that is to use a server side language of your choice perl php coldfusion asp to act as a proxy

2427391
structuremap	log4net
structuremap underwent a bit of an overhaul recently .so it s possible that a dependency on log4net was removed during that process

2427391
structuremap	log4net
in any case structuremap does not currently required log4net

2427392
checkbox	textbox
notifyicons is used for the system-tray icons that you see on the bottom right hand corner of the screens usage of tooltip is only for controls such as textbox checkbox and .so on...for example let s assume there s a textbox instances called textbox1 on the form than this would work

2427395
ubuntu	linux
i have install xampp for linux on ubuntu 9.10

2427395

therefore a messages should not contains any validation logic

2427435
value	field
i want to throw an error messages if user doesn t input any value for a particular field

2427460
hide	show
for your own error-handling you can leave placeholder elements on the page then place messages in them and show or hide them as necessary

2427461
postgresql	oracle
if you are using ms sql oracle or postgresql then you can use row_number to uniquify your rows

2427467
nsmutablearray	nsarray
why not create a mutablecopy of the nsarray and set that as your new nsmutablearray

2427478
contains	any
you should open the error-log view and see if it contains any relevant errors

2427491
constructor	object
why are copy constructor unnecessary for immutable object

2427500
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
with an immutable object however this is typically fine since the default copy-constructor typically does a shallow-copy of all value

2427504
value	field
but my problem is on click the field datepicker populate with today s date as highlighed and no date selected and up on selected date value

2427504
highlight	selected
datepicker is populating march 20 as selected date and current date highlight

2427516
versioning	upgrade
always upgrade the jvm to the latest versioning and then see if the problem still exists

copy constructor are valuable in that they allow for you to take one object and create a completely independent copy of it

2427576
static-code-analysis	stylecop
stylecop is a free static-code-analysis tool from microsoft that checked c# code for conformance to stylecop s recommended coding styles and a subset of microsoft s .net design guidelines

2427613
selected	cell
you stated that you commenced the find-replace action with two cell selected

2427613
selected	cell
but the behavior that you describe suggests that you only had one cell selected

2427613
selected	cell
if you have two or more cell selected then the find-replace action occurs only within the selected range

2427613
selected	cell
if you have only one cell selected however the find-replace occurs over all cell in the worksheet

2427613
selected	cell
.so i strongly suspect that you had only one cell selected .when you started the find-replace operation not two

2427614
command-line	cmd
i usually building my project using these two cmd from command-line dos

2427621

2427836
having	union
advantage of this .solution mytable is queried only once current case we are having a filtering on fkid .so right now performance will not matter but if we have to evaluate complex query then this technique can work fine with respect to union

2427846
put	get
that s what you get out of a query as the column value and i believe that s what you have to put in as a parameter

2427869
arrays	loops
your code was not working as your loops never reach the arrays with key l5

for future project in which i want to make use of the actual asp.net-mvc features and totally submit to a framework s conventions on application building naming styles and procedure though i may not necessarily be going for zend but for a more minimalistic framework like yii or kohana

2427986
arrays	loops
i can see what you tried to do you got an elements from an arrays then you decided to loops over the arrays

2427991
.when	ready
google launchd a new .app to speed up browsing google web accelerator that prefetch the linked pages in the browser no attacks no third party... and .when someone logged to such protected pages well the .app looked at all those links and said hey i ll prefetch those ones also because that way i have the page ready .when the user request it

note the d does not result in an eof action on stdin as it may on some postscript printers that rely on tbcp tagged binary communication-protocol to cause an out-of-band d to signals eof in a streaming input data

2428303
dbd	dbi
take a look at dbi dbd on how to do that

2428319

no matter where i call self mycustommethods initwithnibname viewdidload viewwillload viewwillappear viewdidappear the custom methods is getting called twice - what s the deal

2428355
getter	setter
why do we make for example in java instance-variables private and then use public getter and setter methods to access them

2428355
getter	setter
you still get to the instances variables but why use setter and getter methods .when you can just make your variabless public

2428357
push	pull
more of a push into the icommand object than a pull

2428363
children	tree	children	nodes
many tree algorithms required that each nodes have links to its children and its parent

2428380
any	set
if you make the field public any other code can set that variables to null there s nothing you can do

2428390
postback	ajax
you can t upload files via ajax you need to use an iframe or some other trickery to do a full postback

2428393
uialertview	uitextview
i m adding a uitextview to a uialertview with the following code

2428393
show	next
the problem is after working correctly the first time none of the cut copy-paste button will show up again next time i show the uialertview new instances unless i restart the .app

2428394
getter	setter
the difference is that with getter and setter you control how instances field are accessed

2428402
digits	base
in our case with 6 digits mod 10 6 and base 7 we find a repeat size of

2428408
solaris	linux
i have access to linux and solaris dev boxes if you have suggestions for implements a firewall rules

2428430
dictionary	arrays
if you re creating a class that should act .sort of like an arrays or dictionary these are very useful .so that your syntax looks familiar

2428438
data-members	private
an inner class can lookup private data-members and operate on them

2428455
getter	setter
a very important points that is often overlooked you don t have to provide a getter and a setter for every field

2428455
getter	setter
having classes that consist of nothing but private properties and public getter and setter is just as bad a design as using public field

2428455
getter	setter
the points is that getter and setter allow you to add behavior and logic to the model beyond the simple holding of data - and in many cases that means not having a getter or a setter or both

2428471
mongodb	schema
maybe it s clearer if you go away from the pure json of mongodb and look at how you would defined it in an odm the equivalent of an orm in rdbs as document based dbs don t really enforce schema of their own example is based on mongoengine for python

2428471
put	get
you could of course put the grade info in the student object but ultimately there really isn t much you can do to get rid of that extra class

2428485
data-members	private	getter	setter
in the first place not all data-members should have getter and setter and i imagine you can see the virtue of keeping those variables private

2428485
getter	setter
if there s getter and setter you may be able to compensate for that .so that setting a value can do .something more or less complicated in the internals to get the same effect as it previously had

2428488
telnet	ssh
this can be done in several ways depending on what os ssh daemons telnet daemons you re using

2428495
show	next
this next code does not work the way i want but just show kind of what i am looking for

2428498
revision	updates
because the file is new it doesn t conflict w the previous commit and can updates the revision # on the server

2428498
revision	svn
i get this error a lot b c svn frequently conks out in the middle of committing my large-files which in turn causes subsequent commit to try to write to the revision that was interrupted

2428510
constructor	object	virtual-functions	member-functions
simply having member-functions constructor and destructor shouldn t cause trouble but make sure that you do not use virtual-functions or contains non-pod object as that may get tricky

2428524
textbox	button
this control will be able to hosts other controls like textbox s button etc

2428532
web-applications	webserver
other web-applications that are running on the same webserver do not seem to experience this types of behavior only this particular web service

2428565
strtol	strtok
use strtok to break the string into individual tokens then convert each token to an int value using strtol

i m working in eclipse and find myself always replacing multiple copies of the same words but i always have to take my hands off the keyboard and screens to get the mouse hover over the words double click to selected and then copy or rewrite the words

2428634
boolean	int
notions of type-safety and distinguishing boolean from int did not seem important until much later -

2428649
ethernet	packets
if you are connect to a reasonably smart ethernet switching you will probably see only you pc s packets broadcasting packets but they are not http... and not much else

2428670
constructor	object
there is no way in the current versioning of c++ to call a constructor from another constructor or on an already construct object

2428672
background-color	display
if i trace charname.text it trace correctly but .when the contains movieclip is display it is always blank and none of my settings borders background-color etc.. show up

2428674
scalability	azure
one of the things that attracts me to azure is the scalability given the variability of the demand i m likely to expect

2428683
constructor	private
refactor the real plot initialisation code into a private methods then call this init methods in both constructor before doing anything else

2428688
required	checked
we have common libs project shared amongst many project that are required to be checked out into a libs folder which a developer needs to checkout prior to opening the main project in visual-studio

i m trying to use subwcrev to get the current revision numbers of our svn repository and put it in a file .so i can show it in the user-interface

2428697
strtol	atoi
i would recommend strtol which provides better error-handling than atoi or sscanf

2428715
platform	anycpu
the question is what types is more appropriate for .net x64 apps either compiled with the platform target as anycpu on a x64 machine or specifically as x64

2428715
32-bit	64bit
the dll is called user32.dll does it work as 32-bit or 64bit on a x64 operating systemd

2428719
contact	submit
i have a php contact form that submit data and an email...

2428728
pure-virtual	base-class
a pure-virtual function is still a virtual function .so it would be in the vtable but the compiler doesn t required an implementation for it and will prohibit initializer of the base-class that declare the pure-virtual

2428741
constructor	object
the compiler must not allow you to construct an object of a types which has pure-virtual-functions that don t have a non-pure final overrides in their inherited hierarchy and any attempt to make a virtual call to a pure-virtual function directly or indirectly from an object s constructor or destructor causes undefined behavior

2428747
decimal-point	digits
sure just format the floats with a reasonable format based on your knowledge of what precision you expect them to exhibit -- e.g if you expect accuracy to 2 digits after the decimal-point you could use

2428749
file-descriptor	pipe
what i mean by this is that before the fork the pipe read file-descriptor had a retain count of 1 and after the fork 2

2428762
cursor	row
you can use console.setcursorpositioning column row to set the cursor to the appropriate positioning

2428762
cursor	row
for your example use console.setcursorposition 0 console.windowheight-1 to place the cursor at the lower-most row and then let the user enter text

2428773
for-loop	arrays
my solution was to create a for-loop that ran that code and then checked answer to see if it was an arrays using php methods is_arrays and execution the methods call again if it wasn t

2428787
32-bit	64bit
why not emulate 64bit on 32-bit systemd - i guess because the performance of pointer-arithmetic would degrade

2428801
interface-builder	iboutlet
set the file s owner s class in interface-builder to your controllers class then defined some iboutlet in the class they will show up in interface-builder on the file s owner and you can connect your object in the xib to them

2428802
32-bit	16-bit
with a 32-bit pointsers you can points to a wider range of memory than with 16-bit pointserss

2428802
32-bit	64bit
.when 32-bit pointers were standardized 64bit cpus were not very popular or even existent

2428803
substring	charindex
use substring but you ll have to use either charindex or patindex to get the location of the character you want the substring to stop at

2428809
16-bit	8bit
in the old 6502 it was an 8bit machine but it had 16-bit address bus .so that it could address 64k of memory

2428827
contains	any
if i understand the first part of your question right you want to remove any rows in your newfile cell-array that contains only empty cell

2428873
switching	router
once the .software is working in the green environment you switching the router .so that all incoming request go to the green environment - the blue one is now idle

2428898
order	add
if you want to order the result-set by the max_time field simply add order by u.xdatetime desc at the end of the query

2428912
32-bit	64bit
windows-nt on the dec alpha was a 32-bit operating systemd but the alpha hardware was 64bit capable

2428912
32-bit	64bit
your ordinary address spaces was still 32-bit but there were special apis to allow 32-bit programs to access 64bit addresses as if they were in otherwise-inaccessible segments

2428916
png	gif
.so lets say i have an image doesnt matter what kind of gif jpg png with 200x200 pixels size total area 40000 pixelss

2428916
background-color	transparency
this image have a background that can be transparency or every color but i know the background-color in advance

2428916
python	php
.so in i know the full image-size and the background-color there is a way in php python to scan the image and retrieve that in short count the pixels that are different from the given background

2428925
selected	cell
selected the two cell and drag down

2428941
openmpi	mpich
mpich has built-in debugger while openmpi does not last time i checked

2428947

secondly if you want the button to display the value after it has been selected register onclientclick in the ddl_test_selectedindexchanged event

2428953
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am migrating an webforms .app to asp.net-mvc

2428957
network-interface	mac-address
from google media access-control address mac-address is a unique identifier assign to most network adaptor or network-interface

2428976
icmp	dhcp
also if a hosts becomes unreachable turned off disconnected... an intermediate gateway or the client itself may detection the event loss of carrier dhcp lease not renewed... and reply to the packets sent to the died hosts with a icmp error hosts network unreachable

2428982
wlan	lan
you must have two network adaptor in your pc lan wlan

2428995
push	pull
in this context start by identifying your concurrent development effort and decide on a publication push pull process

2429013
value	field
.some value are modified or linked in from another table but most value are coming from the original table .so they can t really cause truncation going back to the same field that i know of

2429014
ostream	std
to actually write object binary use std ostream write

2429015
key-value	key
.when i selected joining by foreign key field in such a way that this clustered index is used i guess that clusterization should help too because range of rows is being selecteded even though they all have same clustered key-value and between is not used

2429021
ifconfig	linux
there is no portable way of getting the mac-address theoretically you could use the ifconfig cmd for nix linux variants

2429036
document-ready	ready
the only things that should go in the document-ready are things that need to wait until the document is ready inorder to act

2429040
e-commerce	product
we currently have in production sql-server 2005 and we use it s full-text-search for a e-commerce site search of a million product database

2429042
uitextview	nsstring
i m trying to save the contents of an uitextview into a nsstring which i will somehow persistent later

.so instead jna was apparently attempting to copy the libs to a temporary location and load it but that failed

2429051
macros	let
i once saw a macros package that would alias every c keyword to let you effectively program in klingon

2429058
iframe	popup
the alert will popup whenever the location within the iframe changes

2429069
order	join
an index on the fk column will help the join because the index itself is order clustered just means that the data on disk leaf is order rather then the b-tree

2429077
put	get
.when i click the run button i get a pop-up that tells warns me what s going to happen...it s going to put a row into a new table

2429077
put	get
if you try to put multiple statements in and run them you ll get that error

2429078
groovy	java
with java on one side and ruby groovy on the other i know that in the second camp i m free to make typos which will not get caught until runtime

2429080
keyboard	mouse
i m not sure how citrix viewmodel vs mikogo vs ultravnc work with display information but i ve always guessed it s a combinations of sending mouse and keyboard instructions and then refreshing the image to show what the display of the desktop is

2429114
dump	temp
you could also dump the table you are selected from to a temp table and find out what line gives the error if it errors out to a temp table

2429122
constructor	object
.when initializer an object in a hierarchy the base constructor gets called

2429122
constructor	object
the problem this approach has is that if the base constructor call a virtual-method which in java all are it will get dispatcher to the most derived implementation and will thus execute in a not-yet construct object possibly causing unexpected results

2429122
execute	declare
in the example above even if the variables is declare as final and thus a constants by the value of 5 seems obvious in the code the actual printed value is 0 because the constructor of derived has not execute

2429123
data-structures	tree
understand various data-structures like arrays hashtable binary tree linked lists etc and know which suits which purpose best

2429124
webforms	asp.net
i ve seen a little buzz on the open-source asp.net webforms mvp project but where can i get resources

2429124
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this appears to be a compelling refresh of the webforms paradigms and bring into the folding things that make asp.net-mvc great

2429155
perl	php
i m having trouble translating a subroutine from perl to php i m new to perl

2429155
perl	php
my problem is that i really don t quite understand the perl syntax .so i m having trouble writing these and in php

2429159
handler	service
however .when i was originally trying to get it to work i tried iisresets restart some sharepoint service owstimer this i believe runs the event handler but probably isn t involved in the event registration where i am getting the error and even a reboot to make sure no assembly caching was going on - and that did not help before

2429184
contains	elements
you re looking for the closest methods whch finds the innermost parent contains an elements

2429193
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
one of the website is built with ruby-enterprise-edition and passenger

is there a way to turn a char into a string or a string with one letter into a char like how you can turn an int into a double and a double into an int

2429244
twitter	tweets
i have a tweets this link which paste in the article title and a link into your twitter updates box if you re logged in to twitter

2429265
put	get
if you want it to be a types then get rid of the elements declaration in your address schema and put in instead

2429283
put	get
trying to put optional-parameters in uri segments and things start to get weird

2429294
directory	folder
i m using dir.mktmpdir as the default scratch directory which gives a really ugly path for example variables folder zz zzzivhrrnamviuee+++1ve+++yo -tmp- d20100311-70034-abz5zj

2429323
databound	radgrid
this seems ludacris and besides my databound radgrid doesn t lose it s data

2429339
contains	set
set the tspan contains the symbols to a fonts named something like my-symbols-fonts

2429339
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i know that webkit safari google-chrome supports them but firefox at least 3.5 does not

2429350
getter	setter
you can inject ejb s in a jsf model and delegation it in action methods and maybe also getter setter but you should not do the other way round do not defined the jsf model in an ejb this leads to tight coupling and would make ejb s unuseable outside the jsf context

2429353
file-descriptor	pipe
a close only closes the specific file-descriptor that was passed - .so for example if you do the file pipe .socket device... that n was referring to remains open - the same applies to file-descriptors duplicates by a fork

attributes	properties
getattr does a lot more than a lookup in the object s __dict__ it supports properties and other descriptors attributes inherited from the class and its base such as methodss attributes that may be dynamically generator via a __getattr__ methods in the object s class or again one of its base

shopping-cart	cart
itâ s just that i donâ t see the error .when the shopping-cart is display immediately after the items are added to the cart

2429400
shopping-cart	cart
for example in this pop-up interface the action of redirecting to the cart page is separated out into a â œview cartâ button whereas if you hit the â œcloseâ button to close the pop-up and hit add to cart on this page there isnâ t a â œview cartâ button and youâ re immediately redirected to the shopping-cart .so you donâ t hit the error although i believe i did hit the error here .when i insert an alert statement into my code to slow things down

2429412

the 32-bit versioning can create and use 32-bit com components only and the 64bit versioning can create and use only 64bit com components

2429508
python	perl
i m wondering what the correct syntax is and whether there s a better approach that doesn t required jumping into perl or python that i m ignoring

2429513
show	next
this meant that showpopup remained false and the menu was not show the next time the button was pressed

2429515
scripting	shebang
i find it useful to keep a generics shebang line in one-off scripting such as the ones i write .when answering questions on .so .so i can quickly test them on both windows and archlinux

2429517
linux	unix	scripting	shebang
if you re talking about other platform of course this rules does not apply but that shebang line does no harm and will help if you ever copy that scripting to a platform with a unix base such as linux mac etc

2429535

if you mean you have a shared-project that turns into a jar or .war or dll or assembly that several project use you can checked in the artifact and have other project simply checked it out like any other 3rd party jar

2429581
boolean	int
types narrower than int are widened to int in expression anyway - .so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

i come from c++ perl python on linux background but i have a few project coming up where i have to jump in to windows development

2429682
decimal	octal
the 013 is in octal .so treated as a decimal you get 11

2429689
decimal	octal
13 octal is 11 decimal

2429690
order-of-evaluation	operators
for order-of-evaluation the + operators is evaluated left to right .so is equivalent to not

2429693
javascript	dom
please provide concrete examples of javascript code basic javascript code without dom usage that is not valid actionscript 3.0 code

2429695
decimal	octal
it s string concatenation of decimal 17 and octal 13 equivalent to decimal 11

2429698
decimal	octal
i would just add to reed s explanation that 013 is interpreter as octal 13 which is decimal 11

given the previous sample xml fragment my output would contains what i would expect of formatting the publisher elements but i m also getting the text nodess of the children of the soap-env header nodes

2429751
lookup	any
as long as you will never need to lookup anything from othervalues from the main dictionary this should work fine and not incur any performance issues

2429764
subtract	add
yes it is important to get the sign correct .when using esp in this case subtract but also sometimes you need to add .when referencing something already on stack like arguments inside a function

2429803
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested it in the latest versioninging of firefox 3.6 and google-chrome whose versioning escapes me

2429803

clearinterval	setinterval
you can use setinterval to begin triggers the event at regular intervals on hover and use clearinterval to stop it .when the user stops hovering

2429819
margins	padding
for example if margins padding and border were factored into the width i could assign width value to all my columns without worrying about the numbers of columns and any changes i make to their padding and margins

2429819
margins	padding
with w3c s box-model i have to worry about the numbers of columns i have and develop something akin to a mathematical formula to calculate the correct width value whe modifying margins and padding

2429819
margins	padding
it would be difficult to modify padding and margins

2429819
margins	padding
if column width incorporated padding and margins all i would need to do is change the width and i have my layout

2429827
selected	textbox
is it possible to allow a user to selected text in a silverlight text block not textbox as they would be able to in any html page

2429831
conditional	operators
you re using the operators instead of the operators in your conditional which makes an assignment instead of a comparison

2429838
margins	padding
as noted by the op it seems to make more sense to have a pre-defined width from which margins padding and border-width are subtract than to have a width to which these are then added

2429846
order	add
.when you add a product to the order copy everything from product to order include a fk too if you want

2429852
document	editing

2429923
children	nodes
it may not even these children nodes

2429926
subclassing	nsobject

object-detection	viola-jones
you can take a look at viola-jones framework viola-jones object-detection framework at wikipedia

2430020
windows-mobile	windows-ce
it contains unmanaged code to help make windows forms run on windows-ce and windows-mobile

2430028
arrays	loops
why not setup your actionlistener outside loops and make an arrays of them where the index of the actionlistener in your listener arrays corresponds to which button it gets added to

2430029
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
because google-chrome and firefox and ie and safari all behave slightly differently with the same javascript code web developers have to spend a great deal of time testing their code on the various browsers detection which one you re using and adapting the code to the slightly different sets of libs bugs etc

2430029
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
some languages are defined by a standards implementation ruby perl python rather than by a document which is why you don t hear of multiple implementation of those

2430031
salt	md5
generator the token as a checksum md5 crc whatever over the userid the image id and maybe the current day of the year and be sure to mix in an unguessable salt

2430037
value	field
then i would selected all of the information from the corpus for a given field attempt to clean up the data contains in it and tokenize the sanitized data hashing the tokens at the second level with the tokens as key and frequency as value

2430037
duplicates	contains
is there a precise mathematical relationship between n the numbers of recordinging f t the frequency with which a token t appeared in the corpus the probability o that a recording is an original and not a duplicates and the probability p that the test recording is really a recording x given the test and x contains the same t in the same field

2430039
double	int
if i wanted to use the same specialization for all built-in numeric types int float double etc. i would write those line many time

2430066
communication	messages
transport reliability is not resilient to dropping network connections and a variety of other communication problems whereas messages reliability as the named implies deals with reliability at the messages level independent of how many packets are required to deliver the messages.

2430084
double	int
is there a straightforward way of determining the numbers of decimal places in a n int double value in php

2430089
callback	methods
.so .when i register the callback its saying a methods named expected

2430121
selected	button
the real question then is what s a good way to get a single list of all the form elements in a document input selected textarea button to loops through them

2430123
revision	svn
is there a tool somewhat like the eclipse svn plugins that can do do revision control on the file manage timestamps revision stamps to identify incoming outgoing conflicting changes nodes link insert deletion modification and merge changes just like programmers do with source code files

2430134
updating	updates
of course you only need to replay the logic .when replaying those 199 step without updating needing to updates your view

2430138
value	field
anyway one of the field in the inner repeater needs to be a bind instead of an eval as i want to get the value that the user types in

2430148
contains	set	contains	elements
if you know the height of the absolutely positioning elements however you can set the contains div to a min-height of their top offset plus that known height

2430169
selected	button
the user click a button to selected a file to parsing at which points i want the datagrid object to be populate

2430174
gridview	formview
bind methods is only for the gridview detailview and the formview control

2430177
value	field
if it is not allowed for you to alter the original field value maybe duplicates the corresponding columns to a norm_xxx coluumn where xxx is the original named

2430184
version-control	git	document	editing
in the broader context if you allow external editing of these document and you re thinking more about how to store delta on the server you re mimicking git or other version-control systemd

2430184
version-control	git
beyond that either use conventional version-control consider wrapping git or implements your own way of coping with files being changed outside your editor

2430187
or-operator	operands
or-operator has a left operands that is a pointers to a structure with a flexible arrays member and the right operands named that member it behaves as if that member were replace with the longest arrays with the same elements types that would not make the structure larger than the object being accessed

2430207
font-size	width
maybe one solution would be to use javascript to calculate the width of the given text in some standards font-size then resize until you get a reasonable width

2430207
font-size	width
you can then checked if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equals to

2430207
font-size	width
you can also checked if the width is too short maybe less than 200px and increase the font-size accordingly

2430207
font-size	width
that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equals to 800px

2430210
constructor	object
constructor that gets the policy object

2430222
value	field
it creates a textfield with value of passwd and then .when you click in it it then changes to passwd field and removes its value

2430223
haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
erlang haskell scala or anything else

2430236
value	field
the solution is change the value of the detail field in the matrix

2430238
haskell	erlang
this is something you need a heavy duty multithreading language like erlang for but it haskell and others are of course capable of doing it

2430244
headless-browser	htmlunit
what should i modify inorder for the server to serve something else a static page or a page dynamically generator through a headless-browser like htmlunit

2430253
plugins	add-on
debugging a php program is there any add-on plugins for browser which i can view sessions variables those php _session foobar

2430277
jlabel	jtree
one problem i m having is with a jtree that uses html for the tree nodess to underline the text in some nodess the html is just embedded in the jlabel of each tree nodes

2430277
jlabel	jtree
i think my options are to either 1 use another approach to make the text underlined since removing the html from the jlabel causes it to resize properly .when the font-size changes or 2 keep the html formatting and somehow force the jtree jlabel to resize .when the font-size is updates possibly by firing a properties change event

2430362
primitive	int
if your properties is for a primitive data types such as an int then assign would be correct to use

2430371
value	field
however as soon as i try and edit the value field it essentially adds a new value into the object with a key of 1

2430371
any	set
is there any possible way i can set the datagridcolumn .so that .when i edit a value it will updates the value as.sociated with the key rather than insert a new value

2430374
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
ie 7 8 required a different setup than firefox safari opera most notably the data and classid attributes.

2430380
sql-server	postgresql
normally i would use sql-server-profiler to perform this action in sql-server land but i m yet to find how to do this in postgresql

2430405
reflection	runtime
my problem is that knowing whether the jsr is supported at runtime doesn t allow me to use all the features as java-me does not provide support for reflection

2430425
callback	methods
there is this jsonhttpmodule which uses a jsonresponsefilter streaming class to write out the json and the overloaded write methods is supposed to wrap the named of the callback around the json otherwise the json errors out as needing a labels

2430425
callback	methods
however if the json is really long the write methods in the streaming class is called multiple time causing the callback to incorrectly get insert midway through the json

2430425
callback	methods
is there a way in the streaming class to wrap the callback around the streaming at the end or to specify that it write all of the json in 1 write methods instead of in chunks

2430432
mechanize	selenium
something like mozilla mechanize or the selenium tools

2430467
versioning	upgrade
svn will automatically upgrade a working copy .when it needs one and if a different client is using an older versioning it may no longer have access

2430467
compatibility	deprecated
release numbering compatibility and deprecated

2430501
while-loop	for-loop
i know it s more pythonic to use a for-loop for iterator but i wanted to implements a while-loop within a generator that s called by a for-loop.

2430515
highlight	selected
as a note it s easy to lookup constants like __iphone_3_0 by highlight them right-clicking and selected jump to definition from the popup menu

2430517
scala	java
scala list and java list are two different beasts because the former is immutable and the latter is mutable

2430520
nsurlconnection	nsurlcache
nsurlconnection has support for caching in the styles of nsurlcache and it does a lot of work for you behind the scenes

2430523
groovy	scala
i think this is a pretty good match for rails-inspired frameworks such as grails on groovy or lift on scala

2430524
buffering	streaming
the reason it fires the methods multiple time is because it will buffering the contents and then send it to the output streaming

2430530
google-code	bitbucket
if your aim is solely to get your students to learn the use of version-control and bug-tracking systemd it is perhaps a better idea to assign them an exercise and make them set up a repository at one of those sites that integrated version-control online source code browsing and bug-tracking for example github bitbucket google-code etc

2430540
put	get
then test style.background attributes on url string and if it matches then get path between url and and put it into arrays

2430552
constructor	object
i am trying to get a javascript object to use the this assignments of another object constructor as well as assume all that object prototype functions

2430568
return-type	arguments
where can i learn more about objective-c methods and how they work in terms of structure and where the return-type and arguments go

2430572
python	java
if you wan t to run a versioning of the server on desktops your best options would be python ruby-on-rails or java servlets all of which can be easily packaged into small self-contained servers with no dependencies

2430572
ruby-on-rails	django
i would recommend looking at django and ruby-on-rails before any other framework

2430574
any	set
being fluid horizontally really doesn t have much to do with a any solution to a vertical offset. and since that s the case your header has to be a set height

2430574
hidden	reset
.so if in your editable area you can add a fullcontainer rules which you should be able to if you re editing the css file at all you very likely could redefine that div to get rid of the width and height declarations width auto and height auto should do and similarly reset or overrides other things overflow hidden if necessary

2430575
beautifulsoup	xml.etree
i find xml.etree essentially sufficient for everything except for beautifulsoup if i ever need to parsing broken xml not a common problem differently from broken html which beautifulsoup also helps with and is everywhere it has reasonable support for reading entire xml docs in memory navigating them creating them incrementally-parsing large docs

2430575
xml.etree	lxml
lxml supports the same interface and is generally faster -- useful to push performance .when you can afford to install third party python-extensions on .app engine you can t -- but xml.etree is still there .so you can run exactly the same code

2430575
beautifulsoup	lxml
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

2430580
environment	building
it also allows you to generator configuration-files after the fact for an environment you didn t know you would need at building time

2430589
constructor	object
a workaround would be to use the call or apply methods to run your objx constructor function in the this object of objy

2430589
constructor	object
in the above example the objx function is execute changing its this value .so all properties extensions you make to that object in this function will be reflected in the new object that the this value refers in the objy constructor

2430589
constructor	object
edit about the prototype your sample will not work because the prototype properties has no special meaning for object in stances it will be just as any other properties it should be used on constructor functions

2430589
constructor	object
i think you might be confusing the prototype properties of constructor with the internal properties that all object have

2430589
constructor	object
actually .when your constructor function is execute the internal properties of the object that the this value refers has already been set to its constructor s prototype properties

2430596
bundler	gem
with rails3 using bundler now there s been some hubub over on the bundler side about being able to specify an order in which the gem are required but i m not sure whether or not this would solve the problem at hand

2430596
bundler	gem
i ve tried to hack bundler to specify the order myself and have the ruby-on-rails gem pulled in first but it doesn t appear to me that requiring the ruby-on-rails gem actually initializer the application

2430596
bundler	gem
as this line in configuration .application.rb is being called before the .app is initializer any gem in the bundler gemfile that required ruby-on-rails to be initializer is going to tank

2430607
shell	bash
using mac 10.6 bash shell the cmd

2430616
output	cat
note that it is better practice in this instances to pass the filename as an arguments to grep instead of piping the output of cat to grep grep pattern file instead of cat file | grep pattern .

2430641
any	set	conditional	operators
to solve this we use the in operators which allows the sub-query to return a set of value 0 and your where conditional succeeds if a equals any one of those value

2430672
32-bit	64bit
this is 4 bytes on 32-bit systemd or 8 bytes on 64bit systemd

2430683
scala	java
the scala pages web framework is likely to appeal to web programmers who come from a java background and want to program web-applications in scala

2430695
libxml2	libxslt
it uses libxml2 and libxslt to handle xpath xslt and exslt

2430716
checkbox	button
like a checkbox button or dropdownlistfor or all the above

2430720
instrumentation	profiling
i assume you understand how profiling works the profiling will do some instrumentation and attach an agent to the jvm all this affects performance

2430738
contains	set
an index in mysql is a mapping from each value in a column or value in a set of columns to the rows contains that value in that column or those value in the set of columns

2430738
contains	set
a full text index on a column is a mapping from each words generally separated by whitespace to the set of rows that contains that words

2430740
python	c++
due to gsoap being a c++ libs you are going to have to wrap it to be able to use it in python

2430740
python	c++
this tool automatically wrap c++ libs for use in high level languages for example you guessed it python

2430742
value	field
indexes are structures which allow sql or more generally a dbms or search-engine to locate in a very efficient fashion recording based on the value of one or several of the field they contains

2430742
value	field
unlike with regular indexes which are based on comparing the complete value of the field or possibly a simple regular expression with the desired search value a fulltext index may locate a recording based on words found within the field

2430762
hide	show
it sounds like you re looking for a static setup but likely you will show hide windows depending on what you re debugging and size them to different situations

2430767
contains	any
because anything else is part of the implementation and interfaces cannot contains any implementation

2430769
font-size	display
i want display the content of .doc file in a textarea for my project using php as it is means line break font-size etc

2430781
instances	self
background the reason functions become methods .when defined in a class and accessed on an instances thereof by attribute-get notation in other words the reason such functions can get their automatic self is that they re descriptors -- the function types has a __get__

2430781
instances	self
this way you get the nice __get__ of functions automatically -- and as you see the nested-function lexical closure properties doesn t pose any problem at all indeed it simplifies things -- the nested-function call view not self.view which might be rather confusing if self could mean either an instances of your decorator class or an instances of the class whose methods you re decorating ..

2430785
numeric	zero
for each int you read ada.int_text_io.get uses the default width of zero .so it skips any leading blanks line terminators or page terminators then reads a plus sign if present or for a signed types only a minus sign if present then reads the longest possible sequences of characters matching the syntax of a numeric literals without a point. a subsequent ada.text_io.new_line leaves the line terminator there for ada.text_io.get_line to trip over and zero is not within namerange

2430787

apart from openssl and nss you might want to investigate crypto++ which is quite mature and supposedly c++-friendly

2432986
swing	awt
i believe the reason is because swing was built off of awt and containers is a top level awt object

2432986
swing	awt
it really isn t the greatest design choice though since you generally don t want to mix awt heavyweight object with swing lightweight

javascript	dom
you can interoperate between javascript the dom and silverlight

2433606
javascript	dom
4 if you are wanting to rely on the sharepoint webpart communication channels instead of trying to access the web-parts through the dom you can also have silverlight fill a hidden-field and then call the javascript postback function

2433621
hide	show
and i am using jquery to show hide the sub-list

2433626
python	c++
if need be your custom process functions if any could be coded in c++ and exposed in python through the methods of your choice eg boost-python to follow the same approach

another option would be to switching from cglib to javassist

2433770
versioning	upgrade
.so i upgrade to that versioning just to get a runtime error stating that it could not find nhibernate 2.1.0.4000

2433780
pointers	stack
if there s something that is bothering you .when you code...try talk to them in simplistic terms ultimately management do not want to know the intracies of pointers manipulation tcp-ip stack control re-freshes upon wm_paint mapping network-drive dynamically to obtain some data....you get the drift..

2433782
gnome	kde
you can use dbus interface which gets more and more popular in both gnome and kde although it is more for process events or sending simple cmd

2433786
value	field
hopefully access will automatically convert the old textfield directly to the correct value for the new date time field

2433786
value	field
also if there is an autonumber field in the old table this might not work because there is no way to ensure that the old autonumber value will line up with the new autonumber value that get assign

2433805
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i have done this in php and perl but python is behaving very differently

2433832
keyboard	mouse
this should allow you to catch most keyboard and mouse integration

2433835
32-bit	64bit	interlocked	atomicity
reading and writing a data types that fits into a single words int on a 32-bit proces.sor long on a 64bit proces.sor is technically atomicity but the jitter and or proces.sor can decide to reorder instructions and thus create unexpected race conditional .so you either need to serialization access with lock use the interlocked class for writes and in .some cases reads or declare the variables volatile

2433836
hide	show
would i just have different user-controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2433837

2433886
getter	setter
than the same thing with getter and setter

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it may actually be in your best interest to simply let their versioning languish until you re ready to upgrade

2433913
versioning	upgrade
it would probably be best for you to upgrade your versioninging in a sweep with your own .app s versioning changes

2433916
getter	setter
i have a domain-object employee with the properties firstname and lastname which are transient and .when invoking their setter getter methods they encrypt decrypt the data

2433924
numerical	matrix
i would like to use scipy.io because my desired .mat file should include both numerical matrix which i learned to do here and text cell-array

2433928
value	field
you could also try a derived column component and test the value of the potential date numbers field or simply cast it and redirect any errors as being the null value for these two field

2433938
value	field
the derived classes of this base-class are the ones that actually set the value of this multi-element field

2433962
factors	primes
as an optimisation you can simplify the calculation because you know that the starting denominator is a power of 10 .so its only primes factors are 2 and 5

2434004
highlight	cell
in that picture the mouse was over the left most cell hence the highlight background

what i have found .so far is that it s a known issue on vista 64bit but i can t find anyone that has the issue on 32-bit vista

2434075
64bit	x86
after getting the problem on vista i changed the target-platform to x86 as people have suggested with the 64bit problem but tis didn t fix the issue

2434114
silverlight	wpf
i answered a similar question here with silverlight vs wpf

2434175
scala	java	haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
erlang scala clojure haskell f# etc. all do a perfectly good job at things like this--but .so do java and c#

2434175
scala	java	erlang	scala
if you re using this as an excuse to learn a new generally useful language i d pick scala as a nice blend of highly performant which erlang is not in general though it is fantastic with efficient concurrency highly functional which java and c# are not highly deployable due to running on the jvm and reasonably familiar assuming you know c-ish languages

2434204
communication	messages
therefore if you wish to have the desktop-application communication with the web browser you must use the web application as the intermediary and the web application must store any messages shared between the browser and the desktop-application and the receiver of the communication must poll the webserver for any new shared data

2434219
email-address	bcc
one thing that we have done in the past is create a separate email account and just have the users to bcc this email-address for example crm somewhere.com

2434219

we also allow the user to add some cmd at the bottom of the email for attaching to things like work order and or bills for example wo 1000 for a work order 1000 or b 1000 for bill 1000

2434232
buildout	fabric
use something like south to remove database-migration pains and consider something like buildout or fabric for deployment if you have a reasonably complex project or have the time to learn these tools as they will allow easily reproducible scripted deployment

2434253
webserver	upload
is it wise to store upload files in the filesystems of the same website and synchronized these files in all webserver web farm

2434262
ref	out
the only other way would be to use the out or ref keyword on the incoming parameters

2434270

.so now i would like to have an indeterminate numbers of elements all with 100 width .so they can adjust accordingly to the browser s windows size but all side by side display the horizontal scrollbar in the containers

2434290
hide	show
now since iphone os 3.0 uitableviewcontroller automatically resize its tableview .when the systemd keyboards show and hide

2434290
hide	show
i have standards input-field along the custom ones .so if the user changes the field the standards keyboard hide and the custom one show

2434297
arrays	loops
that s because you aren t passing an arrays to the foreach loops

value	field
what am i missing in the save inorder to clear the value to .when the user clears the field

2434331
value	field
in my opinion for every listened object we need to create are personal actionlistener and we can do it by setting a specific value to the corresponding field of the actionlistener

2434336
contains	elements
well the browser seems to generator a load event on an elements in the context of the contains page

2434338
instances	private
the import directives and methods are sometimes declare as public sometimes private sometimes as static and sometimes as instances methods

2434338
vb.net	vb6
it s also a vb.net project upgrade from vb6 if that makes a difference.

2434348
attributes	properties
if you typically only change a handful of attributes - then maybe having a generics setproperties methods on the service that would take the object id a properties named and a new value might make sense

2434349
webforms	asp.net
retrofitting asp.net webforms themess to an old application i have a need to themes an tag such that the javascript click event is different for each themes

2434368
unpivot	pivot

2434427
dictionary	arrays
to draw multiple images over time the approach i have taken is to maintain an arrays of dictionary with each dictionary contains an image the points location to draw at and a flag to enable suppress drawing for that image

2434427
dictionary	arrays
i add dictionary to the arrays over time and triggers drawing via the setneedsdisplay methods of uiview

2434427
dictionary	arrays
use of an arrays of dictionary allows me to completely reconstruct the entire display at any time

2434432
hide	show
if you don t want to use a plugins like the one in slaks answer you have to either positioning a labels above the passwd field what the plugins does or hide the passwd field and show a textinput in its place until it gets the focus

ubuntu	linux
as stated in the title the program is working on my local machine ubuntu 9.10 but not on the server linux

2436251
strcpy	puts
in that situation the strcpy into tmp i think puts only a zero termination byte into tmp

2436254
required	checked
since you don t required complex statically checked types declarations all you need is a class with the right methods

2436264
handler	service
you could also look at ripping apart enough of cassini to make it hostable in your .app and loading the wcf pipeline in there via .svc files and the service activation handler - it d required writing very little new code that way but still give you a fairly robust and tested webserver

2436283

2438356
relative-path	filepath
essentially it just does but inside that it can t find 3.php which is in the same directory as itself is in .so i manually set the cwd and it works.but it would be nice if i find the rea.son why it can t find.as for why debug_backtrace is needed it s because 3.php is include by another func since the relative-path doesn t work it has to use debug_backtrace to get the including filepath finally using the ab.solute-path as mentioned below

2438366
activerecord	datamapper	active-relation	sequel

if you use a properties on an object to store your value instead of a variables you can add a javascript watch to that properties and run a function of choice whenever the properties is assign to

2438784
windows-xp	windows
this answer is really obvious you are using an older mfc dll that is not present on windows-xp hence the ordinals 7118 could not be located...perhaps copy the mfc90.dll to that windows-xp installation into the c windows system32 that should resolve the error

2438784
windows-xp	windows
if not then it could be that mfc90.dll is relying on an api found in windows 7 that is not present in windows-xp

2438789

2438874
factors	primes
but a numbers may have primes factors larger than its own square root for example 1002 2 3 167

2438874
factors	primes
that said you could implements some kind of recursive solution where for all primes factors p of n such that you also calculate the primes factors of n p

2438898
factors	primes
to get primes factors only .when you find an x such that divide n by x while this is possible

2438898
factors	primes
2 is a primes factors

2438898
factors	primes
the primes factors of 20 are therefore 2 and 5

2438901
any	set
utf-8 can store any character set without limitations except maybe for klingon

2438907
value	field
by setting the parameter field to the field will be the order field and set the value parameter to the order value of you current item you ll get the prev and next

2438915
factors	primes
if you want to find all factorss not just primes once you find a smallest factors k you can updates your loops s upper bound to only go up to and including n k

2438922
any	set
since you have a countably infinite set of possible settings the machine can never know whether a setting on which it evaluates to 0 is still to come and will loops forever if it doesn t find any - only .when such a setting is encountered the machine may stop

2438936
singleton	facade
otherwise i think you will need an interface - session facade set up somewhere which is useful always - a singleton is useful or maybe set it up using a containers like unity

2438937
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
most students usually have windows-xp sp2 windows-vista or windows 7

2438942
factors	primes
one classic algorithm for finding primes factors is the sieve-of-eratosthenes see this

2438948
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari
will this application run in any web browser or just major ones like internet-explorer firefox or safari

2438951
linux	osx
i suspected that the fsync api in osx is slower than linux

2438962
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
most common is the sieve-of-eratosthenes which i ll .post because it s easier but there s also the sieve of atkin which is far more optimized

2438962
factors	primes
the last step is just to find out which primes are factors which is easy

2438962
factors	primes
this will generator primes factors up to 20 million in less than 1 second .so it s probably good enough for whatever you re doing

2438986

2439110
windows-vista	windows
wic is available on windows-vista and windows 7

2439124
instances	private
note that the static properties counter is private .so it can only be accessed by the class itself and instances of that class but not from outside

2439130

arrays	loops
currently i have to loops through the arrays and compare the object value manually and craft each one to the particular need of loopss

2439261
conditional	operators
the any operators determines whether any elements of a sequences satisfies a conditional

2439263
primitive	int
since both are an arrays the maximum size for both is equals to the maximum size of an int which is 2 31-1 see javadoc also checkout the javadoc for both string and stringbuffer .this is because the .length arguments of an arrays is a primitive int

2439287
arrays	loops
try document.getelementsbyname and loops through the resulting arrays to find out which one is checked and what its value is

2439289
specifications	w3c
xpath 1.0 is certainly not aware of any schema and the w3c xml schema specifications in versioning 1.0 even only uses a subset of xpath 1.0

2439291
value	field
second you can only checked if a radio input is checkeded or not .so you will need to loops through all those inpud field and checked which one is checkeded to get the current value

2439317

2439390
subclassing	nsobject
3 making a new object would mean subclassing nsobject

2439391
crossover	mutation
.when i use only mutation i find better solutions than .when i add in crossover

2439408
32-bit	64bit
not sure exactly what you re after but if it is to compare 32-bit and 64bit gac d assemblies try something like this

2439408
32-bit	64bit
note that the splitting isn t foolproof pretty naive impl but it should be sufficient to compare what s different between 32-bit and 64bit gac

2439409
parentheses	keyword
also i usually put an url keyword before the parentheses in css but i am not sure if this is required

2439409
attributes	properties
updates if the image field in your c# code is some kind of webcontrol say an image control you should use the setts on its cssclass properties rather than explicit adding a class attributes

2439420
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this only fails on ie7...it works in safari google-chrome and all versioning of firefox and even in ie8

numeric	zero
the key is a numeric parameter a sequences of zero and ones

2439567
factors	primes
a rsa key consists in a few int the most important being such that it should be impractical to factors it into a product of primes int

2439567
digits	zero
a 1024-bit int an int which .when written in binary consists in 1024 zero and ones -- that would be a bit more than 300 digits in decimal seems big enough to thwart factorization current recording is for a 768-bit int

2439582
click	mouse
i would like my jquery works exactly like this but instead of scrolling to the top on mouse click it will redirect reader to specific url link on mouse click

are there any open source libs any language python php preferred that will tokenize parsing an ansi-sql string into its various components

2439618
postgresql	mysql
i realize i could glop through an open source database s code to find what i want but i was hoping for something a little more ready made although if you know where in the mysql postgresql sqlite source to look feel free to pass it along

2439665
background-color	transparency
both pics have transparency backgrounds .so that you can apply your own background-color

conditional	operators
2 you ve created a wrong conditional in operators it should be inverted like

2439675
groovy	java	perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl	reflection	runtime
it is simply a reflection on the culture of perl and it is why the rise of other scripting languages has accelerated and perl5 is in decline and people who once chose perl5 for new systemd implementation move to ruby python and groovy and languages like java and c# evolved frameworks that make a heavy use of reflection for runtime dispatching

2439700

2439724
dictionary	for-loop
for-loop on strings then lists then tuples then dictionary

2439731
python	c++
you d be better off thinking saying googling wxpython not wxwidgets since wxpython is the python wrapper for the wxwidgets c++

instances	private
finally an overview of oo features in python including instances-variables methods types instances class static inherited methods naming private mangled special etc

2439838
exception-handling	try-catch
if you omit this try-catch stuff above i suspect that whenever your program terminate with an exception-handling the default top-level exception-handling handler provided by the compiler will dump out the exception-handling and stack-trace info anyway depends on your compiler

2439862
value	field
i can checked all the instances field but if they are all equals i d still like comparator to return a value other than 0

2439873
installation	building
first if you are building a windowss .app you need to account for the fact that everyone s windows s installation is going to be different

2439880
.net	wcf
using wcf a service can be hosted by any .net application

2439881
callgrind	valgrind	callgrind	gprof	valgrind	gprof
not quite an answer to your question but maybe a solution to your problem i switched from gprof to valgrind callgrind tool primarily because of the incredible graphical tool kcachegrind which you can use to visualize the results

2439881
callgrind	gprof
gprof2dot works with callgrind as well as gprof

2439888
contains	sorted
that is inconsistent with equals will still work but sorted collections contains

2439888
value	field
then in case all the meaningful field of the two object compare to 0 you could still decide the order of the two based on their special order value

2439896
put	get
put it online make it open source get feedback

2439904
lookup	any
if you see any full scan it means either a you re using non-sargable predicatess or predicatess on field that aren t indexed or b the predicates field are indexed but the output columns aren t covered by the index and the optimizer has decided that it is cheaper to perform a full scan than a bookmark rid lookup

2439958
any	set
how can i set category to any category in jpa

2439959
versioning	upgrade
as for mysql there s no other way than making an upgrade scripting for every versioning that changes the db layout

2440035
unsigned	short	short	base
if you can change the arrays base types to unsigned short or unsigned char you might get fewer caching misses because a larger portion of the arrays fits into the caching

2440046
hide	show
here s what it s doing onchange this simply looks if the option is other and if .referrer_other is not already show show it...if the option is not other then it hide .referrer_other if it s still visible

2440096
distributed-database	bigtable
distributed-database with a bigtable

2440108
32-bit	64bit
you can try storing the numbers in a long-long 64bit integral value just be aware that if your application is multithreading and running on a 32-bit cpu you will need to synchronized between threads .when reading writing this value as it takes 2 clock cycles to read write

2440108
unsigned	short
if you are only doing up to modulo 65535 you can take the lowest 16-bit unsigned short and do the operation on them

i think the points of prepare statements - besides security in query building - is prepare once execute many prepare statements are meant to be run multiple time

2440288
frame	width	height	frame
there would be a way to divine at least the numbers of bytes per pixels if you could tell how many frame the cursor has but since you can t that information isn t set as of 10.6.1 â x-radar problem 7751530 you are left trying to figure out two factors of a four-factor product bytes per pixels ã width ã height ã numbers of frame where you only have the width the height and the product

stdin which is readonly stdout and stderr which are write-only

2440364
stderr	stdout
in ruby you can use the predefined constants stdin stdout and stderr to access the default streaming

javascript	dom
a reference loops contains a mixture of native javascript object and hosts object such as the div a dom nodes is what causes the memory-leaks in ie6-7

2443652
double-quotes	single-quotes
i d also suggest using single-quotes for outputting html since it can make the code a bit cleaner you don t need to escape double-quotes

2443653
associations	model
bake detection the associations correctly and specifies them correctly inside the model classes but in controllers and views it looks like cake doesn t know anything about those associations -- i don t even get a selected tag for user_id .when i go add a new messages

2443690
required	checked
checked-constraints are a low-level of abstraction than assert because they required the designer to do more thinking himself about a all the kinds of updates that could potentially cause his assert to be violated and b what particular checked should be carried out for any of the specific kinds of updates he found in a

2443695
base-class	inherited
instead of inheriting from the default form create a new user-controls that inherited from form and then have that as your base-class

2443710
constructor	object
i m not sure how to do this however because the constructor for html-helper don t take a model object

2443748
stdin	pipe
if you want to carry on communication with the same pipe you need to use the subprocess stdin and stdout members and not communication but be careful of the potential of deadlock and use something other than the end of streaming to signals that the c++ side should do another batch-file of process

2443754
mongodb	couchdb
i ve been looking at document-based databases like mongodb couchdb and redis as alternatives because it seems like a schema-less approach to this particular problem makes a lot of sense

2443901
value	field
i need a random object generator in javascript that generator a variety of object with different field and value

2443916
file-permissions	unlink
since members of the grouping can access the directory x and can modify the directory w even though they cannot list the directory no r it means that if a member of the grouping knows the named of the file that person can also remove it because removing a file required permission to write to the directory - the file-permissions are immaterial even though cmd such as rm let you know .when you don t have write permission on the file that is a courtesy because it doesn t matter to the unlink systemd call

2443927
triggers	insert
you could create a triggers on that table that rejects the insert

2443927

instrumentation	trace
we also do source code instrumentation we could have done bytecode instrumenation as well where we remove lots of things from the code like the assert that we comment out and introduce some random code flow obfuscation the software can take different paths yet obtain the same result this is something that really makes the software hard to trace

2443964

assuming that you care about alt height and width attributes you should reading the image properties from a javascript arrays may be a good fit for you

2444120
tuples	any
a consequence of this is that they can also be usefully employed in any expression of the relational-algebra for their properties of acting as an if else joining to table_dum means retaining no tuples at all from the other arguments joining to table_dee means retaining them all

2444131
windows-server	windows

which can be problematic - i have a numbers of ruby-on-rails 2.3.5 and earlier apps in production that required maintenance and won t be upgrade to the new versioning

2444185
rvm	gem
.so what i recommend in this situation is having a look at rvm - it lets you install and manage multiple versioning of ruby and provides i.solation between sets of gem

2444213
constructor	object
c++ doesn t currently allow you to delegation initialization from one constructor to a different constructor or call two constructor on the same object

2444223
sinatra	ramaze
you might want to look at ramaze in addition to or instead of sinatra

2444223
sinatra	ramaze
ramaze seems to sit between ruby-on-rails and sinatra as far as features and usablility

2444238

perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
beside perl which was already mentioned python and ruby sound like good candidates for these languages i bet some lisp derivative too but i have no experience there

2444321
hash	md5
if md5 hash any arbitrary string into a 32-digit hex value then according to the pigeonhole principles surely this can not be unique as there are more unique arbitrary strings than there are unique 32-digit hex value

2444334
cryptography	openssl	openssl	nss
nss provides a numbers of hash and cryptography algorithms and has a more liberal license than openssl

2444336
hash	md5
the answer above still holds but you shouldn t expect an md5 hash to serve as any kind of security checked against manipulation

2444347
shell	bash
using the shell bash

2444354
smartgwt	gxt	smartgwt	extjs	extjs	gxt
as a base framework for a more complex customized one - examples include extjs gwt gxt and smartgwt

2444355
hash	md5
since you re willing to live with the much-higher collision rate you can just truncated the md5 hash of the data

2444384
put	get
i recommend you do your sorting with the built-in sort methods and put your energy into defining the right key-extractor function to get things sorted the exact way you want -- a much more productive use of your time

2444397
pecl	pear
warning pear archive_zip is deprecated in favor of pecl zip

2444401
sftp	ftps

arrays	map
.so far i have achieved a working tile generator i defined a char map arrays to store wich tile is on

2444411
arrays	map
i create an ugly looking arrays contains the tile i want to use on that map

2444411
hashmap	arrays
i then use this arrays to generator the textures and store them in a hashmap for a later use

2444440
contains	elements
you would probably have to break up the paragraph .so that each words was contains inside of its own separate span elements and then add onmouseover event attributes to each of them

2444451
hash	md5	salt	md5
this is why you should always make sure to add a salt if you are using md5 to store passwd hash if you include a salt in the input string a matching input string has to include exactly the same salt inorder to result in the same output string because otherwise the raw-input string that matches the output will fail to match after the automated salting you can t just reverse the md5 and use it to login because the reversed md5 hash will most likely not be the salt string that originally resulted in the creation of the hash

2444451
contains	set
.so hash are not unique but the authentication mechanism can be made to make it sufficiently unique which is one .somewhat plausible arguments for passwd restrictions in lieu of salting the set of strings that results in the same hash will probably contains many strings that do not obey the passwd restrictions .so it s more difficult to reverse the hash by brute force -- obviously salt are still a good idea nevertheless

2444451
hash	md5
bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set .so a lower chance of overlap but until process power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes

2444459
any	set
i set it to 200 and haven t seen any problems on my systemd but was wondering how high i can set it before it causes problems

2444494

is it possible for me to access a google-docs spreadsheet possibly as a csv file

2444689
atexit	main

2444719
python	java
i prefer java or python

2444722
callback	methods
for a simple operation like the one in expert f# with two async operations you re looking at three seemingly separate methods the initiator and two callback

2444775
associations	model
sequel doesn t automatically create model but you could write an extension that took the output of sequel database#tables and sequel database#schema for each table and did some analysis of the key and table named to guess at associations

2444777
dictionary	arrays
the fetch request will return an arrays of dictionary object as opposed to an arrays of managed object

2444777
dictionary	arrays
are you sure it is not returning an arrays of dictionary object

2444777
dictionary	arrays
from the object arrays of dictionary simply do this to get the arrays you want

2444782
background-color	border-color
or just set the background-color of the panels to be your border-color and the gridlines will appear like magic

as far as sending payment to other users you can either do this manually through your paypal account or you could use the masspay api to send funds to other users

2445774
pointers	stack
note that by using shared_ptr as your return-types you are forcing the use of both dynamic-allocation and a particular implementation of a smart pointers but limiting the use of stack for your types and other smart pointers typess that might be more appropriate you cannot extraction membership from a shared pointers

2445799
defined	declare
also note that the new syntax is still a little weird you declare the return-type as auto and then defined what auto means at the end of the signature declaration.

the standards events are mouseover and mouseout but they can be a bit tricky to work with because they bubble you get mouseout for instances whenever the mouseleave any descendant elements

2446652
mouseover	mouseout
with appropriate logic though they re not to bad to work with and in fact if you have lots of these you probably want to use mouseover and mouseout rather than the alternative below because you can set them on just a parent containers and then work out which descendant elements is involved which can be simpler in some cases and more complicated in others

2446652
mouseleave	mouseenter
ie provides mouseenter and mouseleave which are much easier to work with because they don t bubble but of course ie-specific

2447321
rollback	commit
in methods 2 scoping of tran is limited within try block .so commit and rollback should occur within the try block and should throw exception-handling .when a rollback with no begin tran exists in catch block but this is al.so working perfectly

2447324
boolean	int
mysqlio.nextrow field int boolean int boolean boolean boolean buffering line 1405

2447393
any	set
is there any way where i can set up logging for all package in one place

2447401
selected	cell
i am trying to read a value from a cell that is selected

2447401
selected	cell
as of now this is what i use to retrieve the rows and columns of the selected cell

2447401
selected	cell
how can i read the value of a selected cell in the grid and change this value

2447402
put	get
now to use it get inputstream from httpconnection and put it all in saxparser.parse

2447410
32-bit	64bit
the input parameter is uint to specify the beep types which is can be both 32-bit and 64bit int depending on which windows versioning we call it on or am i wrong

2447410
32-bit	64bit
if yes why is it ok to invoke the call a 32-bit int while a 64bit int is expected assuming that i am correct on this

2447421
rollback	commit
each begin tran starts a new transactional and this transactional ends whenever a commit or rollback is called it does not matter where in your stored proc this is

2447429
irrlicht	ogre
in my opinion going with irrlicht or ogre is a good idea

2447457
getter	setter
the specifications required that both a setter and getter are defined to be able to use the syntactic-sugar for calling the setter

2447457
getter	setter
furthermore the getter must be visible inorder to use the setter

2447458
arguments	default
why are default templates arguments only allowed on class templatess

2447458
arguments	default
instead c++ forces that default templates arguments are only allowed on a class-templates

2447477
vaadin	wicket
but remember some web-frameworks like wicket and vaadin for instances use this methods to show its value

2447480
webforms	asp.net
a really good validation framework for asp.net webforms

2447483
python	java
there are others but these are the main ones that bugged me .when i first started python and i had come from years of java like you

2447483
python	java
before using any of these it is helpful to understand why you should go for pythonic code rather than the usual c java way in python although both give you the same output

2447483
python	java
for starters python provides some powerful features not available in c java that makes your code much clearer and simpler although this is subjective and might not look any better to someone coming from java at first

2447484
postgresql	mysql
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

2447487
any	set
but i would say that you should regard any orm as just an option - if you set up your data-access-layer to use the unit of work and repository patterns then use your favourite inversion-of-control containers to inject the particular implementation then you gain yourself a bit more work setting up but a lot more long term freedom

2447499
configuration	logging
for instances in my current project i have a common configurationuration file that has all of the items like logging that are common to the entire project then i have individual configuration files for items that are different per package like individual database connection strings and variables

2447511
order	add
i need to positioning this updates button on www.euroworker.no order you ll have to add an item to the cart use the kjã p button to add and handlevogn to view the cart

2447511
google-chrome	safari
although there is another alignment problems with ie but not in google-chrome or safari

2447511
google-chrome	safari
i had it working before but the only thing i can think of to do is target safari and google-chrome

2447511
google-chrome	safari
need to change these for google-chrome and safari

2447528
double-quotes	single-quotes
shrapnel said in his comment in this case you ll also have to change the double-quotes in the arrays offset to single-quotes

2447556
arguments	default
it makes sense to give default templates arguments

2447556
arguments	default
see this defect report by bjarne stroustrup default templates arguments for function-templatess and what he says

2447556
arguments	default
the prohibition of default templates arguments for function-templatess is a misbegotten remnant of the time where freestanding functions were treated as second class citizens and required all templates arguments to be deduced from the function arguments rather than specified

2447560
arguments	default
as a result there seemed to be no compelling reason to allow default function templates arguments because the default would always be overrides by the deduced value

2447580
double	int
sizeof int sizeof float sizeof double sizeof char sizeof 167 sizeof 3.1415926 and

2447587
innodb	myisam
if in addition you need to do continuously transactional on these tables as opposed to just load data every now and then and mostly query that data you probably need to look into innodb and not the default myisam tables

2447614
google-chrome	opera
also try with some other browsers like opera or google-chrome if you have access to them

2447616
authentication	login
you may also want to hook into the authentication event of the main login form because you will need to manually checked that the user is approved and if not cancel the login event

2447627
delphi	c++
i ve had good luck transliterating this tutorial into c++ though i m not sure how well it will transfer to delphi

2447635
punctuation	words
is it possible to have a tex cmd which will take the whole next words or the next letters up to but not including the next punctuation symbols as an arguments and not only the next letter or grouping

2447657
any	set
i can get the control to work but as soon as i try and set any of it s properties in xaml i get the following

2447658
filtering	sorting
this datatable has paginator sorting and filtering

2447665
puts	gets
the ontouchevent methods gets called every time the user puts a finger down move a finger already on the screens or lifts a finger

2447667
document	editing
if it can support spreadsheet like document editing it will be good

2447676
contains	elements
the ancestry axis returns all the elementss that contains the context elements going upward

2447694
contains	set
you need to set the publishingassociatedcontenttype of the page layout to a content-type that contains the custom field

2447702
mapping	unique
the easiest way to handle mapping legacy database schema is to add a surrogate generator primary key identity in sql-server to each database-table and change your existing composite primary key to unique

2447703
put	get
it would then put those together and get the address of the elements only .when you dereference it something like this

2447712
temporary	copy	temporary	rvalue
there s more reason you don t want to return an rvalue than just avoiding an unnecessary copy into a temporary object

2447712
device-driver	hardware
it was a bit like an ugly device-driver that include kludges to work around dozens of bugs in different versioning and variations of the hardware -- it could probably be refactored and simplified but nobody s quite sure .when some seemingly innocuous change will break something that currently works and ultimately nobody wants to even look at it if they can help it

2447729
temporary	copy
not returning anything could be an option to disable assignment inside other expression if you feel the need but returning a copy does not make sense at all if the caller wants to make a copy they can make it out of the reference if they do not need the copy there is no need to generator a temporary that is not needed

2447775
wamp	php
i have never developed for wamp the hosting guy for my new client says they are using windows servers they can setup php and mysql for me but they cannot switching to a nix server

2447799
droppable	draggable
what i do is i set the foreground div with the draggable as the droppable but use the dropover and dropout features to determine if the item is outside the foreground div

2447816
uitableview	uiview
i have used uiview controllers class not uitableview controllers .how can i achieve this

2447823
put	get
the reset action is a idempotent action if you call it n time you will always get the same result .so imho you should use a put call instead .post as .post is not idempotent

2447837
webserver	nginx
the server side scripting is php and webserver is nginx

2447839
gnome	kde
i like the appearance it has on gnome or kde but even getting it to look like windows-xp would be an improvement

2447853
profiling	trace
guess you could start a profiling trace then open management studio to see how it gets this info

2447871
attributes	properties
for example create a div with a unique id and operate on all input elements within it comparing the named attributes with your properties

2447883
32-bit	x86
- 32-bit .net application needs to be x86 for various reasons

2447905
constructor	object
i m thinking he s got failing logic in the constructor of his object

2447909
aggregate-functions	sum
i realize that an aggregate-functions like average need to be rewritten into a count and sum to the nodes and that the coordinator divides the sum of the sums with the sum of the count to get the average

2447924
contains	set
the final search result set then contains one best match per group.

2447927
arguments	default
.so i suspect that default templates parameters aren t needed but probably only in the same sense that default function arguments aren t needed

2447928
checkbox	textbox
this will be more suited for textbox checkbox as for combo-boxes and list-boxes perhaps you will have to give them a labels also by showing the selection used in both cases as labelss - what do you think

2447928
checkbox	listbox
a listbox combined with a checkbox used as a readonly listbox here on codeproject

2447933
put	get
i get a html form without the form tags themselves and put it into a ruby-on-rails form

2447933
input-field	checkbox
what i want is that the user changes checkbox radiobuttons fills out input-field etc and .when the user saves i want the literals changed content of the form as a string to save it to my database

2447934
java-me	midlet
some phones will automatically switching bluetooth on .when a midlet starts using the java-me bluetooth api

movie player object itself handled the

2448019
any	set
you will have to read all of the rows in the result set or close it before you can issue any other queries on the connection or an exception-handling will be throw

2448038
linux	bsd
anyone know about for linux or bsd or anything else for that matter

2448042

2448083
intermediate-language	cil
which processor are capable of running common intermediate-language cil formerly known as microsoft intermediate-language msil

2448086
errorbar	plot
to plot interval data you may use the error bar provided by the errorbar function and the use axis.xaxis_date to make matplotlib format the axis like plot_date function does

2448094
button	popup
.when i click upload button by hand file upload popup appears

2448108
value	field
all of the field are varchar value except for itemprice and itempostage which are stored as decimal 4 2 and the itembegin and itemend which are stored as datetimes

2448110
constructor	private
i always create a private methods called init and place it there and then call that methods from the constructor or the form_load event handler

2448150
value	field
i think that methods for saving image is working because i see in db that varbinary field have some value and that image types is correct

2448172
compact-framework	.net
it s like .net compact-framework but with a smaller footprint

2448184
sequences	subset
i partition my payload the text i needed to translation into smaller subset of complete sequences

2448191
event-listener	listener
will add an event-listener to this s onchange listener list which - .when the event is fired - will call the someobj methods

2448231
attributes	properties
you can miss off the .when the attributes constructor you want to use has no parameters and you don t want to specify any optional-parameters properties value

2448236
jquery	.post
checkout paul irish s .post on duck punching with jquery

2448242
typedef	struct
it looks like it s working if i use a class instead of struct .so is it not possible with typedef struct

2448246
any	set
and of course you will need them to set any parameters or properties

2448268
key-pair	gnupg
create a gnupg key-pair and store the files on a safe location

2448274
gethashcode	equals
do i implements these key as classes and overrides gethashcode equals etc or do i use struct instead

2448279
populate	row
add an unbound string column populate that column with the appropriate value for each row and hide the boolean bound column

2448283
arrays	loops
the columns are an arrays .so you can append code to whatever function makes them invisible and loops through that arrays setting each ones width

2448299
typedef	struct
you don t need to do an explicit typedef for classes and struct

2448307
typedef	struct
the problem is you can t templates a typedef also there is no need to typedef struct in c++

2448316
typedef	struct
note that there is no need for the typedef trick in c++ you can use struct without the struct modifiers just fine in c++

2448318
boost	stl
note that boost s ptr_vector cannot be used safely with some of the stl algorithms which may be a problem for you

2448322
account	userid
on user account creation a new table is created userdata_ userid

2448325
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
the targeted os versioning are windows-xp windows-vista and windows 7

2448334
webforms	asp.net
everything should work fine because forms-authentication is not exclusive for asp.net webforms

2448345
arrays	loops
or will it required a loops + creating a new arrays

2448364
url-encoding	url	contains	any
by double url-encoding the url it will never contains any slashes and may therefore use parameters separated by slashes

2448369
tuples	any
but if i just store the id and class in a tuples then i m necessarily going back to the database every time i use any of the django object

2448373
scala	java
for example here s a java annotations that i want to express in scala

2448373
curly-brackets	parentheses
i ve tried various parentheses square angle curly-brackets and .so on

2448373
scala	java
but unfortunately i ve reached the end of my understanding of scala java annotations

2448377
click	mouse
once you are happy with the selection you can confirm it by pressing enter or you can click the file you like with mouse

2448383
put	get
once you create your api url and get your results back you can then put them in an arrays and send that data to a uitableview

2448387
arrays	loops
there is no easy way just a loops or a new arrays definition

2448404
value	field
note the elements field within brackets which represents the numbers of elements the arrays is going to hold must be a constants value since arrayss are blocks of non-dynamic memory whose size must be determined before execution

2448434
grouping	sorting
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

2448436
cucumber	selenium
now what we use is shoulda rr mock cucumber + selenium

2448464
getter	setter
.when you bind a component the getter and setter are supposed to be simple - only get set - no logic inside them

2448464
initializer	getter
perhaps the jsf lifecycle is calling the getter to checked whether it needs to initializer the component and the getter initially would throw a nullpointerexception

2448505
contains	elements
with a grid there is no restrictions on having multiple elements within a single grid cell which allows a designer with free placement to have the same flexibility as a canvas but still have the automatic layout capabilities that grid and the other nicer layout controls like stackpanel and dockpanel contains

2448508
python	java
if you are new to python and coming from java or c# or other similar statically typed oo language these classic articles from pj eby and ryan tomayko are necessary reading

2448523
constructor	object
what is the memory and performance usage compared to creating a object with only a constructor

2448523
constructor	object
reference item 2 consider a builder .when faced with many constructor parameters reprinted in creating and destroying java object part 1 excerpted from effective-java second edition by joshua bloch

2448525
contains	any
fyi i have used postgresql with tables contains several gb of data without any problem and without partition

2448526
contains	elements
the xml file that i mentioned tinkering with was doing exactly that it contains the structure member named data types numbers of elements etc

2448526
simulink	matlab
the code is generator automatically using matlab simulink .so i do have access to a scripting-language to help with the structure creation

2448543
direct3d	gdi
i m trying to redirect the output of a gdi application to a buffering preferably a direct3d textures but i ll settle for a systemd memory buffering that i can then copy to a direct3d textures

2448566
any	set
wcf is a unified programming api for any kind of service .so we create the service and use configuration information to set up the communication mechanism like http tcp msmq etc

2448567
copy-constructor	temporary	temporary	copy
if you pass a variables instead of a temporary the compiler is not allowed to optimize away the copy if the copy-constructor of it does anything you would notice .when running the program observable behavior input output or changing volatile variabless

2448567
copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	rvalue	temporary	copy	temporary	rvalue
only .when the arguments is an rvalue most temporary the compiler is allowed to optimize the copy to the by-value parameter even if the copy-constructor has observable side-effects

2448579
pointers	stack
.when it s called with that first-seen line value it should push a new int onto stack and return a pointers to that int thereafter .whenever it s called for that function with any other line value

2448579
perl	c++
the difference is that like c++ with raii perl automatically pops that stack on scoping exit

2448580
display	height	display	width
it display java.awt.dimension width 1024 height 768 is that not what you expect

2448580
subtract	add
i needed to add subtract from my my

2448592
setinterval	settimeout
you can also preload the in-page caching in the background using setinterval or better settimeout

2448600
copy-constructor	constructor
on the other hand if class does have a copy-constructor that does stuff then the optimization you are hoping for probably will not happen because the compiler cannot remove the call to the constructor--it cannot know that the side-effects of the constructor are not important to you

2448602
controllers	routes
you will probably have to create a new route that defined this because for other controllers actions you probably don t want routes to be undefined

2448612
python	perl
a python scripting would be ideal but i also have perl powershell install

2448625
any	set
the custom-cell can set up and positioning any new views that appear with the new state

2448628
getter	setter
and indeed you should preferably not do any business-logic in getter setter

2448630
constructor	object
it s hard to tell from your initial description but if you are concerned about passing a with a million entries to a constructor vs to a builder then the cost of one additional short-lived object is barely worth discussing

2448651
jdk1.5	jdk1.6
in this specific example you can defined a jdk1.5 and a jdk1.6 .profile specify which jdk versioning to compile each with and tell it to include one copy of the class in the jdk1.5 .profile and the other in jdk1.6

2448661
linux	bsd	procfs	bsd
the linux kernel does not provide a mechanism in procfs to report on tcp socket states unlike bsd and other unix-like oss

2448668
environment	restart
set an environment variables service should at least be restart and even then you must take care of what user is the service running under etc

2448669
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
fyi i have this same problem in safari 4 google-chrome for mac firefox 3.5

2448690
contains	set
if the datatablereader contains multiple result sets you can examine the value of the hasrows properties immediately after you call the nextresult methods inorder to determine whether the new result set contains rows

2448697
mousedown	mouseup
my plan is to initiate part of a movieclip on mousedown and complete it only .when mouseup has been initiated

2448697
mousedown	mouseup
this works well for the first time but after that it does not recognise my mousedown only my mouseup

2448712
value	field
i m interested in finding the most precise decimal value in a database field

2448714
value	field
how can i selected the average value of these field but only compare field where the value is greater then 0

2448719
icmp	tcp
isreachable will use icmp echo request s if the privileges can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on ports 7 echo of the destination hosts

2448719
linux	osx
i tested the following on osx and linux clients and it works .when testing for reachablity of other osx linux and windows-server machines

2448729
instance-variables	class-variables
you have singleton application scoping object which actually mean that it will never release it instance-variables and class-variables

2448743
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i can downloading those excel 2007 files without problems in firefox op google-chrome safari

2448746
order	add
if the arrays comes from the db add a .sort_order field .so you can always be sure in what order the elements are in the arrays

2448752
64bit	x86
note i have 64bit win 7 thus the x86 in the program files folder name.

2448783
credentials	integrated
within a domain you can checked the user-accounts permissions using integrated authentication .so the connection-string itself does not contains credentials

2448798
annotations	mapping
there are no nested annotations as states the scala 2.8 preview -- that means you cannot use annotations as mapping metadata for complex applications even the simplest ones often use jointable - joincolumn

2448798
scala	java
inconsistencies between scala and java collections make developers convert collections

2448804
str-replace	explode
i ve tried with str-replace and explode but failed thanks for the help

2448816
16-bit	8bit
.so basically how does one go about to pack 2 8bit value in the 0..1 range into a single 16-bit channel al.so in the 0..1 range

2448817
linqdatasource	gridview
i m trying to connect my gridview to a linqdatasource to selected updates insert and delete recording

2448831
any	set
.when i take the set of cels rendering by my program and write them out to an avi file and then play the avi file in windows-media-player i do not see any tearing at all

2448876
attributes	properties
the above will add the behaviorid as a javascript properties instead of adding attributes directly into the textbox elements

2448897
worksheet	excel
i m trying to write a delphi program that will loops through each worksheet in an excel file and format some cell

2448904
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen
but you can also use the simpler function file_put_contents that combines fopen fwrite and fclose in one function

2448905
python	tcl
tcl python and other languages work well in conjunction with c code and will allow you to specify the configuration behavior in a dynamic-languages rather than mucking around with c typing and strings and and and.

2448906
stderr	stdout
this will interleave stdout and stderr as desired in a real file that is conveniently open for you

2448917
put	get
if you put the code in the .app your will not be able to maintain it and you ll get rsi from all that click

2448937
silverlight	wpf
i have a wpf desktop .app a silverlight .app

2448963
contains	any
does this seem right the datafilepath is on disk and containss the right data but the msmutable arrays does not contains any object after the initwithcoder

2448974
dictionary	arrays
should i use a simple c# arrays new myclass or dictionary instead

2448992
dictionary	arrays
an arrays access in c# is a simple index operation whereas a dictionary is a hashtable lookup

2448997
derived-class	base-class
move validation logic into each derived-class constructor have the base-class perform just the most basic abstract kinds of validation it must null checked etc

2448997
derived-class	nested-class
each derived-class could defined a nested-class with a default-constructor and place all parameter validation logic there

2449000
dictionary	arrays
if you are going to get elements by positioning index in the arrays then arrays will be quicker or at least not slower than dictionary

2449000
dictionary	arrays
if you are going to search for elements in the arrays than dictionary will be faster

2449014
value	field
i am just trying to set a field value and disable it at the same time

2449043
capitalization	uppercase
navigation and logos should start with an uppercase or if it s a named the proper spelling for the named iphone not iphone or iphone. only use css capitalization for stylization

2449048
contains	any
the other options for choosing which gc to use and how to tweak threshold should not matter in your case because they all depend on enough memory being available to contains all the object that your application needs at any given time

2449049
.net	wcf
in other words compile the assembly that contains your data transfer object in silverlight and then shared it with the .net wcf back-end

2449052
cos	sin
you have the angle and the length of movement which is your hypotenuse .so you should be able to use sin or cos to calculate the amount of x and y movement required

2449055
authentication	login
i got the problem i used to login using sql authentication

2449082
show	next
i have this line below that show a link to go the next page of a list

2449116
logging	trace
for those external apps that have trace logging enabled is there a way that i can attach the tracelistener of the parent calling application to listen to and recording all the trace output from the child called application to the parent application s trace output

2449145
panels	grid
grid allow those areas to coexist in a single panels and allow them to be positioning without regard for where other controls are to some extent

2449145
panels	grid
quite a few program windows take this design and .so i guess .when they had a meeting and asked what should be the default containers panels grid was the choice based on that fact

2449206
environment	building
.sometimes i need to recreate the building-server environment on my local development systemd to debugging the building or what have you .so i usually end up downloading an entirely new working copy into a new workspace and running the building from there prevents cluttering my development workspace with all the building artifacts and dirtying up the working copy

2449214

2449384
javascript	dom
i would suggest using as it provides many function to do things like this but using css styles selectors instead of the nasty javascript dom

2449404
calloc	malloc
which was previously allocated using malloc or calloc

2449404
malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
free and malloc calloc etc is used for basic types but in c++ new and delete can be used for them likewise .so there isn t much rea.son to use malloc in c++ except for compatibility rea.sons

2449408
malloc	free
and one more thing you should never pair malloc delete or new free

2449411
lookup	any
i can t seem to lookup the callstack any lower than tservereventdispatch.invoke why is that

2449414
malloc	free
.when new and delete are used with standards c types in c++ source they behave like malloc and free

2449416

2451276
jquery	.post
you can however use jquery to call the server side code via ajax such as .get or .post and then the server side code deletes it and it would seem as though javascript is deleting the files

try writing a vba macros

2451287
required	checked
if you create methods for those events you can put code inside that checked that the required cell are filled

2451292
packets	ping
you can do an icmp ping to the server in question but many servers will have firewalls that drop icmp packets without replying .so it s not exactly accurate besides if then ping is much less than 100ms then the biggest contribution to latency probably comes from the server s internal process not the actual network meaning an icmp ping would be useless anyway

2451300
updating	updates
now updating these sites is accomplished using svn and through the use of a .post commit scripting to auto updates these sites with .svn blocked through the apache configuration

2451307
uiresponder	uiview
i think you re on the right tracking but touchesbegan withevent is a uiresponder methods .so you d actually have to overrides it in a uiview subclassing rather than in your uiviewcontroller subclassing

2451308
javascript	dom
how to invoke a jsf managed-bean on a html dom event using native javascript

2451312

a better approach is to have the mouseout event initiate a timer which will start the transitions after a brief delay and then cancel this timer if you receive another mouseover event in the meantime

2451472
environment	execution
but php s execution environment is like execution a cgi program upon a page request the program starts and it ends .when the page is finished

you can use jquery to do a .post and send some data to the server where your servlets can then store it in the database for you

2451535
nsstring	nsurl
i know one upper bound is 2 32 - 1 bytes because that s the maximum length of a nsstring on the iphone and nsurl can be converted to nsstrings

2451552
error-handling	try-catch
if you want finer control over error-handling lookup the documentation for try-catch here s a primitive usage example instead of getting an error as before we ll return na

2451555

like binary or xml json or simillar

2451565
order	add
i have tried to add the order option with no luck

2451591
textbox	button
having the client id of the textbox passwd and button login i m able to do it

2451594
for-loop	arrays
a divide-by-two search in a sorted arrays of size n can be written as a non-nested for-loop too but it would have o log n time

2451605
stderr	stdout
redirecting the standard-error stderr and stdout to file use the following syntax

2451624
standard-library	boost
i m looking for an existing solution in the standard-library or boost and prefer not to roll my own unless it s a handful of line

2451634
bmp	png
it is entirely probable the data is simply jpg bmp or png and the tool is basically an sql frontend

2451644
egit	jgit
egit jgit is a reimplementation of git

2451649
sql-server	oracle
can i write the same queries selected insert updates etc. in linq to entities that will be validation for sql-server and oracle

2451649
sql-server	oracle
i thinking that if i write now query for sql-server it will be ok for future oracle db..

2451660
for-loop	arrays
there are more verbose ways of iterator over characters in an arrays regular for-loop characteriterator etc but if you re willing to pay the cost tochararrays for-each is the most concise

2451669
relational-database	schema	relational-database	rdbms	schema	rdbms
this doesn t seem to be a problem for a relational-database but if you really need to use a rdbms i d map nhibernate as closely as possible to the real schema dynamiccolumnid named typeid then building whatever data structure you need on top of that

2451672
chain-of-responsibility	composite
can anyone give a practical example of using the design-patterns composite and chain-of-responsibility together

2451675
selected	textbox
in reference to this question that i just asked -- sql - selected all .when filtering value is-empty -- it appears that for some reason an empty textbox s value is not being fed to sql-server as null as it ought to be

2451677
google-chrome	firefox
a useful way of reverse-engineering something like this is to go into a browser like firefox or google-chrome others do this as well but these are the two i use most right-click on the elements and selected inspect elements. this will give you a nicely-formatted at least firefox formats it i think google-chrome might not view of the markup as well as currently applied styles

2451683
swing	awt
either of these should be inside a awt frame or swing jframe

2451683
swing	awt
windows creation is handled by java via awt or swing

2451691
any	set
the reason why the types of wildcard and its selectivity matter is that a predicates with instr will systematically result in a table scan sql cannot make any assumptions about the semantics of instr whereby sql can leverage its understanding of the semantics of the like predicates to maybe use an index to help it only test a reduced set of possible matches

2451695
constructor	object
the line is blurring a bit in javascript since functions double as classes object constructor and closures

2451695
constructor	object
your outermost function may be ginormous but only because it namespaces other big functions which act as object constructor which contains even more callback which contains closures

2451695
contains	any
at its fundamental level though the rules that a function a functionally self contains block of code should be as lean as possible holds true in any case and any language

2451714
dynamic-linking	static-linking
since there are no way to export map my planned workaround is using static-linking instead of dynamic-linking

2451735
jradiobutton	jcheckbox
note that this code will work equally well if you replace all the instances of jradiobutton with jcheckbox

2451735
checkbox	button
however this is not recommended because the standards way to indicate that only one thing can be chosen is to use radio button rather than checkbox

2451735
selected	checkbox
if the user sees checkbox users will generally expect to be allowed to selected more than one and they will become annoyed .when selecteded one of the checkbox causes other ones to become unselecteded

2451735
checkbox	button
if you really don t like the way jradiobutton button look then i suggest playing with your swing look-and-feel to change all of your checkbox and radio button in your application until you are happy with the result

2451737
mac-address	ethernet
i have a need for some c or c++ code compilable under linux to be able to take a list of ip addresses of some arbitrary numbers of remote hosts machines and obtain a ethernet mac-address for each one

2451737
mac-address	ethernet	mac-address	packets	ethernet	packets
ultimately i want to hand off the ip-address and mac-address to an fpga who will use these pieces of information to format and send udp ip packets over ethernet to the hosts

2451737
mac-address	packets
obviously the fpga will also be given its own mac-address and ip-address to fill in the source mac and source ip-addresses in the packets

2451744
show	next
i am using a listview in android 1.5 to show a list of images and text next to the image

2451750
cvs	git
with git or mercurial managing branches is much easier than cvs and subversion

2451761

it was one where it would multiplying by addition

2451785
jquery	dojo
out of 5 libs in question jquery mootols prototype yui and dojo only two jquery and mootools have a fighting chance to be remotely relevant in the survey mostly due to their unique named

2451785
jquery	dojo
.so most defectors went from dojo to jquery rather than to other toolkits which was not available .when they settled on dojo in the beginning

2451785
jquery	dojo
somehow people like to compare dojo to jquery

2451785
jquery-plugins	jquery
jquery has a somewhat equivalent jquery-plugins

2451785
packaging	building
dojo with its modular systemd the building packaging tools and oo aop provisions .appeals to the web .app crowd

2451785
jquery	dojo
and see why jquery has more mass appeal than dojo or any other competitor

2451785
jquery	dojo
is dojo going to beat jquery at numbers any time soon

2451785
jquery	dojo
while technically dojo looks like a clean superset of jquery and then some and both can be used in the same progressive enhancements market dojo is unlikely to upset jquery

2451785
jquery	dojo
updates i hope nobody will make a conclusion that dojo dropped the ball and jquery just happened to be here

2451786
solaris	linux
coming from a linux background i found that david phillips solution worked well using the solaris cmd crle -u -l opt instantclient

2451790
ip-address	hostname
as long as your iphone is on the same network as your server it should be easy enough to types in the ip-address or hostname of your machine into safari mobiles location bar on the iphone or any other device

2451792
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
if you want only one value stored you need a single variables you can also allocate memory dinamically but it required a good knolewdge of pointers and memory allocation management functions malloc realloc free etc.

2451793
javascript	dom
this means you can leave all the javascript in the head and not have to worry about binding and rebinding every time you add new elements into the dom

2451794
required	checked
obviously locking multithreading error checked and .so on required

2451799
highlight	selected
i want .when user selected date 14 qint32 will be added in it and resultant date should be highlight on 2nd calendar

2451813
instances	private
the best way to do this is to keep a list of active soundplayer s in a private static field and remove each instances from the list .when the sound finishes

2451817
administration	account
you can protect buckets in the s3 or make access-levels with account for administration access only and public readable.

2451819
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
it s better to always use case which is standards sql and works in all compliant databases including sqlite and mysql and mssql oracle postgresql access sybase.

2451859
while-loop	for-loop
note i replace the while-loop with a cleaner for-loop

2451909
attributes	properties
if i wanted to provide the user the ability to create their own properties in a core datamodel would it work if i created some dummy attributes like custom decimal 1 custom decimal 2 custom text 1 custom text 2 etc that the user could named and use for their own purposes

2451924
value	field
if the paddress field has a value then encode it with the geokit plugins

2451924
value	field
i would like it to not required the paddress field but if the paddress field does have a value it should encode the geocode

2451934
attributes	properties
xsd.exe will autogenerate the xxxspecified properties and accessor if you set the minoccurs attributes as minoccurs 0 for an elements .

2451940
nsuserdefaults	nsindexset
this class nsindexset does not work with nsuserdefaults i have no idea why but i ve had the same problem in the past - i think it has something to do with it s object lifecycle

2451951
configuration	installation
installation and configuration of nachos 5.0j for linux - the document consists mostly of screens capture .so it s perfectly understandable even if it is in spanish i don t speak spanish but still could get it

2451973
logout	login
click logout on the whole website does not nullify your login in the subdirectories

2451975
derived-class	base-class
you will have to pass the member variables to the derived-class as well and then use those to initializer the base-class

2451983
getter	setter
but getter and setter alike are just wrapper for methods anyway

2451983
constructor	mutators
if this bothers you at a conceptual level then don t have mutators properties at all - use an immutable data structure with readonly properties where all of the necessary arguments are supplied in the constructor

2451992
ftp	scp
if needed you could downloading the log remotely via ftp or scp and then process the log on another machine

2451992
configuration	logging
if you cannot put on a dynamic-languages you probably cannot change your logging configuration

2451997
contains	any
will i have any problems .when xml serializing this class becuase it contains two field having same named differing only in case

2451999
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
only firefox and ie seems to get focus in google-chrome opera not

2452007
required	checked
and then run a query that required each row to be accessed say sum the non empty value from each row using a column that is not indexed and checked to see if any io has occurred

2452027
value	field
the required_info validation fails as the input data submitted by the form contains empty strings for missing field rather than null value

2452029
httpwebrequest	webclient
httpwebrequest or webclient are what you need

2452041
annotations	mapping
this annotations is used to overrides a many-to-one or one-to-one mapping of properties or field for an entity-relationship

2452060
linux	osx	ifconfig	linux
it needs to work in linux win osx and i d prefer to not have to parsing ifconfig ipconfig unless i absolutely have to

2452066
.when	ready
this image will be show while your .app is loading and then will dis.appear .when your .app is ready to go

2452082
value	field
turns out the value i was looking for the elements in the list that were checked isn t in the field but rather part of the form object

2452090
getter	setter
of course it may be more or less necessary depending on how certain i am that the elements i am manipulating will have the attributes i expect them to but in general do the dom guys consider it ok to use .notation rather than getter and setter

2452110
google-chrome	firefox
to downloading i currently have an with the href set to the file location but click it results in onbeforeunload being invoked in google-chrome not in firefox though

2452123
command-line	cmd
everything works fine .when i do mvn cmd on the command-line which leads me to believe that eclipse is looking in the wrong place for compiled code or something along those line although that is entirely superstitious at this points

2452140
any	set
from what i understand you can t setup a mail writer via a factory .so the re.source won t do you any good but you can probably set it up in your errorcontroller or bootstrap

2452151
clearinterval	setinterval
i am therefore suspecting that calling clearinterval inside a setinterval handler might be the culprit

2452151
clearinterval	setinterval
is it ok to call clearinterval inside a setinterval handler

2452153
subtyping	generics	contains	any
i cannot seem to get it to bind a vector that contains generics as it complains that it cannot recognize my class shape or any of its subtyping

2452166

value	field
i want to test an application which rendering a text block with a data field value

2452275
silverlight	wpf
i m trying to fragment an image into several smaller triangles in wpf or silverlight

2452309
any	set
i don t believe gcc has any pragma for turning off specific warnings temporary but those can get rid of them on a per-file basis if your building is set up right

2452313
entity-framework	ado.net
once you get ado.net or entity-framework running off that it should be easy to migrate to another database

2452313
sql-server	mysql	sql-server-express	sql-server
the great thing about that is once you want to support sql-server-express or sql-server standards or maybe even mysql in the future you should only have to modify your connection strings

2452317
deployment	install
and if yes then at the time of deployment is it necessary to install charts control

2452321
for-loop	arrays
is there an easy way to make a seperate double arrays no shared pointers without having to do a double for-loop

2452331
dictionary	arrays
other solutions that are usually better than a plain list of lists include a dictionary with tuples as key would be the 1 1 component or defining your own 2d arrays class

2452333
silverlight	wpf
i m working on porting an .app from wpf to silverlight

2452355
environment	execution
put another way xor swap does not create new object in either the c99 sense region of data storage in the execution environment the contents of which can represent value or the python sense

2452381
look-and-feel	nimbus
there are numerous bug report regarding transparency components field against nimbus see stack overflow question java nimbus look-and-feel with transparency textfield

2452391
javascript	dom
a dom object is not a normals javascript object well it is but it has more to it which is why you have to use createelement in raw javascript to create a new one

2452403
text-editor	editor
i have been developing a toy editor and i want my editor to look like the vs2010 text-editor which can be dragged out of the main windows to become a independent windows and the dragged-out windows can be maximize .when it s dragged to the top of the screens and can be docked by being dragged to the left or right side of the screens which is a new feature in win7

2452403
contentcontrol	avalondock
.so i tried to use avalondock a codeplex project to do that.but i found the dragged-out documentcontent a class in avalondock it inherited from contentcontrol is not treated like a real windows in win7

2452412
value	field
if the constraint is defined in a combinations of field then every field can accept null and can have some value on them as long as the combinations value is unique

2452434
value	field
both such approach suffer added complexity .when querying the database for a given value of the underlying field attributes

2452434
attributes	properties
btw similar properties of the attributes can be codified as well for example whether the attributes is required or not etc

2452434
value	field
a more natural way eav-wise to store such attributes value parts is by storing them individually in multiple recording of the value table possibly with a sequences field as hinted earlier

2452434
attributes	properties
in both cases you need to alter the attributes table to add the necessary properties and types codes to describe such multi-part attributess

2452434
attributes	properties
similarly to the approach of storing the data in the value table you can either make the attributes recording such that all the info for a given multi-part attributes is stored in a single attributes recording or and this is typically easier and more flexible you can create one attributes per part plus one attributes to tie them together for example with a properties which contains a string delimted with each of the attributes id value of the subparts

2452434
attributes	properties
- there would be one recording in the attributes table with a types indicating that this is a multi-value and an extension properties to contains the order list of typess of the individual sub parts

2452434
value	field
- there would be two recording in the value table one each of the diamvalue and the unit attributess such recording would have an additional field called say parent contains the attributesid of the diameter attributes

2452434
attributes	properties
optional there could be also an value recording for the diameter attributes i personally find this redundant with the parent properties

2452434
attributes	properties
- the required properties of attributes doesn t figure in the multi-value or composite question

2452445
communication	messages
further to rob s answer if you have a large amount of messagess to exchange use the first messages to send a windows handle and start two-way non-broadcast communication

2452481
bing-maps	bing
i am trying to use the bing-maps ajax control to plot pins of location stored in a database to the bing map on a webpage

those scripting process files that are on the server and i want them to be able to see only a certain hierarchy of the server s filesystems best a temporary folder on which i copy the files i want process and the scripting

2452492
manifest.mf	web-inf
is web-inf .lib still remains on the classpath if i leave the classpath entry blank as show above in the manifest.mf file or i should delete the classpath entry completely from the file or i should explicit enter classpath web-inf .lib as the classpath entry

2452502
javascript	dom
all i want is to pass a html dom object from javascript to actionscript

2452503
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
you are probably best to use a virtual-machine like virtualbox or vmware perhaps even creating one per user session

2452516
selinux	jail
either a chroot jail or a higher-order security mechanism such as selinux can be used to restrict access to specific resources

base-class	inherited
i have a product base-class some other classes productbookdetail productdvddetail inherited from this class

2452611
32-bit	64bit
i don t know about memory but i do know 32-bit numbers will be upcasted to 64 for comparisons even on 32-bit systemd which gives 64bit systemd a bit boost

2452627
derived-class	base-class
if i understand your question you are trying to determine what derived-class you have from a function that returns a base-class

2452628

contains	any
would match the first part of any link that starts with http or http and doesn t contains pokerdiy.com or www.example.com link.aspx anywhere in the href attributes

2452746
attributes	properties
the player might have an attributes club_named which is the list of the unique named you describe and a properties clubs which might look like this

2452753
any	set
also this isn t really covered by your question but you can of course set properties in child nodes very easily to initiate detection and any solution would have to prevent that too

2452778
required	checked
you could use transactional however you are still required to updates the tables separately and checked the results before committing or rollback

2452838
put	get
it ll find a lot of errors that won t actually break your code but then neither will the lack of semicolons unless you put the entire scripting in one line .so you don t need to fix every single remark just to get it working but of course if you can follow the exact jslint recommendations that s usually just great

decimal-point	zero	decimal-point	digits	digits	zero
use a 1 followed by as many zero as digits after the decimal-point you would like

2454017
attributes	properties
particularly bad is that qt does not use these attributes in their own qt-creator or qt-designer either especially in widget such as the properties tables where the large row height makes it almost useless on smaller monitor because youâ ll need to scroll forever to find the properties youâ ve been looking for

2454054
order	add
i would suggest that you add an order by x clause where x being the clustered key on that table will probably be the fastest

2454063
click	mouse
the positioning of the context menu is not perfectly positioninging with the mouse click

2454064

these allow you to decorator your properties with an attributes and postsharp then implements inotifypropertychanged for you .when the code is built

2454206
owasp	xss
please see the xss prevention cheat sheet at owasp for more information

2454221
children	nodes
do you need to know if each nodes has any children while rendering it

order	add
.when order matters i usually go for the materialize path methods and add an additional column sortpath

2454225
contains	any
any controls shapes symbols within that class will be contains within and created along with the contains class

2454230
contains	set
that same structure was set up on the iis7 machine but now the error email contains no error information at all

add a parentheses and identifier after the where-clause .so that order by applies to the outer selected instead

2454241
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
firefox 2 opera 9.20 safari 3.0.1

2454279
local-variables	class-members
better make local-variables class-members vector elements and similar items normals object instead of pointers to object

2454281
scala	java
uncheckedvariance can be used to bridge the gap between scala s declaration site variance annotations and java s invariant generics

2454281
type-parameter	return-type
this says that java.util.comparator is naturally contra-variant that is the type-parameter t appears in parameters and never in a return-type

2454284
exception-handling	try-catch
to handle an exception-handling in an orchestration you need to use a scoping shape where you put in the code shapes that can throw the exception-handling and then add a exception-handling handler to it kinda like a try-catch block

2454285
children	tree	children	nodes
you could numbers the nodes from 1..m as you building the tree and store children references in terms of these indexes now just write the tree

2454307
pointers	stack
instead of passing in a pointers i pass a reference or const reference and its almost always illogical to delete free a reference .so i never have issue there typically i create them on stack by writing

2454309
selected	button
i d like to get similar output to that available on the mac by selected the pdf button .when printing from safari for example

2454319
any	set
usually in asp.net-mvc i don t set any selected value for a selectlist or for a list because they dont need it in the edit page asp.net-mvc sets those selected items itself on binding

2454319
value	field
now however with the form in the foreach loops all field get filled besides the dropdown boxes these do not receive their initial value

2454319
value	field
as seen from the viewdata lesplist but .when i send a normals list with no selected value the model binder does not propagate it s given value for that field to the selectedvalue of the dropdown

2454355
contains	any
this will infact occur for any line that does not contains the delimiter

2454396
click	mouse
if i have to overrides the behavior in the mouse click events are there other ways the user could clear the current selection that need covered as well

you might want to checked if they are required

2454421
any	set
i would examine the character codes for them in the debugger to rules out any tricks that the character set may play

2454423
pointers	stack
stck points to the cell contains the pointers to the allocated stack

2454425
exception-handling	try-catch
possibly wrap them in other exception-handling if expected a dal may throw a datalayerexception .so that higher up levels can handle all that stuff in one try-catch but it would not handle .something unexpected

2454426
contains	elements
if elements that contains whitespace only are empty by your definition as well then replace the second templates with

2454427

2454449
stderr	stdout
process stdout and stderr properly

2454460
pyflakes	pylint

2454462
value	field
once you have a recording use getdata to retrieve the value of the field you are interested in

2454472
postgresql	oracle
i noticed that you listed your dbs as oracle or postgresql

2454477
directory	folder
i figured out that you can read from the assets directory without actually using the folder named

2454490
any	set
.so just set that to a high value and it should not influence the short-running queries in any way

2454494
duplicates	contains
however the response header dictionary only contains one - seems the duplicates key are overrides each other

2454506
arrays	loops
if not you can store every clips in an arrays and them loops through it

2454512
any	set
well if you can setup x clients on your windows and osx boxes you should be able to run an x versioning of emacs on any of those platform and set the display back to your workstation

2454538
mta	sta
you required a sta thread all threadpool threads are mta

2454545
contains	set
both classes contains a set of attributes which sometimes even have the same named but i can t move them to classa since there are possible more subclassing which do not use them

2454547
hide	show
the first two items hide the application from the taskbar and the alt+tab list and the last keeps it from gaining focus .when it s show and .when click on it

2454615
javascript	dom	attributes	properties
there is no mapping from javascript properties to dom attributes

2454620
debian	linux
for reference the two major packaging guidelines that you can refer to are the linux standards base and the debian policy manual

2454633
type-parameter	return-type
the following modified function takes a single type-parameter which occurs only in the return-type to avoid confusing .so code formatter i replace with â in the code

2454701
jdbctemplate	jdbc
that s raw jdbc but with spring jdbctemplate it s not that painful

2454722
cakephp	symfony
i would never chose cakephp over symfony because if you have to make changes to a model you can never again generator code after the development has started

2454722
codeigniter	symfony
here you find a good discussion about codeigniter with which i develop at the moment and it is no asp.net-mvc and php4-based and symfony codeigniter-vs-symfony

2454726
contains	set
i am using a insert-into selected from statement to insert the result set of a query into a table contains an identity-column

2454730
selected	cell
a datagridview got a properties called multi-select if you set it to false only one cell row can be selected at a time

2454744
contains	elements
i agree that it is best to delegation the listening to a contains elements in this case

2454765
duplicates	contains
although you may have an identity-column your table for insert still contains constraints that links up with another column which prevents duplicates recording

2454769
abstract	sealed
10.6.3 virtual sealed overrides and abstract accessor

2454781
business-logic-layer	data-layer
you should put an intermediate layer between user-interface and data-layer usually called business-logic-layer as referred to by enigmativity

2454797
duplicates	elements
what kind of data structure is suitable for this problem given the constraints that elements must be insert in descending order and duplicates should be eliminated

2454825
webmail	gmail
you could go with a mixed approach a writable field that offers suggestions on addresses while the user writes an address like gmail does or i guess other webmail systemd

2454831
selected	button
put a size properties of say 6 on the selected .so that it appears as a selectedable list instead of a button

2454847

only make actually constants value into constants field

2454848
value	field
sqlalchemy doesn t try to set the field because it thinks the value hasn t changed

2454865
sql-server	ms-access
i load the source data into ms-access massage it and then move it into our sql-server tables

2454866
put	get
this will bring up a hairy situation in how to handle this and what to do - thus security must be enforced - not by computers but by humans a simple human error can happen such as receiving an outer of product that have the same barcode but the price either increased decreased and put it up on the shelf...this can inconvenience and stunt the flow of pos from customer taking the product going over to the counter scan it in pay the cash...you get the drift

2454870
selected	textbox
this has similar semantics to a textbox + selected but i think the interface looks less cluttered

2454880
put	get
given that you need to put the data into a then yes you are doing the minimum numbers of copy operations to get the data into the map

2454881
duplicates	elements
you ll locate or insert each duplicates in o log n time where n is the numbers of elements already in the tree .so o n log n overall

2454901
duplicates	sorted
high duplicates ration may just be easier to solve with either just a hash whose key get sorted into an order list once in a while or with a combinations of a hash and a blanaced tree hash for filtering out duplicatess

2454911
display	outline
i have used pl sql developer which has a feature called code outline which display a hierarchical tree based on program pieces in the current code editor branch statements if else case-when etc... loops exception-handling and high level structures such as procedure and functions cursor types

2454914
constructor	object
lack of a parameterless constructor means for me that an object simply cannot exist without a parameter that will initializer it

2454917

also anytime you are reading those field out of the database into your object you should checked for the dbnull.value value and convert that to null

2456798
ubuntu	debian
also if you are in fact on ubuntu then you can also fetch the source package from debian unstable and rebuild them locally if you want package that are more current than the last cutoff which for ubuntu 9.10 was some time late last summer

2456845
c++	lua
i am looking for a syntax-highlighting component that i can include in a mac os x xcode-project to allow editing of ruby c++ lua etc

2456849
constructor	object
you will notice for the string it returns javabeanconverter and the reason it does that is that javabeanconverter will be used for any object with a default public constructor which string has

2456856
put	get
the settings won t take hold if you put them in a php file that doesn t get compiled due to a syntax-error in the first place

2456865
while-loop	infinite
edit looking back on this and battling with a concurrency bug i was recently facing anyone implements this pattern might face a problem with an infinite wait if an object being locked half-locked on is being looked at by the conditional of the while-loop this is because there is a gap where the state can change between evaluation the conditional and the imposition of the wait statement

2456877
constructor	private
what you can do however is to create a private function that initializer variables one that your default-constructor or a parameterized constructor can both call

2456879
auctex	latex
i m using emacs and auctex to write latex document

2456882
return-type	arguments
keeping an abi stable means not changing function interfaces return-type and numbers types and order of arguments definitions of data types or data-structures defined constants etc

2456882
32-bit	16-bit
if you expand say a 16-bit data structure field into a 32-bit field then already-compiled code that uses that data structure will not be accessing that field or any following it correctly

2456882
systemd	sysv
edit regarding your question about the chapters regarding the elf file-format in the sysv abi docs the reason this information is include is because the elf format defined the interface between operating systemd and application

asp.net-mvc	webforms	silverlight	wpf
telerik has a great tabstrip product whether you are looking for winforms webforms wpf silverlight or asp.net-mvc

2456895
internationalization	localization
i m building a site using codeigniter that largely consists of static-content although there will be a relatively small cms backend and there s code to handle localization internationalization based on the domain used to access it

2456897
constructor	object
a constructor is a one time per-object operation that creates a new object in uninitialized memory

2456897
constructor	object
only one constructor can be called for an object once it has completed the object s lifetime begins and no other constructor can be called or resumed on that object

2456897
constructor	object
if a class constructor completes successfully then it s destructor will be called otherwise the object s lifetime has never begun and the destructor will not be called

2456897
constructor	object
this guarantee can be important .when an object acquires resources in its constructor that need to be release in its destructor

2456897
constructor	object
for simplicity of the destructor rules it is simpler if each object is created by a single constructor and - if created successfully - destroy by a single destructor

2456897
constructor	object
note that in c++11 a constructor will be able delegation to a different constructor but there are limitations that don t really relax the principal of one construction per object

2456910
boolean	int
1 state diagram can have p states and s boolean field and z int field

2456910
boolean	int
4 every action can change n boolean field and x int field

2456925
32-bit	64bit
presumably we can then have one 64bit jvm on each server that would replace the 3 32-bit jvms on each server because of the allowance for a much larger heap size .when using a 64bit jvm

2456945
udp	tcp
udp doesn t verify the target received it like tcp does - you must implements retransmission and such in your applications if you want to ensure all of the data arrives

2456946
triggers	insert
this could be as simple as the timestamp column which gets updatess with the help of updates insert triggers

2456953
postgresql	mysql

2456954
push	pull
maybe there is some special git-hooks before push and after pull

msbuild	nant
also both nant and msbuild can be customized to the heart s content through custom msbuild tasks and through nantcontrib extensions

2456994
msbuild	nant
.so using nant or msbuild really comes down to familiarity

2456994
msbuild	nant
it is also worth adding that msbuild is pretty much guaranteed to work with all new versioning of .net and visual-studio as soon as they are release whereas nant may have some lag

2457002
python	perl
in pseudocode that looks something like python but could be re-written in perl or shell scripting or .

a million rows a day is a rounding-error for what sql-server orable mysql db2 etc is capable of

2457105
python	php
python has this really cool pre-compiling policy i wonder if php has something like that

2457118
controllers	routes
you d have to play with codeigniter routes a bit inorder to still have site.com pages static_page_x instead of site.com pages view static_page_x but if you have a consistent way of accessing your static pages it would save some typing give you a way of adding new pages without touching the controllers code and might also come in handy if you want to apply to all the static pages something that you didn t think you d need before

2457120
event-log	logfile
you can try to log them to the windows event-log and or a logfile

2457167

2457202
bash	zsh
it is in bsd sh bash zsh

2457224
32-bit	64bit
i ve not done this but this should be perfectly fine as long as you aren t relying on any 32-bit jni code for which you do not have 64bit versioning

2457239
mockito	junit
i would like to inject a mockito mock object into a spring 3+ bean for the purposes of unit-testing with junit

2457239

i have considered using reflectiontestutils.setfield but the bean instances that i wish to inject is actually a proxy and hence does not declare the private member field of the target class

2457241
selected	button
.when i click the button without selecteded anything from dropdownlistfor then click on the button the event click will work ok but if i selected anything my page will respond .when i click on the button

2457261
constructor	object
in flex actionscript a new object can be initializer via the parameterless constructor with or without

2457263

we are now in the process of updating an old .app and there will be some db updates

2457357
contains	any
class a will not directly use any methods or directly affect the state of class c or any other subsystem that class b contains

2457404

2457431
.when	ready
window.load triggers .when your page completely loaded with images banners etc. but document.readystate triggers .when dom is ready

2457447
callback	methods
you must have caution as the callback methods is not guaranteed to run in the ui-thread

2457465
implements	abstract
i am interested in understanding object-oriented programming in a more academic and abstract way than i currently do and want to know if there are any object-oriented concepts java and c++ fail to implements

secondly what then is the max heap size on 64bit windows and why is this different than what s available on 32-bit

2457519
contains	any
it contains any files passed as parameters .when you started vim e.g vim somefile.txt someotherfile.py

2457542
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit 64bit part is unrelated to java

2457546
constructor	object
now .when compiler sees this it allocates memory for this and passes the address of this allocated memory block to the constructor of a which then construct the object

2457546
constructor	object
now .when you try calling a constructor within another constructor instead of allocation new memory the compiler should pass the current object this

2457546
constructor	object
then another reason which i see is that even though you might want to call a constructor within another u would still want a constructor to call default constructor for all the object within the class

2457546
constructor	object
if not then degraded performance as each constructor would default construct all the object enclosed

2457550
fwrite	fread
edit the call to fread and fwrite need to have their return value verified

2457551
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview within an updatepanel which allows paging and has a linkbutton that .when click show a modalpopup for editing recording

2457551
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this works fine in ie firefox and opera but i do not get a postback in google-chrome or safari

2457551
updatepanel	gridview
i have other linkbutton on the page that are within updatepanel but are not within gridview that are working fine

2457554
cvs	git
however this may rely upon recent fixed to the _git completion in particular a quoting fix .so you might want to grab the latest _git definition from cvs or local git mirror

2457565
type-safety	generics
the usual way to make it totally generics is with a void which of course causes all kinds of type-safety issues

2457575
any	set
any suggestions on how i could set this up

2457594
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript failure occurs with firefox google-chrome and ie

2457594
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this myself using firefox and google-chrome on a thumb drive

2457617

istream	std
imagine this situation you have different resources and resource loader for them that take a std istream as a parameter

2457683
margins	padding
might try removing margins and padding on the h1

2457708
hash	md5	salt	md5
all our information is encrypted using public-key-encryption and the key-pair is user dependent its generator on the server and the private-key is symmetric encrypted using the users passwd which is al.so hash on the database .so basically on first run the user send in his passwd via a ssl connection and the passwd is used with the addition of salt to generator an md5 hash al.so the passwd is used to encrypt the private-key and the private-key is stored on the server

2457710
google-chrome	firefox
we had a similar problem couple months ago where we wouldn t have any problem with it in firefox or google-chrome but .when we were to show the combobox on ie the screens would freeze and it would start responding again in a couple minutes

2457715
memcached	apc
generally the delay involved in reading the file from disk is much higher than a caching systemd such as memcached or apc

there are classes declare as inheriting from a base-class but that base-class is not generator defined

2457834
contains	set
i have a model form that contains a decimalfield with max_digits set to 5

2457843
contains	set
.when you get the response back your containsers will automatically contains the set of cookies associated with it

2457881
contains	set
if set to false then the stax event streaming will contains instances of entityreference to represent the unexpanded entities

2457885
margins	padding
it must be at least as large as the combined width of the elements in row 1 including margins padding and borders try setting it to a much larger value

2457893
python	java
as far as i know gae supports python and java

2457916
contains	elements
for example adding an elements to an arrays means that the arrays contains that elements

2457919
processor	affinity
edit as the documentation on queryperformancecounter states it should not matter which processor is called - and in fact the whole hacking around with thread affinity is only needed if the apic acpi detection fails and the systemd resorts to using the tsc

2457938
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with the new site design most of the content that had been on the learn page has move to the new webforms section or the updates asp.net-mvc section

2457941
python	java
however .app engine is java python based meaning all that can be re-used are your messaging and rpc contracts

2457950
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
put the int into an nsdatecomponents object then ask an nscalendar object to change that into a date

2457952
jquery	.post
the jquery #button action does not get called and the form acts as if there is no javascript and just runs a .post

2457968
value	field
something could have gone wrong that wrote a value to that field in the db but for example the filename is missing

2457973
drools	jess
a common example of a rules engine algorithm is the rete algorithm used in the java rules engines jess and drools

2458012
xsd	xml
thereâ s also a really good discussion here on connect regarding the two serialization xs and dcs and a useful points that xs is still the way forwarding for wsdl xsd first development as the dcs is only intended to support a simplified programming model and thus doesnâ t support various xml construct

2458021
jvisualvm	btrace
have a look at what btrace can do alternatively try using jvisualvm in jdk 6u18 which does live memory sampling

2458025
derived-class	base-class
.so the calling code in c# cannot determine if the returned object is actually a derived-class or not it actually appears to always be the base-class which does make sense

2458030
double	int
my column would store either an int double or varchar 255 or whatever combinations

2458033
.when	ready
the .ready event is called .when the dom is ready to be used and therefore it won t be called .when you dynamically load and insert something into an already existing dom

2458041
directdraw	gdi	output	mode	device-driver	hardware
in a gui os for console mode applications the output is draw graphically in the systemd defined terminal fonts to a windows in windowss for example this may involve gdi or directdraw call which in turn access the video hardware s device-driver

2458044
callback	methods
i recommend creating a thread and using a callback methods to communication with the user-interface

2458051
streamreader	writer
i created a streamreader and writer to read the file but i think that i am reading and writing in the wrong format

2458059
directory	folder
to get the base assets folder you need to use the assetsmanager to list the directory with just quotes

2458064
value	field
the problem that i am having is that i would like the validation process checked to see if one of the two field has a value if .so then proceed to submit

2458066
joomla	drupal
i m trying to migrate a site from a joomla systemd to a drupal

2458066
joomla	drupal
the problem is that drupal needs filename and sourcepath in the same row but joomla only has filename

2458068
subtract	add
then you can use calendar s add to subtract one day

2458071
aptana	jsdt
i have been doing javascript development for the last couple weeks and have tried jsdt and aptana to assist in code-completion

2458071
aptana	jsdt
jsdt wasn t very good at all but i did have more luck with aptana used as eclipse plugins not the standalone product

2458081
selected	textbox
however if the user click on the textbox to bring up the calendar picker and selected a date the date fills into the field but the validation does not go away

2458091
constructor	object
think about .when you initializer an object that required parameters sent into the constructor having the parentheses even .when left empty tells you that nothing is getting passed in

2458099
for-loop	arrays
i know i could use a for-loop and reference the next item by it s index but it wouldn t work for associativity arrays

2458100
spring	guice
most people use some kind of an inversion-of-control framework - guice spring you named it

2458109
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
can i assume whenever i want to handle both click with the mouse and tabbing-in with the keyboard the focus event will handle both

2458120
constructor	object
if you want to iterate over an object collections and need to access properties an methods pass cachingiterator tostring_use_current as the second param to the constructor

2458123
value	field
i have another item named my recipes that has a treelist field named recipes and it contains selected value r2 and r3 from the all recipes item

2458153
google-chrome	safari
current webkit based browsers as of 3 16 2010 safari and google-chrome exhibit the following bugs

2458153
hash	md5
the only fix i can think of is this .when you save the state from the first time you visit page a take a md5 or sha1 hash of the page and store that with the input elements state

2458153
hash	md5
.when you go back to page a only restore state if the md5 or sha1 hash is the same

2458163
keyboard	mouse
to detection what event you got with you mouse or keyboard to test it u can use

2458169
versioning	upgrade
but remember that parsing has undergone major upgrade and revision in the most recent versioning based on feedback of users

2458186
order	add
then i add class collection.php in the model mysql4 order folder that extends mage_sales_model_mysql4_order_collection

2458199
32-bit	64bit
what is the target cpu of your deployment -- is it any cpu or 32-bit or 64bit

2458209
gethashcode	equals
yes i could implements equals gethashcode to make them seem the same

2458209
instances	private
why would you go for a single instances per entity vs private instancess per view or per use-case

2458209
instances	private
having a private instances in each view would give you the flexibility of the undo functionality on a view level

2458215
contains	elements
if leftlst and rightlst already contains the same numbers of elements and you want to overwrite the elements in leftlst use

2458233
malloc	free
malloc error for object 0x60e2c4 pointers being free was not allocated

2458240
perl	ruby
has anyone got some great feedback from using the various solutions - seems to be various java perl and ruby based solutions out there

2458250
gethashcode	equals
you should implements equals gethashcode methods

2458257
if-statement	for-loop
if another thread sets agents to null immediately after the if-statement execute but before the for-loop then you will get a nullpointerexception

2458274
http-get	get
the get methods has a further requestmapping refinement it only accepts get request meaning that an http-get for appointments invokes this methods

2458278
order	add
order add id is called via get

2458280
.net	wcf
could you use wcf and .net 3.0 just on the servers at least

2458310
hide	show
i am using a jquery plugins for a quick and easy form validation my forms use the input s default-value as a labels and i have a little onfocus and onblur javascript function to show and hide this .when the user starts to types

2458327
order	add
order add id is called via get

2458328
32-bit	64bit
however using deviceiocontrol is cumbersome and you will most likely have to make different versioning for the 32-bit and 64bit versioning of windows

2458329
any	set
wsdldriverfactory opens the url inside the .new methods .so it seems impossible to set any options first

2458334
implements	extends
simply implements comparable myabs on class b which if i interpreter your question correctly extends myabs

2458339
buildpath	libs
you can create a user libs with windows preferences drill down to java buildpath user libs

2458342
modifiers	final
as noted in my comment to my answer i neglected to account for the fact that tool_proc is a local variables and without the final modifiers it cannot be accessed from the anonymous runnable subclassing

2458345
decrement	increment
out of the box the sliderr lets users slider with a really high numbers of fractions digits but i only want my users to be able to increment decrement by .001 for each tick up or down of the sliderr

2458354
eclipse-plugin	ant
there is an eclipse-plugin that will manage the eclipse classpath from the same ivy.xml file that ant uses to defined it s dependencies

2458373
uitextview	uilabel
both seem to work fine for uilabel but fail for uitextview elements

2458377
debugging	trace
or take a look at the debugging function trace

2458389
directory	folder
hopefully linux i assume that s what you are running on could handle millions of files in a directory otherwise you might need to hash on the task id to get a sub folder

2458419
rollback	commit
it should tracking my changes to the db and then in the end allow me to either commit or rollback them

2458419
rollback	commit
it would start .when the user opened a form i m talking about windows forms here and the commit rollback would be .when the user closed it with ok cancel

2458440
executable-jar	.war
however following that advice along with how i think i m supposed to make an executable-jar .war isn t working

2458440
.war	jar
to fix the first one i put the jetty jar files in the base of the .war file and tried again -- same error

2458469
implements	extends
also if you want it baked in you will probably need to extends the gridview and implements your own code

2458479
command-prompt	command-line
you should try using the svcutil.exe command-line tool open a vs command-prompt to run it which although it is similar to the reference feature of vs is actually a completely different codebase

2458501
modifiers	final
the final modifiers forbids changing the variables once it has been set

2458522
aggregate	grouping
.when i am creating the report and more specifically i am developing the selected to extraction the aggregate data from the oltp database i worry about mistaking a join or a grouping by for example returning incorrect results

2458534
decimal	hex
.so the value of be in hex is 0xff but the decimal value will be -1

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
as of c89 you do not have to cast the result-of malloc calloc or realloc and doing .so can suppress a potentially useful warning

2458536
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
it unclutters the code a little bit and you don t have to go back and updates all your malloc calloc realloc call if you change the types of a

2458538
backslash	regex
literals text span the sequences q quotes regex metacharacters puts a backslash in front of them until the end of the string or until a e sequences

2458550
32-bit	64bit
due to user confusion our .app required separate install for 32-bit and 64bit versioning of windows

2458550
32-bit	64bit
i want to prevent the 32-bit msi install from running on 64bit windows machines

2458572
buffering	capture
this places the capture string in capture buffering and incurs overhead in the regex engine

2458577
value	field
with that in mind you should apply the normals rules for index field order supporting the most queries selectivity of the value

2458586
linked-list	tree
it s the database equivalent of a linked-list tree where a row contains a reference in some capacity to another row

children	tree	children	nodes
inherited attributes which must be passed down from parent nodes to children nodes of the abstract syntax tree during the semantic analysis of the parsing process are a problem for bottom-up parsing because in bottom-up parsing the parent nodes of the abstract syntax tree are created after creation of all of their children

2458627
value	field
it s basically happening .when a foreign key is pointed at the primary key of another table...but if i take off the storegeneratedpattern as identity then it tries to insert a value into the identity field

bug-tracking	manual
we recently reviewed a numbers of possible alternatives to replace a systemd comprising svn and a manual bug-tracking systemd excel spreadsheet

2458641
fogbugz	svn
in the end we opted to continue using svn but drastically revised simplified our repository structures and chose to combine svn with the fogbugz issue tracking systemd

2458641
fogbugz	svn
our svn fogbugz systemd is also now integrated with a finalbuildinger building automation suite

2458675

finally i d like to add that you should not worry too much about your design up front and be ready to refactor later .when you discover that your design does not fulfil your needs

2458692
codedom	.net
there is no libs or function to parsing c# code into codedom object as part of the standards .net libs

2458770
authentication	login
i ve searched around and found that .when implements an authentication module in asp.net-mvc architecture some people opt to place the login related actions in the user controllers while others place it in a controllers dedicated to authentication only

2458780
buffering	streaming
because some native platform only provide limited buffering size for standards input and output streaminging failure to promptly write the inputstreaming or read the output streaming of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block and even deadlock

2458780
stderr	stdout
the article provides various ways to address this problem including the source code for a streamgobbler class that consumes stderr and stdout in background threads

2458783
value	field
ok i still don t know how to get the current data object but i discovered that you can use the report s field properties to retrieve value off the current data object

2458821

if it were ruby or perl then maybe.

2458834
wamp	php
i am newbie in php.can any body tell me how i install ffmpeg ffmpeg-php mplayer mencoder in windows-xp and php versioning should be 5.3.0 or wamp server release july 11 2009 xamp server release 2009 12 23

i ve tried this in ie firefox opera google-chrome safari webkit all going back multiple previous versioning where applicable

2458875
oprofile	gprof
oprofile on linux works fairly well actually i like it better than gprof

2458883
constructor	object
but passing this from the constructor to another object is inherently unsafe in many languages including java

2458883
constructor	object
if you are in a constructor the object is not construct yet

2458883
arguments	undefined
if the other object decides to use the passed this arguments at this moment it would reference an object in an undefined state

2458889
sql-server	oracle
in certain databases such as oracle and sql-server you can index files and search within them using sql

2458901
constructor	object
the class can can accept various types of data via this constructor int strings and sequences object as well

2458905

if there is some support for opening and editing vba macros in visual-studio can you provide a very brief summary of how it works or points me to a good reference

2458905
macros	vba
do you have any other tips for transitioning from writing macros in vba using excel s built-in editor to writing them in c# with visual-studio

2458918
python	ruby	interpreter	runtime
if you are happy for the user to enter expression using python ruby or another dlr language you can hosts the dynamic-languages runtime which will interpreter the user s code for you

2458918
ironpython	ironruby
hosting the dlr and ironpython or ironruby could be a good choice here because you get a well tested environment and all the optimisations the dlr provides

2458944
innodb	myisam
mysql fulltext indexes are only possibles for tables in myisam -- not for tables in innodb

2458952
xsd	xml
others who have railed against the idea of not knowing the namespaces involved in an xml document to parsing are forgetting about the xsd specifications for wildcards see section 3.10 of the xml schema part 1 specifications

2458952
xsd	xml
you may be in a scenario like i currently am where you only have a base xsd defined but which intentionally has defined any namespace ##other ... elements to allow for arbitrary xml extensions from other namespaces

2458952
xsd	xml
in this scenario you ll have to use xpath to parsing any xml from other namespaces which are making use of the xsd wildcard elements

2458960
nsstring	nsdata
convert the nsdata of the current read to an nsstring

2458960
show	next

the cellphone is trying to store the field value as an int and the maximum int value is 2 31 - 1 2 147 483 647 which is one digits short of what you and me need

2459021
jquery	.post
to your problem i recall checked my .post on that that jquery sometimes stripes the scripting tags from remote loaded content

2459077
constructor	private
the singleton pattern required a private constructor and this already makes subclassing impossible

2459080
python	ruby
ironruby works like i expect it would but i m not very familiar with ruby or python syntax

2459080
ironpython	ironruby
i m wary using ironruby though because it doesn t appear as mature as ironpython

2459093
arrays	loops
in the case of char arrays it s a 0 .so you can loops until you read that character to figure out the length

2459131
implements	abstract
once you start looking into implements it as a factorsy the abstract thing will sort itself out either it will clearly be necessary or it may factors out easily in-place of an interface

2459141
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
the clients rarely care whether you used ruby php python java or asp.net

2459156
defined	declare
if that s your code then the problem is as i suggested and adrian also said that you have declare a constructor for your rpn_expression_error class but you have not defined it

2459178
mta	sta
from this .so question that discusses the difference between sta and mta threads

2459180
click	mouse
it would be ideal once the link is either click with mouse or the cursor hits the link that the a small prompt would popup and allow the user to change the href properties of the link

2459180
firefox	safari
onfocus doesn t seem to work in a contenteditable div on firefox safari

2459184
superclass	inherited
if you are talking reuse though can you put alot of your generics stuff in superclass that you can inherited from .when appropriate

2459193
tapestry	jsf	tapestry	wicket	wicket	jsf
there are other java web-frameworks that do this such as tapestry wicket and jsf icefaces etc

2459197
push	pull
fossil recently changed the details of how it saves passwd which impacted the way authentication is done during clone push pull and sync

2459197
revision	fossil
i would verify that both copies of fossil are after that revision upgrading both ends as needed

2459198
selected	checkbox
selected checkbox to install fonts for east asian languages

2459201
contains	elements
it seems unlikely that someone using the features of the c# language to their appropriate level would required a tuples contains more than 7 elements especially given the existing and established techniques for problem solving and c# s primarily oo approach to solution development

2459204
file-descriptor	pipe
sender and receiver use the pipe_fd arrays to either write or read from the pipe after they close the file-descriptor that they don t need

2459209
put	get
rest-based service get .post put

2459215
interop	vsto
some of them required interop vsto

2459218
value	field
a colleague of mine specified the behavior back in ie5 or .so you need a hidden _charset_ field with no value to encourage the browser to mark what charset it actually used but that s superfluous in a utf-8 page

2459234
defined	declare
forwarding declare your variables in one or more header-files preferably just one then defined it in exactly one compilation unit

2459235
contains	any	contains	elements
this would also remove the need to float the labels s which removes the need to specify the height of any contains elements

2459240
windows-xp	windows
i recently upgrade one of my laptops to windows 7 and relized that windows 7 or at least the way i have it set up only supports ipv6 but my desktop is still back in the windows-xp days and only uses ipv4

2459285
activation	account
user receives an account activation email click link to activate

2459291
put	get
the problem is that if i put a list of exam_normal at an exam class if i try to persistent exam i get an error because it tries to persistent exam_normal first but it cant because the primary key of exam is missing because it isn t persistented.

2459304
arrays	loops
an intuitive explanation is that for an arrays with m elements even though as n the decreasing control variables of loops goes down towards 1 the possible cell where the cell at positioning n may be swapped with diminishes the probability that this very cell has readily been move increases in the exact same proportion

2459307
mersenne-twister	generator
given a perfect pseudo-random numbers generator the mersenne-twister is very close the fisher-yates algorithm is perfectly unbiased in that every permutation has an equals probability of occurring

2459349
positioning	sidebar
i discovered that if you set display none or positioning ab.solute or anything else that remove it from the flow of elements on the sidebar then the bottom ul move up like it should .so it looks like maybe the ul is trying to clear the sidebar but i can t figure out why that would be either

2459349
google-chrome	firefox
i ve reproduced the problem in firefox and google-chrome .so far

2459355
playlist	playing
.so far the only way i see of programatically controlling what the control is playing is to set its url properties to points to .some file i assume there s .some way to pass in a playlist

2459360
tuples	any
well the simple answer to your question is that c# doesn t provide any syntactic-sugar for working with tuples .so there is no way it could hide nesting of tuples .when there are more than 8 elements

2459361
value	field
at meeho.integrationservice.convertdocument byte templates string extjs string field string value in c meeho src web-services meehoservice integrationservice.asmx.cs line 49

2459401
derived-class	base-class
discriminated union - there is really no good way to implements discriminated union in c# - the only thing you can do is to implements them as a class hierarchy with a base-class representing the du types and a derived-class for each of the du case

2459409
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have an asp.net web application webforms not asp.net-mvc developed in vs 2008 and i have implements asp.net webforms url-routing by following this link

and what should it return for a properties which you access like a value attributes but actually invokes a function

2459466
put	get
if you put it in the where predicates then you ll get no results because there will be no matching rows in the postviews table

2459482
button	popup
.so my thought is to subscribe uimenucontrollerdidshowmenunotification get the frame of popup menu and display the search button right aside

2459511

the final formula came from observation verified by algebra with the earlier formula

2459558
spaces	output
it s not actually printing a spaces it actually output the 0

2459588
python	c++
well let s fast forwarding and imagine i already wrapped those classes exposing everything to python and imagine also i initializer an object of parameter in the c++ code which i pass to the python scripting and that python scripting uses a myclass object to modify the instances of parameter i created at the beginning in the c++ code

2459607
data-members	private
now in its ctor buf itself allocates a private boost-interprocess vector data-members to store value m_data

2459607
data-members	private
i don t think buf is allocated there .so how come a data-members that is private to an object not on a process s heap gets allocated there

2459629
linux	unix
also it works on different unix and linux distributions

2459646

one solution could be to make the images folder a virtual directory on the iis but i would like to know if this can be done without creating a virtual directory for the images folder

2459673
any	set
il is a form of assembler code and one wonder why we don t see hardware that support this instruction set directly if it did then we would not need any jit compilation

2459686
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview that uses custom paging inside an updatepanel .so that the paging and .sorting of the gridview don t cause postback

2459694
directory	folder
you open up the internet information service manager and find the file you want to modify the caching settings for or you can do it on the folder that contains the file - for example if you want to do all files in a directory which is pretty common

more generally you could just release that dictionary and make a mutablecopy of the dictionary in the arrays

2459745
paintcomponent	drawimage
2 overrides paintcomponent in jpanel to call drawimage

2459746
xsd	xml
it would be best if you had an xsd file describing the xml you will be receiving from the server

2459757
perl	ruby
if you do drmaa has perl ruby and other binding as well

2459759
base-class	inherited
it is imposed that every class in ironpython inherited the .net base-class say classa

2459774
python	perl
you might be able to split on a regex python will do this not sure about perl but since you are matching the stuff outside the spaces i m not sure that is even an option

2459776
constructor	object
.so i want a types length that behaves just like float -- except i m going to make it s constructor explicit .so i have to explicit construct length object rather than have random conversions flying around

2459781
worksheet	excel
i want to validation range of excel worksheet a10 b20 to checked that is it has error or na value or not

2459784
32-bit	64bit
i use anaconda now which has 32-bit or 64bit install

2459787
put	get
in merb since whatever a controllers methods returns is given to the client one can put together a hash assign a renderinging partials to one of the key and return hash.to_j.son though that certainly may not be the best way. in ruby-on-rails it seems that to get data back to the client one must use rendering and rendering can only be called once .so renderinging the hash to j.son won t work because of the partials rendering

2459792

if you look at component frameworks richfaces tomahawk etc - they do it this way

2459830
hash	md5
that means that it s likely an md5 hash

2459840
value	field
if you just want to change what the view display based on the value of a cck field the easiest way i have found is to embed a view into the templates using views_embed_view

2459840
value	field
anything after the second arguments gets passed into the view as an arguments .so we pass in the value of the field as an arguments to the view

2459875
apache-config	.htaccess
sadly without .htaccess or apache-config access you won t be able to do this

2460064
radio-button	selected
both of these properties return null if no radio-button is selected

2460066

object in fact has a named field - the fact that its value happens to be null is not the concern of _hasparam function

2460198
ia-32	x86
as i understand it the x86 ia-32 architecture still has the same basic limited register set today that it always did but the internal register count has grown tremendously but these internal registers are not generally available and are used with register renaming to achieve parallels pipelining of code that otherwise could not be parallelsizable

if you compile the application as an open application you add a few .pas from testcomplete to the project then it will use the debugging information and you will be able to see private data-members of the classes and their value

2460442
lookup	any
this gives a constants lookup in 3 step for any of the 8 value which gives me very deterministic performance a linear search -- given random data -- would average 4 step lookup with a best-case of 1 and worst-case of 8 step

2460442
contains	elements
it would have to create a very sparse-matrix 128 positioning table with only 8 elements contains a target which on a pc with a ton of ram might not be a big deal but on a microcontroller it d be killer

2460817
println	output
create a printwriter on the output streaming and use println to send your cmd

2460856
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle

2461530
stderr	stdout
by default the backticks discard the stderr and return only the stdout of the external program.so

2461530
stderr	stdout
will capture the stdout of the program cmd and discard stderr

2461530
stderr	stdout
to capture both stdout and stderr you can do

2461530

to capture a cmd s stdout stderr is unaffected

2461581
stderr	stdout
to capture a cmd s stderr and stdout together

2461581
stderr	stdout
to capture a cmd s stderr but discard its stdout order is important here

2461581
stderr	stdout
to exchange a cmd s stdout and stderr inorder to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out the old stderr

2461581
stderr	stdout
to read both a cmd s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files .when the program is done

copy the executable class files to a tempory file on application startup use a classloader to load these files and unload the ones from the initial jar file. not had much experience with the classloader but hopefully the jvm would then be smart enough to realize that the original jar is nolonger in use and .so unlock it

2467403
order	add
if you re willing to sacrifice file order i assume not but i ll add it

2467403
32-bit	64bit
if you dont like the idea of sorting the file contents or trying to maintain unique hash but can handle o n memory usage you can identify each line with it s 32-bit or 64bit positioning marker depending on the file s size and sort the file positioninging instead of the file contents

2467411
return-value	arguments
regardless what the arguments are or what the return-value is there is an implicit this which is unique to the class types

32-bit	64bit
windows wants to have time_t be 64bit and linux still has it as 32-bit

2467418
32-bit	64bit
.so .when time_t is 32-bit it should be done with d and .when it is 64bit with lld.

entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram with weak entity set

2467531
arrays	loops
.so i went back to the test code and increased the complexity of the object function each loops was calling a dummy function equivalent to checked if vector intersect and i found that .when the complexity of the function increases the execution-time gap between arrayss and vectors reduces until eventually the arrays was quicker

2467545
shell	ifs	shell	bash
this is more of a hack than anything and is tackling the problem from the other side of things but there is a variables in bash called ifs or internal field separator which tells the shell what to consider a delimiter

2467548
32-bit	64bit
.so i need to start eclipse with j2se 6.0 jvm but eclipse needs carbon which is only available in 32-bit and hence i cann t start eclipse with j2se 6.0 jvm which is only available in 64bit mode from mac

2467724
pubsubhubbub	xmpp
pubsubhubbub also seems simpler as a protocols than xmpp

2467724

quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is heapsort

2467772
double	int
if short is half words aligned it takes up two bytes int is words aligned .so it takes up 4 bytes double must be doublewords aligned .so it takes up 8 bytes

vrml	x3d
i recommend wings3d or blender 2.5 to generator the vrml x3d

2468086
getter	setter
i understand that the trayitem attributes is a private from applicationworkbenchwindowadvi.sor .so i added a getter and setter methods

2468092
environment	execution
you may want to add the extension you want to triggers scripting execution .fsx in this case to the pathext environment variables .so cmd.exe can find the scripting even without you specifying the scripting s extension

2468092
windows-xp	windows
a warning if you are concerned about your systemd s security reconsider this step - the fact that vbscript are registered on a default windows-xp and older systemdd to provide a similar feature has been exploited in the past by virus writer i don t know if this is still true on vista or windows 7

2468111
postback	ajax
unlike the multiview control which does a postback each time a new tab is click the ajax tab control allows the loading of lots of control to the client all at once

2468111
postback	ajax
the only draw back of ajax tab control is the whole set of controls are loaded on each postback

2468120
decrement	increment
it might be nice to have masked edit which only accepts numbers or maybe .some form of spin control tupdown or slider + linked readonly tedit .so that the user can click hold to increment decrement an int value

2468148
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
in general i would recommend using a proper xml-parsing libs in a language like python ruby or perl for manipulating xml files i recommend python+elementtree but in this case it is simple enough to get away with using a regex solution

2468149
scripting	shebang
running it as . scripting.sh will make the kernel read the first line the shebang and then invoke bash to interpreter the scripting

2468149
shell	bash
running it as sh script.sh uses whatever shell your systemd default sh to on ubuntu this is dash which is sh-compatible but doesn t support some of the extra features of bash

2468164
scripting	shebang
if your scripting is at your present working directory and you issue . scripting.sh the kernel will read the shebang first line and execute the shell interpreter that is defined

2468170
data-members	instances
this is not stored as a data-members in the class it s just a pointers to the instances of the class

2468174
put	get
this will be a bit neater since you know that everywhere you put myclass you get a myclass object back and not potentially someotherclass which could be a bit confusing

2468180
arrays	loops
then use a loops to go over the arrays in step of 5

2468183
memset	malloc
.when you call malloc or for char the block is unitilialized - you need to initializer it manually - either put 0 into the last elements or use memset for the entire block

2468192
bubble-sort	quicksort
for instances bubble-sort can out perform quicksort if the data is sorted

2468214
solaris	linux
it is compiled properly in solaris but in redhat linux it show the error bellow

put	get
the closest you can get imho is to put network communication in a thread

2468232
callback	methods	.when	ready
that said .when you feel you are ready to move to a parallels algorithm use the pattern known as apm asynchronous programming model where you spawn the worker threads and let them notify the main thread via callback methods event delegation

2468235
sql-server	mysql
not sure about mysql - sql-server micro.soft shines in that it does not have the best one but one of the good ones but that it really has nice visual tools to show the query plan compare the estimates the the analyzer to the real needs if they differ too much table statistics may be off .so the analyzer thinks a large table is small

2468239
timertask	handler
using handler for example is the preferred way to do delayed-execution instead of using timertask

2468243
salt	md5
for example even though that checked is no longer efficient you would checked each mainbundle s key named as md5 keynamed + some secret salt against the appropriate constant.

2468264
meta-inf	jar
after successfully buildinging my application the start fails because it relies on configuration files which are located in the meta-inf directory and after the building this directory is zipped into a jar file hence making it unable to access the configuration files

2468270
windows-vista	windows
in my code im reffering to files external_program.exe windows-vista windows 7 knows how to handle this and starts the program on the same location as my program in the files folder

i have a jquery colorbox opened over top of my webpage with a dropdownlistfor and i d like to make an ajax call every time a new is selected from the drop down

2468362
perl	php
i m trying to replicate the perl and php styles pack and unpack functions in javascript

2468365
decrement	increment
as mentioned in jon skeet s answer you ought to use the idisposable pattern but as you seem to be using this class in parallels environment your increment ++ and decrement -- need to be atomicity using interlocked.increment and .decrement

2468365
decrement	increment
in fact you may need an object to lock on .so you can increment and open the device .when the count is 1 a second attach at the same moment could try to open the device again and decrement and then close the device .when the count is 0

2468394
any	set
if it is a 404 you can in your form alter set the attributes in your search form to fx the front page or any other page that you would like to redirect the user to

2468438
.net	wcf
if not you could bump up to .net 3.5 and use wcf

2468441
submission	contact
it is a submission scripting for the contact form

2468442
strstr	strcat
also i would recommend strstr strcat for concatenation your strings

2468445
udp	tcp
if you want to learn real network-programming you should look into using tcp or udp sockets

2468466
versioning	packaging
the build-cycle will support you in different areas compiling packaging deployment and release which is not supported by other tools only if you implements it by hand...i ve wrote many large ant scripting to reach this ...other problem like changes over the time are caused by ignoring the best practice and pin points versioning which are used

2468467
notepad++	jedit
and if you don t want the code-completion then notepad++ is a good choice jedit is also a good option

2468471
attributes	properties
.when looking at the code for the order object the data-members attributes is added to all its internal properties such as id ordernumber etc

2468493
treeview	listview
the working code sample here synchronized single selection in a treeview listview and combobox via the use of lambda in a dictionary where the key in the dictionary is a control and the value of each key is an

2468493
treeview	listview
code assume a winforms standards treeview listview combobox all with the same identical set of entries the treeview has only root nodes

2468493
treeview	listview
for example i d typically have code like this for synchronized a treeview and listview assuming each item in the listview was synchronized with a root-level nodes of the treeview via a common index

2468493
treeview	listview
then it seems somewhere around framework 3 3.5 i could get rid of the code to suppress recursion and there was was no recursion at least not .when synchronized a treeview and a listview

2468499
expression	brackets
meanwhile on the right hand side --- the side that s giving you the error messages you see --- you have to grouping expression using brackets

2468509
protected	public
you can also divide public protected methods code into small private methodss which you can call from actual public protected methods and choose to obfuscation only private methodss which will not break link from markup i think it is libs mode of obfuscation in dotfuscator.

2468534
exception-handling	try-catch
edit but you can make it an exception-handling you can handle with a try-catch block

2468545

install 32-bit r and 32-bit java or 64bit r which is officially supported from 2.11 versioning and 64bit java

2468603
32-bit	64bit
on my systemd 64bit windows 7 i ve got both sets .so on 32-bit combinations i get

2468603
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit versioning you could call 32-bit java using 32-bit cmd

2468603
32-bit	64bit
because i can t find a way to call 64bit cmd on 32-bit r

yes you can use a full blown sql-server instead of the the free and limited sql-server-express that is delivered with windows sharepoint service 3.0 wss 3.0

2468663
lgpl	gpl
i highly recommend that you avoid gpl and lgpl and go for a more permissive license mit new bsd simplified bsd as the former will limit the adoptability of your code and project with more liberal licenses if they do become adopted in the industry have the potential to be backed by the industry the apache foundation has strong industry support because unlike gnu fsf which mistakenly views open .source and closed .source as enemies sees them as collaborators and .so uses licenses that allow their project to be widely adopted by the industry world

in the case of char opt the compiler copies the string literals to the storage area reserved for the opt arrays probably on stack which causes the pointers to be different

2469351
uilabel	uiview
.so in my custom uiview s drawrect methods i add a couple of uilabel s

2469351
height	frame
.so .when i init my custom uiview i give it a frame height of lets say 50.

2469351

2469429
specifications	w3c
an id attributes would have had to begin with a letter as per the html 4.01 w3c specifications however since the named attributes of input elements is of cdata types source this restrictions does not apply

i mean .when i click on that button a jfilechooser popup which filtering only images i have acomplished this

2469473
value	field
i need to create a custom constraint annotations which can access the value of another field of my bean

2469473
value	field
i ll use this annotations to validation the field because it depends on the value of the other but the way i defined it the compiler says the value for annotations attributes of my field must be a constants expression

2469473
value	field
is there any way to defined the annotations .so the field value can be a variables

2469474
synonym	term
the words closure is somewhat abused and many people just use it as a synonym for anonymous-function but at least according to wikipedia that s a misuse of the term

2469477

2469556
arguments	default
mandatory arguments without default value must come before arguments with set default value

2469558
arguments	default
the reason for this is that arguments with default value can be omitted

2469559
default-value	arguments
arguments with a default-value should be placed after all arguments without a default-value

2469600
callback	methods
i am trying to use to add methods to a defined class which i then add to a callback list

2469603
value	field
as the compiler said annotationss must be constants you can determine the value at compile time. now if i m guessing correctly it looks like you are using this annotations to denote that the value of those field should be equals .when run through the equalss field validation

2469603
value	field
instead of trying to annotations with the value annotations with the field named instead

2469622
callback	methods
as the first arguments of this methods i give types of service which potentially can be available in the network and as the second arguments i give a callback object

2469622
callback	methods
if service is found lost bonjour call servicefound servicelost methods of the callback object

2469622
callback	methods
the reason for that is that browse and resolve can call a operationfailed methods of the callback object and if i use callback object from the same class i will not know which methods is calling the operationfailed browse or resolve

2469622
callback	methods
.so i create a separate class to initializer a callback object for the re.solve methods

2469622
value	field
.so in the servicere.solved i have ip and ports and i want to set these value to the corresponding field of the instances which browse the service

2469646
callback	methods
the service invokes a methods on the callback .when the data changes which in turn updates the user-interface

2469657
.when	ready
.when the data is ready you can return the object to the main thread an let it show it

2469657

2469679
boolean	int
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# types keyword and their alias are interchangeable but why we need alias from my points of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why alias

2469692
revision	svn
but can be slow to start because checked all revision from your svn repository to create new one on your git repository

2469693

2470078
buffering	capture
yes anything you write to the output buffering can be capture using

2470079
16-bit	8bit
many languages runtime and libs like javascript jvm .net icu use 16-bit strings and utf-16 even though storage and internet protocols are usually 8bit

2470084
installshield	uninstaller	installshield	inno-setup	uninstaller	inno-setup
i need a way to invoke the uninstaller of the old installshield application .when i install the new inno-setup versioning

2470084
uninstaller	inno-setup
how do i call the uninstaller from the windows add remove programs through inno-setup

2470084
installshield	inno-setup
if i reuse the app-id for the installshield versioning to be the same as the inno-setup and then manually delete the old files would that work

2470088
contact	submit
instead .when the contact form s submit button is click it just show the below source code in the browser

2470102
constructor	object
if i want to create an object of types foo using resolve how will resolve know which constructor to use

2470116
constructor	object
they re asking you to create a constructor function called circle which creates object that will have get_area set_radius and tostring functions that behave in the way indicated

2470116
constructor	object
circle is a constructor function because it creates new object well technically it just populate them

2470116
constructor	object
inside the constructor function you can refer to the object created by the new-operator using the keyword this

2470117
any	set
i m quite convinced there must be a syntax-error somewhere - but still don t understand why it doesn t show any error even if i ve set up error_reporting e_all in the index function

2470121
python	java	python	php
the autocomplete works great for java and php but with python it seems to be always suggesting me a bunch of garbage and never the real object s methods from the class i initializer

2470129
value	field
sometimes i will want to fetch complete object - meaning both a and b field are set from the database value

2470129
value	field
but on other occasions i would like to fetch o object with just the a field set from the database value

2470134
wamp	php
you ll either need to install xampp wamp or find a 3rd party hosting service that will allow you to upload your php files

2470165
coalesce	isnull
or in your sql query wrap that field with isnull or coalesce sql-server

2470186
attributes	properties
attributes are applied at compile-time and the constructor used only to fill in the properties

2470186

permgen	jmx
we d like to proactively monitor our permgen spaces via jmx

2470227
any	set
is there a way to specify this or any jmx attributes as a -d parameter to viewmodel .so this can be set automatically at startup

2470236
dictionary	arrays	key-value	key
in most cases very convenient way to store parsing xml data is key-value tree of nsdictionary and nsarrays xml nodes can be easily mapped to dictionary item where nodes tag is key and nodes content is value if some nodess on same level have same named they mapped to arrays

2470240
attributes	properties
i m actually storing the attributes and using them to lookup the properties

2470240
order	add
it makes it easier to add the properties to the listviewitem in the correct order

2470240
attributes	properties
edit 2 i am just setting the properties named in the attributes was i find them while looking through the properties

2470263
environment	building
if not you should not be compiling anything using the ia-64 building environment

2470271
attributes	properties
you can get and attributes only from propertiesinfo it set assign to and propertiesinfo has the named of the properties you need

2470292
python	java	python	c++
this means that you ll be able to compile thriftidl files to c++ java python etc. but you won t be able to compile and run the generator c++ code under windows

2470307
configuration	environment
you could use package configuration using either a db xml file environment file or registry setting to hold these value and each of the 32 package can reference the same configuration rather than have to set up the variables in each package

2470313
subclassing	base-class
you don t want the base-class to need to have any knowledge of any subclassing

2470343
constructor	object
constructor can only construct object from exactly one class

2470358
any	set
if yourobject already uses the id object to determine equals and hashcode obeys the contract you can use any set you want a hashset is probably best then

2470363
dictionary	map
parsing the dictionary file and create a map letters in sorted order set of matching words

2470363
contains	any
then for any numbers of random letters sort them see if you have an entry in the map if you do the entry s value contains all the words that you can do with these letters

2470363
metaphone	soundex
to come with more complicated spell checkedings where there may be errors then you need something to come up with candidates words that may be correct but mispelled like say using the soundex metaphone or double metaphone algos and then use things like the levenhstein edit-distance algorithm to checked candidates versus known good words or the much more complicated tree made of levenhstein edit-distance that google use for its find as you types

2470408
haskell	c++
it is true that in haskell as in java or c++ or similar languages you can call out to the compiler then dynamically load the code and execute it

2470408
python	perl
for example if you want to allow users to enter not just numbers in an input-field but simple arithmetic-expressions in perl or python it is going to be much easier to just call eval on the input than writing a parsing for the expression language you want to allow

2470455
webforms	asp.net
in traditional asp.net webforms the updatepanel control lets you do a partials refresh of a part of a page

2470477
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
i have an itemscontrol with the following itemtemplate

2470483
crypt	salt	crypt	hash

2470488
selected	button
this is done by click on the more options arrow next to the green start program button selected run configuration the target tab then selected manual

2470501
exception-handling	try-catch
.when you have a try-catch block it s adding extra structures into your code for catching exception-handling - which is fine i don t say it s wrong but if you can checked the length of the bounds then do that instead

2470510
callback	methods
.so you should not try to use the server value in the onclientclick function but rather in a separate callback the onsuccess methods

2470528
directory	folder
could you add the current php include-path as a linked folder within your project inorder to reference that linked directory in the php include-path

2470533
webforms	asp.net
i ve started using the formview control to enable two-way databinding in asp.net webforms

2470533
contains	elements
caveat 3 user-controls user-interface elementss are not public - .when traversal the nested control hierarchy in #2 if you are using user-controls which do not expose their contains elementss publicly without hardcoding it .so one would have to do a findcontrol for each elements in the current automapper collections

2470535
persistent	transient
this will return transient object rather than persistent entities

2470538
getter	setter
the setter for that cb adds items to it and the getter returns the selected item

2470543
children	nodes
i need to create a procedure to alter that table .so i get a new field that tells for each nodes if it has any children or not

2470561
value	field
your collections of anonymous types will be compared for equality by reference value - not by the value of the childid field

2470562
uiapplication	uiwindow
i ve tried subclassing uiapplication and uiwindow to access it but still nothing

2470564
concatenation	comma
the problem is that .when there is a function with a comma between its arguments the concat concatenation the contents of the functions inclusive

2470567
constructor	private
but i don t know what to do with constructor and which variables are supposed to be private

2470570
order	add
for the overrides part...you can add as many handler as you want they will just execute in the order they were bound

2470578
configuration	logging
the loading of the logging dll s seams like a complicated way of handling the configuration issue

2470584
selected	button
if i selected â œgreenâ and click on a button i would like verify if green is wrapped by for that itâ s ok and in function delete tags without delete contains â œgreenâ

2470641
directory	folder
#1 contains a plugins folder contains directory and files of plugins i am using inside my project

2470666
constructor	private
in java you would do this by explictily defining the constructor but making the constructor private

2470671
text-editor	editor
.when i try to view the file with my text-editor textmate the editor hang

2470692
transaction-log	ldf

simple tests like sqldatasource gridview etc

2470735
value	field
here is a jquery trick to encode field value in this case textarea

2470766
versioning	packaging
as suggested by romain you could read the versioning from a properties file either meta-inf maven groupid artifactid pom.properties if you can wait until the packaging or roll your own filtering file if you can t or if it doesn t provide everything you need

2470776
value	field	class-instance-variables	local-variables
also in contrary to field class-instance-variables declare outside methods blocks local-variables declare inside methods blocks won t be preinitialized with default value

2470782
itemtemplate	itemscontrol	user-controls	itemtemplate
that said perhaps there is a better way to do this - if the parent user-controls contains an itemscontrol the itemtemplate for that control could be a datatemplate that contains the itemdetailsview in which case you could use standards data binding to do what you needed to

2470784
subtract	time
i want to subtract interval time from my logfile but the problem is i cannot convert millisecond string of logfile into datetime-format

2470785
for-loop	arrays
if you never enter the for-loop say .when the player arrays is-empty the variables tempbrowser will remain uninitialized

2470800
lifecycle	onpause
seems to fix the problem and then you put device to sleep only onpause called vs before - all lifecycle methods were execute

2470803
authentication	login
in the authentication section of the web-config file which is at the root of the web .app i can only specify one login page

2470809
blacklist	whitelist
the logic that process the whitelist and blacklist is like .so

2470809
blacklist	whitelist
a hosts that s on the blacklist will almost never get through the exception-handling being if it looks unsafe anyway and it s on the whitelist

2470817
linkedhashmap	treemap
you could use a hashmap or linkedhashmap treemap if order is important with a key of id and a value of object

2470824
internet-explorer	firefox
there is a downside to this this code only works for flash applications that are running on a web browser such as firefox and internet-explorer

2470846
udp	tcp
supposing we have opened a connection of types either tcp or udp to another remote machine

2470851

2470988
arrays	loops
how can i loops through the arrays below and an elements per arrays with key url_slug and value foo

2471004
simplemodal	jquery
i m not aware of such functionality pre-built into jquery but with simplemodal it s extremely easy to pop a modal windows

2471007
library-project	libs
generally create all your basic class libs as a silverlight class library-project because it is the framework with the lowest set of features

2471027
implements	extends
classes cannot extends interfaces only implements them

2471034
32-bit	64bit
is it 32-bit or 64bit

2471037
python	perl
the one obvious way to do it was opposed to the many ways to do it of perl and the backtick is a perlism that python has since lost

2471043
click	mouse
i have a program that simulates mouse click

2471054
openmpi	mpich
openmpi comes out of the box on macbooks and mpich seems to be more linux valgrind friendly

2471063
selected	button
to be honest i m not happy with this anyway i want a way to hide the submit button until the second selected box has been selected...but i m no java expert

2471067
boost-regex	pcre
alternatively if you just need the feature of regular expression matching pcre or not there is also the boost-regex libs mentioned in another answer

2471079
appfuse	spring	archetypes	appfuse
another option would be to use an appfuse archetypes like the appfuse-modular-spring to create a modular application with hibernate spring and spring-mvc

2471083
conditional	operators
since the || is a short-circuiting operators you don t have to test conditional once one of them passes

2471088
protected	public
the asp.net membershipuser has a protected constructor and a public methods to read the data from the database

2471088
constructor	private	constructor	object
have the object save load itself but required a private constructor

2471088
constructor	object
have the object save load itself but let it have a public constructor

2471103
appfuse	spring
appfuse has a maven-archetype for creating webapp with spring hibernate and spring-mvc

2471137
arrays	loops
i believe that the performance gain comes from optimization of arrays iterator in for val arrays loops

2471142
tostring	equals
for the s if i have tried tostring and also the equals

2471148
put	get
.so i am getting off on a tangent use the put get to talk to registers you have to use the trm and the arm arm to place the interrupt handler code .somewhere you have to enable the interrupt most likely in more than one place in the arm as well as in the peripheral

2471148
put	get
.so now you take your test program that can run on the arm if compiled that way and instead compile it on the lost linking it to the put get whatever abstraction layer

2471148
put	get
if you use some sort of abstraction like my put get you can write your peripheral code one time in one file linking it different ways that one file program function can be used with the perhipheral only in simulation for quickly developing your code then run with the arm in-place in simulation adding the complexity of the arm exception-handling and arm interrupt systemd and later on the real chip as you were running on the simulated chip

2471150
duplicates	contains
we will create an abstract greetplugin class to contains some shared boilerplate code simply because we don t want to duplicates code in our actual plugins

2471150
implements	abstract
the abstract plugins class will implements the greetinterface .so we can make sure all subclassing implements the interface too

2471150
implements	extends
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the pluginss extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extendss creates an is-a relationship but a plugins is not a dude

2471150
abstract	extends
since the plugins extends the abstract plugins we can now focus on the actual code that modifies how a regular dude would do his greeting

2471174
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
the java virtual-machine uses explicit bytecode instructions to reserve and release memory on stack these instructions are generator by the compiler and manage the lifetime of primitive like int boolean double and object-references on stack

2471183
selected	cell
.when you click cell you selected it and cell.selecteded properties changes to yes with automatic change of textlabel fonts color to white and cell background to blue

2471229
haskell	ocaml	haskell	erlang	erlang	ocaml
most big libs tend to be more wide than deep for example the win32 api php libs erlang bifs ocaml and haskell libs stored-procedures in a database etc

2471236
any	set
.so is there any way i can set textbox properties that i may be unaware of for this to work without having to write numerous if-statement in the code

2471238
value	field
ideally within the plugins code or if not by a scripting i can run .when i install the plugins - i really don t want to have to create 10+ field through the web interface .when i set this up especially .when one is a list with quite a few value

2471244
httpwebrequest	webclient
an alternative to httpwebrequest is webclient

2471252
constructor	object
2 defined startcontroller.execute in the object constructor

2471252
constructor	object
you can certainly not have any kind of privileges among functions object constructor that are not part of the same scripting

2471253
entity-framework	ado.net
sqlite entity-framework - this is the ado.net entity-framework for sqlite

2471253
entity-framework	ado.net
sqlite entity-framework provider - another term for the ado.net 2.0 provider for sqlite ado.net providers provide the base that entity-framework building on top of

2471256
perl	php
then you can add some prebuilt scripting language interpreter which will process pages in php perl etc

2471257
vb.net	vb6
if you have used adodb in vb6 c++ then ado.net is the .net vb.net c# equivalent

2471257
put	get
each time you put a different graphics card inside your computer you need to have a new graphics drivers to get your graphics card to work at its best

2471257
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
the same is true for ado.net for each different types of database you connect to e.g microsoft access microsoft sql-server mysql sybase oracle etc. you will need a different adodb.net provider

2471257
sql-server	mysql
is a database server or rdbms - think of it as a lightweight competitor to sql-server or mysql

2471285
contains	elements
that being said i think you are running into the issue that .when you try to access a dom elements in a content page the master page that contains the elementss has changed all your id s

2471294
textbox	button
i want to save the user entered value of the textbox off somewhere in the button s onclientclick event

json	xml
this actually works -- i m able to go to testservice.svc xml getdate for xml testservice.svc json getdate for json and points a soap-client at testservice.svc

2471366
selected	button
rather than hiding the input button which won t stop keyboard users from submission the form in the onsubmit event ensure the options are selected and return false

2471376
sql-server	mysql
i did an importer in vb .net witch get data from an sql-server an insert this data throught adsl connection in a remote mysql server

2471384
arrays	loops
now i want to have a foreach loops which fetches all the arrays elements which have a key in them named types

sql-server-express	sql-server
i am deploying to sql-server-express but in prod it will be sql-server 2005

2471481
any	set
if the existing handler is in your code you could set some flag meaning ignore any changes raised for the moment - but you can t effectively remove all the other handler

2471498
buffering	capture
screenshot won t capture the effect note that the white dialog s buffering is shifted -- it is shifted exactly by the distance it has been offset from the main blue windows

2471511
hide	show
to make one form show and hide another you call show and hide on it

2471522
actionscript	mxml
i m not sure how it would be handled in mxml but you can generator the full string in actionscript

2471527
firefox	safari
.when using ecmascripts typeof on plugins elements embed or object safari firefox return function

2471529
python	c++
forgive my ignorance in asking this basic question but i ve become .so used to using python where this .sort of thing is trivial that i ve completely forgotten how i would attempt this in c++

2471530
textchanged	textbox
you could create a derived textbox overrides the textchanged event to capture the handler add remove call

2471543
crypt	salt
note that you don t have to explicit extraction the salt from the stored passwd nor worry about the algorithm salt size - crypt does that for you

2471555
subclassing	superclass
i always think of it as b having more stuff in it then a subclassing often have more methods than superclass hence b gets the wide end of the arrow and a gets the pointy end

2471593
m2crypto	openssl
the openssl docs talk about engine_finish but i don t think m2crypto offers that

2471603
arguments	default
if you want the value for the default value too there s the arguments gem

2471612
arguments	default
if you want the value for the default value too there s the arguments gem

2471623
paintcomponent	draw
jpanel doesn t appear any different .when disabled you ll have to overrides the paintcomponent methods to draw it differently or with a different color .when it is disabled

2471625
assign	add
the rea.son to generally add an int field and assign it as the primary key to any particular table is .so that field may be used as a foreign key in other tables

2471632
logging	trace
trace is a logging facility within asp.net the results of which can be seen either at the end of the page that generator the messages or via trace.axd

2471633
value	field
access the first field field 0 and change the headertext to the new value

2471654
arguments	undefined
i do not think you should do it as the c runtime will prepare the arguments and pass it into the main via do not attempt to manipulate the behavior by hacking it up as it would largely be unportable or possibly undefined behavior

2471656
stderr	stdout
stdout is stderr is below

2471678
expression	brackets
the goal is to search using a regular expression to find all parenthesized named that occur anywhere in the text but in-between any brackets

2471691
margins	padding
in other scenarios i might have to include a negative top margins to compensate for the extra padding on top which i try and avoid typically

2471704
any	set
i was wondering how could i reload any website using javascript and set it in a way that .when it reload the scrollbar is looking scrolled down to a certain positioning

2471708
radio-button	button
if you can you should try and have .some of your javascript generator dynamically for you that way you can output the clientid properties of your server controls you ll probably have to pass in the named of the daterange radio button - .when you declare a radio-button control you should give it a groupnamed - that way all the radio button have the same named rather than id .so you could potentially pass in the named of the first option

2471712
directory	folder
i copy-paste my clickonce deployment to my c inetpub folder on my webserver and i deleted my virtual directory

2471712
directory	folder
.so now under inetpub folder on my webserver i have the following directory path

2471732
firefox	safari
firefox and i believe safari both respond with function because that is how they determined to deal with it

2471734
contains	elements
if giving it haslayout doesn t solve your particular issue then you will definitely want to make sure that there is no contains elements with a background of #fff that is expanding past the bounds of the contains elements likely due to ie6 s way of handling padding and width

2471747
duplicates	elements
i ve ruled out the obvious things like a duplicates elements id or simply not linking to jquery

2471761
hash	md5
try to do a hash like md5 on each bolb and see if they are the same

2471798
droppable	draggable
using droppable to provide feedback is not a good option due to their deeply nested structure using greedy .so i would like to give visual feedback by changing the draggable the clone

getter	setter
i see that tax information is kept at order level but i cannot see any setter getter for it

2471822
profiling	debugging
as suggested in the comments you should contact the builder of the program and suggest that they debugging it using a profiling and properly dispose of the object or to let them go out of scoping .so the garbage collector can dispose of them

2471822
buffering	streaming
also you might suggest that if the error is occurring .when a file is being loaded that they load the file via a streaming using buffering rather than loading the whole file into memory at one time and then release it after it is no longer needed

2471828
directory	folder
caurina folder in local directory

2471834

i ve been assign a project for a website where users will be allowed to upload video s using a youtube-api but more importantly for me they will also be allowed to submit video embed codes from numerous video sites youtube vimeo etc

2471843
duplicates	sorted
lots of pages with very similar content page 1 sorted by date desc page 1 sorted by date asc etc - search engines don t like duplicates content and nor should you as google for instances will only show two pages from your site in a default result set you want them to be valid not duplicatess

2471859
variables	boolean
probably the safest way is to have the user tell you if it is in an applet just add a boolean variables to the appropriate constructor s and or methods s

2471869
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i am using the cycle plugins within joomla and it works fine on ie6 firefox safari google-chrome however .when you view it in opera breaking happens

h.323 is still prevalent but sip seems to be taking over

2471878
condition-variable	shared-memory
the condition-variable and the mutex are initializer in the server and shared between process through a shared-memory area because i m not working with threads but with separate process an i m sure my kernel syscall support it because i checked _posix_thread_process_shared

2471889
any	set
get display on a layer above the actual page and .so always appear above any html no matter how high you try to set the z-index

2471926
constructor	object
the demos include in the prevayler distribution show how to pass in a couple strings or something simple like that into a cmd constructor inorder to create or updates an object

2471926
lookup	any
therefore a transactional must carry some kind of string or numeric identifier for any object it wants to refer to and it must lookup the object .when it is execute

2471942
python	perl
am i correct in thinking that that python doesn t have a direct equivalent for perl s __end__

2471946
delphi	c++
does anyone know a 100 clone of the c++ printf for delphi

restart	reload
is there a way to get it to reload the class rather than having to restart the repl

2471957
buffering	streaming
i ve browsed through the boost binary_oarchive source code and it seems that it reads writes the raw vector arrays data directly from to the streaming buffering

2471961
logout	login
you could calculate these every hour or alternatively you could increment each hour s counter at login logout events and avoid a scheduling task

2471968
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
most people have upgrade to firefox 3+ by now and webkit browsers safari google-chrome etc have had it implements for awhile and even ie5.5+ supports font-face

2471985
python	perl
the triple-quote form you suggested will still create a python string whereas perl s parsing simply ignore anything after __end__

2472004
ubuntu	linux
linux support is tested on ubuntu and fedora but it may or may not work on others

2472032
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to implements this logic by using the mouseenter and mouseleave events one each form something like

2472052
display	height
can i get gnuplot to display the exact y-value or height of a data points plotted using with boxes over its bar

2472085
hide	next
in response to your updates a nice way to achieve that for pages would be to have links to previous and next pages of results or better yet a list of all pages in the list output on the page with the page numbers that you then hide with javascript

2472094
session-cookies	cookies
you will need to pass on the session-cookies and reset that cookies on the new domain

2472105
updating	updates
since the dao layer is responsible for retrieving or updating this data in the backend this means it is the dao layer which needs to know how to fetch your customer or order class from cassandra how to updates certain customer field etc

2472109
configuration	installation	configuration	environment	installation	environment
as best as i can tell the problem lies in the environment configuration of the servers either operating systemd or sql-server installation

2472126
gethashcode	equals
equals nor gethashcode has been overrides at this points

2472137
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
perl ruby and python all have a module available called mechanize designed to automate integration with website

2472161
gethashcode	equals
you haven t show any thing about paymenttypeinfo - does it overrides equals and gethashcode appropriately

2472161
gethashcode	equals
either make paymenttypeinfo overrides equals and gethashcode or pass an appropriate into the contains methods

2472161
gethashcode	equals
as slaks mentions in the comments in this case gethashcode won t actually get called - but you should always overrides both equals and gethashcode or neither of them

2472170
.when	ready
.when you are signals one process from another process it is set on the ready list but not necessarily scheduling and your conditional x y may be change again since no one holds the lock

2472251
bazaar	git
.so why are dvcs such as git mercurial and bazaar better than subversion at branching and merging

2472251
push	pull
there are no virtual directory by design and branches are hard object in dvcs which it needs to be such inorder to work simply with synchronized of repositories push and pull

2472251
bazaar	git
the first thing you do .when you work with a dvcs is to clone repositories git s clone hg s clone and bazaar s branch

2472251
bazaar	git
since i don t want this answer to be any more verbose i ll let you read the git mercurial or bazaar docs about that instead

2472251
bazaar	git
there is also the issue of sending patches between each developer that was a huge problem in subversion which is mitigated in git hg and bazaar by uniquely identifiable revision

2472292

csv	tsv
what s the easiest fastest way to grab data out of a yui-datatable and turn it into a single csv or tsv string

2472436

2472451
oracle	mysql
what would be equivalent of numbers 4 of oracle to mysql datatype

2472501

you could certainly use the button that you want in your menu to show and hide a uitableview

2472604
value	field
i m having some trouble comparing value found in varchar field

2472609
radio-button	selected
.so i want to be able to click on the links and not have the radio-button as.sociated with it become selected

2472609
radio-button	selected
in ie it works fine but in firefox the radio-button will be selected .when i click on the link

2472609
radio-button	selected
i don t really need the labels to actually selected the proper radio-button .so is there a way to just disable them either in javascript or .somewhere in the asp or c# code

2472624

i believe that django form receives file only after it was upload completely.that s why if somebody upload 2gb file you re much better off with webserver checked for size on-the-fly

2472806
buildpath	libs
.so each time i have to go to the libs tab in buildpath to re-target the api

2472823
directory	folder
click the directory folder

2472844

2472849
external	embed
is there any way to embed flash completely in html without reference to an external swf file

2472862
buffering	capture
it allows you to capture all of the user s input before the enter and is not subject to buffering overflows

2472874
value	field
browsers will properly encode form field value and cgi.pm will properly decode them

2472886
data-access	ado.net
this can be implied from multiple sources of documentation including this one data-access strategies using ado.net and sql

2472890
decimal	hex
converting a 20 decimal numbers into hex would result in a 16 digits hexadecimal not a 13 digits one

2472890

please note i m not asking someone to do the whole thing for me as i want to learn and i m confident i can do the rest including addition subtraction etc

2472921
reflection	runtime
instead of having a certain runtime reflection approach forced on me i d rather have compile-time reflection capabilities that i could use to generator the information i need

2472951
session-cookies	cookies
i think the answer is it depends. for the close-and-reopened browser question it depends on whether your sites use session-cookies or persistent cookies to authentication request

2472964
binary-search-tree	nodes
i want to make my avl-tree support duplicates key but there is a problem with the default behavior of the binary-search-tree with duplicatess that the rotation could make nodes with equals key be on the left and the right of the parent

authentication	login
they have seperate login for each database sql authentication login

2472994
value	field
store the operands value in operationtype field plus minus etc

2473017
environment	execution
as pointed out by jerry bullard the evaluation portion of the lifecycle is critical to determining the execution plan which provides information about the environment since the environment is partially determined by the execution context example 4.15 in the configure by dag section

2473029
document	editing
it looks like the document outline view has been around a long time document outline view but whether previous versioning support in-place editing of control named i don t know

2473069
enumerator	any
.when you press an operators copy the current value to the previous value taking into account any remembered oparator present in the enumerator attribute. the assignment-operators copies the result-of the operation back into the current value and the c operators clears both current and previous value

2473094
uitableview	uiview
otherwise i think your best option is to overlay a custom uiview subclassing over your uitableview and handle gestures there making sure to relay any non-gesture-related events to the uitableview

2473105
contains	any	contains	elements
for example think of poping an object from a stack before checked if it actually contains any elements

2473113
processor	cpu
if is your range then if you could generator 10 10 random numberss per second if you have a 3 ghz processor and about 4 cores on which you generator one random numbers per cpu cycle - which is imposible and ruby will even slow it down a lot then it would take about 10 180 years to exhaust all the numberss

2473137
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
i have a data-access-layer a business-logic-layer and a presentation layer ie

2473143
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited

2473171
google-chrome	firefox
the same example tested in ie8 firefox and google-chrome behaves exactly as expected

2473182

the enumerator needs to be public .so other types can reference it - you want to store a private reference to an instances of that enumerator

2473350
instances	private
in the second example you are defining a private types and then returning an instances through a public properties

2473370
factors	primes
in that case a primes that is not a factors of n should work

2473379
reflection	runtime
this mainly has to do with the fact that c++ does not have runtime reflection natively anyway

2473379
fltk	gtk
you could also look at the billions of other gui toolkits like gtk tk fltk yaaf glui dlib clx.

2473380
silverlight	wpf
plus learning prism gave me a much better understanding of wpf silverlight at least from the development binding side

2473481
parser-generator	antlr
parser-generator such as antlr 3 can easily cope with this

2473485

decimal-point	zero	decimal-point	digits	digits	zero
if the scale is less than zero the value will be rounded to scale digits left the decimal-point

2473516
instanceof	typeof
you might also defined an empty parameter set and use func_get_args to pull in parameters and analyze those using instanceof or typeof gettype for typechecking if your function is simple enough

2473526
instances	private
besides that i m pretty sure that it is wrong to have direct access to a private methods of a class instances

2473539

2473753
value	field
each customer types has 10 value associated with it based on the other two key field

2473753
value	field
i want to insert typeb as the customertype but then just copy the value from typea s rows for the other three field

2473773
versioning	migrate
if ever you need to migrate to the next versioning of sharepoint or another server it is easier to not have any custom site definitions

2473784
web-services	webserver	communication	messages
if not you could handle the authentication and communication with 3rd party web-services on your webserver and route the messages from your server to your clients

2473785
hash	md5
anyway you should just use a bigger hash - find an md5 function - if you re actually hashing .something or a uuid generator with more than 4 characters and yes you could use a while-loop but just generator a big enough one .so that conflicts are incredibly unlikely

2473822
internet-explorer	firefox
different micro-optimization have different results in different implementation sometimes conflicting results a being better in internet-explorer but much worse in firefox and the converse

2473829
vbscript	jscript
i have been asked dozens of time over the years for my list of tips and tricks that people can use to optimize their vbscript their jscript their active server pages their vb their c# code

2473829
any	set
this is the same as you d solve any other engineering problem like adding a feature -- set customer focused goals for the feature tracking progress on making a solid implementation fix problems as you find them through careful debugging analysis keep iterator until you ship or fail

2473842
pipe	tail
currently i m using a hodge podged methods that pipe an ls cmd to sed sort cut and tail inorder to get the named out

2473862
coldfusion	.post
pete freitag has an awesome blog especially this .post on hardening coldfusion

2473867
put	get
i think this data will also be useful for me to decide whether to upgrade one machine or get another dedicated machine and put all the databases on that one

2473875
processor	cpu
as processor continue to get faster the main bottleneck in most applications isn t cpu it s bandwidth bandwidth to off-chip memory bandwidth to disk and bandwidth to .net

2473877
bean-validation	spring
actually there is something a little bit like it based on the jsr-303 bean-validation specifications which is now final and fully supported by spring 3.0

2473877
bean-validation	spring
however if it is sporadic spring javascript bean-validation could be the way to go

2473914
any	set
then at any moment set dowrite yes and next buffering will be saved to file

2473920
versioning	upgrade
i ve struggled finding anyone else trying to upgrade the versioning of git-svn and i m guessing this client versioning restrictions is unusual but i m stuck with it corporate environment.

2473925
decrement	increment
use the clock methods 00 00 and put little arrow button above and below the hours and minutes section .so they can click to increment decrement plus they can types it in just like the vote button on the left

2473928
tuples	any
also i m not sure but it could be that year month day hour minute second tuples is predefined somewhere in python std .lib or it can be easily replace with some other construct but it s midnight here and i don t see any other obvious solution

2473940
highlight	selected
i have added a bit of css to highlight today as if it was any other selected date

2473953
hide	show
i m trying to create a loops where if there s only 1 of these divs the delete link should hide and if there are more than 1 of these divs the delete link should show up on all the divs

2473959
show	next
it does not show how to retrieve the fieldset and validation or how to stop the progression to the next fieldset if the form is invalid

2473967
environment	restart
which restart the repl environment and plays back all previous valid cmd

2473971
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that if i modify the extension of an image let s say to .jpgq or even .jpg and i try to upload it firefox and google-chrome will say that the file s types is application octet-stream and normally the conditional will be false

2473972
put	get
i ve seen this before .so i put the validateinput false on the controllers but no joy - i still get the error

2473974
user-interface	drawing
the end result would be that after every image was process the user-interface would have a tenth of a second to process any pending user-interface events - like drawing the image on the screens

2473976
enumerator	any
for each user they enter there s a client scripting coupled with ajax that creates an for each user entered enumerator index is therefore not always 0 as written here .so default model binder is able to consume and bind the form without any problems

2473976
attributes	properties
i would put actual validation attributes and omit properties i don t need

2473979
scriptaculous	jquery	lightbox	jquery
the previous developer incorporated a head.inc file which loads up prototype scriptaculous and then many of the pages are in a sub-template loading up jquery for functions like lightbox

2473980
uilabel	uiview
.so i have a bunch of uiview that i made programmatically and placed a bunch of content on uibarbuttonitem uilabel uinavigationbars etc. and most of these views are going to need to actually be uiscrollviews instead

2473991
gnome	kde
there is the systemd tray protocols which i believe both gnome and kde use

2473992
value	field
in my updates form i want the field to recall the value that are already stored

2474000
credentials	security
to address the security disadvantage of this they recommend implements a shell replacement to place the server in a kiosk-mode on login no explorer access without appropriate credentials etc.

2474021
null-pointer	lvalue
a null-pointer does not refer to an object therefore .when we use the lvalue we have undefined-behavior

2474040
queue	fifo
if you want to limit the arrays s length use a function in which you checked the length and optional remove the oldest elements as you append a new one this is in principles a fifo queue

2474060
contains	any
the common language runtime automatically maintains a table called the intern pool which contains a single instances of each unique literals string constants declare in a program as well as any unique instances of string you add programmatically

2474062
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i ve got a webserver that will take scripting in python php or perl

2474079
any	set
any incompatibilities are dealt with one libs at a time rather than having to cope with a whole set of problems just .when you want to resolve a problem by upgrading one libs

2474082
implements	extends
if you have document based application and a view that you want to dump to printer then in our mydocument or whatever you call it that extends nsdocument you would implements

2474092
versioning	upgrade
in that case then you would be well advised to upgrade to the latest versioning

2474095
versioning	upgrade
the only time you should updates immediately is .when the versioning of the framework you rely upon is out of your control and the client is likely to do the upgrade

2474109
http	ssl
google-static-maps with ssl http is only available to premier members

2474112

i would highly recommend checked out both heroku and engineyard s cloud-based offerings

2474134
python	php
i don t know python .so i am showing you php

2474144
while-loop	arrays
assign an expression to an arrays forces list context as does something like a while-loop

2474156
hiphop	xcache
let me clear up a misconception you might have about hiphop and xcache

2474156
hiphop	xcache
xcache works by adding opcode caching to zend s php implementation like apc and friend while facebook s hiphop allows for php code to be transformed into c++ code and then compiled using g++

2474156
hiphop	xcache
it s not possible to run xcache with hiphop as hiphop doesn t depend on zend interpreter and doesn t even use php opcodes as it s compiled to bytecode after transformed to c++

2474188
value	field
i reckon i could do this in the index creation phase just put the relevant date value in a new field but i don t have enough control of the indexing process to be able to do this .so would like a .sorting .solution

2474205
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
some shared web hosts do php and then only do perl python and ruby etc. through cgi

2474205
json	xml
for anything more complicated you need to basically .post the data in your chosen format - xml json magical binary blob format

2474205
json	xml
simply google for python xml or python json or whatever and you ll find the latest libs for it

2474205
python	java	python	ruby	postgresql	mysql
insert into the database - use the mysql-python libs for python i use postgresql mostly from ruby and java .so i m not fully hip to the latest python mysql libs

2474246
python	java	python	c++
i think that python is very powerful to do a lot of things but just like java and c++ it often depends on good third-party libs

2474246
python	java
i come from a java background but use python for a lot of things and it s been a fun ride

2474246
ftp	ssh
you would need external libs for things like ssh or ftp

2474246
python	java
the one problem with python compared to languages like c and java is that it is not statically typed

2474261
any	set
and the answer is probably how you feel about the risk reward ratio in any given set of circumstances

2474275
internet-explorer	firefox
or figure out the id s classes using firebug for firefox or ie-developer-tools for internet-explorer 7 8 and then styles them using your own css

2474278
default-value	default
if a user has not provided a part and you want to provide a default-value then use the default methods to specify value

2474287
svg	vml
it s cross-browser because it uses vml in ie and svg in other browsers

2474291
value	field
the field and value are hardcode

2474308
value	field
if you want to clear a value for an individual field then i found the following technique useful

2474310
put	get
i put a login box alone with a keyword search-box in 404.html in a django project .so in case a 404 error is raised visitor get more options to jump to other parts

2474328
arrays	loops
you can loops through the tags by calling data.tags.split and loopsing through the arrays it returns

2474334
double	int
you declare variables i as an int and then try to nslog it at as double value without a cast

2474342
duplicates	contains
i m writing a scripting and i need to create a loops that will execute same cmd until file does contains a specified numbers of duplicates entries

2474343
perl	awk
sure is a lot shorter in perl than awk

2474351
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works fine in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 5

2474358
httpmodule	isapi
.so iis7 in integrated pipeline mode uses a isapifilteringmodule to shim isapi filtering dll s and fire off the correct events on the filteringing which is quite different than previous versioning of iis or iis7 in classic mode because this means that httpmodule fire off right along side isapi filteringing in integrated pipeline mode

2474358
httpmodule	isapi
.so does anyone happen to know how isapi events and the httpmodule events line up

2474389
any	set
any suggestions on how to get the input tag rendering with the checked attributes set to checked via jquery

2474405
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4 and ie 8 compat

2474406
versioning	upgrade
if you mean that the install should be capable of doing an in-place upgrade of a previous versioning that is a really hard problem and i ve yet to encounter an install builder that even attempts to address it

2474425
nested	order
if you re certain that nested modal view controllers are what you really want you ll need to dismiss them in reverse order

2474436
temporary	copy
â 15.1 4 the memory for the temporary copy of the exception-handling being throw is allocated in an unspecified way except as noted in 3.7.4.1

2474450
hide	show
if it did it show the content and it hide the content of the others

2474454
armadillo	lapack
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not required lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas

2474454
armadillo	lapack
armadillo will use atlas routines in lieu of lapack wherever possible

2474454
armadillo	lapack
q how well will armadillo work without lapack atlas

2474454
multiplication	addition
a basic functionality will be available matrix addition and multiplication

2474455

2474471
json	xml
json xml or something else

2474473

fortunately they seem to provide a c# wrapper for the best audio api you could try to imagine and you won t have to change a single line of code to make your code working on playstation or xbox or whatever

2474483
uilabel	uiview
it is a regular uiview has some uiimageview uilabel and uibarbuttonitem on it

2474492
internet-explorer	firefox
i discovered this the hard way but unlike internet-explorer firefox doesn t allow for cross-domain xml request without some kind of authentication from the server you re hitting

2474492
json	xml
you ll need to either use json with which you can do a cross-site cross-domain request in jquery or create some kind of proxy for your xml feed locally and then hit that with your jquery request

2474502
arrays	loops
you will have to loops over the arrays using foreach adding each item individually

2474505
value	field
setting the clob field value to what you want it

2474528
progress-bar	progress
i want to show progress with jquery user-interface progress-bar .when an ajax request fires and .when it finishes

2474528
progress-bar	progress
the problem is i don t know how to set value for the progress-bar depending on the progress of the ajax request

2474531
json	xml
there are good libs for parsing and emitting both xml and json in cocoa-touch

2474533
configuration	installation
it consists of copying a vs configuration file around before and after the installation and re-running the install just for bids which is the one component that failed

2474544
click	mouse
i assume i also also have to send a mouseclick to it as .when click by mouse the button goes down and up again

2474552
any	set
you can do this with any set of methods and use any category named you like

2474556
upgrade	migrate
we recently upgrade migrate from windows-server 2003 to 2008 and now it seems that images cannot be rendering .when using doc.addimageurl

2474566
value	field
we pull commonly occurring value in certain field from the results and display them inorder of their popularity - you ve all seen this sort of thing on ebay

2474572
caliburn	prism
are there any sample applications avaliable that make use of both caliburn and prism

2474597
adam	adfs
the impression i got was that adam was the bastard child and that the new federated service adfs was where they wanted people to go

2474597
credentials	security
you could use alternate membershipproviders like the sqlmembership provider to get the good level of security with respect to credentials

2474599
javascript	dom
the javascript you pass in can modify the dom of the page being display

2474615
json	xml
i know i m creating an unreasonably large object graphing but i m also looking to serialization to json or xml because i want to break up the recording into downloadable chunks for the end user to import a la carte

2474616
required	checked
mitigated by the fact that our company required every deployed piece of code to pass automated validation which can checked for this requirement

2474622
constructor	object
i am currently cutting down every single allocation that i can from one of my games to try and reduce the frequency of garbage-collection and perceived lag .so for every variables that i create that is an object string and rect for example i am making sure that i create it before hand in my constructor and not create temporary variabless in simple 10

2474622
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
anyways i was working though it some more tonight and i realized that i may be completely wrong about my assumption on garbage-collection and primitive-types int boolean float are these primitive type-variables that i create in a 10 line function that gets called 20

2474622
boolean	int
.so to rephrase my question are primitive-types int float boolean etc include .when seeing this messages

2474624
callback	methods
you need to avoid exiting the test methods until the callback has been called

2474629
attributes	properties
there s a tagname properties and a attributes properties as well

2474632
any	set
you won t be getting any real savings out of eliminating the arguments to the function in question and you could set off an interesting display of fireworks

2474639
contains	elements
similarly you can use innerhtml to get the html contains within a given elements or innertext to get the text inside an elements sans html markup

2474645
any	set
i recommend testng or junit4 for selenium tests .so that you can easily manage the set up before the whole suite any test dependencies and .so on

2474646
vbscript	vb6
vb6 vbscript etc you can set it up via odbc and have the username passwd there

2474666
firefox	safari
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

2474686
http	ssl
the main site s page s are using plain http no ssl but the whole checkout process and the shopping-cart page is using ssl http

2474706
configuration	environment
we typically use this solution to handle the different server configuration for our different deployment environment staging qa production etc with our dev box being the default if no special copy occurs

2474715
lighttpd	apache
in lighttpd i know there is a global etc lighttpd.conf file but is there something local like the apache .htaccess file

2474733
64bit	x86
i am not sure why the 64bit debugging is not working but if you switching to an x86 configuration instead of x64 or anycpu apparently it works for you as per comments attached to question

2474744
derived-class	base-class
our derived-class has gone and implements this methods and the base-class has gone and pulled the rug out from under it without us knowing

2474744
derived-class	base-class
you have a base-class which is humming along just fine and then by virtue of the fact that someone implements a totally valid derived-class in some completely different part of the .application suddenly your .app is broken

2474744
derived-class	base-class
what happens if you reference an assembly with a base-class that contains a public partials methods and you try to overrides it in a derived-class in another assembly

2474744
protected	public
in the end it really boils down to a much simpler question though what would public protected partials methods add that you can t already accomplish with abstract-methods

2474744
protected	public
there isn t really any use for a public or protected partials methods other than to confuse the compiler and the poor bastard trying to make sense of it all

2474744
protected	public
.so instead of opening up that pandora s box the team said forget it - public protected partials methods aren t much use anyway .so just make them private

2474820
png	gif
i ve trying png gif and jpg formats none of them work

2474826
selected	button
now the problem is if i selected a file and then click on add more then new file button exist but older selecteded file removes and two blank file button display

2474826
selected	button
i want this old file must be selected .when user add new file button

2474829
viewwillappear	viewdidload
a better methods though is to create properties on the view controllers that you set and then either in viewdidload or in viewwillappear you use those properties to set value for your outlets

2474853
constructor	object
if the exception-handling occured in the constructor call new a that time the object has null value.so the a.foo

2474858
json	xml
you could send receive xml if you like though json is easier to parsing and is smaller to send

2474882
positioning	embed
by keeping both the file named and positioning asked for totally random anyone spoofing has to embed an entire copy of your .application - which makes it very easy to determine if they are spoofing your .app and possibly very easy to google for occurances

2474883
any	set
hit that for any set of documentation you don t have install and it will downloading itself

2474886

i have 2 dialog boxes in which i will display 1 dialogbox at a time..if i click next in the first dialog box i will hide the first dialog box and display the second dialog and vice versa...now say if i move the dialog box after click next in the first dialog..and .when i click back in the second dialog ...it goes back to its previous positioning to diaplay the first dialog box ...so i have decided to get the current windows s positioning and updates to the other windows positioning .so that it doesnt move even if i click next back..i am not sure how to get the windowss positioning and updates to other..please help me if you guys know about this

2474893

even if you did embed the .swf in the email as a mime attachment or in a data-url there doesn t seem to be any way to tell the player to load the movie from that data-url e.g

2474900
any	set
assuming the grid will only have one row there is no need to set the grid.row for any item

2474920
arrays	loops
i then loops through each object and add it to an arrays called playlist

2474956
authentication	login
althought if that user has relevant grant on database server if the server encounters any credentials issues for that login then it will prevent in granting the authentication back to sql-server the client will get the following error messages

2474956
authentication	login
by default the operating systemd error will show state as 1 regardless of nature of the issues in authentication the login

2474966
spaces	output
either that or get a libs that parsing css and can output it with minimal white spaces

2474978
json	xml
being new to xml and json i am not sure if this is suppose to be the correct behavior

2475006
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in ie and firefox i can visit mydomain news but in google-chrome it still redirects to cakephp .app folder

2475027

how can i create a macros or vba scripting that .when execute updates the range of the graphing from a x cy to a x-1 cy to include today s measurement

2475117
primitive	int
int is an object versioning of a primitive int

2475117
primitive	int
for this particular situation you can use android s sparse-array class which is a containers of primitive int key

2475150
value	field
i want to populate a combobox with unique value of appname field from the arraycollection initdg

2475150
arrays	loops
one methods i could think is to loops through the arrays object and for each object checked and push unique appname entries into another arrays

2475169
sql-server	mysql
are there any free solutions for automatically migrating a database from mysql to sql-server server that just works

2475169
sql-server	mysql
i ve also tried getting various mysql tools to output ddl statements that sql-server understand but haven t succeeded

2475169
sql-server	mysql
i ve tried with mysql v5.1.11 to sql-server 2005 and with mysql v5.1.45 to sql-server 2008 with odbc drivers 3.51.27.00 and 5.01.06.00 respectively

2475176
networkx	igraph
networkx igraph ... i am not familiar with the use of any of them

2475186
assign	add
for example any user can .post comments while an admin can delete comments and ban users but a moderator can only suspend comments and mute users. as you add new features it s simply a matter of implements some new permissions assign them to the roles

2475201
actionscript	mxml
i m trying to learn how to use actionscript over mxml for flexibility

2475201
actionscript	mxml
i have this simple block of mxml that i m trying to convert to actionscript but i m stuck half way though

caliburn	prism
however if you look in caliburn s samples you will find a basic sample configure to use prism with caliburn

2475216
loading	gif
display a simple gif image with hourglass or striped loading bar or something similar

2475217
ubuntu	osx
plus using rawr you can easily create bundled applications and install for osx windows and ubuntu

2475218
actionscript	mxml
the properties in mxml are just dot properties in actionscript and the value are what s next .so it s not too bad

2475222
interlocked	atomicity
does interlocked guarantee visibility of the atomicity operation to all threads or do i still have to use the volatile keyword on the value inorder to guarantee visibility of the change

2475230
attributes	properties
a properties can by used by both if you use the filelist files and patternset excludes attributes

2475232
google-chrome	safari
this worked out fine in google-chrome and safari

2475232
positioning	slider
the plugins works ok slider to the correct positioning until it call

2475234
javascript	dom
the most annoying thing about jsp pages for me occurs .when they mix up javascript with the code this smart code actually tries to manipulate dom and results in unmatched tags in static jsp code

2475236
silverlight	wpf
second you can nest textblock like .so well maybe not in silverlight but in wpf you can .

2475237
contains	set
.so the problem only seems to be .when iis is set up to use a network shared with a scripting contains shell_exec

business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
in an n-tier .app you re supposed to have a business-logic-layer and a data-access-layer

2475246
rhino-mocks	mstest
i intend to use mstest and rhino-mocks for testing

2475246
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
the wcf service would replace the existing data-access-layer assembly and the user-interface bll would replace the business-logic-layer assembly etc

2475265
32-bit	64bit
even though the abcpdf.dll was correct 32-bit a 64bit of the core abcpdf7ce.dll was on production

2475265
32-bit	64bit
and to top it all off there is no recording of a 64bit dll in our repository and the 32-bit dll was in our gac

2475265
environment	building
as far as i can tell the core dll is only used for building .so we removed those dlls from the affected environment and seem to be in good conditional

2475287
python	perl
you d better use python or perl to make this problem with a overlap mismacth threadhold if you really want to get the uniq contig sequences

2475296
checkbox	textbox
i have a checkbox and a textbox

2475296
checkbox	textbox

2475412
any	set
can any one tell me how to set the item to be selected forcefully

2475413
constructor	object
.when you continue for example the constructor is not called again because the scm already holds the object in memory

2475424
zend-framework	symfony
you may easily use symfony or codeignitier with zend-framework together

2475438
associations	model
you would still need some kind of permission field or associations on the document model but after that you could use canable to simplify authentication in your controllers views

2475441
type-safety	generics
i know that generics are used to achieve type-safety and i frequently read that they are largely used in custom collections

2475444

constructor	private	constructor	object	instances	private
singleton is a design anti-patterns in which a class is given a private constructor and a special getinstances instances or instances static function that is responsible for returning and possibly constructing depending on whether you use lazy-evaluation singleton or not the sole object instances

2475481
dependency-injection	singleton
the solution to the singleton anti-patterns is to use something called dependency-injection

2475494
double	int
.when you do an operation on floats or int that could potentially benefit from more precision the types is promoted to a double

2475527
value	field
tim williscroft has previously suggested this methods that reads the value of a static field of a class

2475527

2475553
json	xml
advantages of implements serialization over xml json

2475553
json	xml
disadvantages implements serialization over xml json

2475553
json	xml
also whereas you can manually edit xml and json you cannot edit a serialization java object without reading it into java

2475553
json	xml
for the same reasons it is often easier to debugging xml and json than binary formats because xml and json are human-readable

2475558
canvas	scale
user can choose image of bigger resolution is scale to canvas size

2475565

type-safety	generics
generics increases type-safety reduces casting and boxing

2475635

but with safari and firefox it never does

2475785
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera	traffic	packets
using wireshark to look at the traffic i found that opera and google-chrome simply ack the firestructuredtext packets from youtube after the cable has been plugged back in but safari and firefox set the restructuredtext flag 0x4 in the tcp header and no more traffic follows

2475785
firefox	safari
.so it seems that if safari and firefox sees a multicast connection close and then later see data on that same connection they will send a restructuredtext

2475790
arrays	map
if you really want to do it and don t have any special reason for using arrays instead of lists i suggest create a map map and handle the different cases

there is no reliable way to detection the http agent - you will break the form-for some browsers in any case - unless you can force users in to using a very limited set of browsers but this can be spoofed again

2476492
selected	button
if i use the default enum_string types it creates drop down selected instead of radio button

2476498

protected	public
i set this class properties as protected which mean i don t want the user of my class access this properties directly and made a public wrapper for this properties in partials class

2476540
abstract-class	derived-class
not sure if spring supports this as i haven t tried and haven t used spring in quite awhile however with another inversion-of-control containers a sneaky route i once took was to make the class one wishes to be returned as your inject interface an abstract-class and have the inversion-of-control containers return that as a derived-class instances

2476544
jcifs	ntlm
i have an application that uses a modified jcifs ntlm filtering

will give you a preview of the operation that ll get execute listing the old value of the field and new value that ll get assign to it

2476579
python	java
mercurial is used for some major project too such as python mozilla opensolaris and java

2476606
constructor	private
and if your goal is only to prevent accidental usage of the constructor by developers not aware that the class was supposed to be initializer by spring but don t want to totally limit possibilities you can make it private but also add static factory-method with an explicit named like createmanuallyinitializerinstance or something like that

2476612
contains	elements
the placeholder can contains a lock .so that other threads that want to access that particular elements must wait for it to be insert

2476612

2476638
conditional-operator	ternary-operator
yes the conditional-operator ternary-operator does what you want

2476676
processor	cpu
in your situation you need to use the performance counter l process program_you_are_interested_in_name processor time for cpu utilization and possibly l process program_you_are_interested_in_name data bytes sec for disk operations

2476676
processor	cpu
if for example you have a concurrent program with the named a_program_named.exe you can find its cpu utilization measuring at least twice the performance counter l process a_program_named processor time

2476676
processor	cpu
by the way measuring with this test a multithreading application running on a multicore processor might give cpu utilization which is more than 100

caliburn	prism
caliburn has built-in prism support .so you can use both

2477038
caliburn	prism
also if you downloading caliburn there is a sample include that demonstrates the prism integration

i want to force rendering one hidden-field it could be rendering on the page but make invisible or rendering on the page and display and set field value programmatically that s why it has to be renderinging - to set it s value

2477089
version-control	git
i do not use subversion myself but from the release notes for subversion 1.5 merge tracking foundational it looks like there are the following difference from how merge tracking work in full-dag version-control systemd like git or mercurial

2477089
version-control	git
in distribute version-control systemd like git or mercurial there is no technical difference between trunk and branch all branches are created equals there might be social difference though

fundamentally datatable and the child entities don t support inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged .so they are not acting the way the data binding would like them to be

2477169
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you are working on a relatively green field application i would spend a little time with entity-framework or linq-to-sql which appears to be deprecated in favor of ef and see if you can use one of these or another orm like nhibernate to fill your needs

2477175
children	tree	children	nodes
balancing involves changing the structure of the tree by telling nodes who their children parent and siblings are via re-assigning pointers but this is an implementation detail

if i have a int32 types int in the 8bit processor s memory say 8051 how could i identify the endianess of that int

2477391
value	field
what you can do however if your event handler resides in the same class as the code that changes the properties value is to introduce a private boolean field in the class which you use as an indicator of whether the current properties change is triggers by your code or by the user

2477392
postgresql	mysql
i use slicehost they have very straightforward instructions for installing postgresql mysql and tomcat is pretty easy to install

2477393

2477420
keyboard	mouse
it s more neat for a checkbox any control for that matter to be agnostic of the .source of user-input keyboard mouse etc .so for this i will just make the programmatic setting of checkbox really programmatic

2477420
keyboard	mouse
using this approach your code can respond neatly to both user s mouse input and keyboard input via one event only via checkchanged

2477425
value	field
you would just have to figure out a scheme from the word_concept_id field which may be just to seed with increment value as you add terms in the preferred language

these are cocoa and core foundation interfaces and are publicly available for use in mac and iphone applications

2479117
linux	unix
i am particularly interested in most used one in unix linux courier cyrus dovecot uw imap and also zimbra but feel free to add any you know

2479143
order	add
for example retrieving an existing order i can t add a product to the product collections client-side...the product collections is readonly

2479152
event-log	logfile
the iis computer is hosting a website which uses windows impersonation and tries to log an entry to the event-log for a custom logfile called myapp and a custom event source mysource

2479153
32-bit	64bit
this is on 64bit windows it works fine on 32-bit

2479162
version-control	git
my need comes from trying to use git for both version-control and deployment to heroku

2479179
selected	button
exactly how you d enable that varies but in ubuntu system- preferences- keyboard layout tab layout options button and selected something appropriate for the compose key positioning item

2479187
textbox	button
how to fetch .profile info of other user say a user types the username of other user in a textbox and click a button

2479197
assign	add
you add your content to a a grouping or to the top level application and then you assign the grouping a layout to tell it how to display the items you ve added

2479198
artifactory	nexus
install and run an enterprise repository like nexus archiva or artifactory and add your libs via deploy deploy-file

2479207
show	next
application logic if the user s next inspector date is within a week or past due show the scheduling inspector screens otherwise show the inspector history screens

2479232
wordpress	blogs
.when i first start one of my wordpress blogs i had the permanent url-for each .post include the date of .posting

2479253
ostream	std
if i have have some overloaded ostream operators defined for libs local object is its okay for them to go to std namespace

2479271
multibyte	strlen
strlen itself has no support for utf-8 or other multibyte character sets

2479274
push	pull
i think people will find it very annoying if they have to pull and push updates from a lot of different places but they will also find it annoying if they have to pull push the entire company codebase

2479282
perl	awk
of course the scripting could get more complex if your situation is - you could look for only certain extensions add them to the limiting awk pattern or even capture the whole output in a perl scripting .so you can easily do .some more fancy logic.

2479285
perl	c++
i know c++ java and perl but no javascript

2479330
highlight	selected
selected text in an elements akin to highlight with your mouse

2479348

2479367
loading	gif
this is usually done by just adding an animated loading gif

2479383
perl	awk
that s really kind of a waste for something as powerful as perl since you can do the same thing in one trivial line of awk

2479386
triggers	insert
if you need the sum or other aggregate in real time add a triggers on table a for insert updates delete which calculates the sum to be stored in b

2479391
triggers	insert
this can be accomplished via triggers which are little bits of code that execute whenever a certain action insert updates delete happens on a table

2479408
defined	declare
meaning any constants declare with defined or built into the language required a prefix to partition themselves - namespacing on the cheap if you will

2479413
updating	updates
even for server side code like a webserver i only have to updates a few tables to get the latest time zone data instead of updating the os on the server

2479422
any	set
normally it shouldn t matter but if your table is set to any sort of binary character encoding _bin collation it will

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve peeked at their source in this way and they accomplish the progress-bar through a combinations of a custom httpmodule and httphandler along with their control

2479465
javascript	dom
the control i linked only works at all because most browsers allow javascript to continue to execute and updates page dom during the .post

2479465
httphandler	httpmodule
.so inorder to make this work you have to updates .some standardized state server-side during your file process in the httpmodule which is transmitted back to the client via xmlhttprequest call handled by the httphandler

2479465
javascript	dom
you have to use pure javascript dom to updates the user-interface for the user

2479469
value	field
let s say i have two recording .so far .so the highest value in the autoincrement id field is 2

2479497
stderr	stdout
one vibration the application was compiled with debugging supports but it is unable to reach monodevelop on the specified ip-address and ports to setup stdout stderr

2479497
stderr	stdout
three vibrations could not setup stdout stderr to the application

2479499
.war	jar
we deploy our .app in an .ear which contains among others the above mentioned .war file and the custom layout class in a separate jar file let s call it commons

2479499
configuration	environment
this basically decouples the configuration and data files from the .application-server environment .so that they are accessible via carbon s lookup functionality and they can be stored in a directory external to the .app server

2479499
.war	jar
.so my only remaining guess is that matcher is loaded by two different classloader .when it is used from the jar and the .war and then attempted to pass from one to the other

2479499
configuration	logging
after a long wait i finally got to eliminate carbon from the logging process and migrate our logging configuration into server conf jboss-log4j.xml

2479500
oracle	mysql
we ran into serious performance problems with our oracle and we would like to try to migrate it to a mysql-based database either mysql directly or more preferably infobright

2479500
oracle	mysql
our first thought was to dump the schema but i wasn t able to find a tool to import an oracle dump file into mysql

2479500
export	csv
export tables in csv files might work but i m afraid it could take too long

2479500
oracle	mysql
is there any tool to import oracle dump files into mysql

2479501
short-circuiting	equivalent
the short-circuiting behavior is also equivalent

2479511
selected	cell
the solution i eventually found was to leave the data value in the grouping line and selected the cell not the data value then set the drop control under properties general to be detail rather then the default none

2479528
oracle	mysql
you can use any numbers of etl tools to move data from oracle into mysql

2479528
oracle	mysql
then you can take a delta of changes from oracle to your mysql or infobright using any etl technologies

2479546
cos	sin
since sin cos and tan are mathematical functions which are calculated by summing a series developers will sometimes use lookup tables to avoid the expensive calculation

2479558
any	set
i want to make it with python .so is there any module that can detection the temperature and or set the fan speed

2479566
speex	wma
in conversation people have suggested speex and wma for instances but i haven t found any libs or examples that work without requiring reference to dll s that won t work in a sl4 project

2479576
defined	declare
in c# or java classes are declare and defined at the same time

2479591
delphi	c++
.so assuming that i m working with variants at the underlying data level variant in c++ or tvardata in delphi - the big union of different possible value how should i hash variants consistently .so that they obey the right rules

2479602
constructor	object
second don t access dependencies through global state like the openforms collections pass your dependencies to your object through a constructor instead

2479605
.net	wcf
comparing wcf binary encoding to .net serialization

2479606
subtraction	time	subtraction	addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
while the quick answer is that they are more expensive than the primitive math functions addition multiplication subtraction etc... they are not -expensive- in terms of human time

2479609
subtract	add
certainly int add and subtract will be among them

2479609
multiplication	division
depending upon the processor there may be multiplication and division as well

2479630
database-table	mysql
is there any application that will read a mysql database-table and generator a sql scripting of insert statements .so that i can copy tables from one db to another db

2479637
attributes	properties
if you include an inheritall attributes same as how it s used in but default the opposite you can shared all your current project s properties and everything too

2479660
.war	jar
the jar needs to be added to the .lib folder in .war web-inf

2479702
callback	methods
start an async operation to login and get the token have the async methods s callback store the token for you and call a function which will start an async operation to get list of albums and category

2479702
authentication	login
there is an obvious problem with cases where you want to wait and not proceed until you receive something back over the network for instances if you want to keep the login page around until you know that you have successfully authentication

2479708
assign	add
at any rate as other people have mentioned add another attributes an id perhaps that javascript can use as a hook document.getelementsbyid to get to the elements and assign an onclientclick

2479709
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
on the intel x86 processor floating-point addition or subtraction required 6 clock cycles multiplication required 8 clock cycles and division 30-44 clock cycles

2479731
credentials	account
if it weren t a service you could use userprofile to store configuration settings but generally service run under a different user credentials than the sysadmin s normals account

2479752
memcheck	valgrind
i suggest you stop and read the valgrind quick start paying particular attention to section 4 interpreting memcheck s output and look over the faq

2479755
realloc	free
this is presumably done .so that a caller can still do free on it like realloc

2479777
.net	wcf
my problem though is that the code generator by the svcutil.exe to access wcf service is different from the code generator by the slsvcutil.exe and the silverlight code is actually incompatible with the .net one i get a bunch of problems with the system.servicemodel.channel classes .when i try to import the class into .net

2479779
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
tested with firefox google-chrome ie8 and opera

2479780
backslash	regex
note that the + has a special meaning in regex and needs to be escaped by a backslash

2479785
base-class	inherited
base-class api you use inherited

2479792
malloc	free
you can t free part of an arrays - you can only free a pointers that you got from malloc and .when you do that you ll free all of the allocation you asked for

2479797
simulator	platform
if you can t find it via searchlight than try looking in developer platform iphonesimulator.platform developer applications iphone simulator

2479800
zend-studio	komodo
zend-studio and komodo are two good ones

2479819
groovy	java
i previously worked on groovy and i had seen sometimes over performed than java

2479819
scala	java
my question is how well scala perform on jvm compared to java

2479846
default-parameters	member-functions	default-parameters	function-templates	member-functions	class-template	function-templates	class-template	function-templates	member-functions
what does the standards have to say about default-parameters in class-template member-functions or function-templates

2479858
configuration	logging
i want to know if there is an easy tutorial that explains how to enable logging in django with minimal configuration changes

2479862
display	height	display	width
the link have a fixed width and height + display block

2479863
google-chrome	firefox
i d advise debugging this in firebug for firefox or through the google-chrome javascript console

2479879
hide	show
in login i show the navigationbar hide the backbutton1 and add a new rightbutton1 then i checked if settings.bundle login and pass are set

2479879
order	add
updates i ve tested more and it seems to me that .when i quickly go from login to list the navigationbar doesn t have enough time to add the button and add the button and the bars in the wrong order

2479906
abstract-class	subclassing
if i was doing this in something other than ruby-on-rails i would set up an abstract-class for workshopfeedback and then have subclassing for each types of workshop workshopfeedbackone workshopfeedbacktwo workshopfeedbackthree

2479932
scala	java
if one really pays careful attention to performance scala is almost always nearly as good as java if not equivalent

2479932
scala	java
in fact my scala code is often faster than my java code because i find it .so much easier to make my highly optimized code convenient to use and reuse--but the java would be as fast or faster if only i had more time and patience.

2479932
scala	java
if you want some data that demonstrates that scala can be basically as fast as java checkout the results on the computer languages benchmarking game

2479936
selected	textbox
for some reason i can t seem to bind the text of the selected item in the combo box to the textbox

2479954
parallels	bootcamp
parallels does support running a windows on a bootcamp partition - as does vmware-fusion

2479966
hash	md5
maybe it s not answer to your direct question but why would t you pull image and its md5 or any other hash that can verify correctnes of this image

2479967
double	int
my suggestions would be to double checked that e_id and e_type are really just native int

2479978
google-apps	gmail
we send through gmail google-apps service and it has worked fine for us

2479983
arrays	loops
i could write three loops to brute-force the mentioned example but what if the numbers of arrays is variables but with know order of course how would you solve this problem

2479991
cassini	iis
havent tried asp.net development but i assume its going to be fine since the iis server or cassini would be hosted on the viewmodel

2480014
contains	any
from php returns an arrays contains all the entries from arrays1 that are not present in any of the other arrayss.

2480014
arrays	loops
just for all the additional arrays loops through their value and checked if each value is

2480021
implements	final
you d probably have an easier time implements a hosts interface for after-effects or final cut pro plugins and using magic bullet

2480027
hashmap	arrays
this could be done even faster if you use hashmap instead of arrays

2480028
arrays	map
you could generator a seperate index that map an index from one arrays to the index of another

2480038
linux	unix
you can find it or easily install it almost anywhere - runs on all systemd that can implements the standards c libs including unix linux dos windows mac beos and posix-compliant systemd

2480042
single-sign-on	security
you may also try to implements single-sign-on using cookies though this has security drawbacks

2480068
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
oracle has deferred integrity checked which solves exactly this but it is not available in either sql-server or mysql

2480073
shadowbox	jquery
and without a mask shadowbox or similar jquery effect

2480078
ubuntu	linux
i am setting up a new svn server on ubuntu linux

2480082
hashtable	sorted
if the arrays are sorted and bounded you can also use binary-search instead of the hashtable to avoid using spaces

2480094
configuration	environment
i properly reinstalled imagick from source with the additional png and jpeg support i added ld_library_path and dyld_library_path to the environment variables i set the command_path option for paperclip in my production-environment configuration

2480094
command-line	cmd
although the imagick cmd worked from the command-line nothing fixed my paperclip problem

2480122
arrays	map
possible solution because you may need to do a checked - if the predicates function can map more than one input value to the same output value you might have a case where the value found in some arrays but not the first or last is wrong

2480128
filewriter	writer
writer w new filewriter file can be replace by

2480128
randomaccessfile	seek
an alternative if you have fixed-width text then look at randomaccessfile which lets you seek to any positioning

2480180
jquery	.post
uzbekjon has a great blog .post on this as well get url parameters value with jquery

2480226
directory	folder
it s an iis issue on the directory security for the virtual folder or parent site

2480234
associations	model
the way i am achieving the connection between databases is by creating associations in the ef model

2480245
cucumber	webrat
i am using rspec 1.3.0 cucumber 0.6.3 and webrat 0.7.0

2480294
abstract-class	subclassing
i think the best solution is create an abstract-class workshop and 3 subclassing workshop1 workshop2 and workshop3

2480304
user-interface	drawing
you ll also have to write your own javascript user-interface for selected colors drawing regions etc

2480318
python	php
here s a php remove_accents function that could be translation into python easily remove_accents

2480320
simplemodal	jquery
my problem has to do with the simplemodal jquery plugins

2480320
slidedown	slideup
edit i think it would help to explain my problem by showing two screenshot before after -- basically i am using jquery s slideup slidedown functionality to hide the credit-card form depending on whether the user is paying via cash cheque or credit-card

2480320
slidedown	slideup
i tried adding in a callback elements of slideup slidedown but to no avail -- in fact setposition is throw a javascript error because apparently the function doesn t exist

2480322
pointers	stack
it seems to me that something s wrong with stack frame pointers near far but i m quite new to this subject and need a little help

2480324
textbox	button
maybe a readonly textbox where i display the formatted time spent and 2 button one for up one for down that looked something like the old vb updown control

2480335
put	get
your verbs get set will become the http standards get put

2480339
launchd	daemons
the problem comes in .when i start the daemons at boot if i launchd from the shell it runs perfectly and completes the work

2480347
gethashcode	equals
you need to implements equals and gethashcode on your exampleclass

2480358
pixels	line
what happens is that the printer drivers either building an image of pixels including the text and send it to the printer or send cmd designed to draw line spline curve and other shapes to the printer with fonts expressed as line and splines outline

2480358
pixels	line
each line of text has to be â œbuiltâ from pixels and often the line of text do not match up with the passes of the printing head especially for fonts much larger or smaller than 12-point

2480365
lookup	any
the string could mean that for any lookup where there is no specific overrides such as acme.toadstool.minimumprice we return 100 - even though there is nothing referring to toadstool anywhere in the file

2480367
gethashcode	equals
it does not implements any equality testing such as overrides equals and gethashcode .so nunit will eventually do a reference compari.son

2480367
value	field
this will fail as each collections contains different instances of example even though the field have the same value

2480398
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i ve used pentaho data integration to migrate from oracle to mysql i also migrate the same data to postgresql which was about 50 quicker which i guess was largely due to the different jdbc drivers being used

2480431
authentication	login
now i have the tag that is checked their authentication and redirecting them to the login page

2480438
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
you may want to look at using the repository-pattern and domain-driven-design which effectively means you will grouping together entities that are associated into a couple of high level classes

2480439
stderr	stdout
if you need to capture both stderr and stdout and don t want to resort to logging following is a simple solution adapted from this .post

2480444
subtract	time
on an x86 machine where stack grows downwards subtract the size from the base address and virtualquery again this will give you the size of the spaces reserved for stack assuming you re not precisely on the limit of stack size at the time

2480447
pagespeed	yslow
i m checked my pages with two plugins for firebug yslow and pagespeed

2480447
pagespeed	yslow
both seem to say that my files are caching add expires headers in yslow and leverage browser caching in pagespeed are both checked

2480450
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have two user-controls where one is a dialog that has a tabcontrol and the other is one that appears within said tabcontrol

2480463
subtract	add
you basically want to add everyone that matches a criterion but subtract everyone that has a criterion that doesn t match

2480472
reflection	runtime
is it possible to compute the hash of a class at runtime in c# presumably through reflection

2480475
hash	md5
salting a hash is used to decrease the possibility of collision and ensure that the hash can t be found in a database like this - if everybody is using md5 for storing their passwd then a passwd file database could be de-hashed by looking up the md5 d value of the passwd

2480480
pyinstaller	wxpython
i m trying to compile a very simple wxpython scripting into an executable by using pyinstaller on windows-vista

2480516

.when	ready
like mike said this also worked for me .when i put it in the ready function and removed the button onclientclick

2480542
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i m thinking of using asp.net-mvc as service hosts of my service where each controllers action becomes essentially a service and i can communication with a service via simple http-request and response and not have to deal with complexity if i use something like wcf

2480557
data-annotations	viewmodel
i m using the data-annotations attributes along with asp.net-mvc 2 to provide model-validation for my viewmodel

2480559
execute	declare
it s not being execute multiple time inside loops and the scoping of what it declare is procedure-wide even though it appears inside loops

2480577
defined	declare
the problem is in the class definition you have to defined any members declare in the generics types twice

2480609
constructor	object
as near as i can understand it as soon as we attempt to use an imagedoc object the dll that contains that assembly is loaded and as part of that load the static constructor is called which in turn causes several other dlls to be loaded as well

2480628
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
that said it s very quick and easy to create a service-layer with asp.net iis without using asp.net-mvc or webforms for that matter

2480629
configuration	upgrade
assuming requiring everyone to upgrade their svn clients isn t an option is there a configuration setting or flag i can set to prevent my newer client from making this change

2480647
put	get
now i get it that i can put a .post with all of its details in memcached and call the key .post 123 that is ok and i can do it for each .post

2480673
cos	sin
.so then instead of cos for x and sin for y above you should use sin for x and cos for y

2480718
kernel	mmu
if you choose to use uclinux on an arm with no mmu an arm7 or cortex-m3 for example then you loose a significant compelling reason for using linux in the first instances - mmu protected process kernel

2480744
primitive	boolean
primitive boolean functions and or

2480753
push	pull
i think people will find it very annoying if they have to pull and push updates from a lot of different places but they will also find it annoying if they have to pull push the entire company codebase

2480758
show	next
this will show me an overview of all of the users by .when they were created and what the current statuses are next to total transactional

2480759
value	field
key field is a long-integer value that

2480773
qt-designer	qtabwidget
i m using qt and i have a qtabwidget setup in the qt-designer editor you can see it in picture 1

2480773
qt-designer	qtabwidget
in qt-designer editor i right click on my qtabwidget- promote to ... and choose base classname qtabwidget

2480779
required	checked
this required a connection to an ms-access database for login - user named and passwd checked acess to that specific site

2480779
ms-access	mysql
the stats work fine on any site that uses ms-access for it data but i m having trouble getting the ms-access connection to work with the site that uses mysql

2480799
.when	ready
the great benefit i ve found of a dvcs is the ability to commit early and commit often and only push .when it s ready

2480818
contains	set
.so given a set of .source files each of which which contains a single function that takes no arguments and returns void how would one automatically as part of the build-process generator an arrays like the one above that containss each of the functions from the files

2480833
ubuntu	linux
for reference the subversion repository is hosted on a linux server with ubuntu 9 something install and i have complete root access to the machine

2480835
data-access	nhibernate
how can i integrated telerik-grid paging for asp.net-mvc with my nhibernate data-access with minimal coding

2480860
data-access	nhibernate
.so all you need to do is implements this getorderdto methods which by the way should be placed in .some repository and not part of the controllers logic in which you would use your existing nhibernate data-access

2480867
execution	exit
my problem is that .when the user exit the application then the thread seems to continue execution

2480876
revision	updates
updates propset takes the revision numbers .so i don t understand how to do this in pre-commit

windows-vista	windows
it is unfortunately available only on windows 2003 server windows-vista and onwards

2480892
any	set
you can t set it .so any line like will do nothing even with strict mode on

2480894
selection	highlight
the listview control of windows-explorer gives a highlight to whatever item is under the mouse without affecting the current selection

2480905
row	col
you don t even really need the row and col arrays unless you plan on computing them efficiently

2480915
constructor	object
it s because streamwriter uses fstream object and the default fileshare on the fstream constructor which doesn t specify a explicit fileshare is fileshare.read

2480922
python	perl
i m not about to write code for it because i haven t thought it through but you could create a perl python scripting that creates the makefile new function.c .h and test bootstrap all in one go

2480933
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that loops over one array.

2480933

2480939
floor	ceil
ceil r floor c

2480948
contains	set
i would like to have a set of simple metrics which indicate with a high probability that the analyzed code contains procedural transactional scripting and an anemic-domain-model instead of following sound object-oriented design-principles

2480948
any	set
would be happy about any set of useful metrics and tools for measuring

2480951
execution	exit

substring physical_name 1 patindex +reverse substring reverse physical_name 1 charindex reverse physical_name -1 + physical_name -1 +

2480997
calayer	uiview
the problem with this is that setframe on a uiview by default has no animation but setframe on a calayer does

2480997
calayer	uiview
i cant just disable the animation on the calayers setframe because if i were to call setframe on the uiview inside a uiview animation block the calayer would still have its animation disabled

2480997
calayer	uiview
unfortunately the best solution is to not use a calayer at all and just add a uiview as a subviews and draw into that just like i am drawing into my layer and hope that with autoresizingmask set to height and width that everything will just work

2481002
smalltalk	lisp
as a latecomer to discussion the main problem with smalltalk and lisp is that you can t run them with cgi or fastcgi on shared-hosting

2481053
32-bit	64bit
that s why they re called 32-bit or 64bit processor

2481055
double	int
the rangevalidator can only handle primitive-types such as int float double decimal

2481055
constructor	object
because you supply an int in the constructor it is trying to match that int to your enum which will fail because vab uses the object.compare object methods

2481056
binary	octal
is there a program like octal dump but is binary dump

2481059
contains	any
you should url encode the hyperlink .so all characters are turned into a valid ascii format and don t contains any x html-entities

linux	unix
on linux unix or windows + cygwin there is the od utility which dump files in many formats

2481079
scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java
scala is compiled down to byte code and is statically typed .so many of the same optimizations that can be done for statically typed languages like java as opposed to dynamically typed languages like groovy can be done

2481079
groovy	scala
.so comparing groovy to scala is comparing apples to oranges

2481079
scala	java
now java to scala comparison

2481079
scala	java
you can expect scala to be on par with java in most situations

2481079
scala	java
scala can be slow if you program in it stupidly tones of mix-ins via traits could provide some overhead that plain java wouldn t have

2481079
scala	java
who s to say the solution you write in java using your own patterns is going to be more efficient than what you get for free in scala remember the scala compiler was written by people that are probably a better programmer than you are

2481079
primitive	int
on the other hand if you are using language-features for no good reason int object .when plain int primitive will do your code will be bloated slow crap no matter which language you use

2481079
scala	java
in summary performance between scala and java is about the same and shouldn t be the biggest reason you choose one over the other in 99 of cases

2481079
scala	java
if scala lets you write one tenth the code as java you might gain 10x the benefit by using it

2481079
scala	java
if scala slows you down 10 time because it s too hard to read stick with java

2481098
parentheses	operators
not as an operators but just as a normals identifier you need to enclose it in parentheses

2481120
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the icons is not aligned vertically with the title in google-chrome compared to firefox

2481149
scala	java
people told me that scala s arrays is just a java which only compares identity

2481154
sequences	unique
operatorss are some unique sequences of the typical operators characters + - etc.

2481159
contains	set
.so attributes that i do not set in later invocations are not null like i would expect them to be and contains stale value

2481165
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and i am attempting to install the php pear libs on a virtual-server which is running ubuntu

2481179

2481259
value	field
i have a table with a field value which is a varchar 255

2481259
value	field
is there a way to truly order by value without changing the field types to decimal or something else

in other words can the value field be modified removed value converted to decimal on-the-fly before the results are sorted

2481268
configuration	environment
required file.join rails_root configuration environment

2481273
exception-handling	try-catch
what can be the drawback of not using try-catch block if i want exception-handling to be handled at frontend considering stored procedure contains multiple queries that need to be execute

2481285
updating	updates
wrong this means i m doomed to always try to get updates to the same static feed object as although i get the updates on a variables i m never actually updating my static feed object and newly added items will be append to my feed.new_entries as they in theory are new

2481308
constructor	object
give all the object internal constructor and force clients to initializer them through some factory-method and then perform the initialization before returning an object instances

2481323
protected	public
provide either a public virtual-destructor or a protected non-virtual-destructor for each class that has virtual methods

2481327
factors	primes
in terms of the primes factorsization this is the minimum of the numbers of time it s divisible by 5 and the numbers of time it s divisible by 2 since we need one factors of both 2 and 5 to make a factors of 10

2481334
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
all uiviewcontroller already have a properties of navigationcontroller which is the uinavigationcontroller that is an ancestry to this viewcontroller on stack

2481343
freetype	libjpeg
remove the files that you originally install for libjpeg and freetype

2481343
freetype	libjpeg
i don t think libjpeg or freetype specifically benefit from compiling them yourself

2481344
scala	java
scala 2.7 tried to add functionality to java arrays and ran into corner cases that were problematic

2481345
strophe	xmpphp
i would suggest using strophe and xmpphp

2481363
innodb	myisam
but full-text-search is only supported on myisam not innodb

2481364
text-editor	editor
it appears you could also give it any extension and map that extension to a particular editor in options -- text-editor -- file-extension

2481375
google-chrome	firefox
.so it should be trickling into browsers .soon ie9 google-chrome 1 firefox 4 are at least .some of the browsers supporting i.so 8601 dates

2481437
smpp	pdu
checked that the bytes sent conform to any smpp pdu

2481438
put	get
after using read-tree you could use this to get the individual file you want to change modify it then put it back in with update-index

2481459
groovy	scala
i wonder if anybody knows if there s an actual design reason why scala does not support interpolation similar to groovy and other syntactically better javas

2481477
order	add
i did that to add filtering that filteringing order by store_ids

2481494
sql-insert	sql-delete
we can use sql-insert sql-update and sql-delete in our .hbm.xml mapping files for insert updates deletes

2481513

we do this to create an isolated environment between dev qa staging prod and it is still easy to push from one environment to the next without having to edit the configuration files or worry about overwriting them

2481525
pbkdf2	salt
using something like pbkdf2 and a random salt

2481548
debian	linux	debian-based	debian	debian-based	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
software install for linux are typically distribute as package. this can vary from distribution to distribution but debian or debian-based distributions like ubuntu typically use .deb package redhat and fedora use .rpm package along with some other distributions

2481548
debian	rpm
see for more information on debian package or for more information on rpm

2481562
javascript	dom
instead of manipulating the dom elementss each time the collections changes you can keep an arrays of your elementss in a javascript variables and directly work with that arrays .when you need to add remove an elements

2481563
arrays	loops
if you are not iterator through an arrays it does not really matter what you start your counter with but it probably does matter how many time you want loops to iterate

2481566
associations	model
and also checked you have defined the model associations correctly.more detail please see habtm in cookbook

2481567
google-chrome	safari
if your application only uses something that supports some of the html5 specifications webkit-based safari 5 google-chrome chromium for instances you can do a lot ahem guessing your question stems from steve jobs mentioning html5 in a keynoteâ ...but will struggle with cross-platform support

2481567
firefox	opera
many of the major player in the browser market haven t even agreed on a common codec for video yet h.264 for many not supported currently by firefox opera etc

2481578
dictionary	map
the common pattern for this in python is to use a dictionary to map

2481600
arrays	map
if you re always using a 9x9 sudoku grid then you can pre-calculate the answers and stick them in a map or arrays

2481628
any	set
the allocation needs to be both large enough for the string initially set by the function and also for any changed that are made after the function before the memory is free

2481629
windows-mobile	symbian	blackberry	nokia
in the meantime the rhodes mobile framework by rhomobile allows you to develop cross-platform iphone windows-mobile rim blackberry symbian nokia and android native mobile applications using html as the user-interface

2481629
user-interface	look-and-feel
the way it basically works is that you write your user-interface in html which gets display by the native browser control that is buser-interfacelt into the phone and the rhodes framework then supplies the necessary css and javascript to make it look-and-feel native

2481631
subclassing	superclass
.so the general rules should be to never call a magic methods directly but always indirectly through a built-in unless you know exactly why you need to do that .when you re overrides such a methods in a subclassing if the subclassing needs to defer to the superclass that must be done through explicit call to the magic methods

2481636
jquery	.post
here s an example of a correct jquery ajax .post

2481655
scala	java
is it possible that scala and java maps are getting mixed up in your code

2481655
scala	java
if you re using java maps .when you think you re using scala maps then that would explain the disconnect here

2481658
entity	poco
create poco classes for each entity for projection .when sending over the wire

2481660

2481778
pagespeed	yslow
yslow and pagespeed

2481798
udp	rtp
for example if you plan to use wifi access points outside of the home many of these will not support rtp using udp delivery

2481804
click	mouse
i also have had the robot move the mouse back to crosshair.x and crosshair.y but this as well as the others still allows the mouse to escape if the user click at the right moment

2481826
buffering	streaming
most clients that receive rtp streaming employ a buffering to account for jitter in the network that is typically 1-5 seconds long and which means there is time available for a retransmit to receive the desired data

2481826
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
in practice .when this is done the difference between interleaved rtp over tcp and rtp sent over udp is how these two perform over a lossy network with insufficient bandwidth available for the user

2481826
buffering	streaming
the interleaved tcp streaming will end up being jerky as the player continually wait in a buffering state for packets to arrive

2481862
blacklist	whitelist
whitelist blacklist granularity etc

2481866
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter

put	get
i alway remember what a teacher once told me .when i was learning c-- with c you get a kevlar boot and a gun it is up to you whether or not you put the boot on before you shoot yourself in the foot because you will shoot yourself at some point... good luck to you on learning c++ just hang in there and don t get discouraged

2481895
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is strictly php5 and was initially created as a fork of codeigniter it used to be called blue flame but it has since been rewritten

2481900
getchar	getc
or use getc or getchar in a loops instead

2481915
while-loop	for-loop
i ve done a small experiment as will be show below and it looks like that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop in perl

2481915
while-loop	for-loop
the one that has the while-loop took 57 minutes 17 seconds to finish while the for-loop equivalent took 1 hour 7 minutes 54 seconds

2481922
response	timeout
.so i d like to find a way to explicit not redispatch the request on timeout or expire because i m using an event-driven series of callback to actually produce the response

2481932
windows	ms-dos
i don t keep as good a recording of .when software was and was not available for ms-dos or ms windows variants

2481932
windows	ms-dos
by that time it would have been for windows rather than just ms-dos

2481932
ms-dos	dos
was new-era i4gl for ms-dos or was there another i4gl versioning for dos

2481932
windows	ms-dos
i would estimate that informix stopped supporting ms-dos as opposed to windows about 15 years ago â 3 years probably

2481936
protected	public
it keeps the public interface clean but still isn t great - baselinedate was made protected and a derived-class is required both solely for testing

shell	bash
whenever i open a bash shell my classpath is someprogram

2482002
ip-address	hostname
if that matches the hostname you are connecting to then just checked if you are connecting by ip-address or by hostname in whatever ssl interface you go through and make sure it is by hostname and not by ip-address

2482002
ip-address	hostname
try connecting by hostname instead of ip-address and see if there is a difference

2482002
ip-address	hostname
it doesn t matter if connecting via browser using the ip-address works -- the browser may not be verifying the hostname using the same algorithm

2482024
database-table	mysql
i want to convert the mysql database-table contents to an excel .xls or comma separated file csv using python script.

i also need to see the value of the newly insert identity from within my triggers which required the use of output into within the triggers

2482037
while-loop	for-loop
the while-loop uses the notation but the for-loop uses

2482037
arrays	loops
clearly with a bit more work the testing could be wrapped up into an arrays .so that the testing would be done iteratively - a loops through the arrays running the timer function on the information in the arrays

2482037
hash	md5
it printing the md5 hash of the factorial rather than the factorial itself because it is easier to compare the results etc

2482037
while-loop	for-loop
i consistently see a small 1 penalty for the while-loop over the corresponding for-loop but i don t have good explanation for it

2482055
shell	bash
.when bash is invoked as an interactive login shell or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option it first reads and execute cmd from the file etc .profile if that file exists

2482055

2482252
code-coverage	gcov
gcc comes with a code-coverage testing tool gcov

2482269
value	field
if you do want to keep to the copy all the field named per entry idea it would be worth separating into two arrays one for the field one for the value

2482272
configuration	environment
has command-line parsing and other basic stuff that deals with environment configuration issues

2482276
jquery	.post	hide	show
i am using jquery to show hide a div containers #pluginoptionscontainers and load a page . plugin_options.php inside it with the required .post variables sent

2482332
jquery	.post
jquery .post

2482342
sql-server	mysql

2482380
jquery	.post
jquery .post

2482380
json	xml
there is ways around it but then again if you want to fetch the xml directly from javascript client-side then what is the php part for and why not get the webservice data as json instead

2482381
wxwidgets	mfc
i get overwhelmed with the proliferation of options like c# .net mfc asp..net-mvc qt wxwidgets etc

2482386
updating	updates
if you don t indicate this clause then the dbms uses the default option which in your case seems to be the for each statement option and that s why your triggers only fires one for each updates sequences regardless of how many rows you are updating

2482388
32-bit	64bit
can i simply use a processor with 64bit and windows 64bit without recompiling my application that would remain a 32-bit application to take advantage of 64bit

32-bit	64bit
you can run 32-bit apps on a 64bit os but they run in wow windows on windows

2482441
32-bit	64bit
however any unmanaged code c++ most third party dlls will have been precompile as 32-bit or 64bit .so you have to use the correct versioning of the dll for your hosts pc

is there a way to convert a wmf picture to gif or png with the delphi 2009 or newer runtime libs

2482660
printf	scanf	putchar	getchar
however if you know you are just doing characters then getchar and putchar will be more efficient since the printf and scanf variants will have to parsing the string each time to determine how to process your request

2482660

that should be set to any cpu the default

2482693
firefox	opera
i see that opera ie doesn t underline the image but firefox does

this might be related to the fact that although you exit the application the process for it is still running in the background .so that restart the application would use the same process

2482746
required	checked
note that the length checked is not premature-optimization it is required to meet std equals s precondition

2482760
mockito	jmock
for the recording jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

2482765
google-earth	google-maps
unforuntatly google-maps only supports a limited set of kml .so not all features are supported and google-earth is more flexible .so it might support

2482776
contains	set
i have a datagridview in which one column contains a custom class which i have set using

2482776

and i set my datagridview control s selectedionmode to cellelected and this allow the user to selected as many cell as he want which spread over several columns

2483233
selected	cell
but i want to constraint my user can only selected cell in single column at a time and there isn t any such kind of selectedionmode for me

2483233
implements	extends
.so if i want to implements this how can i extends the datagridview class

2483233
selected	cell
i also think that i can checked in eventhandler whenever the selectedion cell are changed through which i might make the user can not selected cell spread over multiple-columns but this is not that good i think

2483264
firefox	opera
if you look at the bottom of this blogpost of mine svg at the movie take 2 you ll find a simple wrapper scripting that implements parsexml should work fine in opera firefox and webkit

2483286
derived-class	base-class
a base-class cannot be implicit converted to a derived-class

2483287
derived-class	base-class
yes it does give an error if you want to assign a base-class to a derived-class pointers types

2483291
derived-class	base-class
there is no cast here and there is correctly no implicit-conversion allowed from base-class pointers to derived-class pointers

2483291
derived-class	base-class
a pointers to a derived-class can always be converted to a pointers to a base-class because a derived-class object always contains a base-class sub-object but not every base-class instances is a sub-object of a particular derived-class types

2483294
lookup	any
sql code also doesn t hint of any lookup stuff

2483303

2483304
typedef	struct
in my c file i create my struct but don t give it a tag in the typedef namespace

2483325
arrays	loops
count sort maintains an additional arrays of int which basically count how many of a certain numbers there is and then creates the numbers again .when it goes through the additional arrays in the final loops what i mean by this is - in a oop way of looking at it it s not the same object but a new object with identical value

2483325
arrays	loops
then in the final loops the algorithm goes through the entire additional arrays and dequeues the elements in each bucket into the arrays

2483336
value	field
...for struct the default implementation of equals object which is the overrides versioning in system.valuetypes performs a value equality checked by using reflection to compare the value of every field in the types

2483336
value	field
.when an implementer overrides the virtual equals methods in a struct the purpose is to provide a more efficient means of performing the value equality checked and optional to base the comparison on some subset of the struct s field or properties.

2483364
draggable	z-index
it has many different options and appears to let you keep the current dom elements helpers original and allows you to set the z-index of the draggable as well

2483370
value	field
that would return a resultset including all rows from table a and will include value from table b where table b derived field are used in the selected clause and are satisfied by the join criterion

2483370
expression	evaluation
inorder to transform these value into 1 or 0 respectively then we use a case-statement and checked whether the value is null or not and return the appropriate value based on the evaluation of this expression

2483418
flac	mp3
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of cmd to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2483480
linux	unix	linux	bsd	opensolaris	linux	opensolaris	bsd	unix	bsd
.net of this crucial consideration threads might often be a better choice performance-wise on windows where making a new process is a heavy task but less often on unix variants linux bsd versioning opensolaris macosx ... since making a new process is faster there but if you re using ironpython or jython you should checked on the platform you care about that this still applies in the virtual machines in question -- clr with either ..net or mono for ironpython your jvm of choice for jython

2483498
arguments	default
well one approach to tell the function how you would like to treat its arguments is to have sensible default making the function treat everything by its original types by default while being able to specify any tweak you like with comfort with a short and absent-by-default fmt string like

2483511
aggregate	grouping
grouping by named which is basically a distinct on named plus readiness to aggregate and then a distinct on ip

2483520

2483535
lgpl	gpl
it may be gpl lgpl bsd or whatever

2483536
derived-class	base-class	friend-function	derived-class
and of course an immutable object can be properly construct from a const pointers or reference to the mutable versioning presumably in a separate inline friend-function to avoid giving the base-class a dependency on the derived-class

2483556
hide	show
i want the user to be able to show hide non-modal windowss such as an inspector windows

2483562
selected	cell
to make this work you need to selected data-a in your inital list of data top-left hand cell

2483574
swing	awt
that is an awt class and should not be used in a swing application

2483579
sequences	unique
column sequences must be unique and it is used for re order of items

2483579
sequences	unique
i assume that plain sql solution to this issue is using a third updates to introduce a unique sequences value in the process but i am stuck with ef

2483624
freeswitch	asterisk
install a voip server like asterisk or freeswitch and write code to have your web .app interact with it

2483624
voicexml	vxml
with a voicexml sometimes called vxml application you can install a voicexml server and the associated voip bits or you can use a voicexml hosting provider

2483672
silverlight	wpf
in wpf i can get it with image.source.height but this is not available in silverlight

2483679
this-pointer	construct
hi i have a question about this-pointer .when an object is construct .when it is initializer

2483679
this-pointer	construct
the virtual table is construct in the constructor is the same with this-pointer

2483682
shopping-cart	cart
here s the scenario a user adds things to the shopping-cart say 5 items and goes to view the cart

2483692
hide	show
the reason i need this is i hide show elements sometimes using .show and hide and .when that happens i need to reset tab order for the elements that appear disappear

2483696
row	col
now replace each col in a row with the row mean

2483698
windows-mobile	windows-phone
as for windows-mobile i d forget about that and concentrate on windows-phone 7 which will use silverlight for apps

2483720
constructor	object
given that the constructor can immediately begin accessing members of the object clearly this is initializer before the constructor begins

2483721
.war	jar
you have to provide a jar with the remote interfaces to your .war also known as a client ejb-jar there is no other option

2483721
.war	jar
and if your remote interfaces do use entities or any other dependencies then your .war must obviously be a.ware of them you also need to include entities and any other dependency in a jar and to package it in the .war

2483724
constructor	object
then it automatically call the constructor to initializer the object

2483724
constructor	object
as part of calling the constructor the implicit parameter this - a pointers to your object - is passed in as a parameter

2483724
private-members	object
it is basically a standards function rather than a methods except with access to private-members providing it can find an object to access

2483725
constructor	object
.when the constructor is called for an object that occupies a specific memory location that location is passed as a parameter to the constructor and other member-functions

2483728
this-pointer	construct
the virtual table is construct in the constructor is the same with this-pointer

2483728
this-pointer	construct
the this-pointer is construct i think allocated is a better term at allocation time that is after the global new-operator is called and before the constructor is entered

2483728
constructor	object
in cases where the object is stack-allocated instead of heap-allocated global new is not called but this is still available as a result-of allocation stack-space which is just before the constructor is entered

2483728
constructor	object
the instances vptr is assign after the object s memory is allocated and just before the constructor is called

2483733
contains	elements
many of the default aero templates contains custom elements buttonchrome etc. that are specific to the aero themes and declare in the aero assembly

2483737
constructor	object
this starts points to the current object and all members and base classes have been initializer before you enter the constructor body

2483738
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2483755
linux	osx
i am writing some software in c++ for linux mac osx which runs as a non-privileged user but needs root privileges at some points to create a new virtual device

2483767
32-bit	64bit
subtle integration between bus speeds memory disk i o if relevant network i o if relevant 32-bit vs 64bit if relevant device drivers and the os could all contribute to this

2483789
gksudo	sudo
instead of sudo you may want to use a graphical frontend like gksu gksudo kdesu or kdesudo

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
of the two wxwidgets is more similar to mfc .so it would probably required less rewriting but would maintain more or less the same disconnect you re seeing between what you want and what it provides

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
as i commented previously wxwidgets is more like mfc in this respect -- it uses a document and view not a model-view and controllers

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
the good points is that it s probably a bit easier to do that one step at a time rewrite the code in mfc which which you re already familiar and then ports it to wxwidgets -- but given the similarity between the two that ports will probably be little more than minor editing -- often just changing some named from c to wx is just about enough

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
to my recollection the only place i ve run into much work was in creating menus -- with mfc they re normally handled via resources but at least a few years ago .when i used it wxwidgets normally directly exposed the code that created the menu entries

2483802
daemons	systemd
a lot of daemons etc are also set up under modern systemd to run as their own user with most of the privileges they need

2483828
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
.so it fires .when the enter button is pressed while the textbox is selected which is was the whole time of course maybe that has .something to do with the execution of the code

2483830
contains	set
the class vtable pointsers is also set before this points if your class contains virtual methods or destructor

2483858
versioning	upgrade
what you ll miss though is if there are any files deleted in the upgrade versioning

2483892
malloc	free
you should have the same numbers of free s as you have malloc s

2483895
32-bit	64bit
options is a pointers types not an arrays types .so sizeof options will always be the same typically 4 bytes on a 32-bit machine or 8 bytes on a 64bit machine .so will almost always be 1

2483895
malloc	free
the key is to always free memory in the same manner as you malloc ed it

2483899
dynamic-programming	memoization
as well as memoization it s also worth mentioning the closely related dynamic-programming

2483899
dynamic-programming	memoization
very closely related - personally i m not too clear on whether memoization is a special case of dynamic-programming or not

2483901
contains	elements
in your case block is which return true for those elements which do not contains the pattern

2483901
contains	elements
since in your case none of the list elements contains that pattern the grep returns entire list

2483901
contains	elements
had the block been like which returns true for those elements which do not contains a zero or a lowercase o or a 1 or a i or a i or a l then you would have got a list with all but these elements as the result

2483908
arrays	map
the yaml file describe a hash mapping from strings to arrays of hash that map from strings to strings

2483923
hide	show
i would like to create numbers divs such as eventbox1 eventbox2 etc. in a loops and then have an option to show and hide them

i know i need to use team.objects.filter but i m not sure how to checked the value of the accepted field

2483959
compatibility	platform
there are several project to combine various pairs and project like parrot that seek to provide a platform for a large range of languages for compatibility and project like .net that almost accidentally provide compatibility among previously-incompatible languages

2483961
onmouseover	onload
well you can t use alert and some other javascript global functions onmouseover onload etc

2483974
difference	zero
the order should not make a difference since they tell nasm to generator a file with certain conditional such as using 16-bit and addressing start at zero

2483989
buildpath	libs
go to libs-project s properties flex libs buildpath assets and include the css file and all assets

currently python and ruby have dlr implementation but i haven t heard anything about perl

2483999
python	perl
inline python allows you to import python modules classes and functions into your perl code and call them from perl as if they were native - see import functions

2484006
any	set
the regular expression is trying to match any occurrence of not 0o1iil because omitting a at the beginning of the set will prevent the regular expression from seeing the as the character-class metacharacters

2484007
value	field
what would your .app do .when it got a value of 3 for a true false field

2484019
constructor	object
.when the exception-handling is throw from the constructor the object is never fully construct

2484021
constructor	object
this means that the constructor never completes .so the object s lifetime never starts .so its destructor is never called there is no object and there is no mismatch between and

2484021
constructor	object
in y if it allocates memory in it s constructor and this allocation is successful then it needs to ensure that this memory is free if the rest of the construction throw an exception-handling at any points and if the constructor completes that the memory is free in the destructor assuming that the memory is designed to last the length of the lifetime of the object

2484032
order	add
the order that you add scripting paths to the view determines the lookup order

2484038
abstract-class	subclassing
actually .socketaddress is an abstract-class .so you receive .some subclassing of it

2484041
exception-handling	try-catch
now normally i could wrap a call to this methods in a try-catch block with 2 catch clauses to handle the logging situations for each of the exception-handling

2484042
linked-list	dictionary
this seems to be mostly by design there are other simpler typess that can represent the same range of value for example a normals list instead of a linked-list or a list of pairs instead of a dictionary .so the .net assumes that if you are using the more specific types you want its specific features

2484045
treeview	listview
the idiosyncratic behavior of winforms controls has to be taken into account for example the listview control fires its selected### events before it fires a click event combobox and treeview fire their click events before their selectedvaluechanged and afterselect events respectively .so had to experiment to find that using mousedown would work the same across all three controls

2484052
jquery	.post
i read jquery .ajax .post sending â œoptionsâ as request_method in firefox which helped

2484064
scala	java
yes i know i can call java code from scala

2484064
scala	java
are there any utilities out there to convert java source to scala source

2484078
display	height
but to get it to display nicelly you d need to know the elements height beforehand or to make the content scrollable

2484079
double	int
i think the best choice here is to keep arrays and decode your int or double manually into it and concatenation strings onto the beginning and end

2484094
solidworks	cad
the most common way solid model are represented in current 3d cad software catia pro engineer solidworks nx is through boundary representation b-rep

2484096
hide	show
you can t show the div once you hide it since the link is inside the div

2484100
transparency	outline
.when i use sifr with wmode transparency and click sifred text an outline occures

2484100
transparency	outline
.when i use solid color outline does not appear but i must have a transparency background

2484101
lookup	any
this could be useful if you for example lookup lots of key in a dictionary or something and at the end you want to process all of the results and combine them somehow but if any of the key are not in the dictionary you want to return null for the whole thing

2484102
button	popup
i need to display a pop with a uiswitching and a done button .when user taps on a button and save the state of the switching .when the done button in the popup is tapped

2484109
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
first you need to declare your servlet in a web deployment-descriptor a web.xml file which looks like this

2484109
mapping	unique
basically the idea is to declare the fully qualified named of your servlet in the servlet elements and to map it to an url-pattern in the servlet-mapping the mapping is done via a unique servlet named

2484109
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
| -- web.xml this is the deployment-descriptor

2484142
javascript	dom
are you trying to insert javascript and css into the dom

2484145
constructor	object
i think you are going to need to pass in a different types to the consumer assuming you want to log errors in the constructor of collectorconsumer which is a wrapper around the actual construction of the collectorresponder object

2484151
put	get
also whenever i try to put the scriptalias alias the previous content or the following content into an .htaccess file i get a 500 internal-server-error

2484157
scala	java
aside from this paul phillips once started the scalify project to translation code from java to scala or potentially your favourite language and even improve it in the process

2484167
cakephp	symfony	cakephp	lithium	symfony	lithium	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	lithium	codeigniter	cakephp
other frameworks that i have seen know are zend cakephp lithium cake3 codeigniter symfony ruby on rails..

2484172
put	get
you could attempt to detection a touch-event get rid of the existing overlay item draw your own copy of the icons where the overlay item had been manually animate that as the user drag and then put the overlay item where the user drops it getting rid of your manually-drawn icons

2484192
show	next
my first choice would be an int key and the previous answer linked to a blog .post that show an extension methods that uses the max operators with a selector expression to find the next available key

2484201
websphere	ibm
from the updater tech notes it seems like it was a pain to get running with websphere and you needed a special updater from ibm to get the patches

2484203
implements	extends
i would like to implements an observers-pattern in objective-c where the observers implementss an interface similar to skpaymenttransactionobservers and the observable class just extends my base observable

2484212
instances	private
amazon-ec2 exposes an api that actually allows you to add virtual-machine instancess someone correct me please if i m wrong having pre-configured them deploy another instances of your web .app talk between private ip ranges if you wish slicehost definitely allow this

2484212
python	php
i chose django purely because i m not such a big fan of php i like python and i was comfortable with the framework .when i initially played around with it

2484214
constructor	object
.so i would give the i and labels variables to the constructor .so the object can access them.

2484215
private	self
i have a private methods def __pickside self in a parent class that i would like to overrides in the child class

2484218
put	get
types-class hell is no fun but i think you might get a more informative error messages if you put a types signature for regex into the where-clause

2484233
publishing	release
we publishing new release news through facebook

2484233
publishing	release
we publishing new release news through twitter

2484241
codeigniter	cakephp
both cakephp and codeigniter are designed for php4 - in other words for really old technology

2484245
scala	java
i don t think it s possible to automatically convert java to scala in the general case

2484245
scala	java
many of the low-level construct in java don t exist in scala field and static-members scala places limitations on constructor that don t exist in java and scala doesn t have raw-types like java genericss without the generics parameters specified

2484276
duplicates	lookup
there is a lookup or two to get a surrogate key or to checked for duplicates but the complexity is just o n

2484279
defined	declare
if you absolutely have to have some global object then the simplest way is to just to declare them extern in a header file include anywhere that needs access to them and defined them in a single source file

2484294
.when	ready
if you re handling multiple clients you should use a multiplexer like selected to notify you .when clients have data ready to read .so your server won t lock up the every time you try to read from a client who hasn t sent anything

2484309
icmp	igmp	icmp	arp	igmp	arp

sniffing	packets
packets sniffing editing tool which is

2484344
sql-server	mysql
i don t know if mysql can use any of these techniques but in sql-server i would try one of two different things at least it might give you something to look for in th emysql documentation

2484359
textbox	button
and currently the page is a textbox and a button and only if you types in the right passwd defined in the generator the rest of the page with the link-tree loads

2484359
hide	show
summarizing how do i hide the url s ande the passwd to show them mainly the passwd of course in my .source-code .so that no that it should required .some effort on reading

2484359
put	get	protected	public
p.s. it s not that personal if someone really wants it it could never be 100 protected and if it was that important i wouldnt put it in the public folder also if the dude really wants to get it that hard he should deserve it

2484372
hardware	monitor
the xserver knows about the hardware and handles drawing to a specific monitor receiving mouse input etc

2484372

2484377
jquery	.post
i have received other .post such as this one how to .post an arrays of complex object with json jquery to asp.net-mvc-controller

2484384
memcached	apc
if content is changing a lot it may not be worth caching data but if a lot of more static then maybe using something like memcached or apc will be of use

2484389
initializer	setter
of course i could do this with a pointers that way i could have a setter which i could call later after i am sure b is initializerr but i would much prefer to do this with a reference which means i need to initializer it in the constructor hence the problem

2484392
hash	md5
store for example its md5 hash

2484392
hash	md5
then .when the user types in a passwd compute its md5 hash and compare it with the expected one

2484412
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
i believe this is because user-controls have a visual appearance content baked into their xaml and the content of the derived-class would have to replace the content of the base-class .so the visual inherited is generally not useful

2484412
contains	elements
if you do go down this route you ll probably want to derive your custom control from contentcontrol or apply contentpropertyattribute .so that your top-level elements can easily contains other xaml.

2484416
radio-button	textbox
however i am not wanting to use this as a option grouping with radio-button selection instead i would like to add textbox instead the frame .so that .when i reference the frame it references every control instead of it hence the textbox cbo boxes etc.....just as it would if they were radio option selection

2484418
twitter	tweets
i wanted to use published google-docs document and twitter tweets as the datasource of a silverlight application but ran into clientaccesspolicy issues

2484418
put	get
.so i wrote this libcurl scripting and put it on my php site and now i can get the text of any google-docs document and twitter feed into my silverlight application

2484421
javadoc	phpdoc
not sure if the optional param styles has an official named but php and java developers usually use phpdoc and javadoc respectively to write inline documentation that is auto-generated. if the parameter has a default-value it will mark the param as optional in the documentation

2484422
constructor	object
the b object is not fully construct until the constructor returns

2484422
constructor	object
furthermore before you enter the body of the b constructor the object within the b object may not be fully construct

2484458
.when	ready
q why we use some invokelater and why this thread edt start to execute request .when it s ready

2484467
python	perl
scripting or perl and python programs

2484484
python	ruby
compared to windows ruby and python are prebuilt for mac os x .so the easiest way might be using cocoa with ruby

2484493
ref	out
partials methods can have ref but not out parameters

2484514
fontfamily	font-size
this control should permit to an user to defined with a control templates the numbers of grid the fontfamily and the font-size of axis labels and other parameters

2484516
ms-access	recordset	worksheet	excel
query excel worksheet in ms-access vba using adodb recordset

2484523
sinatra	gem
then sinatra 1.0.b gem install using

2484569
swing	awt
in answer to your question i would definitely do what you describe as an awt solution--that way you can tracking the object created and be able to allow the user to reload them onto an edit canvas and more than likely each of the shapes the user creates would be a layer not the layer swing containers but an object that would store and tracking what shapes are draw and be able to redraw them--the main thing to keep in mind is draw order

2484569
swing	awt
mostly you want to use awt over swing due to the fact swing is not thread safe--that way you do not paint yourself in the corner early on in your design

2484569
swing	awt
swing is built over the awt and adds a great deal of complexity that an application like this doesn t need

2484569
swing	awt
the developer community--myself included--were well on the way to creating a lot of what swing offered in slickness and component based design but what we were building was totally awt based

2484569
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
here is the class which is a custom awt component--it should be fine in either swing awt probably even swt

2484574
any	set
i don t have any experience doing what you describe above but the mkmapview class has a set of methods for concerting pixels to coordinates and vice versa that you should be able to use to map your circle to coordinates on the map

2484596
linux	unix
i suppose this works fine on unix and linux systemd but what i want to do is modify this .so it works on windows-xp

2484597
strong-typing	types
for languages with static-typing and or strong-typing like java you should add information about the allowed typess for input and expected types for the output

2484606
buffering	streaming
from the buffering streaming converting for endianess as specified

2484606
png	gif
i ve found that exif libs out there don t support png and gif

2484613
getter	setter
it feels that while i gain on using asp.net-mvc for every new value added i have to add two new methods in the model which quickly get all cluttered with getter setter

2484613
value	field
then in the view i would have a methods called from the updates which extraction the value from the containers and assign them to the correct field

2484630
json	xml
this way you can return multiple types of results like json and xml from the same methods

2484631
selected	textbox
in my enddate textbox i d like to use the date selected from the the startdate textbox + 1

2484639
value	field
they denote the field in the calendar not the value

2484666
execute	prepare
it first execute the code with the normals stdin console or eclipse console and then with a prepare stdin contains the text test r ntest r n

2484675
linux	unix
yes this works on linux unix only

2484683
versioning	upgrade
the instructions that come with the downloading seem to be for a major versioning upgrade and are way too much trouble for frequent security updates

2484684
json	xml
yes if javascript is an option then basically you should generator a document xml or json or plain text doesn t really matter that much though json is probably easiest if you re using javascript that describe the serialization state of the board

2484698
solidworks	cad
3d mechanical cad software such as catiav5 pro engineer and solidworks are mostly written in c++ sometimes with a thin com interface for publishing basic api to customers

2484703
getter	setter
while getter and setter in and of themselves are not necessarily evil they are sometimes a sign that your subsystems are too strongly coupled

2484726
arrays	map
i can create a sparse-matrix php arrays or map using the cmd

2484730
contains	any
honestly my jsp pages contains jsf tags and actually using facelets don t have any major problems with speed

2484731
getter	setter
if you feel you have too many getter and setter in your model class maybe you have too many field altogether

2484731
getter	setter
in general java is a verbose language which expects you to put all those getter and setter and a lot more in-place

2484733
directory	folder
the server logs are usually found in a straightforward folder file in the server installation directory such as logs in case of tomcat

2484734
scala	java
today i decided to do my first real project translating some 60 line of ugly java code to scala to rewrite it using the better pattern-matching features why

2484743
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
dojo prototype jquery gwt etc

2484748
show	next
is there a show me the next error button somewhere

2484748
selected	button
if i selected the proceed button i am greeted with a java.lang.noclassdeffounderror for my main class which makes me suspect a classpath issue

2484750
shell	bash
on windows you can install cygwin to get a fully functional bash shell

2484750
shell	bash
however many shell notably the bourne shell or its modern descendant bash are also fully-fledged programming languages

2484759
double	int
i have another arrays of double pointers call it b and i have an unsigned int call it c

2484760
32-bit	64bit
you re not trying to use a 64bit specific libs on a 32-bit systemd or viceversa depending on other conditional are you

2484763
arrays	loops
question 2 you could keep a least numbers of 0s in an arrays column .so far and column in which the least numbers of 0s appeared - then updates those variables at the end of the inner loops where you set

2484766
header-only	boost
my question is under what conditional do you do a header-only implementation like boost or also include a .cpp file

2484771
background-image	height
due to the nature of the pattern unless the full 300px height of the background-image is visible in the last repeat of the content-div s backround the background in the div below won t seamlessly connect

2484771
contains	any
i ve tried resizing the content-div on loading the page but this only works as long as the content div doesn t contains any resizing dynamic-content which is not my case

2484771
background-image	height
another potential solution i was thinking off was to offset the background-image in the bottom div by a certain amount depending on the height of the content-div

2484810
silverlight	wpf
while silverlight and wpf aren t quite the same they re extremely similar

2484811
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome extension and firefox add-on to resize your browser to various standards resolution sizes.

2484818
silverlight	wpf
wpf looks set to replace winforms at least on windows-mobile devices with future development focused around silverlight a wpf spinoff and xna

2484826
contains	elements
i want to get the time at which i shared the item which is contains in trying to get the elements using fails because of the after gr which causes a php error

2484839
silverlight	wpf
i think ms is sending a clear messages that wpf and silverlight are the present and future

2484839
silverlight	wpf
additionally wpf and silverlight are expected to converge in the future

2484846
silverlight	wpf
most of your wpf experience can be ported to silverlight which a gives you flexibility to bring your apps to the browser and the phone and b gives you additional confidence that microsoft won t lose interest -- even if they do get tired of wpf they ve show a very strong commitment to silverlight

2484848
configuration	logging
this logging framework provides a configuration file where you can set things like where the logs should be written into or how the log messages should be formatted

2484853
type-safety	generics
other than that the clearables variables was a bit problematic i changed it to a generics for type-safety goodness

2484880
python	c++
i would start with a scripting designed to do something similar like stripes out c comments from code python snippet to remove c and c++ comments is a good starting points

2484887
.net	wcf
we are using .net wcf with netmsmqbinding

2484893
firefox	safari
full screens is tested in safari and firefox

2484896
children	nodes
adding a dummy nodes .when the ihierarchydata instances has children

2484900
contains	set
it looks to me like you ve set up the nul_mas arrays to contains the numbers of zero in each column .so the question becomes which index of nul_mas has the smallest value

2484900
arrays	loops
you can do this with two variables - one for the smallest value seen .so far one for the index where it was seen - and a loops through that arrays to look at each elements in turn

2484907
expression-blend	silverlight
the project types i created was the silverlight 3 application + website via expression-blend 3

2484911
if-statement	arrays
i have tried individual if-statement and arrays without success

2484917
division	modulo
instead of converting to a string use division and the modulo to extraction the digits

2484930
loading	png
there s always the poor man s alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frame as .gif jpg png and having javascript display them in sequences

2484942
google-chrome	firefox
you might also want to try using firebug for firefox or the developer-tools in google-chrome to make sure that the request is actually being sent and inspect the result

2484945
performance-testing	profiling
.so i d say get a working implementation using a single thread then if in performance-testing you discover that it is lacking refactor it to use multithreading if that seems like the best option to beat the performance problems of course you ll be profiling it etc

2484948
silverlight	wpf
another positive thing is that wpf is really similar to silverlight .so if you handle wpf well you should be able to write silverlight applications too - if that s of interest

2484959
32-bit	x86
some platform have hardware watchpoint and maybe i could activate one of those with inline-assembly but i d be limited to only 4 at a time on 32-bit x86 and each one could only cover part of the struct because they re limited to 4 bytes

2484973
constructor	object
using the constructor the idea was that if i had an object like this

2484983
hide	show
i d advise either loading the images with ajax or simply putting them in the html and using jquery to show or hide them as necessary

2485002
any	set
and even if it was you don t set the id for any of the images in the loadimages function

2485037
value	field
let s say you ve got a bunch of member field that you want to updates with the actual value of the parameters that were used

2485043
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
how to checked if an html elements textbox selected radio-button etc is in a form via jquery

2485049
pixels	line
i agree with peter hosey s analysis that the outer half of your line is getting clipped off but my recommendation would be to move all the coordinates .5 pixels inward instead

2485049
pixels	line
this way your straight line will be crisper not antialiasing across 2 screens pixels as well

2485056
configuration	environment
required file.expand_path file.dirname __file__ + .. .. configuration environment

2485056
execute	prepare
execute db test prepare

2485056
arguments	default
you must defined a default .profile to use the cucumber cmd without any arguments

2485057
stdin	pipe
i ve written a c program that works .when i pipe data into my program using stdin like

2485061
signals	sigint
a signals sigint sig_ign seems enough for you unless your application must handle a sigint coming from some other source

2485068
sigaction	sigint
sigaction sigint sigact struct sigaction null

2485068
signals	sigint
if sig sigint panic caught signals for ctrl+c n

2485071
service-locator	inject
note that such lookup is usually coded in a service-locator .when you can t have a a di containers or a framework inject it for you

2485073
button	popup
to know what i mean go to there is a login button at the bottom of the page .when you click it a popup appears

2485076
subclassing	inherited
as pascal i initially thought that injection does not work with inherited but this problem continue .when i directly called em.persist in the subclassing

2485077
gunzip	cat
zcat is another way of calling gunzip -c on many systemd and show the parallels with cat

2485085
.net	wcf
with c# you can explore lots of interesting things .net wpf wcf xna asp.net jon skeet s blog.

2485091
click	mouse
how do i change this behavior .so mousedoubleclick only happens .when the mouse is over the listviewitem and not .when continually click the scrollviewer to scroll down up in the list

2485141
portrait	screens
how can i get a camera preview on part of the screens using portrait view

2485146
checkbox	textbox
in my trivial example i ve assumed that the first control we hit will be the listviewitem which may not be the case if you re dealing with celltemplates that contains textbox or checkbox

2485156
subnet	ping
try sending an ip broadcasting ping 192.168.1.255 if your subnet is 192.168.1.0 24 to primes your arp caching followed by arp -a to spit it all out

2485192
atom-feed	feed
you d be better off just getting a good feed parsing libs and letting it abstract away all the versioning issues and building a clean atom-feed from the data you retrieve from it

2485199
output	mode
try starting project in debugging mode and look at the output windows to see if there are any binding errors

2485207
google-chrome	firefox
and im trying to figure out a way for firefox or google-chrome to setup anytime it sees for instances a a web based page for equipment like cisco linksys sonicwall t1 controllers from the manufacture in the title bar or from the originating page place a set up 2 - 3 passwd to auto log on with

2485216
preserve	copying
if the data you want to write won t fit in between other things you want to preserve you need to rewrite the remainder of the file typically copying from the old file to a new one modifying the data as required along the way through

2485231
matplotlib	sage
if you re willing to use something other than matplotlib but still python there s sage

2485242
scheme	lisp
source scheme lisp nested-loops and recursion

2485247
exception-handling	try-catch
but if one user is disconnect while another thread is process the list then for that free tidcontext- data object i am getting access voilation ok its fine i am using try-catch but problem is that at below line there is some kind of deadlock and process hang if i attach a debuger it show access voilation again and again and again and cpu coonsumption goes up because of that exception-handling deadlock

2485274
ip-address	proxy
i write a middleware which may lower this value for request origining from a proxy ip-address by the following code

2485275
constructor	object
initializer is basically a constructor in ruby .so it will return the new feedmanager object

2485277
haskell	ocaml
f# is definitely based on ocaml and takes ideas from other languages such as haskell and shared many aspects with them however there is also a lot of other things

2485286
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work in firefox ie google-chrome although thinking about handling document.onload too

2485296
atom-feed	feed
an odata feed is just an atom-feed

2485298
constructor	object
all i can think of is that a constructor is being used to do something in addition to constructing an object

2485315
put	get
put this together and we get

2485345
click	mouse
ctrl + mouse left button click

2485345
click	mouse
shift + mouse left button click

2485345
click	mouse
alt + mouse left button click

2485346
return-value	return-type
the function expects a list of manufacturer return-type not an ienumerable of manufacturer .so adding a .tolist to the return-value should fix it

2485360
textbox	button
for example in an .app that has a button for yes and a button for no and a textbox for output the code that tells the computer what to do .when the user uses the yes button is one class the code for hitting no is another class and an object is the two button and what they do together to influence the output box

2485370
alpha	rgba
hey i m trying to draw a constants color to the framebuffer and blend it using the alpha channel from an rgba textures

2485373
return-value	arguments
the return-value can then be used in the outer rules as an arguments for the constructor and .so on

2485379
textbox	button
as an example - in your example of an .app the windows with the two button a textbox and some code for handling what h.appens .when the user types in the information may be organized into a single class something like promptwindows

2485379
textbox	button
this class would be made up of multiple classes internally two button a textbox etc this would probably be used by some separate class which would create an instances of the promptwindows class call a methods on the class to show the windows then use the results

2485382
dictionary	map
generally you would map a simpler dictionary string string as

2485383

rome	feed
take a look at rome project rome feed parsing libs

2485414
contains	set
the button class could have a textfield properties that defined what text it contains â this could be set to no and yes on the appropriate button instances to give them their different appearances

2485425
textbox	button
the yes and no button plus the textbox are usually specified within a class taking for example code written in c# microsoft .net

2485425
textbox	button
you could write your code in such a way that .when you click the yes button something gets written in the textbox

2485428

2485520
ieee	fpu
this assumes ieee float and same endinanness between the cpu and the fpu

cursor	row
since a given screens can have dozens of rows on it and the cursor is kind of small it s useful for the user to be able to tell at a glance what row the cursor is in

2485532
placeholder	required
the contents of this placeholder can obviously vary from child to child and is obviously not required to be used

2485546

2485559
required	checked
messages of undefined-function was given.i checked the versioning in the server and its php versioning is 5.2.12.and i just wonder which versioning is required

2485578

linked-list	arrays	linked-list	heap
it s probably because bubble-sort is an algorithm for arrayss but you re using a linked-list swapping two items in an arrays which is what c uses is o 1 time and required no extraneous spaces but swapping two items in a linked-list which is what haskell uses is o n time and o n spaces and this is heap spaces not stack spaces

javascript	dom
i think the major points here is that a script-tag only creates the javascript-objects and places them in memory in the javascript runtime engine which is completely different from the dom

2486645
arrays	loops
in your original code you were not returning the hash but an arrays new_hash scene.number is an arrays and the next loops through ruby complained because new_hash scene.number was trying to do a lookup into the arrays with a string value hence the error you got

malloc	free
if you were out-of-memory in a defect free program malloc would return an error indication

2487070
callback	methods
.so rather than your ..post call expecting data and handling the callback what i d recommend is having your controllers expose a methods for creating new chat messages via .post and then another methods that get the last x chat messages or the messages since a certain timestamp or whatever

2487070
jquery	.post
the .post would fire only in response to user-input e..g types in a box hit send then you have separately a .get call from jquery that s set up to poll like you said and all it does is fetch the latest chat messages and it s callback updates the chat user-interface with them

2487257
export	report
because .when everyone is logging on as themselves from different applications - windows and web it helps to know that it s actions taking place through an application and not just any user s ad hoc query through odbc and excel say if you allow users access to certain views for data export or report writing

2487291
webserver	nginx
alternatively you may find nginx + apache + mod_wsgi a more stable approach - nginx is a fantastic front-end webserver for serving static-content but apache is excellent for hosting dynamic process

2487567
32-bit	64bit
i don t need to develop for a 64bit environment my work is all 32-bit .so how can i be sure that i can still develop debugging test for a 32-bit target environment using vs2005 on a 64bit machine...

2487572
rollback	commit
one of the niceties of dvcs is that you can commit your changes before trying to merge them with others and thus have a backup versioning to rollback and retry a failed merge and this practice gives that up

2487572
push	pull
this pull the upstream changes re-applies your changes on top of them and lets you push your changes back as a linear history

2487574

notice the use of starmap with a sequences of tuples for any character not in the replacer dictionary return said character

2487616
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
what i have works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

2487620

you can see it live here if you use a browser that supports svg-filters e.g opera or firefox

2487622
abstract-class	subclassing
i m handling this by defining an abstract-class outputprovider that i will subclassing for each individual case

2487626
32-bit	64bit
as the others have pointed out both the 64bit and 32-bit versioning of vs can target both 64bit and 32-bit runtime environment

2487626
32-bit	64bit
further you can use either the 64 or 32-bit versioninging of windows 7 obviously the 64bit versioning of vs required 64bit windows but vs 32-bit runs on either

2487626
windows-xp	windows
you may want to test in a windows-xp virtual-machine running under windows 7 or in certain cases you may need a real 32-bit computer to test on

2487642
value	field
- the converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary

2487642
value	field
if the converted value has fewer characters than the field width it will be padded with spaces on the left or right if the left-adjustment flag has been given

2487664
type-safety	generics
the lack of generics mentioned refers to the fact that the api exposes non-generic methods and classes methods that work on object and typically force the user to use casts and lose some type-safety

2487673
value	field
i want to create a query that returns results where any value in the id field overlap with any value in the arrays

2487673
value	field
i want the query to output all members who have the value 101 or 102 or 103 listed in their id field with multiple ids listed

2487689

what i d like is a javascript function that can be called inorder to restore keyboard and mouse focus to the flash .app and which will work in ie firefox and google-chrome

2487726
subclassing	ivar	subclassing	superclass
a subclassing can t have a declare ivar with the same named as one of its superclass s declare ivars even if the superclass s ivar is private

2487726
subclassing	superclass
this seems to me like a violation of the meaning of private since the subclassing is affected by the superclass s choice of something private

2487726
base-class	superclass	instance-variables	superclass
does the fragile base-class problem exist .when all superclass instance-variables are private

2487733
standard-library	boost
if you have a c99 standard-library or boost you can use the fpclassify macros

2487740
margins	padding
then adjust it to your liking margins padding

2487743
paintcomponent	draw
to fix the problem you need to create an extension of jlabel that is not opaque but has an overrides paintcomponent methods that will draw the background you want

2487792
any	set
this means that as with any fixed-with int data-type the set of representable value is finite

2487796
panning	pan
if your .source audio is monophonic panning is done by reducing the volume in one of the left or right channels .so at centering they re both at 100 and one channel is ramped down as you pan left or right

2487797
droppable	draggable
.when i defined the items to be draggable the code doesnâ t work any more the items are classed as droppable but the drop event wonâ t run

2487807
32-bit	64bit
i m using w7 64bit main program and wi.dll is 32-bit all programs mentioned here is 32-bit programs as well

2487817
constructor	object
just make setsomething public and pass a reference to the first object to the second s constructor

2487818
oodbms	rdbms
or are oodbms .so different than rdbms that it worth doing separate framework for them

2487818
oodbms	rdbms
nhibernate was designed for rdbms .so i am wondering whether there are any difference features in oodbms usage that one might not take advantage of while using nhibernate

2487820
droppable	draggable
however if you want a treeview you should be using sortable instead of draggable droppable

2487823
protected	public
the private protected and public directives exist for the benefit of the compiler

2487823
subclassing	ivar
there is still objective-c s relatively flat namedspace to content with and that is what prevents you from having an ivar of the same named in a subclassing

2487823
binary-compatibility	legacy
32-bit mac os x preserve the legacy behavior for binary-compatibility reasons

2487860
duplicates	contains
as an alternative approach to fallback in some cases if translation do not always exist or you re unable or unwilling to return two results and if the amount of data contains in the translation table is not very large you could also duplicates the data in the database for each language with translation overwrite for those field that they are available for

2487863
python	c++
i know we re not really supposed to give homework answers but it appears the op is in an intro to c++ class .so probably doesn t know python yet hopefully it just looks like pseudo code

2487876
imap	nntp
executive summary essentially the author eventually gives up on using this header and recommends and show a different approach which is also implements in the c-client libs part of the uw imap toolkit open source package which is not for imap only -- don t let the named fool you it also works for pop nntp local mailboxes c

2487879
for-loop	arrays
to iterate over an arrays use a standards for-loop with an index

2487912
genshi	mako
numerous templates languages such as cheetah django-templatess genshi mako mighty might serve as an example

i m building swig perl python ruby and lua libs and this fix only got python and lua working

2488031
memory-management	memory-leaks
personally i am not a big fan of activities constantly calling setcontentview as i worry about memory-leaks and overly-plump activities making state and memory-management more difficult

2488046
arrays	loops
i am trying to get to the yellow green blue arrays s length and loops to get the value

2488054
selected	button
obviously this code doesn t mean anything its just to experiment on how i can do this feedback form the problem im having now is once some one presses the submit button there s a submit button on the form how do i go through the table and get text from the radio button the user has selected

2488070
click	mouse
right now you re refreshing the frame only in the def ondraggingdown methods the first time the mouse left button is click and held down not every time the mouse is move while said button is held down the dragging action itself

2488093
.when	ready
checkout this course on parallels computing using cuda from the university of illinois .when you are ready to dive in further

2488148
contains	elements
i have a two dimension json arrays where each elements contains several attributes

2488150
external	embed
from where i sit i d suggest that you can t really embed the definition into the file i m assuming you re getting data from external .sources .so you re unlikely to get help from them and even if you do you immediately create challenges as you can t for example easily open the files with excel if necessary

2488151
linked-list	queue
currently i m just using a linked-list but i thought maybe this would be more like a queue than a linked-list

2488169
frame-rate	fps
.when it took 40 ms from the last frame you know you are one frame â œlateâ since to keep the desired frame-rate of 50 fps youâ d like to keep each frame under 20 ms

2488194
.when	ready
then .when the parent thread is ready for the counter to stop it should set the boolean to true stop which will cause the counter thread to stop as soon as it checked the value again

2488202
variables	boolean
it s considered a better way link to use separate volatile variables boolean isstopped for this purpose

2488208
arrays	loops
the fastest data structure to loops through is an arrays or vector with the data actually in the vector - not pointed to

2488214
mssql-jdbc	jtds
mssql-jdbc drivers or performancewise better the jtds jdbc drivers

2488214
hsqldb	oracle
instead of a fullfledged database server you can also consider an embedded javabased database such as sun oracle javadb derby hsqldb or sqlite each which are of course accessible through the jdbc api the usual way

2488218
postgresql	oracle
mssql sqlite postgresql oracle or put your choice here

2488219
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
these would include postgresql hypersonic sql mysql sqlite on the free side and oracle ms sql-server and others on the paid side

dictionary	arrays
its this byte arrays you would store in your dictionary

2488269
hash	md5
hash uncompressed contents md5 would do probably

2488285
difference	count
if i understand the problem you can use table to compute the difference in the numbers of elements in each set and then create a vector based on the difference of those count note that this won t necessarily give you the order you gave in your question

2488288
constructor	object
the messages constructor uses xmlserializationr to serialization your observation object

2488289
32-bit	64bit
.so if your image is 24-bit you can possibly use a 32-bit or 64bit if 64bit compiled datatype and keep packing the data in two variables of these types from both images and compare the two for equality

2488290
boost-test	googletest
the ctest component integrated with other unit-testing libs like boost-test or googletest

2488290

autotools	cmake
the kde project move to cmake from autotools for this reason

2488306
subclassing	superclass
inheriting a class attributes from a superclass and later changing the value for the subclassing works fine

2488306
superclass	inherited
now if the inherited value is a list the shallow-copy effect strikes and the value of the superclass is also affected

2488310
queue	fifo
a queue is basically a list of items with a defined behavior in this case fifo fifo

2488310
linked-list	arrays
either with a linked-list or with an arrays

2488310
linked-list	queue
what you need is another queue implements using another linked-list that maintains a reference to dots in the first linked-list

2488310
linked-list	queue
and you also have a secondary queue implements as a linked-list that maintains a reference to the dot

2488332
python	php
django is implements in python but it should be fairly straightforward to ports this code over to php

2488341

you can add the view of the uinavigationcontroller to the uiwindow and either let it obscure the first view or remove that view from the uiwindow

2488387
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
that s the direct answer to your question however if you simply want uinavigationcontroller functionality but don t want to see the uinavigationbar on the first screens - checkout

2488395

2488445
tree	trie
i personally feel you can checkout b+ tree or trie

2488459
pointers	stack	instances	destroy
the object guarded by the scopingd_ptr will be destroy .when it goes out of scoping - either at the end of the calling function if the pointers was a stack variables or .when the contains class instances is deallocated if it was a member variables

2488462

2488504
postgresql	mysql
okay i tried this for you on postgresql i don t have mysql here .so maybe it s a little bit different

2488507
short-circuiting	equivalent
true they will perform bit operations rather than logical operations and thus they wonâ t short-circuiting but these bit operations follow a well-defined mapping which is effectively equivalent to the logical operations as long as both operands are of types bool

2488508
put	get
each rest methods get .post put delete is a simple conditional in the view function

2488509
spaces	output
inorder to output make sure to toss out spaces dots for each car after if the stoplight is at the right and the cars come from the left or before stoplight at left and cars coming from right the car itself and there you go

2488509
linked-list	queue
if you add to the struct a pointers to the next car and a null-pointers for the last car you already have a linked-list keep a global variables that points to the first car or null for an empty queue

2488535
tuples	any
tupless can be turned into new lists by just passing them to list like any iterable and any iterable can be turned into a new tuples by passing it to tuples

2488539
linked-list	queue
i am tasked with making a queue data structure in c as a linked-list

2488540
contains	set
as an example protocol-buffers allows you to generator code which either contains full statically-typed code for reading and writing messagess or it generator just enough .so that the rest can be done by reflection in the reflection case the load save code has to get and set properties via reflection - it knows the named of the properties involved due to the messages descriptor

2488555
32-bit	64bit	powerpc	arm
by hardware i primary mean 32-bit versus 64bit but it s also worth noting that linux runs on powerpc arm and sparc

2488555
32-bit	64bit
if you have a 64bit systemd you can run a 32-bit viewmodel and test

2488555

packet-capture	udp
if you can also take a packet-capture on the client device you can confirm whether udp packets are getting received

2488610
subclassing	metaclass
michael s answer is nice and simple but if you wish to avoid having to add that line to each unit subclassing - maybe you have a bunch of other lists like that one a metaclass is an easy way to solve the problem

2488619
uniform	points
if the coordinates of your surface data represent a uniform grid such that z is a rectangular set of points that span from xmin to xmax in the x-axis and ymin to ymax in the y-axis you can plot it using surf instead of trisurf

2488699
hash	md5
for example compute a hash with md5 and look at a byte of it

2488712

2488770
boolean	int
this function is capable to return testing result such as boolean int unknown types etc

2488777
versioning	migrate
the actual updates is pretty straight forwarding i checked schema versioning in a table and compare against a constants in my .app to decide whether to migrate or not and between which versioninging of schema

2488784
http	ssl
because of some recently discovered ssl attacks it is always preferable to also put the login form on a http page

2488796
pixels	line
if you used a 1.5-pt line width half of that is 0.75 pt which is three-quarters of each 1-pt pixels .so the color will be rendering at 0.75 alpha

2488796
pixels	line
this of course goes to the natural conclusion if you use a 2-pt line width each pixels is completely covered .so the alpha will be 1

2488823
contains	any
but generally you can solve any arrays problem by contains the data in an stl vector

2488865
duplicates	elements
also checked the id of your checkedbox elements is valid and correct not a duplicates doesn t have a typo etc

2488945
where-clause	sql
and then using these as your where-clause in the sql query

2488945
contains	any
for one this is vulnerable to sql-injection and any subject or comment that contains single-quotes will break the query

2488945
numeric	digits	digits	short
the use of a numeric identifier will easily keep your query-string very short unless the people registering complaints file .so many you get up into numbers hundreds or thousands of digits long

2488957
increment	reset
sort it then iterate through it and keep a counter that you increment .when the current numbers is the same as the previous numbers and reset to 0 otherwise

2488957
hashmap	arrays
alternatively you can use a hashmap from int to int or if you know the numberss are within a limited range you could just use an arrays and iterate over the vector increasing by 1 for each numbers

2488957
hashmap	arrays
this required a hashmap datastructure though unless you can use arrays which will also be faster which isn t part of stl

2488960
selected	checkbox
my problem is i can t seem to keep checkbox selected with the option that the user had chosen before .when the page refreshes after validation fails

2488980

i ve made a viewbased .app in the .app delegation i ve set a uitabbarcotntroller in the .app i have different view controllers two of them display text in a uitextview and labels the other one is my shakecontrollers a uiviewcontrollers in which i ve set a uiacelerometerdelegation in it i create a instances of uiaccelerometer in the methods which manages the shake everything works fine in this controllers i have also set a uiimageview to make a simple animation in the view did load methods i set my imageview.animation to an arrays of uiimage

2489041
linux	osx
what can i use that works with osx linux and windows and plays sound well

2489042
user-interface	drawing
also now that you have your pixels in a bitmap you can do tricks like make the size of the bitmap smaller and scale it .when drawing to the screens allowing you to take much less time updating those pixels while still filling the entire user-interface albeit at a lower resolution

2489057
order	join
i have in mind to load in a temporary db table all data from cr then do the query on the temporary table where i can join tables and do order bys

2489065

subclassing	superclass
it seems to me that subclassing should be able to see superclass because package a.b.c is a subpackage of a.b.

2489122
printf	strlen
if you re using strings always use the c++ string libs over strlen printf and that

2489131
dictionary	arrays
if .so then you need an arrays of dictionary

2489131
dictionary	arrays
then add each dictionary to an arrays to store them

2489131

2489236
attributes	properties
how can i prevent the framework from applying the required attributes to properties of types datetime and int etc without changing them to nullable

2489238
order	add
to model the gravitational sort as you describe you would have to start by thinking each object on a separate thread with a thread safe way to add them to a list in the order they finish

2489246
getter	setter
the .doc you linked show the model having getter setter like this

2489247
callback	methods
however .when debugging with firebug the callback in unable to find the javascript methods and i do not know why

2489250

regardless .when a user click a button on the page i want to loops through the items in myitemscontrol and determine if the checkbox elements associated with the item is checked

2489398
put	get
this situation may seem a bit like a chicken and egg problem application developers won t move to 3.x till the libs get there libs developers would rather only maintain one branch and are waiting in an attempt to time the porting to py3k in a way that they can put the their py2.x branches in maintenance shortly thereafter

2489409
texture-mapping	cube
if you are doing anything like the introductory course i ve taught in the past it s basically spinning cube and spheres some texture-mapping and some vertex animation and that s about it

2489409
python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
if you want to leverage your knowledge into a real job in computer graphics though pretty much every game and graphics engine is written in c or c++ while python or lua is left as a scripting-language

2489416
ebnf	bnf
is there a bnf or ebnf that describe the grammar for java s annotations

2489421
exception-handling	error-handling
more to the points you should only use exception-handling .when error-handling would otherwise mess up the structure of your code which shouldn t be the case in an is the data in this form ok - yes fine accept and close event handler

2489451
postgresql	mysql
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standards than mysql via py-postgresql

2489451
postgresql	mysql
.so if the third party extensions you re pining for are say wxpython and mysql-python perhaps you can try these alternatives i m biased of course since i ve long preferred qt to wxwidgets and postgresql to mysql on purely technical grounds -- but the prompt porting of the related python-extensions to python 3 does al.so hint that these extensions are being more actively and vigorously developed .so that might be another nudge to try them

2489457
textbox	onblur
for this i have used the onblur option within the tags of the textbox

2489461
default-value	default

2489572
order	join
is there anyway i can join the order collections with the product collections and filtering by category id

2489576
javascript	dom
the only thing i can guess is that since windows.open is a methods jquery doesn t treat it like a dom elements even though all documentation from basic javascript tutorials treat the variables as both a methods to open the windows and the pointers to the windows s inner dom

2489576
dialog	pop-up
i usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jquery-ui dialog widget but in this scenario the images are actually webcam feed that the user will want to pop out of the main windows and have open even if the main windows is closed .so while i appreciate the move from pop-up windowss in general please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve same-windows widget

2489583
derived-class	base-class	derived-class	pure-virtual	pure-virtual	base-class
my instant reaction is that you should store smart pointers in the containers and make sure the base-class defined enough pure-virtual methods that you never need to dynamic_cast back to the derived-class

2489587
silverlight	wpf
trying to incorportae controls that can be shared between both silverlight and wpf apps and was just wondering what were the main pitfalls were.

2489643
attributes	properties	qt-designer	pyqt
i just downloading the whole pyqt qt4 package including qt-designer from the pyqt website however it seems qt-designer which looks amazing to use as a newbie since you can see all the attributes properties default etc of each widget and visually edit the properties is great but pyqt seems not to set qt-designer to integrated directly with with pyqt and pyqts python code-generation scripting

2489643
qt-designer	pyqt
is there a way to get qt-designer to integrated closely with pyqt for code-generation on-the-fly like it does with c++

2489644
constructor	private	constructor	object
as an example the java serialization framework uses it to invoke private object constructor .when deserializing object

2489644
value	field
someone mentioned systemd.seterr and it would be a good example but curiously the systemd class methods setout seterr setin all use native-code for setting the value of the final field

2489644
jpda	jvm
debuggers in my opinion don t fall into this category as they normally don t run in the same jvm process but instead the interface with the jvm using other means jpda

contains	set	contains	elements
the methods allows you to pass each elements in the current matched set through a function producing a new jquery object contains the return value

2489710
value	field
i like option 1 .so it can be used on any value that may be in cents not just that specific field in that specific class

2489734
virtual-functions	base-class
defined a base-class which you are already doing with virtual-functions which would be overrides by derived classes enemy and civilian in your case

2489744
value	field
.so for example an accountbean would contains the account field and maybe a few simple methods that use those field to compute and return a value or format a field

2489754
keyboard	mouse
i would like to have a background-image in my qgraphicsview that is always scale and cropped if necessary to the size of the viewport without scrollbar and without scrolling with the keyboard and mouse

2489780
nonblocking	epoll
epoll has a reputation for being the ideal tool for the task and it is part of the python distribution .so using anything but epoll for nonblocking http is highly counterintuitive prove me wrong if you feel like it

object-pascal	pascal
the free pascal compiler supports object-pascal and it says you can call a pascal libs from a c program

2489809
perl	ruby
can you guys throw in some good questions about ruby xml ajax or perl

2489972
shell	ifs
if using a shell which can handle a nul character inside strings then joining on the nul and separating on it via ifs or whatever can work well

2489972
shell	bash
but several common shell including bash break on nul

2489972
perl	lua	perl	ruby	python	lua	python	ruby	python	perl
even if that would work for you you ve just reached one of the warning sign that it s time to switching to a more structured language python perl ruby lua javascript .

g++	gcc
g++ the c++ compiler is a sibling of gcc the c compiler and g++ is allowing you to use that c99 feature while vs has no such thing

2489994
pos-tagging	stemming
leaving other practical questions aside parsing pos-tagging stemming and of course the very issue of identifying mapping a given word.

2489994

well you could cut out the second fmodf by just subtract 32 one more time to get the mod from below

2490016
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
the viewdidappear and viewwillappear methods will only be called if you are

2490045
matplotlib	networkx
one idea is to use the networkx libs for python coupled with its matplotlib visualization

2490045
matplotlib	networkx
networkx can rendering tree to matplotlib plot and matplotlib allows you to zoom and pan

2490086
32-bit	64bit
while none of these is particularly new little seems to have changed -- i haven t tested all of them but for example the first link to codeproject built fine in 32-bit with vs 2008 and needed only one trivial change to work as 64bit code as well change getclasslong to getclasslongptr and gcl_cursor to gclp_cursor

2490097

i can also upload via ftp to the webserver which has access to postgresql and the database somehow.

2490157
python	java
that being said if you re interested in learning general programming techniques rather than just advanced c i d recommend learning another language such as python or java since it s much easier to grasp concepts such as algorithms data-structures and design-patterns in higher-level languages

2490166
restart	exit
.so i created a wr.apper that restart the .app as .soon as it detection a crash now comes the problem .when the user logs out or shuts down the systemd the .app exit with status 1

2490398
jquery	dojo
however personally i use it only .when i have to mostly to get collaborators and make them comfy on a project s technology stack -- maybe because what i tend to develop server-side are more web-services apps than sites the user-interface part i d rather leave to the browser with dojo jquery or google-closure

2490398

2490473
solaris	linux
i want to use i o completion ports for windows and asynchronous i o aio for solaris and linux versioning of my server application

2490492
linked-list	nodes
void insert linked-list nodes

2490497
contains	elements
you can import the schema that defined this types into other schema and you can use that complex types in xml document which contains elements from both schema

google-chrome	firefox
this is not working in ie but it does in firefox and google-chrome

2490627
google-chrome	firefox

2490644
attributes	properties
the showbody properties seems applicable only to title attributes

2490662
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera	any	set
from memory i think there are quite significant size difference in the default sizes of button between ie firefox and safari - i dont really use opera but i assume there are size issues there - .so if you were then to set a padding on the button in css it might not rendering correctly any more in safari and firefox

2490666
profiling	debugging
we have been working on a graphical frontend that show all the instantiations allows debugging profiling

2490715
python	java
but a python class is not necessarily the same as a java class and the way i use python - as a scripting-language - is more functional then oop - .so what do you unit test in python

an html elements can only contains block elementss such as

2490804
ubuntu	linux
currently i use ubuntu gnu linux

2490807
attributes	properties
thus there won t be anywhere in the definition that checked the value of the styles attributes for a certain css properties inorder to validation a document

contains	elements
what i would like to get is another matrix b with dimension n-k choose n k where each column will contains the excluded n-k elements of

2490862
value	field
dbgrid display value based on field types

2490862

imho .when business-logic-layer bll needs i o to some store db xml disk etc. best way to have data-access-layer dal out of bll since you may change it you want to control caching etc

2490899
base-class	superclass
another benefit to having a universal base-class is that logic dealing with the superclass does not have to be special cased for top-level classes with the exception-handling of the universal base-class object itself

2490902
triggers	insert
.when the form is triggers it goes to a save.php page which contains and value insert

2490915
grizzly	netty
grizzly and netty are also good nio based network frameworks but if you want to use jsp and find that tomcat is not sufficient i guess jetty would be the best bet

2490915
push	pull
also it s not like there are only push and pull model

2490923
pointers	stack
it seems to me that the only things added to stack in each recursion are two pointers variables mp is a pointers to a structure and the stuff that one function-call stores a few saved registers base pointers return address etc. all 32-bit 4 byte value

2490942
contains	any	contains	elements
.so i wanted to have a xml elements which can contains any valid xaml

2490951

there s really no difference between using a mysql database and a sql-server or oracle for windows forms programming

2493089
werkzeug	jinja2
it is exclusively geared towards .app engine and uses werkzeug and jinja2

2493089
jinja2	mako
also comes with jinja2 and mako it s your choice it s lightweight and easy to comprehend

2493107
selected	textbox
and in the code-behind you would add controls to your panels for each drop down item then have a javascript onclientclick for each item that updates somewhere on the page hidden-field textbox whatever their selected choice from the dropdownlistfor

2493130
increment	reset
although this increment is reset .when altering the table structure or .when toggling set identity_insert to on and back to off i would not advise it

2493199
contains	any
one approach would be to extraction any shared interfaces into a particular directory and then use your versioning-control systemd to ensure that the directory is the same between both project -- for example if you were using subversioning it has a feature called external that allows one project to contains a directory that is actually a link to a specified directory or a specified versioning of a specified directory in another project

2493207
dictionary	namedtuple
edit it looks like the _namedtuple function is provided by pylast and will use a real namedtuple in python 2.6+ but will fallback to a plain old dictionary in python 2.5 or older

2493208
http	ssl
i have a login page in a asp.net-mvc 1.0 application that i am securing with ssl i have an attributes that inspects the request for the page and redirects to a http uri .when it is requested with http

2493221
required	checked
create a php file with the db checked required

2493227
python	java
i want it to be as cross-platform as possible and be able to write binding to it for other languages to use java python etc etc

2493242
implements	extends
i guess you have to either implements some solution outside of hudson that produces triggers files to be used in hudson or you extends the promotion plugins with your company specific rules

2493255
lookup	any
on the one hand you want a .solid and consistant database-schema tables indexes vies procedure functions and al.so lookup value and any non-changing static data required by your systemd and you want version-control over that .so you can tracking what changes over time and by who and al.so can control .when the changes get applied to which database instances

2493266
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
if you did not have the base-class constructor you could not add these rules to your derived-class object

2493273
function-call	inline
for example if the compiler decides to inline the function obviously there will be no copy since there is no function-call

2493287
dependency-injection	inject
alternatively you could read up on dependency-injection and look at using an inversion-of-control containers to inject these dependencies

2493294
push	pull
in python the yield-keyword can be used in both push and pull contexts i know how to do the pull context in c# but how would i achieve the push

2493298
linked-list	nodes
i will be creating a head nodes like head new linked-list 4

2493312
data-structures	linked-list
as others mention this is not the same algorithm in c and haskell because the data-structures differ--haskell uses an immutable linked-list of unicode characters

2493385
selected	button
the jsf-generated html output looks correct but the webbrowser would in the view only selected the button which was actually selecteded by the user in the previous request on the same page

2493385
selected	button
if the caching is-empty none of the button is selected

2493388
credentials	account
wrong credentials for the email account

2493439
tablelayoutpanel	panels
the layout panels such as tablelayoutpanel also help tremendously since they do dynamic resizing at runtime

2493440
arguments	default
arguments default current nodes cck

2493440
value	field
allows for cck field value of the current nodes to be loaded as default-arguments

2493440
arguments	default
arguments default request params

2493451
base-class	inherited
you ll have to defined some kind of base-class or interface known by the project you re building and make the runtime loaded types implements that well known interface or inherited from the well known base-class

2493461
value	field
i can see it under dev rendering tab as part of content attributes like but if i assign value to or and call node_save cck field are not saved

2493473
arrays	loops
if no default-constructor is available you will need an arrays of pointers and then loops over that arrays to initializer each of the pointers

2493485
value	field
this would only use those field as filteringing if they had value to filtering on otherwise they wouldn t be used in the query

2493488
constructor	object
you can t do that with an object with no constructor that doesn t take arguments

2493499
tuples	any
you can add a list to a tuples just like any other elements

2493551
silverlight	wpf
a similar question was asked for wpf the answer for which made use of the targettype properties on the hierarchicaldatatemplate but i am uncertain whether that properties is available in the silverlight versioning since i don t appear to have access to it in my environment

2493557
macros	basic
as a learning exercise i m writing myself a simple extension plugins macros framework using ironpython - i ve gotten the basic working but i d like to add some basic debugging support to make my scripting editor easier to work with

2493558
font-size	height
you may also need to apply font-size 0 to the top and bottom s to make the defined height work properly in ie 6

2493574
udp	tcp
tcp would be reliable your data will make it to the other end whereas udp doesn t care you just want the data fast as possible and loss is acceptable video-streaming

2493625
buffering	streaming
i have service that use net.tcp binding both streaming and buffering endpoints. i d like to add wif federated security to those service while continuing to use net.tcp binding

2493638
contains	elements
it is supposed to printing the thead and tfoot on each page in theory but for some reason the thead does not if it contains certain elements together

2493666
postgresql	oracle
postgresql has the except operators which i recall is pretty much the same as minus such as in oracle .so maybe .something like would work

2493706
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
now this works fine in firefox but safari and google-chrome simply refuse to change the source regardless of operating systemd

2493715
arrays	map
make an arrays collections or map which is identified by currently iterated category

2493721
contains	set
i want to find the minimum set of intervals of size b let s call it m .so all the intervals in s are contains in the intervals of m

2493722
value	field
if a field has blank true validation on djangoâ s admin site will allow entry of an empty value

2493734
triggers	insert
also is it possible that you have a db triggers that may be running on updates instead of say on insert that is setting it to a default-value of 0 false

2493736
mouseover	mouseout	margins	padding
the problem is hovering the mouse over from one span to another triggers an instant mouseout and mouseover again even though they have no padding or margins between them

2493795
put	get
i d like to be able to format the out put .so all i get is

2493796
subroutine	scoping
subroutine should do as little work as possible and keep the the smallest scoping as possible

2493806
png	gif
you can put a transparency color onto a gif .gif image and it will be smaller then a 24-bit png

2493814
reflection	runtime
reflection is only used to find the right methods at runtime without the eyesore you re looking to avoid

2493818
spring	jsf	flex	jsf
you ll need to use jpa spring as inversion-of-control containers spring-security jsf or spring-mvc flex

2493832
javascript	dom
.so i m a beginner in xml dom and javascript but i ve run into an issue

2493833
video-encoding	flv
i m doing one research on video-encoding tools for flv

2493867
upgrade	migrate
now i have to migrate it to jboss 5 and i have to decide whether i can leave axis1 web-services as is at least for the time being to get the .app working on jboss at all or if i have to upgrade web-services to axis 2 or cxf

2493869
tiff	bmp
they have a renderpagetostream function that will create a reliable image of your document in one of several different formats including bmp jpg and tiff among others

2493871
attributes	properties
you will need to make your own validation attributes eg that validation the child properties

2493879
alpha	rgba
css is in rgba order a stands for alpha which is from 0 invisible to 255 opaque

2493890
while-loop	for-loop
here is a translation of your for-loop into a while-loop just to clarify his observation even more.

2493905
illegalargumentexception	classcastexception
error-handling omitted but of course you want to throw illegalargumentexception wherever incorrect types are passed around i prefer to let classcastexception be jvm generator and throw iae in my own code .when i detection something wrong

2493913
arrays	loops
in this case doing loops will actually be more efficient than trying to use linq for setting these arrays since you re going to have some odd filtering required

2493939
contains	elements
inline elements like cannot contains block elements like

2493945
webforms	asp.net
we have an asp.net 2.0 webforms .app that uses ms ajax 1.0

2493996
restrict	shared
feel free to shared little tricks and idioms but try to restrict yourselves to core and contrib

2494023
stdin	pipe
you must pass the output pipe of the first process as the value for the parameter stdin of the second process

2494031
concat	where
another feature i miss is to concat two lists where each of them could be in inverse order

2494038
json	xml
i know this is done by libs that emulate json via xml api because of impedance between xml and json due to conversion from xml to json but for pure json solutions it is usually not needed

2494058
silverlight	wpf
note i am working in wpf but assume this is similar if not identical in silverlight xaml

2494088
xsd	xml
see the stackoverflow discussion about xsd schema for recursive xml

2494110
stderr	stdout
stderr needs to be redirected to stdout

2494123
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python perl ruby would probably be the easiest to set up and manage

2494139
distinct-values	lookup
on the other hand i ve seen the first lookup approach for all distinct-values in use

2494141
arrays	loops
obviously it s a for each loops saying for each object in foo arrays

2494141
arrays	loops
that would make some sense granted the use of different object with the same named ob seems odd to me but it looks readable enough saying that the arrays consists of every elements in that loops

2494151
superclass	inherited
neither member is inherited in the traditional way from any superclass

2494154
job-queue	queue
in generics terms you need a job-queue and a way to manage the queue

2494225
defined	declare
the biggest gotcha comes .when using the or any operators at a higher level than the desired logic is declare in other words referencing the object as a parent class that either doesn t explicit defined the operators or definedd it differently than the true class

2494226
profiling	trace
looking at the sql trace in nh profiling the query appears to be correct

2494257
sql-server-express	sql-server
this article on the sql-server-express blog suggests there will be no .net 4 sqlclr in sql-server 2008 assuming that the logic extends to the other editions

2494291
any	set
given that there is no implicit order of a set then no there isn t any reliable way to do this

2494296
virtual-functions	base-class
i overrides all the virtual-functions from the base-class and i have a constructor like this

2494303
curly-braces	include
i am trying to include a variables in a .ini file setting by surrounding it with curly-braces and zend is complaining that it cannot parsing it properly on linux

2494308
order	add
assuming that transactional and payment are mapped in nhibernate already you need to add the cascade option to you associations mapping for order

2494308
order	add
that will make sure that .when you add transactional payment to an order they are persistent

2494311
explode	fgetcsv
you can try something like fgetcsv setting the delimiter to | or you could just use fgets and use explode to put the data in an arrays

2494316
contains	any
contains any non-alphanumeric

2494319
callback	methods
you could do something like that by adding a callback to the object right after creating it and like you said monkey-patching the default ar before_save methods

2494325
value	field
to give some context i m simply trying to copy a populate field consisting of value similar to 16-2009-02 34-2010-02 et cetera to another currently unpopulate field

2494341
specifications	w3c
the meta tag and named attributes are part of the w3c specifications see specificationsifying meta data

2494345
attributes	properties
.so i have created a .net 3.5 class inheriting from the .net 2.0 class and added the data-annotations attributes to the overrides properties in the new class

2494346
linux	unix
on unix linux platform use python built-in os.statvfs

2494347
entitymanager	entities
given jpa annotations entities is it possible to generator before runtime the list of queries that will be performed by hibernate for crud operations performed against entitymanager

2494359
factors	matrix
there doesn t appear to be a way you can initializer lu with a pre-existing upper triangular matrix lu s constructor makes no assumptions and just starts factors but i would think you could either use it as is and live with the performance hit of the redundant factors or just take solve methods and adapt it to your needs

2494386
javascript	dom
why not edit the dom from javascript

2494387
text-editor	editor
in the .post editor view i am using a rich text-editor fckeditor

2494409
arrays	loops
then if you just want to access one field of this arrays no need fdor a loops being an associativity arrays you can use syntax such as to access each field

2494411
interpreter	runtime
but variables paths those with arguments get interpreter at runtime

2494412
swing	awt
what component would you choose to display xml data in a awt swing java gui

2494420
contains	any
i have a table contains 2 date field and an identifier id fromdate and to-date these dates overlap in any and every possible way

2494425
font-size	height
it uses the height of the flash object and the font-size to set the line-height

2494435
defined	declare
if your class is not meant to defined some super-type it should not be declare as abstract i d say

2494439
realloc	calloc
secondly comment 2 why did you call calloc .when the realloc on a double-pointer was called previously..

2494439
realloc	calloc
assume n has value of 5 then realloc is called on double-pointer a meaning now calloc is called thus has a new block of memory.

2494441
constructor	private
id use something more akin to a singleton with a protected private constructor as you suggest

2494452
associations	model
polymorphism associations with multiple associationss on the same model

2494471
constructor	object
can i call constructor explicit without using new if i already have a memory for object

2494509
duplicates	contains
this jar cannot be duplicates within the context of at least the ear contains the portal .app and plugins in an .app server or the global classpath if running in a servlet-container like tomcat

2494520
64bit	x86
my development workstation is running 64bit windows 7 and i do a fair amount of work with unmanaged code .so i immediately checked that the .net-assembly and the vc++ libs both had x86 targets

2494520
any	set
edit i get the same error regardless of x86 or x64 mode but .when set to any cpu execution gets past that points but execution abort on a later call to the vc++ libs with no exception-handling

2494536
height	frame
i would like to increase the height of a uiimageview with every animation frame using core-animation

2494546
json	xml
use wcf to return plain xml not soap or json

2494551
subshell	bash
in addition to the example given in the advanced bash scripting guide referenced by jefromi these examples show how pipe create subshell

2494562
directory	folder
just because you launchd an exe doesn t mean its working directory will be the folder it resides in

2494564
value	field
i m wondering whether it s better more efficient for the server client web service to cut this payload vertically--getting all value for a single field with each call--or horizontally--getting batch-file of complete recording with each call

2494576
specifications	w3c
knowledge of w3c s specifications

2494578
scheme	lisp
i m talking lisp scheme styles macros

2494587
attributes	properties
you d simply create a new class contains all the properties you need for the form and use this as model attributes for your form

2494622
32-bit	64bit
.when i get this error it is always caused by loading a 32-bit dll in a 64bit process

2494647
32-bit	64bit
in vc6 this worked because both long and time_t were 32-bit but in vs2008 time_t is a 64bit types .so they are incompatible

2494652
python	c++
you can make your gui using designer with python just as you would do it with c++

2494654
selected	textbox
shape shadow may be set by right-clicking on a shape including a textbox choosing format text then selected shadow or using vba via the shadow properties on each shape

2494660
push	pull
now as you note you can building both push and pull styles iterator easily if you have coroutines available

2494668
pointers	stack
your data structure is represented in memory as nodes object structures where each nodes has a reference pointers to the struct below it on stack one could also make the references bi-directional as an alternative

2494679
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
on the domain root i placed wide-open crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files

2494692
stdin	tail	stdin	pipe	pipe	tail
you could pipe the output in to php tail -f file | php myscript.php and then read from php stdin

2494713
coldfusion	railo
we are looking at railo another servlet and i m trying to figure out how easy it would be for the coldfusion railo .apps running in the same .app server to communication directly with each other

2494724
32-bit	64bit
but floats cost you at runtime because the chip is optimized to do 64bit math not 32-bit math

2494726
spaces	output
ok now looking at the output it confirm what we ve all been suspecting those spacess are ascii 160 the non-breaking spaces

2494737
data-access	ado.net
data-access - ado.net is great if you are used to it

2494737
value	field
for example you could return the value odd or even in the oddeven field which would be css classes that you could styles in your stylessheet

2494785
constructor	object
controllers class and not create a dao object in constructor each time

2494799
value	field
here is a section where the percentage field are not retaining their value

2494808
constructor	object	data-members	constructor
this refers to your object s data-members not the constructor s parameter

2494811
directory	folder
changing the current directory to the plugins folder

2494821
configuration	environment
i have a small configuration application that takes in environment and artifacts in the following way

2494827
constructor	object
the object s this reference is implied but it can be useful for clarity and it s necessary for disambiguation between an object s member and a local variables of the same named as in the constructor below

2494857
authentication	login
any newly created user should be able to login to sugarcrm using sugar s existing authentication

2494874
contains	any
normally a com api is contains in a dll file or active x control kinda like a dll file and you reference that from a windows application which will load the com dll just like any other dll

2494874
.net	wcf
wcf is basically a microsoft .net technology for building web-services

2494874
.net	wcf
you could optional use the older web-services in .net that have been around before wcf i just personally liked wcf better because it was more flexible

2494898
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you create a simple button and then choose edit templates - edit a copy blend will automatically generator a styles area along with all the button states mouseenter mouseleave pressed etc

2494930
callback	methods
i think i may be a bit confused on the syntax of the moq callback methods

2494942
aggregate-functions	sum
still the join resolution might not make a lot of sense but you could be using some other aggregate-functions sum avg etc. joined to the grouping month

2494945
selected	listbox
currently i have a listbox updating a junction-table with an onclientclick event iterates through selected items and if they are not in the table it adds them

2494945
highlight	selected
the list box is also updates by an option grouping based on the option grouping value a query populate the list with the appropriate items and they are selected highlight based on the junction-table

2494946
put	get
how can i make my menuitem get those .txt files and put the filenames in the menuitem .so that it creates a list of all .txt files in that folder

2494962
callback	methods
however i have observed a strange thing after a systemd reboot- the callback methods starts execution itself 3 or 4 minutes before the specified period

2494975
administration	account
why is not using the administration account

2494988
base-class	inherited
there s no way in current xml schema to have a class complex types be based both on a base-class and at the same time inherited from a second interface class - xml schema just doesn t have those concepts sorry

2494996
put	get
put another way if i convert foo to bytes i get 112 111 111

2495010
python	perl
i don t know perl that well .so i d wind up doing it in python

2495033
callback	methods
however the callback isn t being invoked until the getbyfilter methods is invoked

2495033
callback	methods
however you don t need to save the value in a callback because you can just get the parameter value directly in the returns methods

2495044
button	popup
the snag is that if i open a popup menu for a button the user has to click again to dismiss it

2495044
click	mouse
the points is that once the mouse exit a button the mouse is automatically click leftdown leftup on the next button the timer is invalidated and the pop-up menu is cancelled

2495044
click	mouse	mousedown	mouseup
assuming a pop-up menu is open and the mouse exists the leftdown leftup events are fired i know this works as i log them in nslog s for mousedown and mouseup the timer is invalidated but the pop-up menu is still showing and the other button click on by the fake events doesn t show anything

2495044
mousedown	mouseup
also the whole thing gets into a loops and there s frantic mousedown mouseup being sent for some reason

2495061
firefox	safari
this can be reproduced on both firefox 3.6 and safari 4.0.4

2495061
firefox	safari
i m really clueless i was wondering if x is maybe a reserved keyword in javascript firefox safari

2495065
.net	wcf
since you re using .net 3.5 and running on the same machine you should use wcf with the netnamedpipebinding which uses binary-data transfer over named pipe only on the same machine

2495068
dialog	pop-up
i want to change an image on a view from a pop-up dialog of 4-6 icons imagine like changing your image on a messenger application

2495072
formatting	printing
you can easily adapt it to printing anything you want of course and add the required formatting

2495078
json	xml
the above query can be called directly from your .app with this url xml json formats available

2495098
javascript	dom
i can t seem to find any documentation to support this but my guess is that the tag is being treated specially and the object is actually a javascript image object not a normals dom elements

2495107
duplicates	contains	contains	any
it isn t a key but it doesn t contains any duplicates value

2495137
deep-copy	object
unfortunately there is no reliable way to do a deep-copy on a vector of object

2495137
deep-copy	object
just a quick review of what i believe a deep-copy is a deep-copy is a copy where not only are the contents of a collections vector in this case copy-paste but the object contains in the vector are copy-paste independently

2495137
contains	any
in other words if vector v contains a and a copy v of v is made a copy of a a in v is unaffected by any changes to a and vice versa

2495142
phpmyadmin	heidisql
you should run your queries at the command-line or through something like phpmyadmin heidisql etc

2495202
braces	macros
the braces or spaces are just a trick to allow latex to see the proper macros name.

2495222
png	gif
for performance reasons you wouldn t want to configure apache to not send certain file types gif jpg png etc to php for handling

2495228
contains	any
this is different though as it will return true if coll contains any subclassing of t1 as well

2495244
subclassing	nsobject
the way i usually go about doing this is i add a methods to my nsobject subclassing that will act as my datasource object what goes into the datasource arrays assuming you re using this basic approach

2495244
subclassing	nsobject
since each row will have variables height i create an nsobject subclassing call it blogpostinfo

2495248
value	field
i need to set the value of a field in a form via javascript

2495248
value	field
what is the acceptable way to load a value into a currency field in ms crm

2495256
directdraw	directx
i m rendering using directx mobile with directdraw as a fallback path

2495266
delphi	c++
i m an experienced developer but most of my oo programming experience has been with c++ and a little delphi

2495274
32-bit	64bit
on 10.4 and 10.5 both 32- and 64bit executable can run on the 32-bit kernel

2495274
32-bit	64bit
you can link against them normally whether you re building for 32-bit 64bit or both

2495274
32-bit	64bit
pointers and long are 64bit wide int is still 32-bit and long-long is still 64bit

2495274
32-bit	64bit
windows uses the llp64 model instead -- long is 32-bit wide in 64bit windows

2495278
3g-network	wifi
because the user will either be in wifi range or on the 3g-network

2495282
selected	button
then i hooked the the controllers to the button and selected the outlets

2495298
triggers	insert
you can even calculate the is_prime value using a before insert triggers if you don t want to change the insert code

2495306
row	col
each nodes also has an index properties that contains it s positioning on the board matrix eg 1 4 - row 1 col 4

2495313
colorbox	jquery

but this is basically vb.net vb6 difference not especially vba

2495376
temporary	copy
if the request is not idempotent such as .post request are then you need to create a filtering which wrap the servletresponse with a custom implementation of the printwriter with the five write methods been overrides wherein you copy output into .some buffering builder which you store in the session or a temporary folder at local disk filesystems .so that it can be accessed afterwards in the subsequent request

2495376
apache-commons-email	javax.mail
to send it as an email make use of javax.mail or the more convenienced apache-commons-email

2495429
contains	elements
the basic points here is that you do a sort of subselect on device which is a descendant seeking all the interface elements that it contains

2495439
debian	linux
now the interesting thing here is that this behavior happens only on redhat linux and clones fedora centos etc. while on debian systemd the memory is returned back to the os after all freeing is done

2495524
constructor	private
unless you re trying to call a parent s constructor i d suggest making a private initialization methods

2495533

here is what c++ faq has to say about it in the question â œcan one constructor of a class call another constructor of the same class to initializer the this object

2495616
exception-handling	try-catch
.so you either need to input a valid smtp server or wrap the send line in a try-catch to catch the exception-handling and either log it .somewhere or ignore it

2495628
rollback	commit
the rules for whether or not this transactional commit or rollback reside in the main thread

you have to create extern-c wrapper to handle all the details of fortran calling c++ name-mangling being the most obvious

2495686
push	pull
if users from site b can ssh into site a they should be able to push pull directly from the repo on site a - push pull via ssh is one of the main ways to work with remotes in git

it is only that the jvm can keep the instances in a private place which does not incur the cost of a memory barrier

2495793
javascript	dom
it s usually best to keep your javascript unobtrusive and out of the dom

2495800
where-clause	sql
you can t even be sure that a contentprovider necessarily supports a classic sql where-clause -- some xml-backed contentprovider might use xquery syntax instead

2495801
contains	elements
thus the collections object must contains an applicable add methods for each elements initializer

2495812
hide	show
i d like to hide and show edittext with animation

2495819
lookup	any
but that by definitions sacrifices any order to get the constant-time lookup

2495837
progress-bar	progress
inorder to inform the user of the progress i have a progress-bar that i updates inside dowork

2495859
setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	setinterval
if for some reason you want to re-invent the wheel you ll need to set up a function that s called periodically via the settimeout cleartimeout or setinterval and clearinterval functions to control the animation after establishing the state open or closed via a onclientclick handler

2495861
double	int
re edit i see you want to return boxed types like int double etc

2495890
webforms	asp.net
i have dragged a empty asp.net table onto my webforms

2495890

.when you convert with you always get a string in decimal base it doesn t matter if you write the numbers in octal mode or in decimal mode an int is an int and it has not itself a base

2496038
hash	md5
a simple approach would be to calculate a checksum or hash md5 over the numbers and send this to the client with the data

2496038
hash	md5
convert the numbers to strings concatenation them and calculate the md5 hash over it

2496040

the fool who initially wrote this p invoke sample code had no idea what he was doing and created one that works on 32-bit systemd but does not work on 64bit systemd

2496079
protected	public	defined	declare
if you want to defined variables in a function methods just declare them without the public private protected

2496095
protected	public
you cannot request a variables from a function therefore it can t be defined as public private protected

2496121
while-loop	arrays
it s al.so not useful in java since the jvm will include bounds checked on your arrays .so your while-loop is checked that you re not going past the end of your arrays anyway

2496130
exception-handling	try-catch
place the code in a try-catch and var_dump the exception-handling you re getting

2496165
linked-list	dictionary
i have also been playing around with creating a key that is not unique but spreads the object evenly between the dictionary buckets and then storing object with matched hash in a list or linked-list or sortedlist

2496170
csv	xml
you can even read the xml file as string and use regular expression to read the content between the tags and create a csv file or use xpath expression to read the xml file data and export-to-csv file

is there any kind of facility in delayed_job for running a sort of setup methods .when a worker starts have it set some instance-variables like the xmpp connection object that can then be used by all the jobs that come up

2496227
configuration	upgrade
this would be a nice solution because there is no configuration required--in fact you d only have to ship the pay jar to upgrade from demo to pay the main and demo jars are reused and stay right where they are

2496229
any	set
since each project can have multiple working sets and the windows working set can be any combinations of working sets it s quite easy to only see what you want at any given time this way

2496245
linked-list	arrays
with an arrays this is o n + overhead of some reallocations with a linked-list this is only o 1 or o 2

2496246
callback	methods
one thought i had was to use to invoke a callback methods but i don t know how to indicate to the callback which bar object is making the call and consequently what response to give

2496254
constructor	private	constructor	object
my guess would be that quercus cannot initializer the object because the class connection has a private constructor

2496257
any	set
the only requirement is that the hashcode is always the same for any specific set of relevant data in the class

2496275
variables	boolean
where are those boolean variables

2496279
udp	tcp
existing extensions allow you access to tcp udp layer but not below

2496281

itâ s hard to login to a site .when you donâ t have authentication to access the login page

2496281
base-class	inherited
if you have a custom site map provider such as a database driven one such as this one on msdn then this might have to do itâ s own security checked but it depends at which base-class you inherited from

2496281
children	nodes
without the additional roles attributes the nodes and children wouldnâ t appear but roles â adminâ states that the nodes should also be show to users within the admin role even if the security checked fails

2496287

2496297
actionscript	mxml
flex is just the named for the marriage between the mxml markup and actionscript 3 language while flash is the compiled output

2496340
subclassing	inherited
the subclassing should not need to also implements idisposable it is idisposable via inherited

2496341
oncreate	onstart
essentially it s that you can t get a view s height until after oncreate onstart and onpause have all finished because before then the activity hasn t finished drawing itself on the screens

2496370
subclassing	base-class
.when you subclassing an idisposable class all of the dispose pattern plumbing is already being handled for you by the base-class

2496387
windows-server	windows
if you are using windows 7 or windows-server 2008 r2 maybe you can use applocker

2496388
subclassing	superclass
the child class should overrides the virtual dispose do any disposing specific to the subclassing and call the superclass dispose which in turn will do its own work

2496392
ebnf	bnf
to specify the syntax of a programming language it is usually used a variant of the extended backusâ naur form - acronym ebnf - which is a variant of the backusâ naur form - acronym bnf

ebnf	bnf
ebnf and bnf are metalanguages to describe syntax of programming languages

2496393
malloc	free
i encountered similar problems .when writing my own memory manager and wanted to overrule malloc and free

2496393
contains	lookup
the solution is to lookup in the atl sources where atl atlthrowimpl is defined and see if the source contains other functions

2496394
click	mouse
now i d like to use mouse to click and hold and move to navigate up and down like how the hand cursor feature in adobe-reader works

2496410
quirks-mode	doctype
and put ie 6 and 7 in quirks-mode by putting something an html comment before the doctype to use border-box box model

2496418
arrays	loops
minus is the same as saying get all the rows of the first query then from that set remove the rows that are al.so in the second query .so you could like load the results from the first query into an arrays in-memory then loops through the second query results and checked them one-by-one against the first query results and remove them if they exist

2496424
rvm	gem
you could use rvm ruby versioning manager which is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install manage and work with multiple ruby environment from interpreter to sets of gem

2496430
dictionary	arrays
can i use allkey on it in this case to get a correct-order arrays of key if the dictionary never changes

2496448
directory	folder
edit once referenced you will have to browse to the install folder of the starter kit to add the reference the dlls will be be copy-paste to the output directory because the copylocal properties of the reference in vs will be true .so .when you publishing the project via vs or compile the dlls will be include in the bin folder .so no you will not have to install the starter kit on the server al.so

2496467
directory	folder
usually hosts give you access to at least one directory above that in which case a much better solution would be to create a folder there into which you put your application

2496477
getter	setter
.when you put self.myarray you tell xcode to use the getter or setter but .when you just do myarray you are responsible for everything right

2496480
attributes	properties
while the readonly properties takes a boolean value the readonly attributes takes a string value

2496489
put	get
as of now the best methods i have is to use php to get the field title from the first row of the file and then put together a create-table query

2496492
boolean	int
i say that the mechanism you are describing is a c styles because in c the standards way to handle errors is to return an int that maps to a defined and then pass in by reference the value you are looking for in this case a boolean

2496506
pixel-density	hdpi
i ve been able to use different icons by using two directory with different icons drawables-hdpi icon.png and drawables icon.png but not every android 2.x is going to be hdpi and not every 1.x android device is going to be low pixel-density

2496507
event-log	logfile
inside the catch you will generally write to either a logfile or the systemd s event-log

2496555
exception-handling	try-catch
you can in junit4 use something like test expected arithmeticexception-handling.class but some people find that to be harder to read less intention revealing than an explicit try-catch exception-handling e block and if you wanted to checked state say of some mock object or to see if the exception-handling was throw in the right place or logged or the like

2496556
script-tag	iframe
i do not control the code on the move side it is import via a script-tag which then opens in a iframe

2496583

2496599
bibtex	latex
i m using latex and bibtex for an article and i want to able to cite the title of an article i reference

2496620
binary-tree	nodes

2496668
stdin	eof
my question is how do i read stdin until eof into a variables

2496696
streamreader	streamwriter
can i use streamreader and streamwriter with only file

2496709
buffering	streaming
you need to fflush the streamingwriter to force it to actually write the data from its internal buffering to the streaming

2496733
malloc	strcat
the problem here is that you are referencing a pointers variables that no memory allocated via malloc hence the results would be undefined and not alone that by using strcat on a undefined pointers that could be points to anything you ended up with a bus error

2496733
malloc	free
the code highlight the programmer s responsibility to manage the memory - for every malloc there s a free if not you have a memory leak

2496736
static-class	base-class
you might consider a utility handler static-class that contains a pointers to your base-class and delegation responsibility through that

2496745
callback	methods
.when i need to call something that will notify me about completion i fill set target and action with the actual callback usually self and a methods and stuff other value i will need later into value1..2..3 the callee hang on to the mycallback object and .when time comes it call the target action and passes the mycallback as a parameter

2496745
nsurlconnection	nserror
this is actually not how i do it though - i simply created a generics myhttprequest wrapper class that is the delegation of the nsurlconnection it accepts a url nsstring .post body process all the network stuff and returns an nsstring result and an nserror to the caller - a little bit higher abstraction

2496759
expression	evaluation
the evaluation of the expression is essentially

2496781
linux	unix
if you don t have the time for unix variants including linux you can try libstatgrab

2496909
required	checked
call a member function through a pointers that s been deleted and anything goes - the compiler and runtime aren t required to checked for this error but you certainly can t count on this working

sql-server	oracle
any real db sql-server sybase oracle db2 udb ... will have better backup features better management features and provide much better control of access and table management

2496978
build-system	cmake
if you are interested in learning more about cmake you might want to take a look at the c++ application project templates and c++ library-project templates which make use of the cmake build-system

2496978
g++	gcc
the cpath environment variables is much like the path environment variables it is a colon separated list of directory except that the directory in that variables will automatically be used by gcc and g++ as if they were specified on the command-line with the -i flag headers will be searched in those paths

2497002
constructor	object
reason error creating object with named nsevicebusstructuremaptest.testserver unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor arguments with index 0 of types nsevicebusstructuremaptest.itestmanager no unique object of types nsevicebusstructuremaptest.itestmanager is defined unsatisfied dependency of types nsevicebusstructuremaptest.itestmanager expected at least 1 matching object to wire the miningservicemanage parameter on the constructor of object nsevicebusstructuremaptest.testserver

linked-list	arrays
linked-list if you remove an elements from the middle of an arrays you pay the cost of moving all of the elementss to the right of the removed elements

2497178
arrays	map
map to implements a map using an arrays would give the same performance characteristics as your putative arrays implementsation of a set

2497183
ubuntu	linux

there are many advantages -and drawbacks- to having a semantics void rrn as opposed to a primary key based on one or several attributes field or column value of the recording

2497847
