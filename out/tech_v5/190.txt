use the onitemdatabound event handler and make the link an asp.net hyperlink component that way you can then get the value you wish to put into the query-string from the item.dataitem parameter and simply append then to the link.navigateurl properties

1902104
union-all	union
union will only give you the distinct-values concat will give you the union-all

1902135
order	join
instead of putting the conditional in where and join clauses could you perhaps use order by on your meeting data and then limit offset rowcount

1902164
partcover	nant
i had to go through a numbers of step to finally get partcover working .when calling it from a nant scripting

1902164
64bit	x86
next again if your os is 64bit and you use nunit or another test exe with partcover you will need to invoke a versioning explicit compiled for x86

1902193
log4net	nlog
log4net and nlog - see

1902209
protected	public
you can overrides a protected methods with a public one

1902209

you can t overrides a public methods with a protected one

1902230
cucumber	selenium
i m spending my first few days with cucumber selenium trying to figure out whether rbb is the thing i want to use in my latest ruby-on-rails project

1902230
cucumber	selenium
following the instructions on i got cucumber selenium sorts of up and running

1902246
order	add
in general with logging i add logging in the following order

1902251
search-engine	web-crawler
aspseek is a web-crawler indexer and a search-engine written in c and licenced under the gpl

1902251
search-engine	web-crawler
dataparksearch is a web-crawler and search-engine release under the gnu general public license

1902251
search-engine	web-crawler
mnogosearch is a web-crawler indexer and a search-engine written in c and licenced under the gpl

1902252
configuration	logging
because this wiring of category to listener is done in configuration you can alter the logging after deployment

1902270
filtering	grouping
i was thinking about adding a expression field to the permission table .so that .when accessing a certain re.source the filtering is applied in fact it would be a little more complicated i would have to apply each filtering of the grouping to which the user belongs joined with an or

1902286
boolean	double
in the example value is modeled as both a boolean and a double

1902287
distance	polygons
does anyone know of a way to fetch all polygons in a mysql-python within a given distance from a points

1902287
distance	polygons
the actual distance is not that important since it s calculated for each found polygons later but it would be a huge optimization to just do that calculation for the polygonss that are close

1902297
mkdir	umask
this .solution al.so has an issue with mode mkdir may fail .when directory exists but doesn t conform to umask .so you might want to checked that as well

1902303
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited
inherited works because everywhere you can use the base-class you can also use one of it s subclassing

1902303
base-class	inherited
if you were able to restrict access to methods the resulting class would not have the same api and you would not be able to use substitute an instances of the base-class for one of the derived classes negating the advantage of inherited

1902392
32-bit	64bit
the drivers is an unmanaged component and you probably have a single versioning of it 32-bit or 64bit install on your machine

1902392
32-bit	64bit
since you cannot load 32-bit unmanaged components in a 64bit process and vice versa it ll not work

1902402
environment	building
it s possible to set environment variables during the building to alter the path and still have it work in a local environment

1902404
push	pull
have your monitor thread-sleep for 50 or whatever milliseconds lock the buffering and checked for flags pull out what s needed unlock the list and push the data out

1902415
command-prompt	cmd
if i start my selenium server in a command-prompt and then run the maven building goal in another cmd prompt then the tests runs as expected

1902417
dictionary	map
are you trying to map a pair of int to a dictionary

1902417
dictionary	map	dynamic-programming	memoization
if you are trying to map a key consisting of a set of value to a dictionary can be useful in memoization and dynamic-programming you need to declare your own comparator to compare the contents of the key rather than solely considering their references

1902449
python	java
hence the reason jython java and python are not great for cgi invocations

1902452
directory	folder
anyway ntfs uses btree directory structures .so you really could place all in one folder

1902456
hide	show
i would rather have some sort of client side paginator where we can hide show contents than going to the server and doing a databind every time

1902474
put	get
the project url is .when you create an account and put your issue into the prokect s bug tracker you will get help there

1902524
associations	model
in my experience though i don t usually have problems with model and associations using the database

1902548
.when	ready
the old versioning can be uninstaller from the gac .when it s finally ready to be

1902551
downgrade	upgrade
sql-server can upgrade a database but can never downgrade it

1902556
selected	button
that is done .so you can get the mutually-exclusive selected behavior that radio button are designed for

1902575
macros	basic
on a very basic level yes templates s are just macros replacements

1902575
macros	basic
this ignore the very basic things such as scoping type-safety and that macros s are messier

1902578
private-members	object
templates object types can be namespaced made private-members of a class etc

1902579
sql-server	oracle
unless you re talking large as in google s index types of large the enterprise databases like sql-server or oracle will do just fine

1902579
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
james devlin over at coding the wheel summed it up nicely though this is more of a comparison between free db s like mysql with oracle sql-server

1902579
sql-server	oracle
nowadays i like to think of sql-server and oracle as the death stars of the relational-database universe

1902588
put	get
if you put the above in a file called log4j.properties and put that file in your classpath you should get tons of debugging output from c3p0

1902601
typename	typedef
the typename keyword is presented to enable context-free nested typedef s

1902604
spring	seam
but .when i do this all the spring inject field are usless cause seam creates new instances at runtime

1902604
spring	seam
my spring component is also added to the seam context i can tell cause .when i defined one with the same id in seam it complains

1902620
aggregate	grouping
however there is views grouping by module which should allow you to aggregate these count

1902620
default-value	arguments
since the nodes reference field points from sessions to conventions you would add that field as the arguments and pass a default-value in using the nodes id from url option

1902632
spring	seam
although i do not use seam along with spring chapter 15 of seam in action books talks about spring-integration

1902633
msbuild	nant
i know that i need to use cruisecontrol.net for codeigniter and either nant or msbuild for building the applications

1902633
environment	building
but i just can t find anything that connect the dots and explains how they interact with eachother what should be on your building-server .when you should building with your building-server is it just for deployment buildinging or even .when you just want to compile the .app you re developing after making a small change on your local environment

1902633
mstest	nunit
i m also planning on axing mstest as i ve found it to be buggy and will use nunit instead

1902633
continuous-integration	build-server
i do understand what continuous-integration is but again i m not sure how a build-server should be setup and how it connect with everything and why we need one the pitch to management

1902633
build-server	teamcity
finalbuilder seems to be a build-server - but i thought teamcity is also a build-server.

1902643
base-class	inherited
you could also create a base-class which all your pages inherited from and have that contains the methods you need

1902651
constructor	object
enable clients of this code to use it in a very natural c++ fashion w o creating a lot of overhead to existing code to convert it to use the c++ wrapper object automatic conversion to appropriate legacy types constructor that take legacy types etc.

1902653
arguments	default
additionally because templatess are types safe there are a numbers of templates coding techniques that could conceivably be performed with some hypothetical advanced preprocessor but would be kludgy and error-prone at best templates templates parameters default templates arguments policy templatess as discussed in modern c++ design

1902664
macros	basic
templates are only similar to macros in their most basic functionality

1902711
selection	cell
datagridview -value does not gets saved if selection is not lost from a cell

1902711
selected	button
i was thinking perhaps catching the event of leaving the grid but it seems the base problem is click a button for reasons i think i understand does not fire lost-focus events for the current control and it doesn t seem the click handler arguments knows what the last current selected control is

1902713
assign	add
i would also add type-specific inline or macros wrapper that assign retrieve data from the generics structures if you do this often in your code

1902713
realloc	malloc
if you checked the signature of malloc realloc you will see that you can achieve correct memory allocation without dreaded pointers

1902728
value	field
subsonic created the properties in the class correctly as short however in one of the propertieschanged methods it was expecting a string for this field and was setting its value to environment.username

1902732
jquery-append	.when
.when i click it it send ajax request and replace content in some div with jquery-append function

1902772
hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
another model to store hierarchical-data in a relational-database is the nested-set-model

1902773
logging	trace
also make sure silverlight is able to serialization the versioning object use wcf diagnostics trace logging and find out exactly what is wrong and on which side client or server the problem occurs

1902792
google-chrome	opera
but in other browsers like mozilla google-chrome opera and .so on it works

1902805
worksheet	excel
now i am able to generator the xl file with that templates if there is only one worksheet in that excel file

1902805
worksheet	excel
then the excel file do not use the templates and instead use a blank worksheet

1902820
instances	destroy
remove the globals and make a factory abstract-factory that will fabricate create an instances of your class and destroy it with the destructor

1902852
unique	words
every address binding contract combinations in wcf must be unique in other words you can have multiple contracts itransactservice iqueryservice on the same binding webhttp or http with the same address

1902853
artifactory	nexus
i would err on the side of creating more artifacts instead of fewer and using a repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage them

1902860
lookup	any
therefore i make sure that the right methods will be include in the lookup and avoid falling back on a global methods if any

1902861
python	c++
mpi is a message-passing libs with binding for many languages including c++ fortran python and c#

1902868
imageview	textview
i assume that you have custom layout for listview items and this layout consists of button and some other views - like textview imageview or whatever

1902868
imageview	textview
my custom_row.xml file is relativelayout with button of id button textview of id text and imageview of id image - just to make things clear

1902876
spaces	output
where prog is expected to output one or more newline spaces separated results

1902883
copy-constructor	placement-new
which implies val is default construct and copy-paste into the newly allocated or possibly previously allocated but unused spaces via placement-new and the copy-constructor

1902887
temporary	copy
you are right that push_back cannot avoid at least one copy but i think that you are worrying about the wrong things but resize will not necessarily perform any better either it copies the value of its second parameter which default to a default construct temporary anyway

1902888
google-chrome	firefox
i found identical results in firefox google-chrome and ie

1902893
distributed-database	bigtable
i want to know that the distributed-database systemd bigtable is object oriented

its good practice to use a transport layer security to protect the communication in general and messages layer to authentication the user as a valid user and approve his privileges

1902907
16-bit	8bit
a 16-bit image will allow the image to be brightened more than an 8bit image because there is more information to start with

1902911
credentials	account
s3 can be a good option for this data you can keep it in a file with the same named as your domain and it will be accessible from anywhere with the same amazon-web-services credentials as your simpledb account

1902911
unsigned	zero	numeric	zero
i m talking about the fact that numeric data must be stored with both zero padding to a length of your choosing and an offset value depending on if it is signed or unsigned inorder to work with simpledb s string-base query language

1902911
any	set
once you decide on a format or a set of formats to be used in your application it would be folly to leave that information hidden in and scattered across your source files in the case where that information is needed by source code tools query tools report tools or any other code

1902915
32-bit	64bit
my guess is that a 32-bit binary is being fed to a 64bit process or vice-versa

1902926
contains	any
i wrote this as part of tvnamedr - a utility which takes tv epi.sode filenameds and renamed them nice and consistently with an epi.sode pulled from - while the .source filenamed must be a valid file the series named is corrected and the epi.sode named - .so both could contains theoretically any characters

1902943
connection-pooling	pool
if you want to use connection pool in your project ensure that you have the following code set up for the tomcat connection-pooling to work in context.xml file

1902991
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
it is much faster than ruby python or perl

1902995
arrays	map
i m certainly not claiming this is the best or most efficient data structure but this is how i d map your data into a two-dimensional php arrays that very closely resembles your raw-data

1903003
webmethods	tibco-ems
or if you are rich you could look at tibco-ems webmethods etc

1903042
malloc	free
in that same example we re using malloc .so i assume we need to call free at .some later points

1903046
httpwebrequest	webrequest
cast your webrequest as an httpwebrequest then before the break call request.abort

1903051
asp.net-mvc	webforms

i m on a project where we have a primary solution developed with vs2010 and a satellite .net compact-framework solution developed with vs2008

1903109
.net	wcf	web-services	api
the wcf api in .net 3.5 supports json web-services natively

1903109
.net	wcf
self-hosted wcf service do not required iis but can be served from any managed .net application

1903115
arrays	loops
well the other answers all use 2d arrays which means using a 2d loops to retrieve it

1903115
lookup	any
.so you create a hash-function that turns any numbers into the relevant range then you do direct lookup instead of a loops

1903117
linux	unix
if you re a linux unix fan you ll feel right at home with eclipse

1903125
primitive	int
on the other hand if you have a primitive types int nillable will lead to problems since there is no mapping from xsi nil to a primitive

1903143
endpoint	uri
would you ever want an instances which did have a null endpoint uri

1903156
any	set
there are instructions in the instruction set which use specific registers which are smaller and often faster than the equivalent functions which target any register

1903158
value	field
given the following model how do i required that atleast one of the two field has been given a value

1903175
capacity	storage
thus if capacity - size 0 a push_back will not cause the vector storage to be reallocated

1903222
fadein	show
each con will show up with a fadein effect .when i do a mouseover on an imagediv

1903223
memmove	memcpy
as long as the arrays is modifiable you can use memmove to shift them but don t mistakenly use memcpy as memcpy is not meant for overlapping regions

1903224
tunnel	vpn
setup a quick vpn either tunnel other ppp over ssh see ssh s manpage between your machine and a special machine within the corporation which is allowed to see the web then updates your router tables to route traffic through the vpn

1903224
tunnel	vpn
then use the tunnel to establish ssh vpn

1903229
administration	account
if i belong to both administration and users groupinging and the administration grouping has read permissions but the user grouping has a deny checkbox for read permissions then the deny actually takes precedence and will prevent your account from accessing the registry key

1903232
silverlight	wpf
stick to wpf silverlight

1903243
conditional	operators
true false operators and only evaluates either the true or the false part depending on conditional

1903267
valarray	std
i wonder if perhaps you should be using a std valarray

1903278
put	get
you could either put in a call to session.refresh inside your getperson methods to always get the most current state from the database or you could expose that functionality through your own refresh methods

1903299
lookup	any
lookup and insert are really fast .so you shouldn t have any problem there

1903299
dictionary	arrays
regarding using an arrays that s what the dictionary class does already

1903305
glfw	sdl
next there is the windows systemd native ones win32 cocoa ... or libs built on top of it qt glfw sdl sfml .

1903338
arrays	loops
coupled with a loops you can bit-shift an arrays in milliseconds

1903339
put	get
i have left joined the two tables and put a where-clause to get me the y and null instances those are easy

1903382
sql-server	mysql
the link below is for sql-server but the theory for mysql is pretty much the same for basic join

1903383
relational-database	schema
join are the essential query in a relational-database schema

1903390
worksheet	excel
see the worksheet with charts to multiple worksheet with chartss sample on our excel report samples page for an example or downloading the free trial here to try it yourself

shell	bash
if you re referring to gcc and the bash shell these are not a part of linux

1903448
value	field
this is a really great function written in jquery to determine the value of a url field

1903453
contains	elements
just to be clear i understand the specifications of it has a defined start and end it can contains various elements whereas input is a singlet and can t contains stuff

1903479
any	set
returns all the parent s children that have a attr value of foo in the db but because it hits the database again any children that have had their attr value set to foo before being saved will have their db value restored thus overwriting any changes

1903506
loading	gif
i can see the gif and the loading... messages .when the contentpanels loads but the problem is that because it is only a i can t seem to get it to take up the whole panels and be centered instead it sits in the top left and doesn t display the whole loading graphic

1903518
push	pull
the advantage of git over something like svn is that it utilizes a pull model instead of a push

1903528
google-chrome	safari
i would recommend going with mp4 because it s already supported on the latest versioning of safari and google-chrome

1903536
hide	show	jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
what is the best way to hide show or enable disable certain jmenuitem in my jpopupmenu based on the nodes selected in the jtree

1903536
hide	show	jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
from here i would have a series of if-statement that access my jpopupmenu object and perform the modifications necessary to hide show specific jmenuitem

1903538
textbox	button
add two multi line textbox to the page and a button

1903546
exception-handling	try-catch
as tzerb above mentioned his code i thought it would be best to add another layer a try-catch to checked and see if the exception-handling is indeed being caught - i am surprised that no exception-handling occurred but worth a shot

1903561
spaces	output
sha1 has a larger output spaces than md5 and fewer attacks are known on it too .so it s definitely not a worse choice

1903565
linux	bsd
their os is based on bsd which is similar to linux in function but a different os kernel and differently licensed

1903580
contains	elements
background images do not display outside of their contains elements

1903581
any	set
bear in mind though that any data that was previously set by the old default will remain

1903594
one-to-many	entity
my understanding is that you can make any many-to-many relationship into separate one-to-many relationships by adding an intermediate entity

1903599
directory	folder
i often set the initial directory to the user s my document folder using call to shgetspecialfolderlocation and shgetpathfromidlista from shell32

1903622
division	modulo
you can use the modulo and division to get your code

1903623
rar	zip
user upload an archive file zip rar tar.gz tar.bz etc content - several image files

1903625
defined	declare
if you defined the arrays as extern then you can declare it in an external module separate from your get_button_name function

1903647
directory	folder
one place it uses the libs is the my document folder which at least by default is a libs that include both the user s document directory c users whoever document and the public document directory c users public document

1903653
configuration	installation
we have a common python installation for all of our systemdd inorder to ensure every systemd has the same python installation and to ease configuration issues

1903682
where-clause	sql
in the second case you are sending the query to the database nhibernate.linq converts your expression into a sql where-clause

1903723
duplicates	contains	contains	set
the list contains duplicates strings .so i set the duplicatess properties to dupaccept

1903729
macros	basic
there are some basic problems with macros

1903734
hide	show
i have realized show hide function in css

1903737
instrumentation	profiling
i recommend doing some code profiling with instrumentation to figure out where this issue is occurring

1903743
logging	trace
stack trace for top-level caught exception-handling are useful logging around areas where systemd crash can happen full connection pool is useful as is logging around areas where the systemd crash before

1903756
device-driver	hardware
the job of calculating checksums is usually not performed in the user-space libs but at the device-driver or in hardware

1903761
directory	folder
without coping all the .svc files for every binding that i whant to support since a url in iis is a folder or a virtual directory

1903779
javascript	dom
i can only think of using javascript to checked for ff3.5 and change the dom

1903788
plugins	add-on
however i m having difficulty is making it remain deleted as every time i refresh the table sorted pager plugins or the filtering plugins add-on i m using

1903831

sounds to me like you might want viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1903847
nsnumber	optional
an optional arrays of nsnumber object

1903854
python	c++
if you want to code in c or c++ whether for performance-critical or legacy code i recommend writing it as a python extension module called from a python-based activity

1903858
display	width
the table is display in full width and the entire page scrolls

1903866
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
for things that might change every time the view is show use viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1903875
lookup	any
if you have a class or interface which represents the insert and lookup abstract data types then you can replace its internals without changing any of the callers

1903897
environment	building
now i can pre-building different versioning of msi for different environment since there are already distinct building step for these dev test anyway but this does not solve a question of several productions where the product is already built

1903916
markup	xhtml
xhtml strict forces you to use semantic markup where as transitional is a bit more flexible and still allows you to use legacy presentational elements like and

1903926
archive	corrupt
-i might just have been unlucky with a corrupt downloading but i did try it twice once through software updates... and once by selected archive to install the downloadinging component pack which unlike v4.5.0 and v4.7.0 was a jar not a zip

1903929
terminal	prompt
anyway this makes quite sense because readline which is used for prompt needs a terminal to work reasonably

1903933
double	int
it is bad programming to put a double into an int imho

1903936
key-value	key
you can create a series of queries to checked for changes to tables matched on the key updates or missing the key-value additions

1903940
any	set
is set to true along with any other debugging options

1903951
json	xml
i want my .app to output xml by default json if requested via the format parameter would be fine

this would be necessary only if the op had done something like overrides setattr and or getattr -- in which case the op is not the innocent enquirer we took him for

1905593
getattr	setattr
the setattr call should be followed by return-value .so that it doesn t fall through to return getattr ....

1905597
getter	setter
both department and departmentid will have setter and getter methods

1905622

i get the same error but only for columns with its default-value set to any value except the default

1905727
32-bit	64bit
now on the other hand if you don t need to develop 64bit windows-applications you probably don t you can just use the officially provided compiled 32-bit qt libs for vs2008 and save yourself multiple hours building qt

1905727
32-bit	64bit
i ve experienced no difficulties myself using 32-bit qt on 64bit windows with visual-studio 2008

1905788
reserved-words	keyword
i am sending you the list of microsoft reserved-words please checked you are using reserved keyword that s why you are facing this problem

1905789

what you could then do is have an arrays of all css properties you want to test and simply loops them through a function of your own that gets the css properties for everything using forementioned methods depending on which browser

1905806
z-index	overlay
the easiest way to do this would be with an overlay -- an absolutely-positioned that covers the entire page and has a high z-index

1905833

put	get
having not used core-animation myself i can t get more specific. put them in a single view hosting that layer hierarchy and use core-animation to perform the slider transitions

1905848
markup	xhtml
for markup i would suggest html 4 or xhtml 1.0 1.1

1905848
jquery	dojo	javascript-framework	dojo
as for the proper xmlhttprequest i would suggest as others did in their answers using jquery or any other javascript-framework dojo prototype and .so on to take care of doing the right thing on each browser

i think you should only use the keyproperties and skip the properties attributes for the properties that belong to the primary key

1905897
selection	cell
is there any way to detection a cell selection change in a jtable

1905928
value	field
this field could checked for duplicates value ignoring the case

1905928

this would lead to case-insensitive comparison for unique value in the custom field

1905938
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i managed to solve the problem after adding a dummy uiviewcontroller that is the only subviews in the uiwindow

1905939
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the general rules is that anything which is new to html5 is and will be supported by firefox safari google-chrome webkit and opera

1905941
value	field
is the source data for the report arranged in such a way that you could defined a second datasource which looks up the field value for parameters 1-4 and returns them as a single row to which you could then refer in the report using the first syntax

1905946
markup	xhtml
considering the fact that xhtml has it s limited browser compatibilities there s no reason to code strictly with this markup especially if you can have the same functionality look-and-feel using a tried and tested markup such as html 4.01

1905946
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
furthermore test all your code on opera firefox msie safari and google-chrome to get the best feel for true cross-browser compatibilities this will help you determine the best markup for the job at hand

decompile all the classes put all the java files order in the proper hierarchy directory for package etc. and then add them as the source of the original jar by right click the jar file - java source attachment - external folder

1905991
configuration	logging
one thing to bear in mind is that whilst your configuration will handle logging at different levels you may be causing heavy overhead in your log call

1906013
sql-server-express	sql-server
sql-server-express has some limitations but if your project reaches the scale where that becomes an issue hopefully it will be generator enough traffic revenue to support an upgrade to a non-free sql-server product

1906033
spaces	output
it will rendering the tags but with a blank spaces inside .so they won t output anything on the browser

1906035

1906252
selected	button
this button image is already selected according focused and pressed state thanks to this xml

1906271
for-loop	arrays
what i did next was i declare a pointers in the for-loop starting with the pointers p1 which went through every item in the arrays until it reached pointers p2 - printing item s value

1906278
dex	jar
.when i compile my application in dex file with the dex.bat tool it s take a very long time because of the conversion of the jar libs into dex format

1906278

i am using mpmovieplayer in my application.i have a button for playing movie witch has an image of play.but .when mpmovieplayer plays movie i can see that button on movie player s overlying controlls like .when i pause movie i see my play button instead of movie player s default button.also i have customized navigation bar and i can see that navbar .when movie plays instead of default nav bar.i tried hiding button .when playing movie but it didn t worked.does someone knows about this issue

1906293
malloc	free
you could wrap all your call to free and malloc with your own functions in which you also supply for instances in which file and at what line numbers each allocation is done

1906295
configuration	logging
you can always fallback on writing it out for yourself using something like new stack-trace .tostring but i m guessing the reason you ask is you want this to be configurable in the logging configuration

1906298
contains	set
in the set each item contains the screens properties

1906308
listbox	textbox
now i have an issue regarding some textbox es bound to this listbox i want whenever the selecteditem in the listbox is equals to a specific value valueforenabled the textbox es to be enabled otherwise they should be disabled

1906318
bubble-sort	quicksort
for this i was going to use quicksort and bubble-sort

1906327
bubble-sort	quicksort
no because quicksort is demonstrably better than a bubble-sort in all but a very few set of circumstances involving extremely small dataset

1906327
insertion-sort	selection-sort	insertion-sort	bubble-sort	selection-sort	bubble-sort
or compare bubble-sort to a selection-sort or insertion-sort both o n 2

1906334
bubble-sort	quicksort
comparing quicksort and bubble-sort is probably not a good idea

1906334
bubble-sort	quicksort
bubble-sort even may not beat quicksort on small cases

1906337
put	get
similarly put and delete should be safe to repeat if you get an error back or the network connection timeout

1906338
value	field
how do i access hidden value field from the controllers class

1906338
value	field
my hidden value field is

to declare and use the pointers correctly you al.so have to know that the subscript operators bind before the dereference operators .so parentheses are needed

1906523
asp.net-mvc	webforms
both asp.net-mvc and webforms by experts

1906534
datagridview	listview
.so i have read that i should use a listview or datagridview

1906542
stderr	stdout
also i took the liberty to send the warning and notice messages to stderr rather than stdout thinking you probably want to separate those

1906544
superclass	inherited
now i thought the altered _paddingx and _paddingy value in the inherited class would bubble up to the superclass

1906552
updating	updates
updating this is a real pain since after we updates the database the outdated software is likely to break due to database changes

1906552
updating	updates
i am to write an updating service which will be able to updates the whole product - updates the database reinstall service and applications

1906557
arrays	loops
if this doesn t give you the output you want or your arrays is too big to copy and expand or you have some other reason for not liking the proposed solution then i fear that you will have to write a loops to write the output a line at a time and use low-level file-writing functions

1906563
textbox	button
in silverlight application .when a textbox or button has the focus if the users press the keyboard shortcuts ctrl + y ctrl + to get the zoom browser this funcionallity doesn t work

1906586
asp.net-mvc	webforms
afaik there is no difference in worrying about memory in asp.net-mvc and webforms

1906594
internet-explorer	firefox
sure you may find a way to do it in internet-explorer using activex or in firefox using an extension but you still need to stop and think if this is the right thing to do

about the security it is more or less as secure as the whole server is but you should make sure your private-key is hidden outside the document-root of the webserver

1906669
key-value-coding	kvc
you can look for kvc key-value-coding in cocoa for detailed explanation on this topic

1906669

contains	any
any common field in .post and images would be move to content perhaps title or date and those original tables would then only contains information specific to a .post or image perhaps body or resolution

1906861
primitive	int
how much depends on the java implementation but since int is a class and byte a primitive types it could be significant

1906878
administration	account
if it is vista server 2008 then adding worker account into administration grouping won t work due to uac

1906894

just add a contains elements around and change the height of that instead but don t add any padding or margins to that

1906896
dbd	dbi
how can i fetch the last row that was insert using dbi dbd mysql

1906905
contains	set
for instances for the key set 1 2 3 the possible key combinations are 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 however the index need only contains the key 3 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 since for example the document matching the key 1 2 could be obtained with a query for startkey 1 2 null and endkey 1 2 the numbers of index entries will be 2 n-1 numbers of key

1906935
put	get
.when i put it in .somewhere at random i get the error expression expected however .when i look at the examples i am working from they do not look like expression .so i am very confused

1906994
value	field
that is i d like the field s value to appear as text in display mode but in their widget .when in edit add mode

1906994
value	field
where render_field would either return the field s html widget or just the value as text based on the mode

1907011
subclassing	inherited
the as.sociations should be defined in the parent class .so they can be inherited by the subclassing

1907012
key-value	key
if the containers contains a key-value pair such as map please specify whether cadapt is needed for the key or the value

1907046
firefox	opera
haven t tried it in firefox or opera

1907046
firefox	safari
you can quickly hide the options again by using the blur focus methods in the ondblclick event and if this methods works in firefox and safari i still think it s the best solution considering most people don t double click selected boxes

1907050
directdraw	direct3d
as directdraw is now deprecated it s maybe preferable to use the direct3d functions

1907050
direct3d	directx
you can checked the validity of this code by forcing the software rendering in the directx control panels by checkeded the software only checkedbox in the direct3d tab

1907091
debugging	trace
the good old debugging with trace approach may help you having a rough idea of where the problem is

1907095
any	set
you can use any instances of tooltip to set a tooltip - you may find it easier to create a new instances of tooltip rather than re-using the one on the form

1907101
onmousedown	onmouseup
onclientclick onmousedown and onmouseup will not help you to prevent the selectbox from opening

1907110
contains	set
you don t need it because you have the object contains the data and i d assume a small set of core functions and all the more extensive functionality can be implements as free functions instead of in a dereived class

1907131
httpwebrequest	webrequest
we are wondering how to use httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse .net class in atl c++ project is their any interface exposed for webrequest class in c++ currently we cannot have a c# project .so we are looking for alternative interface

1907132
decimal-point	digits	digits	short
the short answer a computer represents a float with a limited numbers of bits which is often done with mantissa and exponent .so only a few bytes are used for the significant digits and the others are used to represent the positioning of the decimal-point

1907140
arrays	loops
inside that loops i m comparing cell of an arrays

1907142
observers	listener
this may seem a bit complex but the benefit is that the observable class doesn t need to know what exact other object are listening to it which is why observers are sometimes called listener

1907151
32-bit	64bit
much later we got 32-bit and 64bit cpus and the need to distinguish between int of different lengths

1907161
arrays	loops
if you re already in a loops which is increment i then increment i in the arrays access expression as well would mean that each loops iterator would increment i twice

1907171
double	int
as for int and double being added the int gets turned into a double immediately then the above applies

1907180
attributes	properties
now decorator your types s properties with a typesconverter attributes

1907182
python	c++
what s the way to do in python the following in c++

1907205

1907225
swing	swt
if you used swing and now you want to start with swt this book show you the difference swt eye for the swing guy

1907233
constructor	object
you can create an raii object that call addsink in the constructor and removesink in the destructor to make this pattern exception-safe

1907262
children	tree
tree root is first row without parent and there is always order that parent is declare before its children

1907274
membership	guid
i m assuming you will have a table to store the event details related on the userid which is a guid in the asp.net membership default provider

1907296
python	java	python	c++
the advantage of this approach is that all applications - java c++ python appear the same in an strace .so it s easy to spot bad behavior

1907297
any	set
treat me as a noob starting from beginning to end how should the uiview and uiscrollview be set up in ib to allow any touches to be passed and what code should i put into where

1907312
getter	setter
is there a better standards way to create getter and setter in java

1907312
getter	setter
it is quite verbose to have to explicit defined getter and setter for each variables

1907318
boolean	int
instead expression in the java programming language that operate on boolean value are compiled to use value of the java virtual-machine int data types

1907318
boolean	int
the above implies although i may have misinterpreted it that the int data types is used .when operating on boolean but this is a 32-bit memory construct

1907318
boolean	int
why is a byte or short types not used as the proxy for a boolean instead of int

1907335
where-clause	sql
in sql mssql oracle etc. whatever .when joining tables what is the gain from adding a filtering to the join statement instead of having it in the where-clause

1907338
python	java
i haven t checked the extensibility of existing cmses for google-app-engine but if there is any of them that supports plugins i would like to know how they did it and whether they are javascript plugins only or if they support python java plugins too

1907340
sip	rtp
as sip is only use for session initiation you ll also need a libs for audio-streaming an rtp libs

1907347
getter	setter
most ides provide a shortcut for generator the code eclipse right click - source - generator getter setter although i realise this is probably not the answer you are looking for

1907347
tapestry	spring
.some inversion-of-control frameworks allow you to annotations properties .so that they can be used in the context of the framework tapestry inversion-of-control and the latest spring i think but this use is limted to use by the framework

1907350
groovy	java
groovy does generator them for you but no dice in standards java

1907355
scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java
some people are looking at alternative java sibling languages such as groovy or scala

1907368
where-clause	sql
a foreign key is used to maintain referential integrity while a where-clause is used to join tables together in a sql operation such as a selected

1907373
getter-setter	getter	getter-setter	setter	getter	setter
with netbeans just start typing get or set where the getter-setter is to be replace and call up autocomplete ctrl+space it ll give you the option to generator the getter or setter

1907382
getter	setter
another if you have a lot of object that need this is to write your own code-generation tool that takes a base-class and produces a wrapper with getter and setter

1907382
getter	setter
imo behavior classes with getter and setter are a code-smell

1907409
factors	primes
one of the issues about this that makes it difficult is that primes can not be broken down into factors

1907412
c++	lua
without integration multithreading into lua which isn t that hard lua is already prepare for it your only solution is to handle the signals in c++

1907412
c++	lua
if you need to notify lua you can always use a callback save it in the registry handle the signals in c++ and run the callback

1907413
arrays	loops
im tunning this loops and what to populate teh arrays withteh output of my methods im not sure about that last part arrays2db i i how shold i do this

1907435

you do it just as with any other .app set up your webserver to listen on ports 81 then set squid on the same machine make it listen on 80 and forwarding to 81

1907442
oracle	mysql
however the following table should be used as a mapping between datatype in oracle and mysql

1907442
oracle	mysql
oracle and mysql compared data types comparing data types

1907442
oracle	mysql
the main difference as explained here and here is that oracle numbers datatype is variable-length format while mysql decimal n datatype used to be represented as strings that required one byte per digits or sign character before versioning 5.0.3

1907452
uniq	comm
comm -12 sort first.txt | uniq sort second.txt | uniq

1907455
getter	setter
if you have lots of object with lots of boolean then you can use bit-fields that are managed via your getter and setter

1907492
sqldatasource	gridview
i know this is easy with an sqldatasource control but i lack that luxury and i am having trouble switching from my itemtemplates in the gridview to the edittemplates .when i fire the gridview s edit event

1907492
databound	gridview
the gridview is databound .when a dropdownlistfor index changes which gives me the mod_id for the query

1907499
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	radio-button	button	textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
you could just have a radio-button list and then .when other is selected in the event set the textbox enabled otherwise disable it if it isn t the other button

1907500
web-services	security
also if you understand french read the excellent magazine la security des web-services

1907509
entity-framework	nhibernate
the one main difference between them is that entity-framework is a bit more database focused and nhibernate is a bit more object focused

1907537
.war	jar
i fixed it by copying the jar file inside the .lib folder project .war web-inf .lib

1907548
primitive	int
i m working with an existing object framework that uses special value to represent null for primitive int datetime long

1907548
subclassing	accessor
i thought about subclassing the datatable and datarow but the base classes don t allow overrides of the accessor

1907557
multiplication	transpose
the second one consist of transpose the matrix b first and then do the multiplication by rows

1907570
put	get
stick it inside a function definition and put an yield output_part in-place of the output.append line to get a usefull interator

1907586
contains	elements
you can use contains to selected the elements

1907604
order	add
currently i simply add new properties to orderinfo class while adding new order

1907619
show	next
cryptanalysis of the winapi guid generator show that since the sequences of v4 guids is pseudo-random given the initial state one can predict up to the next 250 000 guids returned by the function uuidcreate

1907640
execution	jobs
is there a way to prevent jobs from execution .when the it is first registered

1907646
widget	button
however i can t get swtbot to find this button widget dialog box

1907668
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
malloc free calloc realloc

1907670
directory	folder
myapp is the iis directory in which the folder controllers is.

1907683
sequences	subset
let fk be a subset of the heading of r2 such that there exists a possibly empty sequences of attributes renamings that maps k into k say where k and fk contains exactly the same attributess

1907710
font-size	height	background-color	font-size	background-color	height
best bet place a second textarea with identical settings font-size line height padding... but different styling no background-color no borders to the left of your original textarea

1907716
malloc	free
from your list you ve missed new and delete - some say never to use malloc and free

1907736
python	ruby
if it was written in python ruby or had an abstraction in either language that would be great

1907741
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
malloc free calloc and realloc are all probably more advanced than what you need to worry about

1907742
getter	setter
that s the work of the ide to generator repetitive verbose code as getter setter

1907753
hide	show
that would allow your existing controls to be ignorant of the refreshing stage and allow incapsulation of the progress-visualization inside the adorner and the chunks of code that is required to show hide the adorner layer

1907765
value	field
now .when i click outside of this input onblur i get the field types changes to text again and the value restores to passwd

1907765
value	field
and if the field is click again onfocus my text types input again becomes passwd and the value is back to

1907772
google-chrome	firefox
in this case after click add new button ie will give exception-handling unknown runtime error while google-chrome and firefox will work

1907782
python	php
that is of course difficult since trac is written in python and our site in php

1907814
getter	setter
i ve scoured the .net and found some solutions however it is hard to distinguish which is the correct latest ..net 3.5 way given the colourful history of getter setter and managed-c++

1907826
constructor	private	constructor	object
the widget object would have instance-variables a constructor and public private methods just like in any other oo langauge e.g widget.js would look like

1907831
long-integer	zero
0l specifies a long-integer with value zero

1907860
malloc	free
first of all you should never delete a malloc ed pointers and never free a pointers created with new

1907860
memset	calloc
calloc similar to new + memset allocates memory on the heap sets it to zero

1907860
realloc	free
realloc attempts to resize a block of memory or creates a new block block of memory and copies the old data free ing the old pointers

1907868
sorted	lookup
normally i would use vlookup but the pitfall is that i want to lookup a numbers in a column from a table that is sorted on an other column

1907868
sorted	lookup
vlookup can only lookup things on the sorted column itself

1907868
macros	vba
i could write some vba could to go through the table but i don t want to do that because of annoying macros warnings and because excel on mac doesn t support vba anymore

1907885
bison	yacc
i always recommend this page to people who want to learn lex yacc or flex bison

1907892
credentials	account
however the op is correct that the del.icio.us service returns a 401 using code as show above verified with my own account and i am providing the correct credentials

1907893
silverlight	wpf
wpf browser applications run with isolated permissions much like a silverlight browser application

1907898

it looks like the per-user autoplay preferences what corresponds to the autoplay control panels in windows-vista and 7 are kept under hkey_current_user software windows currentversion explorer autoplayhandlers userchosenexecutehandlers

1907910
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
qt python binding pyqt is a flexible and mature framework that can certainly do that take a look at qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene for example

1907913
wsimport	xjc
wsimport uses xjc from jaxb to create java files and the documentation here indicates that changing the character encoding in the xml file should suffice although i have not tried this

1907915
selected	button
all the magic is done by 3 javascript functions which i bind to various events like button click jqueryui tab selected etc

1907923
registration	login
i might suggest you start with a tabbarcontroller and if the username passwd is not set the active viewcontroller execute presentmodalviewcontroller animated to display the login registration viewscontrollers in modal mode hidding the underliying tabbarcontroller

1907927
innodb	sphinx	innodb	myisam	myisam	sphinx
though it can be configure to talk to mysql automatically sphinx is really a separate tool to myisam or innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
otherwise you can take a hybrid approach with myisam and innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
put all your canonical data in the proper innodb tables and just use myisam for storing fulltext searchbait

1907927
innodb	myisam
you then have to make sure you updates the myisam tables from any new text insert into the innodb tables after a successful transactional

1907927
myisam	sphinx
whilst the lack of transactional support in myisam risks occasionally making the data inconsistent in concurrent or error conditional a danger that obviously also applies to the separate fulltext store solution like sphinx lucene et al that s not a big problem in reality as it s only the searchbait that becomes inconsistent and not your actual data

1907927
myisam	sphinx
it s not quite up to sphinx s speed but way way ahead of myisam fulltext in features eg

1907931
google-chrome	firefox
no problem in firefox and google-chrome also

1907934
multiplication	addition
just .something for you to try but this would only make a difference for large matrix seperate out your addition logic from the multiplication logic in the inner loops like .so

1907934
multiplication	addition
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible .so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loops than you would in the multiplication loops

1907942
xquery	xslt
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1907951
xquery	xslt
xslt and xquery do two different things

1907951
xquery	xslt
xslt actually relies on the functionality of xquery take a look at the tutorials on www.w3schools.com

1907968
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
as far as the malloc free calloc realloc these are just functions like any other cmd in these particular cases functions include in the stdlib

1907981
primitive	int
to make things more complex there is the fact that the solution should work with standards methods constructor and also .when typesb is a primitive types like string or int

1908007
ruby-on-rails	grails
do you know if there s an equivalent in grails to asp.net-mvc s html.renderaction also found in ruby-on-rails as cell

1908031
text-editor	editor
good editor if you have a small set of users you should have a look at xstandard i found that by far the coolest rich text-editor available

1908045
associations	model
a join model lets you hold extra information against the associations between two other model

1908045
associations	model
if you don t want a join model then you could use a simple has_and_belongs_to_many associations

1908065
autotools	cmake	autotools	gnu
two popular building systemd are gnu autotools and cmake

1908065
autotools	gnu
gnu autotools is very complex made up of many different utilities and has a steep learning curve but there is plenty of documentation available for it online

1908065
autotools	gnu
gnu autotools cannot do that

1908073
salesforce	force.com
you can also negotiate with salesforce over the pricing but afaik there are not people building mass market applications based off of force.com largely because of these issues

1908079
express-checkout	shopping-cart	express-checkout	paypal	shopping-cart	paypal
we re trying to have paypal express-checkout payment for a shopping-cart for a live website

1908081
defined	declare
there s actually no keyword to declare and defined an actual state machine

1908081
defined	declare
it follows naturally that you can now declare your events in a header and defined them in a .cpp file

1908085
32-bit	64bit
by default calculations are done on the 80-bit long-double types and only rounded to something like a 64bit double or 32-bit float upon request

1908099
.when	ready
.when i m logging on to my development machine locally i would normally like a hosts of applications to be started automatically outlook various notification-area apps but .when i m using terminal-services to connect it usually means i m on call and dealing with an issue and i want my systemd ready to go as soon as possible

1908121
value	field
.when i .post a form using dojo.xhr.post i get all the field in my form .posted except for the value of my dojox.checkedmultiselect no matter what options are selected

1908123
postgresql	mysql
the razorsql sql gui tool supports postgresql and mysql

1908127
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
i guess that the two unsigned members of the struct are 16-bit and the long align is 32-bit or two 32-bit members in the struct and 64bit for the long

1908157
32-bit	64bit
if you follow those step it should theoretically fix your problem which sounds like it s caused by a mix of 32-bit and 64bit software

1908158
express-checkout	paypal
.when you use the express-checkout the user is directed to the paypal website and selected which address they want to use and that is returned

1908194
endpoint	uri
in my wcf service i only want 1 endpoint 1 uri however i want this uri to be able to handle multiple types of request

1908203
semantics	keyword
êžé ä u s answer is the shortest though it has slightly different semantics than yours in that yours will provide an explicit empty string arguments if the key is missing from the dictionary while êžé ä u s will omit the keyword arguments altogether

1908231
contains	set
i set up sub_test sub_test.sql to contains the double-ats

1908238
gitignore	git-add
alternatively git-add -a will make sure that the index reflects the current state of the working directory unless you have any suggestions in your gitignore file

1908241
value	field
how can i make solr php client to know that i have to search in multiple field and for multiple value or

1908249
turbogears	django
i ve move from turbogears 1.0 to django

1908269
python	c++

1908272
margins	padding
it has margins padding applied to it

1908273
directory	folder
the function below returns all folder in a given directory down to multiple levels

1908273
directory	folder
i only need one level depth though just folder in the target directory no subfolder

1908273
directory	folder
how can i modify the function to return only the folder named of the given directory

1908276
lookup	any
i edited this to account for .when the lookup value is smaller than any of the value in the list

1908288
web-config	app-config
and then reference that file from your service s app-config or web-config

1908288
web-config	app-config
this actually works for any configuration section but not for configuration section grouping in your web-config app-config

1908291
put	get
i prefer to use google-analytics since it would save me a lot of work but i would use another scripting or put in original code to get the following

1908305
python	java
this does mean however that you probably aren t getting as much benefit from threads in python as you would in java or many other languages

1908318
push	pull
in my case my push provider pull rows from a db table and send them at the time specified

1908334
digits	base
how can i combine multiple images such as base image with logo and numbers of digits images to display graphical counter with pageviews count updates dynamically

1908351
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
what if on your implementation unsigned and are each 32-bit and long is 128 bits or more realistically 16-bit and 64bit

1908364
margins	padding
the margins padding and border are in addition to the width of the object

1908366
jsonp	ajax
you can t make an ajax request unless you use jsonp to a url in another domain

1908366
callback	methods
jsonp gets around this by loading up a script-tag with your url as the src and having the webserver respond with a bit of code wrapped around the json result that execute a callback to your javascript methods

1908368
dynamic-dispatch	overrides
field access is not subject to dynamic-dispatch like methods access field cannot be overrides

1908368
subclassing	superclass
subclassing the field in the superclass

1908379
ruby	php
also supports many dynamic-languages like ruby and php

1908390
put	get
you can put into firebug or whatever console you re using to get a list of matching elements

1908391
revision	svn
.when files are deleted from as svn repository they can still be accessed by users checked out old revision

1908397
ruby	php
if on the otherhand you are doing php or ruby and actually need an ide then id recommend eclipse at least for php and ruby-on-rails

1908399
constructor	private
your constructor is not declare as public .so by default in c# it is private

1908403
svnadmin	dump
in the meantime your only recourse is to svnadmin dump your repository then pipe the dumpfile through svndumpfilter excluding the bad path into an svnadmin load cmd

1908405
constructor	private
however your constructor is private .so that won t work either

1908411
python	c++
i know python and c++

1908441
hide	show
you can toggle show hide with the toggle function

1908450
arrays	loops
you will have to create another arrays and manually copy elements with a loops

1908452
put	get
the default operation of your browser is to put the value in the get form in the query-string

1908452
put	get
instead of submission a get request submit as a put because you don t need a .post you can do this with javascript with a friendly degrade to .post and redirect to a get

1908454
value	field
does it depend on the scenario and the intuitiveness between a field and its value

1908455
getter	setter
this expects a properties bill_sent with a getter and setter in the billdoc bean

1908460
arrays	loops
this code can loops through a few time and there will be at most 3 to addresses in the string arrays - the first time it is run it s fine - but then the second loops through it hang on

1908481
hide	show
another option is to use the show and hide methods

1908486
filehandle	pipe
that doesn t work on windows well maybe it does in 5.10 but you can use the 4-arg selected call to see if there is input on a socket before you attempt to read it and in windows 4-arg selected only works on sockethandles not on filehandle or pipe

1908491
attributes	properties
this works because that attributes specifically is a read write boolean properties for elements

1908497
winlogon	gina
once you create the proper gina dll you can register it here hkey_local_machine software windows-nt currentversion winlogon ginadll

1908498
double	int
javascript doesn t have int all numbers are actually double

1908499
double-quotes	spaces
i added double-quotes around your bgcolor parameter added a spaces before your first line continuation character added double-quotes and ampersands around your a href txtlink.value

1908500
vba	vb6
and since vba vb6 doesn t have shared methods it doesn t really matter if you prefix with me or not

1908501
value	field
i wrote an .app once that had a gender field in the database with 0 or 1 because in the .application layer i had an enum that m.apped gender.female and gender.male to the 0 and 1 value respectively

1908519
children	nodes
finally the question is there any way to updates this table in a set-based manner .so all quantities are updatess with bottom-up summed quantities of children nodes

1908524
double	int
ipv4 uses only 32-bit addresses .so javascript should be fine using double which gives you an 52bit int part

1908532
rtsp	sdp
it s an online radio streaming rtsp in the sdp format

1908560
entity-framework	ado.net
use ado.net data service we are using entity-framework for o r mapping

1908585
user-interface	drawing
there are a few limited well-defined exception-handling the opt-in threaded drawing introduced in snow leopard but the general rules is to not run user-interface code on another thread

1908601
libavcodec	ffmpeg	libavformat	libavcodec	libavformat	ffmpeg
if you are wanting to display the frame or perform some other process on them you may want to use libavformat and libavcodec main parts of the ffmpeg project to extraction the video frame in code

1908601
libavformat	libavcodec
here is a pretty good tutorial on how to get frame from a video using libavcodec and libavformat

1908601
libavformat	libavcodec
libavformat and libavcodec are c libs .so i would use c or c++ if you want to interface directly to them

1908601
environment	building
ffmpeg will not building on msvc++ as per the documentation .so you would have to set up a mingw environment

1908603
command-pattern	mvvm
i m working on a wpf .app and i understand command-pattern pretty well but i ve found that there are several different implementation of command-pattern for mvvm

1908616
row	col
most grid use a syntax such as mygrid row col to reference a particular cell programatically

1908631
google-chrome	firefox
here s the code that i used to make it work in ie firefox and google-chrome

1908633
constructor	object
you could use copy constructor in your object where you pass in the source and manually copy the field of it to the destination

1908648
document	editing
trac provides a wiki platform for collaborative document editing in addition to general project-management support

1908699
arrays	loops
assuming to_add is an arrays of addresses you don t need to loops through it adding them

1908707
vb.net	vb6
i have vb6 dll which i am referencing in vb.net i am calling the following function in it

1908730
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitableview	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
the uitableview is inside a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller all of which are being created programatically

1908733
csv	xml
xslt is designed to take one xml document and transform it into something else csv html or a different xml format xhtml

1908733
xquery	xslt
both xquery and xslt rely heavily on xpath

1908733
xquery	xslt
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language .when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908733
xquery	xslt
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt

1908743
profiling	debugging
if you want to know this for debugging optimizing reasons look for a memory profiling

1908746
directory	folder
depends what you re looking to do exactly - you could create a virtual directory underneath your site that maps to the directory hence the folder will seamlessly slot in as if it was located in your application sites directory

1908755
debugging	trace
i have also turned on log4net debugging and set system.diagnostics to write the trace to a file

1908769
deployment	install
is mdac microsoft data-access components install with the same versioning in the deployment environment as in the dev environment

1908778
abstract-class	subclassing
either it is an abstract-class which you must subclassing and provider the implementation for a specific methods which the controllers will call whenever it needs its data

1908785
sql-server	mysql	hsqldb	mysql
as i said if hsqldb is smart like mysql or sql-server it will narrow the search by the intcol and then only compare at most a few value by the uuid

1908788
python	c++
embed python object into your c++ qt

1908788
installation	building
building installation instructions for windows is near the bottom of the page

1908793
capacity	storage
the upsides and downsides of each .approach is based on how you re passing the uuids around your .app -- if you re passing them around as their string-equivalents then the downside of requiring double the storage capacity for the varchar 36 .approach is probably outweighed by not having to convert them each time you do a db query or updates

1908806
selected	button
if the user selected the + button again another uitextfield is added to the next row

1908826
triggers	insert
is there more recomended way of determining cmd types in the triggers then testing deleted and insert tables

1908847
value	field
i want to get the field named value for them .so i can get data from the database

1908847
value	field
i have to do it .when it iterates the document and not .when it iterates the field and value

1908871
selection	highlight
this will however probably produce many false positives because you can t distinguish between an ordinary selection and a search and it won t work with browsers that do not use an ordinary selection to highlight search results

1908876
xquery	xslt
the majority of the functionality of xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 overlap and for the most part they are similar languages with different syntax a little like c# and vb

1908876
xquery	xslt
xslt is a lot more verbose but its templating features add a lot of functionality that can be fairly cumbersome to replicate in xquery particularly making small changes to nodes tree

1908876
xquery	xslt
unless you are using the static-typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1908892
system.web	.net
the only place possibly to be careful around it is the system.web namespace as i believe .net 4 has a client .profile install which basically means if you use this install it will only install things expected to be used on a client

1908904
directory	folder
note that you can selected an existing folder or create a new one to contains the content for the virtual directory

1908904
selected	checkbox
selected the checkbox for the access permissions that you want to assign to your users

1908907
contains	any
any instances members are not guaranteed to be thread safe. it contains only instances methods

1908909
registration	login
i am building a web application from scratch that has registration and login functionality

1908915
abstract	extends
concreteitem is just a simple class that extends abstractitem which is abstract

1908922
toggleclass	addclass	toggleclass	removeclass	removeclass	addclass
jquery has functions toggleclass removeclass and addclass

1908925
perl	php
in perl you can trap such errors with eval is there anything equivalent in php

1908939
jquery	.post	jquery-dialog	.post	jquery-dialog	jquery
then to delete a recording you could have a jquery-dialog box and if the user presses ok use the jquery ajax functions to .post the required details to delete.php which would then carry out the deletion

1908940
selection	highlight
however firefox will use the dom selection .when highlight text from a ctrl+f

1908971
profiling	trace
use the sql profiling tool and run a trace

1908997
itemtemplate	gridview
there also exists itemtemplate elements for greater control of the gridview

1908999
entity-framework	ado.net
i would love to use an ado.net entity-framework types solution but i believe the compatible data providers only work with db2

1909017
python	php
isolate the raw html from your php in the header and footer in a simple templating language if possible and write python and php interfaces to your templating language

1909031
jndi	jmx
you can configure jbosscaching instancess using jboss service descriptors and your ejb can then lookup the caching instances from jmx jndi

1909049
callback	methods
for instances if a methods uses a callback using a lambda for that callback means you don t have to defined a real function somewhere to handle it

1909051
constructor	object
i agree with mark that the way to go is to inject individual fine-grained object into the constructor as required

1909075
put	get
as strawberry says jade doesn t put any restrictions on your database use .so long as you can get at it from java

1909075
firebird	mysql
i ve also used firebird which doesn t suffer from any annoying commercial free fork like mysql does

1909077

1910062
any	set
there does not appear to be any way to set the flag using visual-studio .net it looks like they encourage people to compile for 64bit if possible instead of using the flag

1910072
.when	ready

callback	methods
one clean way of coding this is to pass in an object that has a callback methods that takes a result set

1910081
callback	methods
your other methods creates the object with the callback methods with it s resultset handling code and passes that to the methods that execute the sql

1910084
put	get
i d like to put the wrapper divs in a control .so that i can use them in a .aspx view page and not have to look at all the mess required to make fancy corners shadow but still get the benefit of seeing the results in the designer

1910089
vbscript	jscript
asp with jscript is 100 time better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910092
entity	poco
i have created poco domain object that map to the entities in the entity domain model

1910094
contains	any
to begin with you are right how the wsdl is formed and what it contains has nothing to do with any ssl layer concern

1910094
ssl-certificate	ssl
it is not very common but .some clients do like to checked that the fingerprint of the ssl-certificate of the remote party matches a known fingerprint .so that they can feel safe that their systemd will fail if .some has found a very clever way of masquerading as your ssl secured site

1910107
ubuntu	linux

i get different value from prototype s cumulativeoffset function in internet-explorer 8 and firefox 3.5 within a complex layout with several elements having padding and margins

1910124
one-to-many	entity
it seems to me that .when you use relationships in hibernate jpa that using relationships like one-to-many can have a performance boost on reads because only one database call would need to be run to get a parent entity and all children entities

1910129
callback	methods
.so you need to pass an object on which to make a callback into this methods

1910142
fish	zsh
note that in some shell you need to quote like zsh and fish

1910156
entity	pojo
we tried using hibernate s dom4j and pojo entity modes in the same application a while ago

i d recommend using hibernate with your pojos and use something like xstream or raw dom4j for doing your xmlserializer to and from the pojos

1910173
click	mouse
i have created a mouse event handler that gives me the screens coordinate x y on a right click of the mouse

1910180

google-code	bitbucket
i d suggest you make a commitment to hop over to github bitbucket or project hosting on google-code regularly and query for django project

1910206
configuration	environment
svn none of the environment variables svn_editor visual or editor is set and no editor-cmd runtime configuration option was found

1910230
attributes	properties
if you don t specify the properties in command-line svn will try to open your editor to let you modify attributes

1910242
contains	any
i would look then for any variables that contains the string termination character either or depending on how the string starts

1910244
value	field
if first named is a required field in your database and the import file doesn t havea value for one of the recordinging either add a default-value unknown or don t try to insert the recording

1910249
any	set
it s more accurate to say that they start from a base set of object frequently called gc roots and will collect any object that can not be reached from a root

1910249
contains	any
.so in your case once the local-variables a b and c go out of scoping at the end of your methods there are no more gc roots that contains directly or indirectly a reference to any of your three nodes and they ll be eligible for garbage-collection

1910251
.when	ready
.when you re ready to search for your cartoon figures

1910269
perl	c++
notice that some of these semantics are sufficiently different than those from languages like java c++ and perl that pythonistas often prefer to use slightly different terminology

note that a data store like sql is only used during the actual credentials authentication step of the forms-authentication lifetime

1910300
lighting	quad
what i mean is a 3d world where the camera is fixed and all the textures quad are facing to the same directions the camera and between them there will be lighting points and i want the texturess to have per-pixel normals value .so they ll lit as if they were 3d model

1910309
duplicates	elements
i have a problem with removing duplicates entries from the output based on some child elements conditional

1910311
uiimage	nsdata
to get a nsdata object from a uiimage you can use one of the following functions

1910362
arrays	loops
that way you get to think about different ways to do things in assembler like passing arguments making stack frame composing address expression arrays indexing managing memory conditional loops try-catch etc

1910367
updating	updates
is it right to try updating parent object or it is needed to updates all 3 object separately

1910385
carbon	cocoa
actually a much better solution for eclipse 3.5 is to use the carbon building instead of cocoa

1910385
carbon	cocoa
cocoa seems to force a black cursor but i didn t have this problem with carbon

1910388
authentication	login
if the email-address is part of user authentication register login etc then you can perfectly combine it with the user activation systemd

1910388
activation	account
send an email with a link with an unique activation key to the specified email-address and only allow login .when the user has activated the newly created account using the link in the email

1910401
contains	elements
otherwise for instances if you want to avoid initializing elements to zero which could be unnecessary you can indeed use hstack and vstack to add an arrays contains the new elements

1910402
dictionary	arrays
i tried hashtable dictionary lists and arrayss in .net all i could get is a simple key-value arrays

1910405
google-chrome	firefox
i found the following worked in ie firefox and google-chrome pc only don t have access to a mac just now

1910408
registration	login
for one of these controls a login screens i want to be able to hide the login user-controls and then display the registration user-controls

1910409
google-chrome	safari
the website that i m currently working on is having a few issues with webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc.

1910413
attributes	properties
if you would like to use additional properties on entities you should add them as process instances attributes .so they get persistent correctely and can be accessed from the process instances context at runtime

1910514

1910585
highlight	cell
i need to quickly figure out the index of the cell to the right or left of the highlight cell grouping

1910585

in this particular case the highlight grouping is mobile and can only move to the index before or after the previous next occupied cell

1910586
getter	setter
the text function works as both a getter and a setter

1910599
selected	button
alternatively you could include the same intent-filter on an activity to have it come up as an option for the user to selected .when they press the call button

1910602
concat	where
statement concat statement union selected device_name sensor_value from table_name where sensor_value 10

1910616
scheme	lisp
and as a slightly bizarre suggestion might i suggest lisp or scheme

1910623
value	field
as of now it is passing only the field named not the value

1910651
arrays	loops
declare the new arrays before loops with the arrays constructor

1910661
value	field
however if you still want to have xml-like field in your words templates and replace them with value i would suggest using words-automation object

1910662
datagrid	listbox
it will rendering the object itself like it might show the outline of a listbox or one empty column of a datagrid but it will not show any of the other data

1910669
show	next
if i don t use dynamic-memory-allocation no malloc and instead have a variables locally declare as show below is it safe to use that variables in the called thread even after the next iterator of loops takes place

1910685
arrays	loops
to address the comment you could defined an arrays of both types outside loops or make them global

1910688
critical-section	multiprocess
on multiprocess systemd if the critical-section is unavailable the calling thread spin dwspincount time before performing a wait operation on a semaphore that is associated with the critical-section

i m trying to do the following i have only a scriptmanager and an updatepanel with empty contenttemplate on a page

1910698
protected	public
a child class inherited all the protected public and published properties functions and procedure of its parent classes

1910699
perl	php
even if perl would be faster than php the most would choose php because of the simplicity of php

1910701
fwrite	fread
to maximize speed you probably want to open the file in binary mode and use fread fwrite to copy fairly large chunks 4 megabytes of data at a time

1910708
arguments	undefined
it may or may not work depending on exactly how this all gets invoked -- realistically on most architectures with most compilers the memory pointed to by arguments will continue to be valid but you will most likely end up with multiple threads using the same myptreadarguments struct which you probably don t want the actual behavior is undefined this is only a likely outcome

1910716
instances	self
it is self in this instances .so your methods should go in the same class

1910717
assign	add
if there is more than one icons in the file particularly likely if you include it as a resource in your exe or dll you ll also need to add a comma and either a zero-based positive index numbers representing which icons you d like to use or a negative resource id using the negative of whatever id you ve assign your icons in your resource scripting

1910717
default-value	default
instead you can set the default-value for the shell key equals to the verb you d like to perform by default

1910717
command-line	cmd
process the command-line in a manner consistent with the cmd you set under the shell key

1910719
linked-list	nodes
have your cell class implements a linked-list nodes interface

1910722
calloc	malloc
.when you pass the address of .some data to a thread that data s lifetime becomes unrelated to execution of the parent thread .so your only real choice is to allocate the memory for that data in way that decouples its lifetime from execution of the parent thread -- allocate with .something like malloc or calloc

1910723
constructor	object
for example .when deserializing object new object are created without their constructor ever being called

1910726
data-warehouse	rdbms
depending on the types of data-analysis i would expect not choosing db4o and in fact probably not choosing an orm at all or it not even being important at all since a lot of data-analysis is either database intensive traditional normal-form rdbms or some data-warehouse model - kimball or inmon-style - or nosql - massively distribute non-relational - still the kings there or numerical data intensive memory data-structures signal-processing - you don t want your databases in these loops anyway

1910738
z-index	overlay
no matter what value of z-index i try i cannot overlay my html div or img elements on top of this flash animation see top left corner

1910764
web-config	app-config
and then your app-config web-config needs the following

1910808
qhash	qmap
qt also provides it s own map implementation - qmap and qhash

1910840
binary-tree	nodes
std map normally uses a balanced binary-tree which means 20 items will use 20 nodes each of which is normally allocated separately

1910859
udp	rtp
matt h mentioned that rtp over udp packets can be checksum ed .so that if they are corrupt they will get resent

1910859
udp	rtp
in asterisk for example you can enable disable checksums on your rtp over udp traffic in the rtp.conf configuration file with the following line

1910862
contains	elements
it looks like to me that there are about 2 options put the new items html in the php file that gets called by ajax and append it to the elements contains the status feed

1910871

perl	php	python	php	python	perl
the rationale behind this is that there should be relatively few matches with non-punctuation characters in-between the words .so you re still getting mysql to do the heavy lifting while your php perl python whatever code can do a more fine-grained checked on a relatively small numbers of rows

1912704
credentials	account	credentials	security
the recommended best practice would be net.tcp with transport security and windows credentials assuming all your callers are intranet-clients with an account in your corporate active-directory

1912704

is the issue that it isn t calling your callback methods

1914591
callback	methods
you have to had the callback to the .load methods

1914690
touchesmoved	gestures
as noted in the comments to the op touchesmoved can be called by just one touch of a multitouch gestures moving

1914690
touchesmoved	gestures
.so if you start a two touch gestures like a pinch but only move one finger you only get one touch in touchesmoved

1914710
dictionary	map
internally dictionary uses a hashtable while std map uses a red-black-tree .so std map is order while dictionary is unorder

and there could be some spaces between the comma and the wordss and between the start of the line and the first words

1914844
font-size	height	font-size	width
assuming you are happy recognising only a subset of html markup without css here i assume p b i br tags only plus font-size for font-size changes with other attributes ignore img tags for images with all but src width height ignore and accurate width and height mandatory with all other tags attributes ignore -

1914844
font-size	height
set up a state machine with a caret positioning at top left of page and initial font-size and formatting page numbers of 1 maximum height of glyphs images in current line of zero and empty list of page boundaries

while-loop	infinite
inside the code there is one while-loop which will run infinite for checked any data is written in the socket and call different functions accordingly and will send the results back to the sockets

1914884
execution	jobs
it appears to make the distribution and execution of new jobs quite seamless allowing the developer to concentrate on the implementation of their jobs

1914884
execution	jobs
i am wondering if anything exists in the java domain for the distribute execution of jobs that are not easily expressed as mapreduce problems

1914896
conditional-compilation	compile-time
for compile-time parameters take a look into conditional-compilation

1914900

i ve seen that happen .when the report is set up for a different paper size than the printer is expecting - ie your report is setup for a4 and the printer contains 8 1 2 x 11

1914905
user-controls	tabcontrol
instead you could change your childwindow to be a user-controls and display it in a tabcontrol

1914916
code-completion	autocomplete
.when it comes to writing code i use ctrl + spaces basic code-completion a lot to autocomplete methods namedd variables namedd etc or simply to see which methodss are available for a certain object by trying to autocomplete directly at the dot following the named of the object

output	mode
where temperature bigemdim5 is the output of emperical mode decompostion

1915007
callback	methods
whenever i need to call a callback or similar i should first open a function and then call the methods inside the function

1915046
git-branch	git-remote
with modern git you always fetch all branches as remote-tracking branches into namespace visible with git-branch -r or git-remote show origin

1915047
contains	any
likewise .when an nsmutablearray is release it also release any object contains within it

1915047

i have tried to recreate the same behavior calling in different places like viewwillappear animated viewdidload loadview navigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller animated but nothing works

1915156
firefox	safari
compatibility with safari firefox ie6 ie7

1915163
arrays	loops
after this fetching php now uses around 500 mb of ram i loops an arrays of approximately 3 500 sample object each of which has an associativity arrays size around 100 entries as one of its properties

1915167
hide	show
it seems that you re using relative positioning to hide and show the sub-menus moving from -999em to auto

1915206
tree	trie
a radix tree patricia trie tree or

1915224
version-control	cvs	environment	building
branch the code in cvs or version-control in every release and then checkout from head.also very important use a single building file and maintain a setup document to building the environment on local box

1915263
value	field
here the user needs to compare the old value along with the new but doesnâ t necessarily need to checked every single field

1915263
value	field
task crosscheck every change of every field to make sure new value are correct

1915263
value	field
in this case knowing the old value is at most a secondary task only occasionally will a user care what the field used to be

1915263
value	field
design prominently mark the field that have changed see last paragraph and show the old value as a tooltip with mouseover

1915263
value	field
task detail evaluation of how each field has changed including perhaps a long history of multiple changes for each field followed by occasionally correcting a value based on the history

1915263
value	field
you should allow the user to edit value .when in this mode and also selected a value on the history list to revert the field

1915263
value	field
saving pushes the now old value of edited field onto the list

1915263
value	field
here the user already knows or suspects which field have been changed and what the new value are but now wants to know how they got that way

1915263
value	field
design if the users generally needs to checked only one field then a menu item opens for the field that currently has focus a small windows with a grid listing the history of value who changed them .when they changed them and any other auditing information who approved it and .when

1915263
filtering	sorting
if histories tend to be long provide sorting and or filtering

1915263
selected	button	value	field
you can provide a cmd button that sets the current field value to one selected from the history grid

1915263
value	field
note that this is different from the list using tooltip in that the user is primarily interested in figuring out who and .when the field changed not in what the field should be â itâ s easier to scan through the timestamps but harder to revert a value

1915263
value	field
a menu item can revert the field to a value selected in the panels

1915263
value	field
design provide a general audit windows for any arbitrary list of field or object allowing the user to query filtering by field field value to answer â œwhen was this ever x

1915263
value	field
the audit windows show a sortable grid listing the timestamp data object or table field old value and new value and username

1915278
display	height
to get the display height of the image you will have to

1915286
associations	model
if you decide to create a join model you can iterate through entries in the join model deleting those without an associations

1915302
restart	exit	spawn	exit
in fact i am just in the middle of writing something that you may find useful a manager that spawn a few worker process and restart them if they exit killed dies

1915312
json	xml
i think it depends on how your creating your service api rest json xml wcf etc.. but here are some links that will help

1915323
silverlight	wpf
silverlight out-of-browser technology and wpf clickonce on the surface have similarities

1915324
postback	ajax
it does not ever resubmit ajax request such as those produced by updatepanel event triggers partials page postback

1915327
moss	wss
ray - as others have said you need a license for moss beyond your windows-server and tfs licenses but not wss 3.0 for tfs 2008

1915327
moss	wss
tfs 2010 does not required wss or moss at all if you have another site or portal solution flexwiki zen pivotal tracker etc

1915336
expression	evaluation
javascript doesn t bother evaluation the rest of an expression if it already knows that the result is false

1915347
order	add
i ve been using a hashtable but by nature hashtable are not order and i need to keep everything inorder as i add them because i want to pull them out in the same order

1915350
silverlight	wpf
silverlight support is fairly weak compared to wpf but it does contains the icommand interface

1915350
implements	extends
you can extends controls to give them cmd properties or implements them via an attached properties

1915352
implements	sealed
if you re wrapping an idisposable in an object the contains object itself needs to be idisposable and you need to implements the appropriate pattern either a sealed idisposable class or the messier but standards virtual pattern

1915356
superscript	subscript
if you wanted you could go ahead and generator the superscript and subscript characters and insert those instead

1915379
compatibility	platform
the big one is cross platform compatibility

1915379
silverlight	wpf
obviously wpf has a much richer toolkit than silverlight .so it may well be that silverlight just isn t an option

1915389
.when	ready
i had issues with the tag and the acrobat reader plugins the plugins would timeout and not load the report .when it was ready but that doesn t happen at all .when the browser wait for the page to load

1915403
order	add
if you don t new to retrieve by key and you add items in key order .so the collections doesn t actually have to do its .sorting this is it

1915406
configuration	installation
the installation of it is a bit of a nightmare with all the configuration options and i am sure this will confuse the customers even with documentation

1915409
hide	show
i think it best just to have three uiview references to the subviews in the parent view or view controllers all initially null then to have subroutine to hide the other two views if they are visible and either construct and show or just show the new view

1915417
sequences	unique
one solution that i came up with was to start all of our barcode with a unique sequences of characters not known to the user

1915431
input-field	textbox
or u can replace asp textbox with input-field of types text and set it s event onmouseover to the function changefocus

1915436
value	field
with dictionary field i care about key part not value .so value part may be the same between items

1915470
silverlight	wpf
wpf has a richer control tree whereas silverlight is a reduced set for compact size

1915470
silverlight	wpf
wpf required .net install locally whereas silverlight has its own platform independent browser-based runtime

1915476
haskell	python
in haskell you would do it similarly to the python versioning but the details depend on the gui libs that you use

1915510
subclassing	nsobject
in this case the class must be nsobject or a subclassing only nsproxy and its subclassinging would fail and it must also conform to both nscoding and uitableviewdelegate protocols

1915521
mouseover	mouseout
it is probably a scripting on the home about and jobs links that makes a floating div tag visible on mouseover and invisible on mouseout

1915522
return-value	return-type
to call an objective-c methods in the gdb console you have to cast the return-type since gdb doesn t really know what the return-value is

1915531
order	join
using an order by in a view also is a general no-no because if you join the view - the order by is getting execute but there s no need for it

1915534
dlopen	dlsym
i use dlopen to load the object and dlsym to get a function pointers to the shared object function

1915539
cassini	iis
why would it be different between iis and cassini

1915563
value	field
i have created a custom field for my value but only the new field named is stored and it is serialization and stored in the data column of the user table

1915577
aggregate-functions	sum
.when set to on if null value appear in aggregate-functions such as sum avg max min stdev stdevp variables variablesp or count a warning messages is generator

1915578
reflection	runtime
with regard to checkeded at runtime no you cannot checked the signature for fit because c does not support reflection

1915583
google-chrome	firefox
it s work on firefox and google-chrome but doesn t work at ie

1915586
codeigniter	pyrocms
a free cms built on codeigniter is pyrocms

1915586
codeigniter	pyrocms
unlike other cms i have seen built on frameworks pyrocms doesn t touch the core framework at all which means future upgrade of codeigniter will be easy

1915591
concatenation	comma
since comma are missing python will i think concatenation them all into one string thus giving you a list of one item

1915599
contains	set
each link #nav li a contains the nav item text plus an additional span which is set to display none by default

1915613
contains	elements
this means that currently you have an arrays that contains true or false for each elements

1915614
difference	factors
but conceptually all your doing if you solve this problem is adding one extra scale factors related to the difference between zoom 1 and the initial zoom factors desired

1915636
duplicates	contains
i have to remove duplicates email the entire line from the file one of the line contains overflow example.com in the above example

1915639
google-chrome	firefox
however since the website has to work cross-browser i am spending time looking at it in firefox google-chrome and ie

1915639
google-chrome	firefox
it looks great in google-chrome and firefox but there s something broken in ie that make the footer align to the right and cause a horizontal scroll to appear

1915650
explode	implode
you might consider using explode and implode instead of a regular expression

1915674
contains	any
a function doesn t know about its scoping in as2 - it doesn t contains any reference to it unless you add one

1915694
any	set
positioning them appropriately set any unique properties load your data etc. then .when that s all done sweep through each control arrays by index and set the visible properties on each control to true

1915699
attributes	properties
there is a further problem in ie in that properties you add are incorrectly treated as attributes

1915702
void	main
the english you quote does prohibit declaring main to return void

1915702
return-type	arguments
it is allowing variation in the arguments that come in but not in the return-type

1915707
return-type	arguments
hence the return-type must be int but you are free considering the remaining arguments you may selected between

1915722
versioning	upgrade
my experience is it can be very hard to get current customers to updates to a new versioning of a database server .when you wish them to take an upgrade of your .software .so you will most likely be forced to support sql-server 2005 for a long time if you allow your customers to use it now

1915726
png	gif
if the input image is a png or gif file my scripting is working correctly

1915739
required	checked
the problem i have is that using cevent to signals the thread seems to required a loops where you checked to see if the thread is signalsed at the end of loopss

1915744
return-type	arguments
its return-type must be int but the implementation is allowed to have different arguments types

1915755
hide	show
i have a row of links across the top of my page which are meant to act as tabs .when one is click i want its div to show and the rest to hide

1915756
hide	show
then you can either show the containers which will be as fast as can be or hide the controls and reset containers like this

1915759
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
i would like to checked the types of a superclass a against the types of a subclassing b with a methods inside the superclass a .so that b will inherited it

1915777
linux	unix
trying to access this data raises a segmentation fault at least on unix linux

1915797
private-key	rsa
i want to protect my rsa private-key with a passwd who wouldn t but the following c# fails

1915802

if article contains a categoryid field then you would be able to do it but with a many-to-many relationship table you ll need to set up the mapping

1915817
contains	elements
if elements stationnumber doesn t contains an attributes in the schemaa then is not valid

1915833
environment	restart
.so we have to specify the environment prod dev test in one of the files that ruby-on-rails loads as the application is restart

1915845
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the following code works just fine in ie firefox google-chrome and safari but i am wondering how efirefoxicient it actually is .when scale to a lot of users and whether it is accessible to screen-readers special needs users etc

1915867
version-control	git
if you run a distribute version-control systemd with easy branching git mercurial these days then you ll be able to prototype easier and refactor easier all while still having a valid working copy

1915872
pointers	stack
to perform the arbitrary function-calls i used a function pointers typesdef that took an arbitrarily large 24 numbers of arguments then using the symbols table you find the function address cast it to the function pointers types and pass it the real arguments plus enough dummy arguments to make up the expected numbers and thus create a suitable if wasteful maintain stack frame

1915879
dialog	pop-up
but i want to be able to do all cropping on my current page where i upload the image s in a pop-up div dialog

1915886
margins	padding

compact-framework	.net
scoping of .net - there is the .net-micro-framework .net compact-framework and asp.net for a few different views on how one could use .net

1915963
callback	methods
as you can see this methods allows to pass a resultsethandler which exposes a callback methods to convert resultsets into other object as describe in z5h s answer and dbutils provides several implementation just pick up the one that will suit your needs

1915969
silverlight	wpf
while working in asp.net winforms wpf silverlight or whatever you should become very familiar with the .net but most likely specific portions of it

1915986
revision	svn
is there a way to see revision changeset to a repository in tfs just like how we can see revision branches in svn using revision graphing

1915991
nested	order	order	join
what i do is assemble a monolithic subselect representing the cds order by the joined artist named then apply a limit to it and then join the nested subselects to the artist table and only then execute the resulting query

1916003
fclose	fopen
there are lots of idioms but many of them are in how you edit your code such as sort of imitating raii by writing an fopen and a matching fclose in quick succession and only afterwards writing the code in between to process the data

1916019
implements	extends
i want to have either an abstract-class or an interface that mandates the inclusion of a static methods in all of the classes that extends implements this class interface

1916019
static-class	inherited
you can try to argue that you should never need to inherited static-class methods but that is utterly wrong and i will ignore any answers that make such points

1916052
hornetq	openmq
other open source messages brokers which support the stomp protocols are openmq which is include in glassfish v3 and glassfish 2.1.1 but also works standalone and soon the jboss messages broker hornetq v2.1

1916056
slimdx	xna
since your .app is graphic intense it could be more efficient to work at a low-level read xna or even slimdx directx

1916066
sqldatasource	gridview
i bind a sqldatasource to a gridview using gridview.databind and these queries often take a significant time to execute

1916070

1916145
logout	login
i automatically purge all invalid login which have expired at each login logout attempt

1916170
slidedown	slideup
stop does work with slideup and slidedown

1916192
callback	methods
try the begininvoke and endinvoke methodss on the event delegation - these return immediately and allow you to use polling a wait handle or a callback to notify you .when the methods has completed

1916222
bluetooth	usb
another approach is to tether your phone to a pc using a usb cable bluetooth information-retrieval open a serial connection using the phone as a modem and write a program to listen for new smss using at+cgml as describe here

1916252
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and safaria but doesn t in ie7

1916256
png	gif

1916265
any	set
is there any possibility to set onetoone relation cardinality .when generator dbml with sqlmetal

1916270
quirks-mode	doctype
without doctype some browsers go to quirks-mode to emulate bugs in old browsers

1916290
attributes	properties
you can use a different prefix attributes of properties task e.g

1916323
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to change the background-color of a div on mouseover and mouseout

1916323
mouseover	mouseout
instant change to yellow on mouseover and slow fade on mouseout

1916327
required	checked
this would also required a converter to checked if the length of the string was more than 75

1916337
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is difficult because from what i can tell asp.net-mvc hands off to the webforms rendering engine which then sets the content-type using the header on the page this methods isn t viable for me it would be far easier if i could change this in one central place

1916341
sequences	unique

1916446
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve had a chance to try out linq-to-sql and ado.net entity-framework for a while on different project and i feel that ado.net entity-framework would better fill our needs

1916446
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework has a lot of data mapping options

1916446
entity-framework	ado.net
there appears to be a sqlite ado.net provider that is compatible with the entity-framework and sqlite can do in-memory storage .so in theory the unit tests could use a different connection-string specifying the in-memory database

1916448
bazaar	git
git is not bazaar

1916448
push	pull
i don t ever recall them changing their repo formats .so pretty much any two versioning can push and pull between each other and they don t arbitrarily kill off the access to your repositories for no apparent rea.son

1916450
fiddler	charles
or you can switching to a proxy tool like fiddler or charles to see all the http request made by the browser

1916727
jquery	.post
well this is shattering after two 2h sessions of investigating the problem trying ouf all of the possibilities of the scriptmanager trying to use jquery instead and finally writing up this sample because the real world setup is as always more complicated i now found this short blog .post which solves my problem - with a single line added to the javascript file include

1916753
object-reference	instances
updates i changed the code but am still having the same issue-- i am referencing the ddl incorrectly and i keep getting object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1916766
publishing	release
and on an additionnal side note remember that in the long run .when you have to make modifications to these classes you ll have each time to release this or these jar s building testing naming versionning publishing them meaning a few manipulations each time - depending on your build-system it can be more or less fast n easy maybe maven can help in some cases

1916822
erlang	python
you might want to take a look at stackless which is a modified versioning of python running lightweight tasklets in message-passing erlang styles fashion

1916860
google-chrome	safari
it must be a webkit issue as it is in both safari 4 and google-chrome

1916867
return-value	arguments	user-input	output
if you squint your eyes and wave your hands a bit you can declare that all user-input is part of the function s arguments and that all output is part of the return-value and then fudge things a bit .so that it only does the actual i o on demand

1916875
export	csv
i m trying to export just the numerical value for two performance counters to csv

1916879
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i quess this is why people say that webforms provides a leaky abstraction on web programming and some are moving to asp.net-mvc

contains	any
i want to convert them to a string but without doing any decoding i want to end up with a string that contains 902151914033

1916942
implements	abstract
first thought would be implements the abstract member in the inherited class ala

1916946
virtual-functions	base-class
this is the class interface the abstract-methods can be thought of as pure virtual-functions functions that must be implements by descended classes but do not make sense to be implements in the base-class

1916951
implements	abstract
because your sqlfaqprovider class isn t abstract it has to implements every abstract methods that it inherited

1916956
implements	abstract
.when you inherited from a class in c# you are required to implements all methods marked as abstract unless your class is itself marked as abstract

1916956
abstract-class	base-class
abstract-class are ones that cannot be directly initializer at runtime because they don t fully implements all of the required methods that the base-class es say must exist

1916956
implements	abstract
to fix your problem either mark your class as abstract with the expectations that another level of inherited will fill in the missing pieces or implements deletefaqbyid in your class

1916957
arrays	loops
to display the matrix as you showed above loops would look almost identical to loops that filled in the arrays

1916957
arrays	loops
in fact the loopss are .so similar that if you don t need to do anything with the matrix except display it there s no real points in using the arrays to begin with just use this second loops and replace with rand

1917008

base-class	inherited
all web-parts inherited from this base-class

1917107
parentheses	braces
redundant braces and parentheses are visual clutter

1917130
configuration	environment
the answer is likely yes but changing the database environment from the production configuration to a integration configuration during testing introduces risk that the testing will give false results

1917142
compact-framework	.net
i ve made .some modifications to sub.sonic 3.0 inorder to allow it to run on .net compact-framework 3.5 as well as use more complex entity-table mapping and entity tracking .so it s more like linq-to-sql

double	int
for example with int_of_float ocamlc will compile it into a call of some c function but with ocamlopt it will compile it into some special assembler opcode that transform double to int

1917176
click	mouse
if dragmove is called click and mouseleftbuttonup are not ever fired because dragmove is a blocking call until they release the mouse button

1917177
spaces	output
assuming the filenames do not have spaces just substitute the output of list util shuffle

1917180

i want to refactor some code using the castle inversion-of-control di framework but my issue is that i have some singleton classes and factory-pattern classes and i am not sure that one can implements a singleton or factory using di

1917186
tuples	any
with any union types definition you need to separate the constructor named from the constructor parameters with the keyword of and the parameters themselves should take the form of a tuples types they should be separated by asterisk

1917222
verilog	vhdl
i found that people have already written cores in verilog vhdl which i can directly use in my designs a pcie interface module a ddr3 memory controllers module etc

1917298
linux	unix
in unix linux environment any file or directory starting with a

1917306
linux	unix
if you do any mono development however keep in mind that in unix linux gnu anything that has a period prefix is hidden by default

1917309
linux	unix
historically filenames that start with a . character are hidden unix linux mac os x

1917315
contains	any
if a test contains multiple assert any that follow the one that failed will not be execute

1917318
linux	unix
however unlike unix and linux environment these folder won t be hidden

1917409
perl	php
i came to know php after perl .so .when i first found preg_ function i basically just used those

1917426
decrement	increment

ex i choose an option on the first selected box click the button to add a new selected box a new selected box is added and show the first option but my first selected box resets to the first option as well opposed to the option i had already selecteded

1917491
order	add
i can add object fine but .when the object is display to the user to the program output the checkbox selection as salesform.order instead of invoking the tostring methods in the order class like i want

1917519
decrement	increment	instances	destroy
you can increment an int global variables in the t constructor and decrement it in the t destructor doing this will tell you whether t instances are being destroy by the containers

1917519
instances	destroy
the acceptance-testing can allocate a few t instancess into a containers instances destroy the containers and test whether that destroy the t instancess whether the t destructor were invoked

1917553
put	get
what happens is that the javascript is called correctly it call the gettabs function and passes through the getjson call but it doesn t actually hit my controllers to get the json i put a brekpoint on the controllers action and it is not hit in this case

1917597
networkstream	sslstream

multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division

1917714
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
first of all you need to get a tool that will allow you to inspect the live dom something like firebug for firefox ie developer toolbar for internet-explorer or the webkit developer-tools in google-chrome or safari

1917714
attributes	properties
if it s an image you could try using the attributes that you can see .when you right click and view the properties of it in a selector using the selector attributes

1917718
conditional	operators
i just saw this block of code on the wikipedia article on conditional operators

1917723

1917749
perl	c++
i use it in this manner all the time in c++ java and perl

1917752
conditional-operator	ternary-operator
also this is the conditional-operator - it is an instances albeit currently the only one in c and c++ of a ternary-operator

1917758
python	perl
pyperl provides perl embedding for python but honestly it s not the way i d go

1917758
python	perl
footnote inline python is better code than pyperl and i would suggest using that instead but it only supports having python callback to perl .when python is invoked from perl in the first place -- the ability to embed perl into python is listed as a possible future feature but it s been .so since 2001 .so don t hold your breath

1917771
stderr	stdout
under windows-console applications have stdin stdout and stderr

1917776

binary	hex	decimal	hex
did you mean 1010 binary 10 decimal 0xa hex

1917856
abstract	extends
another option is to have a creation time counter that is stored in the abstract base .so that case-class pushint value int extends abstractop abstractop.nextindex

1917856
tostring	equals
use extractors but in that case i will miss nice features like the implementation of hashcode equals tostring and more important the checked for an exhaustive match

1917863
background-color	transparency
the transparency value in this example is the background-color or lack thereof

1917865
background-color	transparency
transparency just means that it shouldn t show a background-color

1917866

then run you count id grouping by division on this recordingset may be a temporary query and subtract the dummy recording from the count .so the selected clause would be

1917890
haskell	c++
i m developing a small haskell program that uses an external static libs i ve developed in c++

1917890
stderr	stdout
does ghc hijack these three streaming stdout stdin stderr or is libstdc++ simply not initializing them because i m linking with ghc

1917892
if-statement	for-loop
just about the biggest shock i had .when i went back to c was that variables are defined at the function level - you can t scoping variables inside a block if-statement or for-loop inside a function

1917902
scala	java
edit - changed translation from scala to java for clarity and ability to more accurately represent what is happening

1917907
any	set
you can set up an error handler within php to throw an exception-handling upon any php errors example and further documentation found here php.net

1917909
windows-xp	windows
it seems painfully clumsy but i have not seen alternatives that will work on our platform -- windows-xp and windows 2003 server

i would however still want to be able to validation my xml file using a xsd.and here is the complextype i have tried to defined in my xsd to do this job

1917918
winlogon	gina
hosting .net in winlogon where gina dlls are loaded is probably not such a hot idea- could cause all sorts of conflicts if something else decides to do the same thing and if you trash winlogon you re not getting anywhere with that pc

1917918
unmanaged	c++-cli
all that said if you still want to try it you ll need an unmanaged shim dll c++-cli or some il hacking see here to export the gina functions because c# can t directly export dll functions

1917953
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1918091
google-docs	spreadsheet
it allows you to take your google-docs spreadsheet and import it as a .csv file

a few people have already mentioned the possibility of using an std map or other associativity arrays types to do the job

1918132
python	php
i m not sure what the python client libs might look like but with the php ones you generally make an authentication call against the libs something like

1918133

specifically let s translation the scala code you posted into java

1918319
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
nullpointerexception is a runtimeexception which means it doesn t have to be declare in the method-signature

1918323
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i m testing in ie8 and in ie8 compatibility view both show the same but safari firefox google-chrome all act fine and as expected

1918328
value	field
if you are posting a file or files in addition to other field as you appear to be in the example above you have to supply the value for the file as path to file then get the filesize in bytes and add that to the total content-length

1918330
any	set
could .someone points me to or describe how i can get a test environment set up locally .so that i can start developing an application what webserver i should use framework if any - spring

1918332
any	set
but i can t see that any one set of levels is better than any other

1918342
lookup	any
any assistance or thoughts on a self referencing hierarchy via lookup table are greatly appreciated

1918350
review-board	svn
review-board lets you do peer code reviews against svn diff before change is committed

1918359
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
opera safari google-chrome support would need hacks such as copying .application and required files locally

1918385
base	zero
the size of the base struct is apparently 1 i assume because it can t be zero and the size of the derived is 20 which seems to make sense 5 x 4

1918412
python	java	python	ruby
the code is ruby java python and maybe others

1918432
row	col
void intmatrixall int row int col int matrix

1918434

1918447
32-bit	64bit
an int aka system.int32 within the runtime is always a signed 32-bit int on any platform a long aka system.int64 is always a signed 64bit int on any platform

1918450
32-bit	64bit
this could be 32-bit or 64bit

1918452
32-bit	64bit
sure is a difference - in c# a long is a 64bit signed int an int is a 32-bit signed int and that s the way it always will always be

1918454
32-bit	64bit
the former is 32-bit and the later 64bit

1918457
32-bit	64bit
i think an int is a 32-bit int while a long is a 64bit int

1918478
pixels	line
if you have a line of text that would be 500 pixels wide with a fonts height of 20 pixels at a zoom factors of 100 then you would have to increase the zoom level to 105 to get a line of text with 525 by 21 pixels size

1918478
pixels	line
most code samples i know don t use this but you could use it to insert additional pixels between some characters to stretch the width of the line of text to the desired value or to move characters closer together to shrink the width

1918520
reflection	runtime
doing it this way means that there will be no casting or reflection needed at runtime

1918536
data-structures	dictionary
although python dictionary are very efficient i think that if you re going to store billions of items you may want to create your own c extension with data-structures optimized for the way you are actually using it sequential access

1918544
capacity	storage
it won t be in memory but you are trading performance for greater storage capacity

1918558

directory-structure	filesystems
scanning a directory-structure is an io intensive operation whatever you do the first getfiles call will take the majority of time by the end of the first call probably most of the file information will be in the filesystems caching and second call will return in no time .when compared to the first call depending on your free memory and filesystems caching size

1918663
value	field
we then do a pass where we checked whether every member of every types -- methods of classes field of struct enum value and .so on -- is consistent

1918763
silverlight	wpf
in talking with a lot of people who work with both silverlight and wpf even those who are excited about silverlight and push for it strongly i hear a lot of the say fairly emphatically that if you are going to be developing exclusively for a full-trust windows environment wpf is hands-down the obvious choice

1918763
silverlight	wpf
certainly keep your eyes on silverlight but for your current business case wpf will likely be the best fit

1918764
required	checked
some extra explicit coding to implements runtime instead of compile-time checked may be required in grouping 1 to assert that new object are created with all appropriate methods plumbed in to meet an interface contract as there is no compile-time interface-agreement checked if you want to make grouping 1 code more like grouping 2

1918764
factory-method	visitor	abstract-factory	visitor	abstract-factory	factory-method
coarser-grained patterns like abstract-factory builder factory-method prototype adaptor strategy chaining of cmd bridge proxy observers visitor and even asp.net-mvc mmvm tend to get used less in small systemd because the amount of communication about the code is less .so the benefit of creating such structures is not as great

1918764
composite	memento
finer-grained patterns like state cmd factory-methods composite decorator facade flyweight memento templates methods are perhaps more common in grouping 1 code but often several design-patterns apply not to an object as such but to different parts of an object whereas in grouping 2 code patterns tend to be present on a one pattern per object basis

1918815
instances	destroy
the first instances will have a reference held by the end block and won t be destroy until the end of the program and any later instancess won t have that end block called on them at all

marking the the field as volatile would cause the jvm to checked the field value every time or at least ensure that ready changes propagate to the running thread

1919524
required	checked
for something that would likely required the least work scintilla was last i checked in the process of supporting os x

1919526
any	set
is there any way i can set the tables such that whenever somebody enters a new recording or modifies a recording his her username and the date entered is stored into 2 columns in the same table as the recording itself

1919537
arrays	map
if you want to take every elements in an arrays and change it the idiomatic ruby way is to use map or collect

1919547
value	field
default constraints can be used to set the value of the date field if a value is not provided

1919550
arrays	loops
i generally use foreach to loops through my arrays

1919555
jquery	.post
and it is being called by this jquery ajax .post

1919556
input-field	textbox
if you need the value to appear in the input-field for some reason once you detection the keystroke you could fill the textbox

1919571
void	main
i could compile the void main as c++ source file with microsoft c++ compiler 14.00 integrated with visual-studio 2005 .so does it means that the compiler does not conform to the c++ standards on the main function-prototypes

1919572
arrays	loops
i will use arrays_key to get a naturally numerically indexed arrays of key and loops it

1919572
arrays	loops
the third way is to use the arrays internal pointers to skip the first elements and then continue in a loops by using reset next list and each

1919588
void	main
i could compile the void main

1919595
void	main
note that you need to add 0 in main otherwise an error is raised because a void return is not ignore

1919596
formatting	printing
use f# s printing formatting rather than string.format

1919597
selected	button
you can create a button that .when pressed prompt the user to selected a file from their local computer

1919710
google-chrome	firefox
this methods actually works in the embedded-browser as the javascript is retrieved and execute but it does not work in other modern web browsers s i tested against google-chrome ie8 firefox 3.5

1919711
output	mode
.when do the cap deploy everything works fine except the ferret-server while restart server its try to stop the ferret_server in production mode and try to start the ferret_server but it fails due to permission problem .here is the output from my deploy file transactional commit

1919743
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so is it better to use asp.net-mvc or webforms

1919754
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is faster than webforms

1919760
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in google-chrome safari and ie8 the image loads perfectly fine but in firefox the image loads as a background-image in the wrapper div on the first click then into the overall background on a second click

1919762
contains	any
even blurrier is what happens to code that was originally derived from other code but no longer contains any of the original code

1919764
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms and asp.net-mvc each have their strengths

1919782
constructor	object
then .when you get to the end you can retrieve that data from the session to pass to the object constructor

1919805

revision	svn
is there a way to see revision changeset to a repository in tfs just like how we can see revision branches in svn using revision graphing

1919884
environment	building
vs supports pre-post building events which can call external process but do not directly interact with the environment like batch-file or scripting

1919934
append	input
if you have elements in the form that can cause this error and they are important to leave in the form before it is submitted being used as input for an ajax call etc then simply append the named of these form elements with x-ignore- or delete them from the form

1919942
callback	methods
i move body of start and stop methods into a thread-pool worker thread much like your timers call your callback regularly in context of a thread-pool worker

1919945
contains	set
you don t have the recursion set up for menuitems that contains other menu items

1919959
binary-search-tree	binary-tree
you can do a search on a binary-search-tree in o log n but you can t find the depth of a binary-tree in anything less than o n unless you caching the depths as you building it or do something similar

1919959
binary-tree	nodes
complete and balanced binary-tree can have its depth approximated in o log n or in o 1 if the numbers of nodes is known

1919972
firefox	gecko
in firefox and gecko i can use responsetext to get the bytes even if the bytestream include binary zero

1919996
deployment	install
.so the plugins have to be install separately from the main clickonce deployment

1919996
directory	folder
for that i can enable a special folder in the user directory where pluginss can be drag and dropped directly and picked-up automatically .when application starts .i have a problem in finding out a way to checked for plugins updates every time my application starts

al.so a lot of java frameworks seem to be using thread-local a lot .so how is their case different from python django s

1920070
binary-tree	nodes	binary-tree	tree	children	tree	children	nodes
a binary-tree just means a tree whose nodes have a maximum of two children

1920070
children	nodes
heap a nodes is bigger than or smaller than all of its children

1920093
one-to-many	entity
you can t do that if you associations table has properties you need you must map the associations as a one-to-many to an new entity for insurer_section that then has a many-to-one

1920096
.when	ready
however this should not required here call in window.onload as scriptmanager will call them .when dom gets ready

1920123
literals	hardcode
if your source code is hardcode as in your sample you could use a c# literals string

1920133
default-value	default
to chime in with the rest it will be null but i should also add that you can get the default-value of any types using default

1920139
default-value	default
for structures the default-value is the same as you get .when you initializer the default parameterless constructor of the structure which can t be overrides by the way

1920145
duplicates	elements
i have a list with duplicates elements

1920145
duplicates	elements
i have used the above code to find the duplicates elements in the list_a

.when i create a multithreading program and i use methods such as wait or signals to control threads among other things does jvm control all the thread state changes or does the underlying os have anything to do with it

1920159
firefox	safari
i also believe this is only happening in mac safari and mac firefox because windows firefox seems to be fine

1920165
dialog	pop-up
now i want to add a native user-interface to it - the ability to show some pop-up windows to request user credentials and perhaps fileopen dialog

1920179
hashtable	set
but it s far easier to use a set roughly o n due to the hashtable

1920191
recording	playing
does someone knows how we can combine our current recording into another background playing music

1920192
dictionary	for-loop
her dictionary expression are really nice in this case though for other queries .when you need to do something different with the results just use tuples expansion in the for-loop

1920200
tablelayoutpanel	panels
in that case you can use the tablelayoutpanel with relative sizes and within these panels you arrange your controls with anchoring and docking

1920202
file-access	filesystems
regarding file-access a trusted application will be able to access to some predefined folder such as mydocuments mymusic mypictures myvideos but not the entire filesystems

1920202
silverlight	wpf
among other things it eases the task of sharing code between wpf and silverlight .so you could consider developing a dual sl+wpf application

1920211
tiff	png
i tried to use jpg png tiff

1920335
dbd	dbi
the perl dbi database interface does not make provision for passing an already-open database handle to the drivers - the interface assumes that dbi plus the relevant database drivers or dbd xyzdbms module will establish the connection

1920335
dbd	dbi
therefore at best you are going to be writing the code to extends dbi to allow for this and also extendss the relevant dbd to support it which is an altogether non-trivial exercise

1920339
reflection	runtime
instead consider having a properties or similar that accepts a types and do some work at runtime reflection etc - or don t use the designer

1920347
margins	padding
also .when i add margins and padding i have to calculate everything again

1920352

since your profiling suggests that the qhash serialization takes the most time i believe that replacing qhash with a qlist would yield a significant improvement .when it comes to deserialization speed

1920438
qhash	qlist
even if you said that you need the fast child lookup i would recommend that you try replacing qhash with a qlist as a test

1920438
children	nodes
if there aren t many children for each nodes say less than 30 the lookup should still be fast enough even with a qlist

in asp.net-mvc there is nothing special about the form on the page unlike webforms

1920569
sip	rtp	rtsp	rtmp	rtsp	rtp	rtsp	sip	rtmp	rtp
however you ll still need to streaming those packets up to a server .somewhere and there don t appear to be any silverlight implementation of rtp rtsp sip or rtmp .so at this points you d have to roll your own network streaming containers support

1920584

the callback methods will run pretty quickly after that you ll get an objectdisposedexception .when you call the endreceive methods

1921937
difference	zero
yes - you can use a numbers table a bit like this probably not overly efficient and assumes incident dates have zero time parts 00 00 00 - if this is not true you ll need to make the time zero test the difference in dates

1921982
button	popup
among the things your popup box should contains is a button or some other control to allow it to be removed

1922044
audio	ogg
i d like to play back ogg vorbis audio from http in silverlight

1922064
beautifulsoup	lxml
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

1922066
contains	elements
it gives the full path as you parsing each elements .so you could checked if the path m e and then checked if the text nodes contains foo

1922085
sql-server-express	sql-server
using sql-server full edition instead of sql-server-express is also an option

1922100
gtk	gdk
i ve got a gtk gdk docked windows that i need to give keyboard focus to .so accelerator key shortcuts work

1922130

aggregate	grouping
what you probably want to do here is a grouping by on the column you want to be distinct and then apply an appropriate aggregate operators to the other columns to get the value you want eg

1922209
csv	xml
instead of a csv you could send an xml and then parsing it in the procedure

1922224
constructor	object
first i thought that synchronized is locking mlock object but then if after t.start constructor thread enters sync block first it would block it at mlock.wait and implicit block thread t by blocking it from entering synchronized block

udp	tcp
.so i ve heard .some theories that udp is a security risk but i don t really understand how it s more of a risk that tcp or how a policy server doesn t relieve the risk

my question is there any way .solution or workaround that i can set the root folder of hibernate to be the extension folder .so it starts to get the classes from there

1922343
32-bit	64bit
i m reminded of all the downloading i see msdn and many others where you must selected between the 32-bit and 64bit install

1922351
environment	building
this approach required a building which is not possible in the environment which i m running the code in we re using our own on-the-fly building-process which include only the javascript that is necessary for a particular page

1922356
python	java
i know netbeans is a full-featured ide and you can compile java programs but i don t think they support python

1922399
c++	lua
using lua 5.1 and c++ with luabind

1922403
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework is pretty easy to work with

1922413
any	set
you shouldn t need any additional path information in the import if the header search path is set correctly

1922418
access-control	authentication
i think you should maintain a local database of authentication customers on the pc that handles access-control

1922428
compact-framework	.net
windows-mobile has fairly easy development with .net compact-framework

1922434
getter	setter
usersupport class has field user with getter and setter and some other methods

1922441
textbox	button
i m rendering a wpf grid with multiple elements button textbox ... to a bitmap which is then used as a textures for a 3d surface in a direct3d scene

1922441
listbox	textbox
visualtreehelper.hittest is a good start but instead of finding textbox it finds textboxview and instead of listbox it finds a border

1922446
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
works in firefox safari and google-chrome .

1922450
updating	updates
.so creating a new instances adds a row to the table updating the object updates the row etc

1922463
json	xml
for example json yaml xml or even the built-in configparser

1922486
python	php
php language may appear less complicated than python but you ll do more work to create the site

1922486
postgresql	mysql
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

1922497
value	field
if the user enters value in more than one field then i need to search on all of those field

1922505
dictionary	namedtuple
btw on python 2.6 using namedtuple instead of dictionary is an option

1922512
firefox	safari
i need to add some javascript to it and have managed to get it all working in ie and firefox but safari is a no no

1922513
python	java	python	ruby
you ll find that ides are much less of a requirement .when using a dynamic-languages like python or ruby compared to java or c#

1922519
jmockit	junit
source of the problem was transitive dependency due using of some my testutils module with compile scoping dependency on junit which have to be after jmockit in classpath while in the parent-pom test dependencies was defined as bellow

1922544
scrollable	panels
what matters more than the raw numbers of items is the ratio of items in the list to the items visible in your scrollable panels whether youâ re talking about a list box or the dropdown portion of a combo box

1922544
pixels	line
.so for 1000 items you need a panels about 800 pixels high at 16 pixels per line

1922544
keyboard	mouse
there no reason not to and even with a small the numbers of items it benefits users using the keyboard only rather than the mouse very common for data entry

1922550
base-class	inherited
inherited from a base-class

1922551
.net	wcf
.net 3.5 vs2008 wcf service using basichttpbinding

1922557
implements	extends
rather than loading an external swf i have implements info bubbles for modest maps by adding removing child object like a textfield to my marker object which extends sprite in response to the appropriate mouse events

1922567
value	field
since the value field is private it s not accessible in the derived-class

1922567
value	field
if the value field was accessible in the derived-class it was public then you should have used new to express your intention to hide the base member

1922569
user-roles	userid
but .some user-roles can see grid not filtering by userid - .so super admins see all data

1922574
interpreter	runtime
i think that whether you are compiling one or multiple-languages the answer to whether your compiled code will run on different platform depends on the existence of a virtual-machine like the jvm java virtual-machine or clr common language runtime that can interpreter instructions and execute them on different platform

1922578
ref	out
if you do you ll get the error a ref or out arguments must be an assignable variable.

1922578
ref	out
you shouldn t use ref or out unless you really really need to and have no other way to do what you re doing

1922604
xsd	xml
since i already have a strongly typed xml xsd combinations i am hoping there is an elegant methods for buser-interfacelding a user-interface to edit this easily enough

1922617
environment	building
i would recommend setting up continuous-integration where your building-server is responsible for retrieving the latest sources from the subversion repository performing a building and preparing the deployment package for various environment test staging and potentially ftp ing it up to the production box once you re happy with the deployed changes in your test or staging environment

1922619
contains	any
if there s any possibility of the user string contains special regexp characters you should modify this to

1922622
minimum	max
grouplayout supports this we can specify the max size in the addcomponent methods alongside with minimum and preferred

1922628
protected	public
also in your above example we have to assume that the base foo methods is marked as public or protected as otherwise the use of the virtual modifiers is kind of pointless anyway as it won t be visible to base other classes

1922637
required	checked
in that .app i used a controllersplugin that would checked if the requested controllers is the restrict controllers and if the user has the required role for that

1922641
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
my question is should etags be case-sensitive or case-insensitive

1922645
vcalendar	vcard
in the vcard and vcalendar formats

1922649
jqgrid	.post
there is an excellent .post about this on the jqgrid forum

1922654
indexof	equals
how does indexof determine that two object are equals

1922685
contains	elements
you created the arrays but didn t put anything in it .so you have an arrays that contains 5 elements all of which are null

1922688
indexof	equals
it s not clear which types you re calling indexof on anyway but most collections won t use comparator anyway - they ll just use equals and do a linear search

1922694
python	perl
this would be much easier in a scripting-language like perl or python

1922723
any	set
i ve got a stackpanel with a grouping of expanders in how do i set it .so that only expander is expanded at any one time

1922728
javascript	dom
use ajax return a very small page with javascript that will triggers the search which would modify the dom with the results as they are being fflush or make several call to the search program with a parameter denoting how many results you want and the offset

1922740
subtract	add
then add subtract delta_x to the x-coordinate of the blue points you want the line to be perpendicular to

1922743
constructor	object
according to mindprod site and this article since the current directory cannot change throughout the execution of a program the file constructor does not need to embed it in each file object

1922748
subtract	add
found another problem the code that calculates the boundaries subtract from the maximums but doesn t add to the minimums

1922750
constructor	object
the constructor call std locale creates a locale object that represents the user s preferences

1922751
contains	elements
my partials view is rendering with the actions that are fired from the elements that it contains

1922759
json	xml
if i was using xml it could be simple to do which makes me believe i m not using json objective-c correctly

1922764
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
for example the string.compareto methods performs case-sensitive comparison but you could provide the string.case_insensitive_order comparator which would result in case-insensitive sorting

1922774
mkmapview	mapkit
in my case i had a category for mkmapview and did not bind the mapkit framework with my target .app thus the class which the category belongs to wasn t found at building time

1922792
selected	button
if i hit the add button and selected the cod file i want to sign from another location the cod file isn t being listed with all of the other files

1922794
screens	hdpi	hdpi	mdpi
maybe you also want to use small normals large instead of ldpi mdpi hdpi because the former refer to screens size instead of density

1922805
implements	extends
i ended up looking at the log4net source and determined i can implements my own appender that extends fileappender and overrides the file properties

1922843
specifications	w3c
attributes do not inherited the namespace of the elements to which they belong as per the w3c specifications and that is why you got those results which are correct

1922856
dictionary	arrays	key-value	key
the nsdictionary methods allvalue returns an arrays of the value in a dictionary unattached from their key and key-value coding for nsarrays produces an arrays of the given key s value for all the items in the arrays

1922861
apache-commons-email	javax.mail
for a concrete and realistic example consider the apache-commons-email api which is nothing more than a wrapper for the standards javax.mail api

1922867
databound	radgrid
i ve managed to do this by handling the databound event of the radgrid and manually populating the cell in the footer

1922867
contains	any
i ve tried using but this tablecellcollection contains a couple more cell than i d expect .so accessing them by int index feels a tad ropey especially as this is a user-defined report .so the columns may be in any order

1922892
32-bit	64bit
on an i686 and x86_64 .so 32-bit and 64bit proces.sor running linux 3.0.0 the answer is

1922898
contains	any
occaisionally they don t want any data in a field but .when they delete the text and try to save the blanked-out field comes back with its original text the table object passed to the save action contains other edits but attempts to blank out field result in the original text staying in the field

1922916
double	int
many of the field are volatile int and as it turns out i need to upgrade one of those to a double

1922917

has anyone attempted to convert migrate an asp.net-mvc web application project to asp.net webforms

1922941
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m new to asp.net-mvc but not to webforms

1922941
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my thought was that since i m having difficulties frustration implements the asp.net-mvc .app that i would revert to webforms before i get too deep into the development-process

1922943
numeric	digits
you can have this advantage also by using a global sequences to generator numerical key or by using different numeric ranges last digits or whatever

1922946

.when export my simple.data report to excel using reportviewer in localmode i can sort the table data fine but i have images in all of the rows and they do not sort with the data

1922946
selected	cell
i m trying to sort via selected the cell and then going sort

1922957
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it would take a lot of analyzation and extra work figuring out how to work with viewstate converting controllers logic and views into web-parts etc. to convert a .net asp.net-mvc .app to webforms but it could definitely be done

1922979
attributes	properties
the fact that class attributess cannot implements interfaces and transient can be seen as a generics properties of an attributes makes sense of introducing transient as a language keyword

1922981
groovy	scala
it s worthy to note that some languages scala ruby groovy have language-features that enable you to write

1922992
.when	ready
if you are upload a new versioning of the site you can create a symlink in the place of the root directory and then switching that .when the site s ready

1923024
.when	ready
the advantage of the static libs is that you can stage this by upgrading the libs for each project .when it s ready

1923032
hash	md5
upon request the client hash together using md5 or sha1 or sha something else - you choose the request field and the secret

1923032
value	field
the hash value is attached to the request - say as another .post field

1923035
attributes	properties
everything works great the only issue i have is that the binding i m doing on the isreadonly attributes which goes to a boolean in my viewmodel which is set based on a call to an authentication service is now overrides the labels content to the named of my viewmodel properties isnotadmin

1923038
arguments	default
in the above code sample the final arguments alert.yes is specifying that the default option from the bitwise list in the 3rd arguments is the yes button

1923038
arguments	default
i can see that the button is styled as the default it gets a bit of a halo or extra border .when compared to the cancel button or .when compared to itself .when passing null as the last arguments

1923081
python	php
python is multipurpose it is not specialised to a specific target of users like r for statistics or php for web programming

1923112
accumulate	grouping
why not store a column in the grouping table that specifies whether or not the discount can be accumulate with other discounts versus if it must be applied to the base price only

given that they do that i ve seen a few of these scanners act as a hid keyboard mouse input device

1923187
postback	ajax
after there is a text change send a ajax request or postback to handle the logic from there

1923196
.when	ready
.when the pages are ready and tested just move the files into the normals place after moving the old existing files into backup directory

.so for example a user would login into the systemd and if successfully authentication it would receive an encrypted token back

1923205
windows-xp	windows-ce
qt-4.6.0- wince as is implied in the named and said explicit on the page you linked is for windows-ce not for windows-xp and vista

1923218
environment	execution
this is impossible on a single execution core which is almost certainly why microsoft treats the count as 0 in such environment

1923230
aggregate	grouping
you can grouping by c and then use an aggregate to order by the min or max j.created

1923231
implements	extends
if you know you are going to extends the functionality of the object now or later on create the interface if not think about it before you implements it

1923249
tripledes	aes
- tripledes aes - you named it with varying key lengths too

1923250

what s happening is that .when you click off the menu it cancels the pop-up menu .so you deselect the button but the next immediate event is click the button and now its deselected .so it show the menu again

1923253
textbox	button
think of the basic controls in the framework such as textbox or button - if you were implements something like that you d want a control

1923257
markup	xhtml
however in both browsers if you have invalid xhtml somewhere in your page you may be throw the renderinging engine into quirks-mode - in which case it will do its best to rendering the page in the way the old-style browsers would in being able to deal with virtually any markup you give it and at least present something to the user

1923265
32-bit	64bit
this error led me to the following .post that basically tells me that the ruby versioning that came together with xcode 3.0 does not work in 64bit environment and a solution could be to install the 32-bit versioningof mysql

1923266
dictionary	arrays
you can do this but thatâ s not to say you should â a plist can have either a dictionary or an arrays as its top-level elements

what this code does is that it show the first 5 matches with the keyword at the beginning and the next 5 matches are with the keyword in any place

1923356
http	ssl
you can use the http ssl streaming wrapper to let php transparently handle the ssl part

1923356
http	ssl
you can also use http s if ssl support is enabled in see also

1923356
http	ssl
.when making a http request both the http and the ssl options are used

stderr	stdout
the child-process created with os.fork inherited stdin stdout stderr from parent process while the child created with pty.fork is connect to new pseudo terminal

1923362
union-all	union
i wonder if it s because you are using a union instead of a union-all

1923420
configuration	environment
as is pointed out in the nokia instructions make sure to use the visual-studio command-prompt get your environment variables ironed out create a custom mkspec if you have to and keep a close eye during the configuration for any warnings

1923423
selected	cell	selected	button
are you using the filtering button or are you just selected the cell and click the sort button

1923434
installation	building
while building from source is not necessarily a bad idea even if the official distribution is built using a better compiler using macports to do it is probably a better idea than a self-built installation

1923437
digital-signature	sign
if you sign your assembly with a real certificate the .net runtime has to checked the digital-signature

1923467
similarity	distance
since writing my original response i ve learned that oracle include the levenshtein distance and several other string similarity functions in the utl_match package which i believe is a standards part of the database

1923477
configuration	installation
is there a way to updates only configuration file forcefully during installation

1923502
hash	md5
context consider each set within g to be a collections of the files contents or md5 hash not named that are found on a particular computer

1923502
contains	set
something like if finding x in a set within g means there is a high probability of also finding y then there is probably a set in h contains both x and y .

1923506
directory	folder
this makes sense but i want ruby-on-rails to ignore this folder and just let me use apache to rendering a standards directory listing here

1923510
contains	set
the result set will contains the tag the sample and the count of users that tagged said sample with said tag

1923510
value	field
value is limiting the field to retrieve to tag.name and sample.name

1923527
subtract	add
.so to compute ae+bg start with m1+m7 which gets us the ae and bg terms then add subtract .some of the other ms until ae+bg is all we are left with

windows	winpe
make sure the following directory exists in the winpe filesystems x windows system32 configuration systemprofile desktop

1923530
required	checked
also checked all form tags to ensure they have all required attributes

1923535
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the elegance and simplicity of asp.net-mvc blows away mvp which feels like a pattern that is just grafted onto webforms

1923536
hide	show
you should reverse your thinking - hide the rows by default then show the one you want

1923537
contains	any
bstr simply containss 16-bit code units that can contains any utf-16 encode data

1923571
linux	uname
on linux uname returns linux on leopard it returns darwin

1923572
deployment	install
i am trying to do a deployment with capistrano to newly install ubuntu-server

1923572
directory	folder
if on other hand i don t use use_sudo and set variables www directory ownership to myuser i still cannot deploy - some of my deployment cmd set folder ownership to apache user www-data and then i get something like

1923578
concatenation	comma
this reduces the output to a single row and all the categoryname strings are concatenation together separated by comma

1923581
implements	abstract
using abstract helped with the getsavedevents methods since all of the children implements that methods

1923586
double	int	primitive	int
this works for the string and the usual primitive value-type you will encounter int decimal double bool datetime

1923587
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have been doing asp.net-mvc development for a year and a half and would never even think of going back to webforms on a new project

1923588
implements	extends
ok .so you re extends the class instead of implements an interface

1923604
value	field
in such cases auto generator value properties of those field in entity classes should be set to true

1923607
python	c++
or i d try to use c++ s rtti facilities or python instanceof function

1923609
callback	methods
the value passed to the callback is the one that the variables posses .when you call the start methods which is false and that s why you never see the output in the console

1923612
administration	credentials
on a server there are other ways to protect the sql-server credentials starting by limiting access to the server to authentication administration

1923641
any	set
in any case a handle is normally intended as an opaque data types -- you re not supposed to know anything about its value only a set of predefined operations that can use it to accomplish various tasks

1923652
any	set
and since you have all the project outputting to the same folder any of the referenced project will most likely get copy-paste more than once if you have those files set to be deployed in the child project

1923659
callback	methods
the callback methods needs to be in the derived-class not the parent class

1923671
margins	padding
i then added an overflow hidden for the containers and the margins padding show above to the columns

1923672
getter	setter
here s a simplistic example in java i m leaving getter setter out for shortness - don t make your field public

1923675
required	checked
that required your database driven website to look in the http-request and checked which domain was originally requested then it can handle the request accordingly

1923700
linux	unix
if you re using unix or linux i d suggest using ulimit

1923706
child-process	spawn
the first being the program itself and the second being the child-process it spawn

1923708
variables	boolean
flag is a boolean variables

1923737
silverlight	wpf
there is now a much better way to do this in wpf and silverlight

1923758
specifications	w3c
as for what to defang look at the w3c specifications for html

1923767
pyquery	lxml
pyquery provides the jquery selector interface to python using lxml under the hood

1923782

considering that you want one page with all of the content you could simple hide all but one main div with css and then use javascript jquery to show one div .when a tab is click and hide all of the other main divs

1923794
webserver	upload	ftp	ssh
i am using paramiko to ssh into my webserver and upload a file to another ftp

i m running on windows-xp sql-server-express 9.0.4053 and i have sql-server management-studio-express 9.0

1923830
blacklist	whitelist
a modified versioning base upon jay bazuzi s solution above since i can t .post code in comment it checked a blacklist extensions i do this only for demonstration purpose you should strongly consider to building a whitelist rather than a blacklist

1923837
numerical	nan
i have a numerical methods that could return nan or inf if there was an error and for testing purposed i d like to temporary force it to return nan or inf to ensure the situation is being handled correctly

1923847
value	field
note that this may or may not be the case for simple getter depending on what other code in your class is doing to the field value

1923860
verilog	vhdl
in verilog and vhdl programming languages used to design chip we always have to use the subset that are synthesizable .when designing the chip

1923865
windows-vista	windows
.net applications made for .net 3.0 or later work much better on newer versioning of windows windows-vista windows 7 etc

1923879
checkbox	textbox
this works fine but i would like to use checkbox instead of textbox

1923889
temporary	copy
make a new target just for your scripting have it copy its files into a temporary staging folder or something make your main target depend upon it and do a second copy of its results

1923899
visitor-pattern	visitor
one disadvantage of the visitor-pattern though is that the visitor itself needs to be changed .when you add a new class of object being visited

1923904
entity-framework	nhibernate
currently we have only an implementation for nhibernate but implements it for linq-to-sql or entity-framework should be straightforward

1923911
javascript	dom
2. #1 doesnt make sense because if you are doing it on-the-fly you should be using the javascript programmiatc creation and adding it to the dom instead of just returning html ie

1923913
instances	self
c++ object instances are not considered of types id .so even if you change your code to pass this instead of self it won t compile

1923917
virtual-machine	parallels
my coding environment visual-studio is in a virtual-machine parallels on os x

1923931
any	set
since you don t need any other decorator for the naa form you set formelements as the only decorator and remove the submit button from the naa form

1923931
order	add
set up your display main form like .so and set the order of the naa form .when you add it as a subform .so it display above the elements of the main form

1923939

1925119
administration	account	administration	sysadmin
that s pretty simple to do -- restrict the built-in administration grouping in sql-server for example by giving it only public and not sysadmin disable the sa account if the server has mixed-mode authentication and substitute another account in your control to act as sysadmin

spaces	output
note tomalak is correct in that the 2nd match on has no effect other than to remove spaces from the output which is a bit odd

python	php
if .so it s quite possible that php is calling the python file with a different working directory and it s trying to import things relative to that path instead of the path of the scripting

1925796
value	field
if you need to control the value in that field then it s data and you can t use an autonumber but have to roll your own autoincrement routine

1927991
euclidean-distance	threshold
to determine that they are subjectively â œthe same â you would have to do something like what fortran suggested although you will have to arbitrarily establish a threshold for â œsameness.â to make s independent of image-size and to handle channels a little more sensibly i would consider doing the rms root mean square euclidean-distance in colorspace between the pixels of the two images

1927991
average	scalar
find the mean average across all pixels then take the square root of the resulting scalar

1927998
logout	login
if the event you emit may be of an interest to many object at once screens rotated memory usage user login logout then you should use the nsnotificationcenter

1928010
telnet	ftp
you don t want these untrusted users to be able to install a custom daemons pretending to be a well-known service such as telnet or ftp since that could be used to steal passwd and other nasty things

1928041
versioning	upgrade
supposedly you can instruct the application-settings infrastructure to copy settings from a previous versioning by calling upgrade

1928060
latex	tex
how to create such a layout in latex tex

1928097
exception-handling	try-catch
if you dont like to litter your code with try-catch around each methods you can try using aop frameworks which would give you the ability to handle exception-handling by marking the methods with attributes

1928113
compact-framework	.net
i have developed the application for windows-mobile 5.0 and .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2

1928113
compact-framework	.net
but .when i run my application on windows-mobile 6.1 and .net compact-framework 3.5 my application hang on serial-port close api call

1928113
compact-framework	.net
there are many workarounds mentioned in the .net compact-framework blog like closing the com ports on different thread opening the ports in the beginning of the application and close once application exists polling for data instead of event handling but nothing is working consistently

1928165
google-chrome	firefox
that source code .when placed into an otherwise empty html document looks like this for me in google-chrome ie and firefox

1928169
derived-class	base-class
i derive from base-class and try to have a specialization for the function templates in derived-class

1928171
python	java	linux	unix
if i was running the shop i would skip the eval and begin by selling them on using ironpython because i think it is a better choice in the long run and python skills can be leveraged on linux unix project or java project as well as in .net

1928176
android-emulator	adb-shell
after that i closed adb-shell command-prompt and my android-emulator

1928185
google-chrome	firefox
what is the ie hack for setting the positioning properties relative in not-a-browser ie and positioning absolute in other browsers firefox google-chrome

1928190
firefox	opera
.when i test my design on firefox and opera the interface loads fast and is a pleasure to use

1928208
value	field	tostring	equals
an easy way i use to construct an equals and hashcode methods is to create a tostring methods that returns the value of the business key field then use that in the equals and hashcode methodss

1928209
javascript	dom
on intranet bandwidth isn t a bottleneck old clunky ie javascript engine might be .so i d say send generator html even in better browsers native parsing of html fragments should be faster than building dom with javascript

1928248
entity	poco
where policeofficer is just a poco not a mapped entity of any kind

1928255
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in firefox google-chrome safari and opera it returns 3

1928272
hash	md5
initially i was thinking of using a md5 hash of the email as username but given the limitation of 30 characters it is not possible

1928277
contains	elements
from googling i believe this is a wtp elements but i m not really sure what it does and why it believes that it contains a reflexive reference to the project contains it

1928285
hash	md5
a reasonable approach is probably to hash the guid using something like md5 and then trim off the last 2 characters

1928315
selected	checkbox	value	field
you could put an additional field into your contact class - selected or checked - and use the itemrenderer to set this value .when the selection of the checkbox changes

1928318
getter	setter
2 use javascript s encapsulation trick to make sure the prototype field is only accisble via getter and setter methods

1928319
instances	private
i would have a private instances member referencing a thread timer

1928328
.when	ready
remove the -h option .when you are ready to apply the cmd

1928342
constructor	object
as far as i know a constructor in javascript is a function that initializer object created by the operators new and they are not meant to return anything

1928343
windows-vista	windows-xp
with rdp 7.0 now release and if you apply the required updates for windows-vista sp1 and windows-xp-sp3 you can now use remoteapp to remote and or virtual machines running windows-vista or windows-xp

1928343
virtualbox	vmware
these machines can be running as virtual machines under virtualbox or vmware worksation player not just under hyper-v

1928354
javascript	dom	value	field
the types of each field value will also be string as far as the javascript dom on your page is concerned

1928367
selected	checkbox
currently using the following to selected all checkbox .when a checkbox with id #checkall is checked

1928367
checkbox	button
how can i change this to allow for the use of a button instead of a checkbox

1928373
treeview	listview
.when you click on something on the order and it needs to know the current customer you can refer to the treeview or combo box or listview etc to see what is the currently selected customer

1928386
udp	tcp
data sent on udp is usually idisposable .so if you don t receive data then it can easily be ignored...however .sometimes you want semi-reliable but you don t want order reliable like tcp uses 1 second is a good estimate of a drop

1928391
webforms	asp.net
we have been using log4net for logging our asp.net webforms application

1928398
progress-bar	progress
i have a powershell scripting that call a cmdlet which in turn report its progress using write-progress and i would like to hide the progress-bar

1928407
put	get
it will be .some extra cycles to parsing all the class information but .so long as you don t put any css info on that class it doesn t change display doesn t put you in quirks-mode and doesn t get you in fights at work

1928410
javascript	dom
however keep in mind that some javascript libs frameworks will invisibly add use custom html attributes in the dom tree such as several jquery-plugins do

1928414
constructor	object
otherwise call the regexp constructor 15.10.4.1 passing it the pattern and flags arguments and return the object construct by that constructor

1928424
checkbox	button
you still use this.checked in the attr ... code which of course won t work as this is a button now and not a checkbox anymore

1928424
checkbox	button
the following stores the current checked status in a data attributes on the button and thus allows you to toggle the checkbox as before

1928425
attributes	properties
while in your xhtml you write the attributes as javascript exposes this properties as a boolean value element.checked

1928430
http	ssl
this is called http or ssl tunnel

1928440
google-chrome	firefox
ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome

1928447

i have also indexed the valdate field since i often query for value on a specific date

1928462
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textbox
for each row each column has an input textbox radio-button checkbox etc

1928468
constructor	object
in general a constructor can ignore this and just return an independent object

1928468
constructor	object
if the constructor doesn t return anything as is the usual pattern for constructor the new-operator itself ensures that it returns the new object created and passed as this

1928495
object-reference	instances
messages object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1928505
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
there s platinumgrid which does work correctly in ie firefox opera and safari google-chrome

1928531
deprecated	javadoc
you could follow the suggestion given in this thread and mark the methods using deprecated then .when you run javadoc use option -nodeprecated

1928531
protected	public
i really mean to stress here that the qualifiers private public and protected have meaning which you should consider and utilize effectively

1928538
jquery	.post
are you doing the .post with jquery

1928560
textbox	button
even though you can do much more complex layout with wpf like it s mentionned a button or almost anything really can hosts other stuff like image textbox and even more some other basic stuff found within winform are hard to reproduce

1928575
udp	tcp
technology-wise this means you want udp not tcp and a custom loss-recovery mechanism

1928598
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
it works fine in firefox opera and google-chrome

1928598
margins	padding
i ve tride setting padding and margins to 0 for both and but to no wain

1928606
click	mouse
everything words exacty how i want it to however .when i click another image the previous one stays glowing like selected until i enter the mouse on it and leave it

1928623
difference	factors
this can realistically differ by a factors of 4 way more than the difference in clock frequency you re likely to encounter

1928650
directory	folder
the .svn folder is just a hidden directory which will appear in every or at least most of the directory in your source tree

1928673
enumerator	any
.so for this rea.son i don t put in any wpf-specific properties visibility enumerator into my viewmodel because that bind me to use wpf for eternity which isn t really a bad thing but it compromises maintenance

1928686
arrays	map
if you have a multi-value control like a multi-selectable list or a set of button mapped to the same named multiple selection will map to an arrays

1928700
thickbox	jquery
i am using jquery s thickbox plugins ver

1928710
scheme	lisp	smalltalk	lisp	smalltalk	scheme
self smalltalk and lisp scheme s have dealt quite successfully with most of the same issues

1928775
contains	any
this means that a libs contains the definition of a function should appear after any source files or object-files which use it

1928860
silverlight	wpf
i need to constantly display large amounts of colored text in wpf or silverlight and i need the user to percieve it as showing up instantly

1928861
lightbox	thickbox
i don t know thickbox specifically but problems with forms are common to many lightbox like tools

1928861
lightbox	thickbox
usually copies them into the thickbox lightbox whatever on dom level

1928865
textbox	button
i am using flex as3 i have a accordian with two tabs each tab contains some textbox and i am trying to access these child controls from button event handler which resides outside the accordian problem is these controls are null until i open the tabs of accordian

1928871
silverlight	wpf
i know that wpf developers have the ability to use the sos.dll but that cannot be loaded in the vs2008 ide while debugging a silverlight .app

1928883
any	set
do i need to set any one of them as innodb

1928896
callback	methods
you can use the add_close methods to attach a callback to know .when the alert is closed

1928898
any	set
in our application we have windowss with windowsstyle set to none we implements the functionality to drag the windows but only from the header rather than from any points in the windows

1928913
any	set
has anyone got any example of how to set a pixels perfect border that doesn t look pants on an event

1928925
buffering	streaming
in the case of tstreaming.read the .source is the streaming s contents .so you don t pass that in as a parameter but the destination is the buffering parameter show in the question

1928944
switching	screens
i know that it s possible to execute tests in there -- libs project already run in the flash player -- but application project still insist on running tests in my default browser which sits on another virtual desktop and necessitates a lot of screens switching

1928946
any	set
do i need to set any one of them as innodb

1928947
any	set
as an aside i recommend calling stop with both of the optional-parameters clearqueue to remove any pending animation .when you switching between functions and gotoend to finish the current animation set to true - this is usually the behavior people want

1928949
.when	ready
i ve the code below that works great in my ready function in jquery .when i fill the form and change focus from the input elements to another run the ajax checked and assign a css class to the elements showing if is validation or not

1928965
configuration	logging
in my codeigniter configuration file i have this logging threshold set

1928966

1928968
hide	show
the controllers sets a variables can_edit that is used by the views to hide show edit links

1928999
any	set
you have your #wrapftr set to hide any overflow with overflow hidden

1929002
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
if memory serves was 6.1 is a servlet 2.4 containers .so checked that the deployment-descriptor web.xml validation against the 2.4 schema or 2.3 or 2.2 dtd if you re writing to those specifications

1929007
constructor	object
should i use model bean class and then pass that object in the constructor

1929025
selected	button
button selected all button

1929047
click	mouse
also the description labels should be able to respond to the events like mouse click etc

1929069
deployment	install
we usually use setup and deployment project in .net 2008 to building our application install

1929081
constructor	object
this way you d have a cleaner constructor for your object

1929100
protected	public
if you really must avoid the interface you can create a public abstract-class that has all of the properties but declare a protected constructor

1929100
nested-class	inherited	instances	private
you can then create a private nested-class that inherited from the public abstract that can only be created by the outer class and return instances of it as the base types

1929106
pixels	line
at certain variables points in my tiff i need to insert a line of pixels from elsewhere in the tiff

1929128
solaris	aix	solaris	linux	linux	aix
if i have a binary file which was was created on hp-ux and suddenly i take this binary file on linux or let s say in any other platform like aix or sun solaris and if i want to checked about the details of the binary as to in which platform it was developed how could i do it on any platform

1929132
32-bit	16-bit
using a 16-bit dll from a 32-bit application involves what microsoft call called flat thunking

1929138

1929147
notepad++	emacs
try opening your file with notepad++ emacs or any other editor which show it

1929172
return-value	arguments
.when you retrieve the properties value you just call its get methods and use the return-value and .when you set its value you call its set methods with the appropriate value arguments

1929176
value	field
you don t need a private field - that s just creating a redundant copy of the value

1929177
shutdown	restart
value is still 7 from the change that occurred in the constructor if the program has been running all along or if the program was shutdown and restart the static-initializer will have set it to 3 and deserialization did not change it

1929199
directory	folder
i can invoke either assembly assembly or assembly directory but for the latter how do i copy the final output to the local jboss deployment folder

1929202
getter	setter
you are correct the issue is .when ever you use albums in the first code block you are referring to this setter getter

1929204
revision	svn
this way i can also use the svn revision numbers in the assembly versioning

1929232
constructor	object
but if you really can t pull those responsibilities out introduce parameter object is one way of cleaning up busy constructor methods like that

1929270
fclose	fopen	fclose	fread	fopen	fread
i would imagine it would be easier to write a short function using fopen fread and fclose to parsing it yourself

1929271
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
.when the derived-class inherited from the base-class it inherited the vtable as well

1929271
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class must have an entry for foo in its vtable .so that the call will be redirected appropriately .when the derived-class is referenced polymorphically through a base-class pointers

1929282
decrement	increment
instead of scanning the hand arrays for any non-pairs you keep a pairs_counter as part of the arrays or its associated context whenever you add a card to hand i then you checked if hand i 2 you increment the pairs counter if it s 3 you decrement it

1929282
decrement	increment
likewise .when you remove a card if hand j 2 you increment the pairs counter but if it equals 1 your decrement it

1929288
entity-framework	nhibernate
yes this layer can be linq2sql entity-framework nhibernate or any other orm object relation mapping framework

1929289
dictionary	arrays
key-value is used with dictionary types not arrays

1929329
rollback	commit
i d like to see the code for the organisationmergemgr but my guess would be that you have transactionalal staying open .when they are not supposed because there is no explicit commit or rollback call that is made in all situations even if you think it will always participate in a larger transactional these call must be made to guarantee cleanup of transactionalal resources

1929332
constructor	object
occasionally i ll use a separate meaningless key field that s a uuid auto-generated in the constructor or by the object creator

1929346
children	tree
abstract object parent in tree with their children

1929356
binary-operators	operands
binary-operators are predefined for the integral types . for integral types computes the bitwise-and of its operands

1929359
h.264	mp4
.so in flash you can read the video with the format of flv codec .soren.son spark on2 vp6 or mp4 codec h.264

1929374
python	ruby
if you want something localized look for graphics package for whatever language you re comfortable with pygame python gosu ruby

1929380
solaris	aix
how do i declare in c++ that the code that is written is to be built-in either hp-ux or solaris or aix

1929389
hash	md5	salt	md5
for added security you would be better served to save just one cookies as a salt md5 hash of the user s data inorder to provide a potential hacker less information about the user s account data

1929408
virtual-functions	derived-class
the whole points of virtual-functions is to call the same function for a given object no matter what base or derived-class pointsers you re using

1929413
triggers	insert
i ended up modifying the triggers to al.so include the insert deleted data like .so

1929418
attributes	properties
the more subjective debate is whether to use elements or attributes for properties like named etc

1929418
contains	elements
finally add a children elements with the child elementss contains there

1929427
user-controls	ascx
what you can do instead is to have an empty standards aspx and move your code to user-controls - ascx

1929461
process-explorer	perfmon
can we come up with a list of perfmon or process-explorer statistics to watch for with threshold for whats acceptable on a modern machine

1929461
processor	cpu
cpu - of processor time

1929466
order	add
just add another calculated expression as the first order by expression which puts those two value ahead of all others.

1929468
listbox	textbox
what i have is a listbox being populate by a textbox

1929474
radio-button	checkbox
if i understand you correctly i think you mean an object that acts like a checkbox or radio-button but you want that in a menu

1929481
composite-controls	asp.net
well on our asp.net website we have scenarios that control navigation and what composite-controls are used

1929486

1929500
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
it s certainly a de-facto standards - it s supported by latest mysql postgresql oracle sql-server versioning

1929518
sql-server	postgresql
we would like to have our application to be at least sorta db agnostic most notable to be compatible with both sql-server and postgresql

1929518
sql-server	postgresql
we are wanting to be db agnostic .so we can use postgresql here in development and later in our own hosting due to price and let our self-hosting clients use sql-server if they .so wish

1929535
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
works well in mac firefox safari opera pc ie 7 8 but is not working at all in ie6

1929555
uploadify	.post
the only way you can solve this is to pass current page session_id through .post to the uploadify scripting

1929569
credentials	account
having one account per service means that if one is compromised passwd is discovered etc its the only one affected assuming you use different credentials for each

1929571
databound	formview
the databound event of the formview will allow you to find the control but is inappropriate since that only happens once and then the event won t always be bound and it won t fire

1929573
communication	messages
.net s binary-serialization would probably be the fastest out-of-the-box option assuming both sides of the communication mechanism are c# and can load the same assembly contains the messages types

1929588
g++	gcc
gcc g++ v4.4.1

1929590
sql-server	postgresql
hopefully postgresql will allow similar collation options to what sql-server provides in the future doci

1929602
switching	screens
you can implements activity.onpreparedialog int dialog to switching out the messages before the dialog is show on the screens

1929651
value	field
a user table could have a field in it that gets set to true or some value .when a user logs in for the first time which you could subsequently query

1929655
registration	login
you can store one field in the database like uppon the registration and after the first login you just change that to 0

1929657
debugging	trace
as others have pointed out trace only works .when in debugging

1929665
entity-framework	nhibernate
entity-framework and repository-pattern and nhibernate and all such help but none solves the fundamental issues

1929668
value	field
for example .when user fills some form and inputed value don t pass validation it s good practice to show all field with inputed value and to points to incorrect field

1929669
altera	xilinx
those from altera and xilinx are full usage or per product types

1929675
any	set
if you use a normals button and edit an empty templates then you can styles the button to have any content you wish and expose properties that you can set in the xaml for icons etc

1929696
contains	set
we have a a large set of object that include composition and named properties both string value that contains value with a lot of duplication what would be a suitable data structure to store the strings which can be searchable and small

1929707
gentoo	linux
using django 1.1.0 with apache 2.2.10 mod_python 3.3.1 python 2.5.2 with psql postgresql 8.1.11 all in gentoo linux 2.6.23

i ve been experiencing memory problems the .app will run for a couple of iterator then receive low memory warning and finally be terminate while working with nsinvocationoperation in a methods called repeatedly by a nstimer

1929750
thickbox	jquery
the closest thing i have seen to this is the addtolist plugins for jquery here - but it does not use a thickbox styles pop-up

1929751
getter	setter
getter and setter may cause extra code to be produced

1929755
base-class	inherited
for instances you couldn t do it on sealed typess because inorder to maintain the ability to use your types normally you would have to inherited from it in the types you building and you would have to either overrides or shadow every properties on the base-class

1929756
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit versioning run on 64bit via wow64 but the process is still limited to 2gb with a 64bit versioning you can go beyond that to more than a single machine will have

1929758
web-services	api
it allowed us to turn out web-services into an api of sorts

1929760
textbox	button
well conceptually an example of this might be a flash instant messenger with a textbox and button send

1929763
serialization	marshalling
if you don t need the richness of serialization - if you just wanna write a structure to a byte arrays consider the marshalling class

1929776
postback	ajax
i need to be able to tell from within a vb.net class not a user-controls whether or not the current request is a postback and or callback ajax

1929780
debugging	trace
sometimes while debugging a crash you add a line of trace and viola the crash disappears

1929787
contains	any
it s easier to just do a test based on whether a bit pattern contains any of the query characters .when expanded and if .so expand the string and use conventional string-compari.son

1929790
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in firefox safari and google-chrome the onreadystatechange handler nevers gets called

1929790
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i performed the test on a local file in firefox 2 firefox 3 firefox 3.5 safari 3 safari 4 and google-chrome 3 and got similar results here the logs recorded in firefox 3.5

1929824
highlight	selected
highlight selected ranges not on how

1929824
worksheet	excel	highlight	selected
that kind of highlight only occurs in excel .when creating formula on the worksheet not .when one is selected ranges for any other purpose

1929824
highlight	marquee
if you are willing to use a simple input box solution instead of a control on a form then that c# example you gave would work if you use form.show but not form.showdialog but it would not show any special marquee band or other highlight

1929846
scons	cmake	build-system	cmake	build-system	scons
a few years ago i looked into using some build-system that isnt make and tools like cmake and scons seemed pretty primitive

1929870
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
in objective-c class methodss are inherited across subclassinging and more significantly a subclassing can overrides a superclass s class methods s

1929870
nsmutablearray	nsarray
the nsmutablearray subclassing of nsarray overrides +array to return a mutable instances instead

1929879
queue	fifo
.when reading the next messages from a given queue we need to ensure fifo fifo the lowest id from the given queue with the given status

communication	messages
this leaves you with little means to communication proper error information other than using your own error numberss on the over 50000 range which is very cumbersome as the numbers of transalated error codes increases and using the error messages string as the exception-handling information

1929926
protected	public
remember private protected and public are just other methods defined in ruby module class

1929946
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button
the problem is that this change functions fires inconsistently for non textbox input checkbox and radio button in ie

1929959
filesystems	symlink
since the symlink is actually a filesystems file what s happening is that svn thinks that i m trying to commit that symlink as a file for a project in the current directory -- basically what ire originally thought i wanted to do

1929977
vba	vb6
it is not from ms and not about vb6 but since cdate is part of all vba implementation i have seen .so far i suspect it won t make a big difference

1929978
attributes	properties
if named is available as a properties on the classnamed and x named can be used interchangeably as attributes but an error will result if both are specified on the same elements

1929989
debugging	trace
one recommendation i have is to stop debugging by adding trace and use a debugger instead

1929996
callback	methods
first you call animate to hide panels then you use .post or get ajax methods and in callback you call animate to come back to previous state

1929998
32-bit	64bit
all servers are running on archlinux although the staging servers are on 64bit os s while the production is an a 32-bit

1930003
value	field
the commented field above are the default value

1930003
value	field
the password-db field has the value password-file thus this file will need to be named the same and contains the users and their passwd as follows

1930011
attributes	properties
for this to be a viable option you must be able to add attributes to the original properties that you want to intercept

1930012
javascript	dom
usually just by creating an elements with javascript and dom

1930015
stderr	stdout
the process is basically that you fork the child creates a new session the parent exit the child duplicates and then closes open file handles to the controlling terminal stdin stdout stderr

1930016
boolean	int
you want a generics read methods that reads in those from a configuration file and will convert item1 to an int item2 to a boolean and item3 to a string

1930017
numerical	matrix
i m writing a matrix class and i want it to be able to store any different numerical data types - from boolean to long

1930070
instrumentation	profiling
people who use profiling that only do instrumentation or sample the program counter are often satisfied with such small improvements

1930075
mstest	nunit	mstest	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
standards way nunit mbunit myfav or xunit.net havent got around to working with it or mstest

1930079
value	field
where the first 3 bytes contains the char field the fourth is a random value used for padding and the next four bytes are the little-endian representation of the int 122

1930083
configuration	logging
my logging configuration is stored in a separate file

1930088
assign	add
based on your comments on john s answer i think what you want is just to assign the result-of each function-call to a variables either one variables for each or stick them all in a list and then add those results together

1930104
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
it seems to work in ie6 ie8 and firefox 3.5 but it doesn t work in opera and webkit browsers google-chrome and epiphany .

1930131
python	c++
.so judging purely by the criterion set forth in the question the build-system that seems like the best fit is probably waf - pure python provides support for c++ and other languages general powerful not a dsl

1930131
scons	cmake
i tried cmake scons and waf and liked them in roughly that order

1930131
declarative	imperative
cmake s building model for c++ is more declarative and less imperative and thus to me easier to use

1930131
declarative	imperative
the cmake language syntax isn t great but a declarative building with odd syntax beats an imperative built-in python

1930161
relational-database	schema
the huge difference from a traditional relational-database is the lack of a predefined schema in a relational-database you know that table has those columns and you can technically map each row to an instances of a class

1930161
inherited	accessor
if you provide additional information you can defined an extended object inherited from the base one to provide accessor to the enhanced information

1930168
xcodebuild	xcrun
i m using snow leopard + xcode and xcodebuild and xcrun are both present at usr bin

1930168
shell	bash
you can set it in your shell configuration file .bashrc for bash like .so

1930168
linux	unix
however on mac os x sh and bash are the same program this is typical on many unix and linux systemd nowadays

1930198
udp	tcp
let s checked from the client side you can simply use a cmd windows on the client machine and use netstat -a cmd to see all tcp udp connections to and from the machine look for your webservice hosts in there ideally run this cmd close to .when the .app attempts it s call home. can you triggers these phone home call manually

1930215
any	set
updates i understand that if you built-in any cpu mode which all project are set to then .when you register by dropping your assemblies into the component service application it will use 64bit if it s an existing 64bit application

1930226
json	xml
text xml json etc is usually represented in the streaming as utf8 although any encoding is possible

1930227
value	field
since you have a rather large numbers of field in the struct use a parsing or write your own to generator source code to printing the members their named and their value

1930227
value	field
also don t forget that java favorite tostring which returns the field value as a string

1930227
value	field
this technique allows you to iterate over a containers of field and printing out their value using tostring and their named using get_field_named

1930229
selected	checkbox
i then go into loops that creates checkbox for them to selected

1930229
selected	checkbox
.so in the dictionary genre.value would return whether the checkbox is selected or not

1930229
postback	ajax
my problem is .when i try to postback not using ajax for now the action has a null value in the dictionary

1930238
hide	show
click on show desktop to hide all apps

1930239
click	mouse
even on a smaller scale gui application events such as mouse click tend to be asynchronous

1930241
output	cat
for example the scripting used in the linux from scratch walkthroughs make extensive use of heredoc in combinations with the cat cmd and the output redirection operators

1930243
firebird	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	mysql	mongodb	mysql
for make a document managment systemd i m looking at document stores like mongodb but because i have more experience with regular databases firebird sql-server mysql i wonder if is possible model a document store on top a relational one

1930249
synchronous	.when
.when writing classic mac macos 9 and before applications in c a synchronous language if there ever was one you don t have preemptive multithreading .so all potentially blocking systemd call have an async counterpart where you fill a block of data with parameters including a callback

1930251
value	field
i click the button that runs the insert statement and i recieve the following error numbers of query value and destination field are not the same

1930261
webforms	asp.net
the login page is a regular asp.net webforms

1930261
authentication	login
you could add code to the form_load event of the login page to checked if the user is already authentication

1930262
removeclass	addclass
if you need to do it anyway put them in a css class and toggle the class off and on with addclass and removeclass

1930271
contains	set
a set called send_msg1 contains the named of all the servers that have sent msg1

1930280
dictionary	arrays
the best i came up with was creating an arrays initializer inline then initializing the dictionary with the contents of the arrays in a static constructor

1930295
show	next
amplitudes printed next to each index show the power of the frequency get more accurate according to the precision of the resolution

1930305
firefox	gecko
interestingly enough either versioning seems to work fine in ie8 - .so this may be a firefox gecko problem

1930326
promise	future
if you re not using a language with first-class async support start using whatever promise or future or task support that the language does provide jquery s or angularjs s

1930328
shipping	tax
should i just create a tax and shipping manager class and have a tax shipping factory in the constructor

1930332
32-bit	64bit
if not 64bit then it could be an os corruption because it s just there on 32-bit windows

1930333
any	set
i need to know either how to make it work from the configuration file for connections set up in code or how to configurationure it manually in code if anyone has any info

1930360
implements	abstract
i do think you need to abstract away the shipping with an interface that you can implements with a class for each of your shippers usps ups fedex etc and could use a factory class shippingmanager to pass the correct one out or depend on the inversion-of-control to do that for you

1930361
json	xml
you can output it as xml or json ready for loading into another scripting application

1930393
mstest	nunit	mstest	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
coderush s unit test runner release in 9.3 supports more test frameworks out of the box nunit mstest xunit.net and mbunit

1930395
sql-server	mysql
i am working on the sql-server 2005 database for the internal application for my client and the client also got the public facing web application with mysql database

1930395
sql-server	mysql
i do not have any details about this web application but i got the assignment to updates the mysql database on public domain from the sql-server database internal domain on daily basis as auto process

1930404
date-difference	difference
a new date-difference types might make more sense here with a constructor or factory-method taking a base datetime a target datetime and optional a calendar default to cultureinfo.currentculture with which to compute the various difference components years months etc.

1930413
versioning	upgrade
if you decide to upgrade then yes go with the latest versioning

1930439
alpha	rgba
or the 24 bit refer only to the colors and ignore the alpha rgba 8888

1930457
twitter	tweets
here is an example from the documentation for retrieving tweets from twitter

1930462
remote-desktop	rdp
remote-desktop protocols versioning 6.1 changed the way rdp sessions are handled making session 0 which previously meant console session into a non-interactive session

1930482
directory	folder
i can invoke either assembly assembly or assembly directory but for the latter how do i copy the final output to the local jboss deployment folder

1930483
udp	tcp
but with tcp instead of udp

1930483
udp	tcp
you can get udp types behavior over unicast tcp pubsub

1930483
udp	tcp
tcp windows is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1930483
udp	tcp
if you really really really need to use udp and lazy-evaluation acks and .so on then you could stripes out rabbitmq s tcp and probably pull that off

1930502
fadeout	fadein
i m trying to make a div fadein .when another div is click and fadeout again .when another div is click which would be the close button but my code doesn t work did i forget something

1930504
conditional	operators
the operators short-circuiting - that is if the left conditional is false it doesn t bother evaluation the right one

1930504
conditional	operators
similarly the || operators short-circuiting if the left conditional is true

1930506
json	xml
one thing i would think about that i havenâ t seen mentioned yet is that binary serialization will generally create a less bytes to send over the socket however if you use a xml or json serialization and then compress the results using a compressionstream gzipstream

1930532
exchange-server	ews-managed-api
if you are programming against .net 3.5 or above and exchange-server 2007 sp1 or above you can use ews-managed-api which is the client-side api for ews and offers a much cleaner experience than the one provided by auto-generated web service proxy via add web reference menu item

1930536
instances	destroy
you can destroy the object via subscription instances then it ll automatically remove the pointers

1930561
titlebar	icons
what s still missing is a sweet custom icons for titlebar taskbar win and dock mac

1930597
constructor	object
there is more to it one example would be if the constructor of userdao required some other object to be passed as arguments dependencies

1930604
buffering	streaming
the reason behind this is that your streaming will keep your output in a buffering and only write it to a file .when

1930615
sql-server	postgresql
hoping someone has experience with both sql-server and postgresql

1930615
sql-server	postgresql
seeing as sql-server can get i really want to look into postgresql

1930623
callback	methods
i have a winforms .app in c# that call call a methods asynchronously and uses a callback

1930630
put	get
.when i put the mentioned below i now get this error

1930635
fflush	gets
firstly you actually need to write the data to the streamwriter and secondly you need to make sure you close the streamwriter .so it actually gets fflush to the file

1930656
versioning	upgrade
richard dooling s macports on snow leopard explains that to fix the older install of macports which is broken after the upgrade to snow leopard you should just downloading and install the new compatible versioning over the old one and then simply follow the migration instructions - which also say the same

1930663
selected	cell
i have vba code to selected a range of cell on the same row and then merge left justify that selectedion

1930667
internationalization	localization
long story short maybe depends on the systemd the .app is deployed to depends how php was compiled welcome to the cf of localization and internationalization

1930682
downgrade	upgrade
solution would be to upgrade mysql or downgrade phpmyadmin

1930687
sql-server	mysql
but basically you create a dataflow task connect to the sql-server for the source data and use a query to defined what data you are going to copy then you do any transformation needed to make the data fit into the mysql structure and connect to a mysql destination

1930693
margins	padding
and for all block-level elements you can set a verticla margins and padding

1930698
.when	ready
.when i call in a page via ajax that has a ready function on it i can only get it to work using this methods

1930701
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
functionally it works but i m getting the following error .when i checked it unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element eq

1930709
hide	show
just add hide true as show below

1930718
.when	ready
it is used to handle the event of .when all page controls are loading and ready

1930725
revision	svn
my svn repository was perfect at revision 497

1930725
revision	updates
i already ran that cmd and the current revision doesn t appear to be the same as 497 because .when i updates -r 497 or .when i have a 497 working copy and i updates -r head a lot of file updatess occur

1930725
revision	updates	revision	svn
or is it that .when i updates svn goes back through each revision despite the fact that the head and 497 are identical

1930725
revision	updates
it would simply say updates to revision 497. .so is my cmd wrong or is this thinking wrong

1930733
document-ready	.when
the document-ready should fire .when the data is successfully written to the dom

1930743
duplicates	contains	contains	set
the only column with the entitykey set to true was pwsid but that column contains lots of duplicates

1930746
arrays	loops
how can i apply my function for the arrays item text without having to go through an loops

1930752
variables	boolean
if we have 3 boolean variables a b c that is a micro-optimization

1930752
variables	boolean
if we call 3 functions that return boolean variables each function may take a long time and not only is it important to know this short-circuiting but in what order

1930764
updating	updates
if i have a project that depends on several other project and i updates one of those dependencies without updating its versioning numbers thus requiring no change in the parent-pom the parent will never get rebuilt

1930790
duplicates	contains
i m guessing ef is optimizing the .distinct away because it assumes the items can t contains duplicates

1930798
iequalitycomparer	ienumerable
this is an extension for ienumerable that allows you to .distinct for any field or even several ones using lambda which creates iequalitycomparer for you on-the-fly

1930812
nsbuttoncell	nscell
you subclassing nsbuttoncell and overrides one or more of the various draw methods available to nsbuttoncell and nscell

1930840
output	mode
visual-studio will al.so helpfully gray out the code if you ve selected an output mode that doesn t set the defined .so the code will not compile

1930854
http	ssl
i want it to be secure via ssl http

1930863
.net	wcf
you are not supposed to throw .net exception-handling because of the very fact they are .net specific - wcf and soa is by definition system-agnostic

1930870
python	c++
i m not an expert with python but in python the affectation with operators has not the same meaning as in c++ creates a new reference to the same internal object .so there is no points in export c++ s into python interface

1930870
python	c++	copy-constructor	constructor
alternatively in python you can use a copy-constructor of course this constructor must be defined in the c++ python interface

1930871
revision	svn
run svn info to remind yourself what your repository url is then create a new folder and checkout the revision you want

1930882
configuration	installation
if your installation program does have the ability to modify the webserver configuration and you are willing to have it use a self-signed certificate you can scripting the creation of the certificate to allow the domain named to be input

1930884
buffering	streaming
whenever the collections or streaming buffering grows beyond the allocated size of the arrays the arrays gets re-allocated now at double the previous size

1930888
python	c++
if for some reason you need to invoke the c++ assignment-operator from python you can probably haven t tried it myself add a member function to do that like this

1930889
qt-designer	pyqt
qt-designer is also include into pyqt - you can try using it to design your application s gui i m almost sure you ll be able to find web browser component or similar there

1930891
contains	any
contains the code to implements the service and any support helpers methods needed to achieve this

1930915
contains	elements
more specifically you want to use the load methods where you will pass the url of the view that contains the user-interface and then inject that html into a specific elements in the quser-interfacez page dom

1930916
background-image	transparency	background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
one other option to simulate shades is to use transparency png files and setting them as the background-image over the top of a background-color

1930945
icollection	ienumerable
it does not implements any of the usual suspect interfaces like icollection ilist or ienumerable which normally triggers the unrolling

1930956
put	get
if the code is older than the last put to the database then i will just get the html direct from the database and serve it therefore avoiding all the cpu wastage of generator the html

1930960
silverlight	wpf
this is targeting the reduced genericss support in wpf 4 and future silverlight and will include a hierarchy of generics controls

1930964
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
the webserver - apache iis nginx lighttpd or whichever one you happen to use - is the program that knows how to every aspects of ssl connect

1930978
click	mouse
the button draw themselves and checked for mouse click

1930979
buffering	capture
the only problem i could see happening here is that if your files are extremely large you are basically creating a full copy of the file in memory the buffering but ob is intended to capture all output from the scripting except headers and hopefully will do the trick

1931016
getter	setter
back or intermediate it by java.util.calendar with three getter and three setter

1931052
populate	row
get the last populate row in the worksheet via an auxiliary function

data in other cell of the selected range will be deleted

1931059
json	xml
if you are familiar with json format or xml or yaml you can edit initial data by hand

1931080
latex	tex
latex is a program suite developed in the language known as tex

1931084
optional-arguments	arguments
my general rules is if you either have a lot of arguments for a methods more than 3 or 4 or lots of optional-arguments then use an options hash otherwise use standards arguments

1931116
entity	poco
no poco entity classes are strongly connect to framework

1931117
latex	tex
most functionality you see in latex was implements in plain tex

1931119
duplicates	contains
.so an mjpeg might contains a full jpeg image and then subsequent .soi..eoi blocks that do not specify those headers that are duplicates to the previous frame

1931121
latex	tex
latex is a set of extensions on top of tex -- but most people use latex nowadays since tex itself lacks a lot of useful features provided by latex

1931124
tiff	png
can anyone points me to an eclipse-plugin for working with complex binary file-format such as tiff jpeg png etc

1931125
latex	tex
latex is intended to provide a high-level language that accesses the power of tex

1931125
latex	tex
latex essentially comprises a collections of tex macros and a program to process latex document

1931125
latex	tex
because the tex formatting cmd are very low-level it is usually much simpler for end-users to use latex

1931129
triggers	insert
i m insert data into a view that has an instead of triggers that handles all insert

1931129
triggers	insert
what can i do to let ssis know that this view is safe to insert-into because there is an instead of triggers that will handle the insert

1931140
attributes	properties
i have public properties with attributes but .when the .app runs they re null

1931142

or if you want to have the code execute .when the document-ready event fires

1931170
android-emulator	adb-shell
is there any kind of gui tool that i can hook up to the android-emulator to be able to look at the db of a particular .app while i m developing testing or are my only options the adb-shell and creating test activities within my .app

1931179
mach-o	elf
that s a linux x86 elf binary a fat powerpc and x86 mach-o binary and a windows executable just to give some examples

1931182
innodb	myisam
i m looking for documentation on how mysql stores data on disk in particular innodb and myisam

1931224
contains	set
a set can contains recording from more than one table

1931224
contains	set
for example one set may contains 3 recordinging from cities 1 recording from counties and 4 from countries

1931224
contains	set
the table will contains multiple recording for each set all sharing the the set numbers

1931224
contains	set
a table which contains a text column for each entity types which will include a string set with the appropriate entries

1931233
entity-framework	nhibernate
i am not an expert on nhibernate or the entity-framework but i m sure that they also have this support

1931238
latex	tex
.so .when i want to start programming functionality for latex using tex what s my starting points

1931275
latex	tex
tex and latex its follow-up are quite old languages nowadays but are still widespread and often used

1931275
latex	tex
forget about tex use latex

1931275
latex	tex
latex is tex

1931275
latex	tex
but tex is not latex

1931277
google-maps	gps	google-earth	google-maps
this can be consumed by many mapping apis including google-maps and google-earth and there are many tools to convert to from other gps formats

1931279
unsigned	short
unsigned short stringbinding

1931288
put	get
now i realize that there is possibly no perfect solution for that because abstraction can only get to a certain extent and at some points i have to put in strings and hope i never make a typo but i wonder what solutions are

1931292
subtract	time
note if you must have an exact interval of x seconds you would have to keep tracking of the time passed from .when the ajax request was launchd up to the settimeout call and then subtract this timespan from the delay

1931295
android-emulator	adb-shell
i d like to be able to access the android-emulator s user-interface button from the command-line or from a test scripting the back menu or home button. can this be done through the adb-shell

1931299
put	get
it means you ll get best results if you put an index on the column that determines the latest

1931306
symfony	drupal	zend-framework	drupal	zend-framework	symfony
of course i only have 1 or 2 drupal deployment in the wild - most of my stuff is custom work in symfony or zend-framework

1931322
authentication	login
if the email-address is part of user authentication register login etc then you can perfectly combine it with the user activation systemd

1931322
activation	account
send an email with a link with an unique activation key to the specified email-address and only allow login .when the user has activated the newly created account using the link in the email

1931328
arrays	loops
.when you need to access it you should checked the arrayss length first or use a for foreach loops to iterate over each item in the arrays

1931336
player	movie
otherwise the main movie s size is determined by the actual display flash player being in a browser standalone or via air .so you cannot really change it after then movie is actually loaded

1931343
lemon	yacc
consider a parsing yacc lemon or similar

1931346
updating	updates
if the reading dominates and updating is rare and it s not critical that the reading loops be able to see every updates immediately consider using a copyonwritearrayset

1931346
dictionary	map	dictionary	arrays	arrays	map
the problem here though is that neither of these two structures give you your dictionary or associativity arrays storage a la map out of the box

1931349
division	modulo
we can solve this problem by adding the modulo percent sign to our formula to get the remainder of a division operation

1931352
hide	show
it works except it of course show hide on every elements with the appropriate classes not just the one i m hovering over

1931364
put	get
i have tried different html-verbs get put .post - no difference

1931374
mouseover	mouseout
the variables this is bound to the triggers elements in the mouseover and mouseout handler .so you can say .something like

1931380
for-loop	loops
how does one defined variables resulting from iterator in a for-loop or loops in general

1931382
preventdefault	form-submit
return false is more appropriate for something like click for an or a form-submit but really you d probably want to use preventdefault instead

1931399
any	set
i need to find any numbers of intem grouping from 50-100 item set that add up to 1000 2000 ... 10000

1931408
knapsack-problem	np-complete
googling for knapsack-problem should get you quite a few hits though they re not likely to be very encouraging -- this is quite a well known np-complete problem

knapsack-problem	subset-sum
edit if you want to get technical what you re describing seems to really be the subset-sum problem -- which is a special case of the knapsack-problem

1931409
contains	any
and don t forget regexes themselves regex literals can contains any of those things and regexes can also be written in the form of string literals for use with the regexp constructor

1931444
rollback	commit
however the way you are using it in your code you don t need to set it to false everything is done in transactional and you control them with commit or rollback

1931450
show	next
if you really don t want to show parameters in url and both actions are in same application then you can store those parameters in session or flash store and retrieve in next request after redirect

1931454
json	xml
input format could be changed to xml or yaml in adition to json listed above but i am using json within the project and changing format in specific place would not be very good

1931454
json	xml
now i ve switchinged to xml and parsing the data successfully but looking forwarding to any solution that would allow me to switching back to json

1931455
getter	setter
i ve added getter and setter to your classes and wrote the following converter

1931458
attributes	properties
the second task printing both properties and the files resulting from using both these properties in the exclude attributes

1931471
any	set
.so if you want to change max_length in the child then i would recommend that you declare named in the child .so that any class that inherited from nodes will set its own named with its own max_length

1931484
hsqldb	oracle
i m trying to spot-test an oracle backed database with hsqldb and dbunit but i ve run into a snag

1931484
hsqldb	oracle
what s the easiest way for me to convert this to work in both hsqldb and oracle

1931484
hsqldb	oracle
after doing some more research it looks like oracle converts the above snippet to o.startdate + interval 7 day which is apparently more standards but doesn t work in hsqldb

1931496
any	set
i want to create a custom media elements i want to be able to load a video and play any where from 15 secs to 1 min of the video i want to be able to dynamically set this on load up based on user settings

1931508
put	get
there is sprog which lets you graphically building process out of parts get url - process html table - write file and you can put perl code in any stage of the process or write your own parts for non-programmer use

1931514
order	add
mathematics says it s 1 but floating-point arithmetic says it depends what order you add up the terms and in 4 of the 6 possibilities it s 0 because 10 100 + 1 10 100

1931519
pointers	stack
i m trying to sort of harness the global intelligence of stack overflow community to see in your collective experience what have been the most effective ways to teach things like pointers and memory-management to young computer science students

1931519
pointers	stack
ordinary stack variables followed by references followed by pointers

1931526
datagridview	databound
it will automatically updates the datagridview if it is databound to the dataset using the datasource and data-members properties

1931548
.when	ready
.when your plugins is ready for a more permanent deployment you can export it with p2 metadata and use the updates manager to start it up

1931557
webforms	asp.net
i am buser-interfacelding out an ajax enabled user-interface using webforms in asp.net

1931559
contains	any
you can use itertools.ifiltering any time you want to selectively filtering an iterable getting another iterable which only contains those items which satisfy some predicates -- which is why i say this approach is very general

1931579
any	set
i assume that your use-case is that there are multiple multiple threads calling set but for any given value of id the set methods will be called once only

1931590
any	set
i think your question is not complete because read literally the answer is don t set any column widths at all

1931605
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django	ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
then for php there is zend and codeigniter ruby has ruby-on-rails python has django

1931606
contains	elements
if that elements contains some dom elementss that will be manipulated in page load just call page load function at the end

1931624
postdata	request
you re never going to be able to fully hide parameters tools can be used to monitor request and view the postdata parameters

1931628
silverlight	wpf
using wpf silverlight is just one way to rendering your game - but writing the game is pretty much going to required all of the same skills as using other platform

1931633
telnet	tcp	android-emulator	ddms
the android-emulator listens on two tcp ports per instances 5554 for the telnet interface and 5555 for control communication with tools like ddms

1931633
android-emulator	adb
i believe the android-emulator tries to notify a local adb server at startup

1931633
android-emulator	adb
adb devices showed a new android-emulator mdash

1931639
locale	french
the yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss format has a locale language issue on sql-server 2005 an example is french but is fixed in sql 2008

1931653
contains	set
note the region is relative to control on which it is set not your contains control unlike graphics.setclip

1931684
contains	set
more broadly you ll want to think through and map out all the different types of actions you ll be taking ahead of time .so you can set up your table s in a way that can accurately contains the data you want to put into them

1931697
member-functions	inline
yes member-functions that you defined inside the class definition are implicit inline

1931698
licensing	platform
will this eventually be opened up to other automobile manufacturers or is microsoft stuck to only licensing the sync techology to the ford platform

1931710
inlining	inline
about the inlining the compiler will inline a lot of functions .sometimes even whole classes .so to speak anyway even if you don t ask it to do that

1931724
calayer	uiview	core-animation	uikit
each one of those sprites would be hosted in a core-animation calayer or uikit uiview and then animated about the screens

1931725
put	get
from there everything else building on this including how addresses get into the registers process by the alu and put back into memory and or pushed on stack

1931754
windows-vista	windows-xp
please note that this only works on windows-xp and then only .sometimes - on windows-vista and beyond service run in a separate session from interactive users .so you ll never be able to attach to the con.sole on those oss

1931757
triggers	insert
the last time i needed a database transactional logger i used an instead of triggers in the database .so that it would instead of just updating the recording the database would insert a new recording into the log table

1931759
any	set
in terms of efficiency it should be as fast or faster than any other technique here as it only required iterator through the list once only performs one division operation well one set of them and does most of its work with int

1931761
treeview	listview
however in windows forms the treeview and listview or list are completely separate controls that don t necessarily need to be used together at all

1931787
highlight	selected
also you can just rip out all of the javascript stuff since its sole purpose is to allow you to selected highlight a regex in the document and then do some automagic fancy regex - nsstring escaping .when you do a copy command-c in safari

1931787
latex	tex
for high quality printed output though you re almost certainly going to end up using tex latex or one of their derivative

1931789
javascript	dom
the question of why this doesn t happen in ie8 is likely to be one of two reasons either the dom structure isn t exactly the same across browsers or ie8 uses a different strategy for handling dom nodes insert while javascript code is traversal the tree

1931802
numeric	zero
numeric line must have at least two int followed by zero

1931815
any	set
.when set in any fashion

1931826
show	next
if you find traditional for loops simpler than next any and all let us know and we ll show how to recode these uses of the higher abstraction forms into those lower-layer concepts

1931827
order	add
i use stored-procedures for my report and use this code add a barcode image for an order numbers

1931835
linux	unix
i need to generator a timestamp using c# for some data which is to be transfer from one party to another party and i need to know what is the worst case precision of the systemd clock in all operating systemd windows linux and unix

1931836
duplicates	elements
collections allow duplicates elements

1931836
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	set	contains	elements
set â a collections that cannot contains duplicates elements

1931836
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
can contains duplicates elements

1931836
duplicates	contains
a map cannot contains duplicates

1931836
duplicates	elements
in your case i don t think that you want a queue i m not sure you need a map i think you want to allow duplicates elements .so you don t want a set and this leaves us with a list

1931836
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
if the initial list can contains duplicates elements i wouldn t use a map to store matched named because a map cannot contains duplicates key

1931836
contains	elements
but because the logic of the algorithm is still not clear does the initial list always contains an odd numbers of elements

1931839
macros	basic
the basic trick is to use a bit macros magic of get the compiler to help you building the metadata

1931850
printf	scanf
i understand that for scanf it is because the string is just a character arrays which is a pointers but for printf how is it that you can just put the variables named just like you would for an int or float

1931867
any	set
the problem with any long timestamp is that it will be relative to the machine generator it but wont guarantee non-collision on the other systemd as the clocks can be set differently not float but actually be set differently

1931890
sftp	scp	sftp	ftp	ftp	scp
ftp isnt going to respect a symlink though i beleive sftp does while scp or rsync will

1931897
haskell	lisp	haskell	python
you can see these in languages like python lisp haskell etc

1931915
contains	any
this is sort of a weird question -- opml is an xml format with very specific definitions and requirements it s not like just any database-table would contains opml-appropriate data

1931943
solaris	linux
for example priority is different between solaris windows and linux

1931946
solaris	linux
ruby 1.9 has threads but they have lots of problems -- the biggest one is that they don t work the same cross platform priority behaves differently inside a thread will eat the whole process in solaris but not linux nor green-threads etc.

1931951
latex	tex
you could also try starting out with the expl3 programming language which is a layer on top of tex with more consistent syntax more abstracted data-structures and quite a deal more in-built functionality for performing programmatic tasks than latex s kernel

1931957
triggers	insert
3- custom built caching mechanism using file caching bulk insert triggers to convert insert into updates if rows already exist etc

1931961
e-commerce	product
this becomes a problem during say adding product to an e-commerce site that break their product up into category

1931969
realpath	symlink
by using two dirname s and i ran realpath earlier to remove the symlink from the path

1931976
put	get
in short those environment need to be nested in arbitrary ways maintained between instances of user integration a defined x 1 typesd at the scheme repl should presumably result in the user being able later to types in x and get back 1 as the value put inside object model scheme functions since scheme functions close over the environment they are created in etc

1931987
cos	sin
this creates a sin cos pair per iterator

1931987
cos	sin
this methods becomes unstable sooner or later and is not as exact as calling sin cos in loops

1932036
order	join
all these tables join to the order - all the recording returned are related

1932038
debugging	trace
i have left of detail to show its simplicity but still left my trace code that i find essential for first-time debugging

1932048
sql-server	oracle
you can use sqlite in wpf the same way you would use sql-server oracle or any other database -- via ado.net or better via an object-relational mapper

1932060
constructor	object
however you wouldn t be able to control exactly .when the constructor and destructor are called in relation to construction and destructor of other global object

1932063
latex	tex
latex is only a bunch of hacks piled on top of tex

1932065
instances	destroy
if you really feel obliged to clean up the instances one way that works reasonably well though it also has some problems is to use atexit to register a function that destroy the instances

1932090
contains	any
yui contains a javascript-framework that is probably better that any code you can write yourself

1932105
value	field
friendinfo contains friendid and some other field relative to friend info which are quine in this table and iteminfo contains the itemid as primary key and friend id as foreign key i want to execute the join query which selected value from friendinfo table based on friendid and also selected item from iteminfo based on same friendid

1932111
constructor	object
you can have class b constructor register any object created with class a

1932114
python	c++
this .post will feature both c++ and python code

1932130
constructor	private	constructor	object
for singleton pattern make sure you defined private constructor like this to prevent client from creating many object

1932133
sql-server	oracle
oracle doesn t have this problem and neither does sql-server .when run in read committed snapshot mode

1932151
value	field
the price field in shoppingcartitems2 has the correct value for each of the returned items but .when i create a new object columns inorder to bind further down the object chaining the negative price a discount show on the gridview as 0

1932170
push	pull
i created a simple mysqli class for a project i m working on to make it easier and more streamlined to pull from and push to the db

1932192
contains	set
however you should close it if you fetch let s say only the first row from a result set contains about 100 rows

1932200
cryptography	openssl
i noticed from sites like openssl that talk about export laws regarding cryptography software

1932212
ruby	php
i am familiar with only scripting languages like php ruby javascript

1932222
processor	cpu
processor intel pentium r dual cpu t2370 1.73ghz

1932229
binary	hex
i ve used both otool and otx to disassembly various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

1932233
version-control	git
a better option is to get a vps from a provider like slicehost do development on your local machine then use the vps as a staging server and periodically upload changes to the staging server using version-control like svn or git .when multiple developers are involved

1932233
versioning	staging
the benefits to this setup are multiple fast synchronous network response constants connection no dynamic dns tricks the staging versioning of the site is always on even if your localhost computer is not on redundant power managed backup etc

1932235
procdump	dump
i created a dump file after my vs 2008 crash by using procdump

1932237
checkbox	textarea	radio	click
you can change the currently focused elements if that is a input elements textarea textfield checkbox radio or a link which are highlight in a particular way .when you click the key tab

1932245
derived-class	abc
if i want to change my derived-class to add in functionality that is not supported by the abc then my compiler is not recognizing them whatsoever

1932247
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
of course all of the classes could implements the interface but that seems redundant because the children of the abstract will inherited the interface because they extends the abstract-class

1932247
implements	abstract
it seems to me like this is right but in a way this seems redundant because the children of the abstract will need to implements these methods inorder to compile

1932255
implements	abstract	pure-virtual	base-class
polymorphism what you are trying to achieve here works better .when you are using abstract base-classes - .when the methods are pure-virtual in the base-class and implements in any derived classes

1932282
abstract-class	subclassing
do you have more implementation of the interface than the abstract-class or subclassing thereof

1932303
bmp	gif
since this is a batch-file job anyway if i were you i would write out a bmp file a really easy file-format and then use a command-line program like imagick s convert to turn that into a gif

1932304
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
what i ve done in my ruby sphinx adaptor thinking-sphinx is to tracking .when recording are deleted and updates a boolean attributes for the recording in the main index i call it sphinx_deleted

1932311
function-call	inline
i know that inline is a hint or request to compiler and its used to avoid function-call overheads

1932316
hide	show
i have a row of images row1 .when you click on page 2 row1 should hide using this function hide slider and after all of them have hid row2 should show using show slider but these hide and show functions occur at the same time i want the hide function to finish before the show function execute here is my code

1932316
hide	show
how can i have the hide function execute while the show function wait for a go ahead

1932331
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
this blog .post is aimed at thinking-sphinx a ruby plugins for sphinx but the setting value is just passed straight through to sphinx

1932337
value	field
if you wanted to get the value of an initializer object you could change the ownerclass parameter to object object and get the value of the field instead of named

1932339
32-bit	16-bit
even in 32-bit mode the segment registers remain 16-bit

1932339
linux	bsd
second unless you re working on an ancient systemd like a dos extender or something really unusual a lot different from a typical desktop server os like windows linux os x bsd etc. you shouldn t modify any segment registers in any case

1932340
function-call	inline
the keyword here is small - once the function-call overhead is negligible compared to the time spent in the function it s pointless to inline them

1932349
implements	extends
provide the concrete classes that either extends from the abstract-class or extends from another class and implements the interface

1932349
implements	extends
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract-class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract-class cannot be used

1932349
implements	extends
the one arguments for having the abstract-class and the concrete classes implements the interface is that if you were to later change the concrete class to no longer extends the abstract-class then you could forget to also implements the interface which in some cases could break the code without the compiler complaining

1932350
implements	abstract
interface methods are implicit abstract .so if an abstract-class implements an interface there is no need to satisfy the interface contract in the abstract-class

1932350
abstract-class	subclassing
it is fine for an abstract-class to implements an interface as long as all subclassing would otherwise implements the interface but the abstract-class should not contains the implementss methods

1932350
implements	abstract
interface methods are implementation specific unique to the implements class whereas abstract states and behavior are meant to be common or shared amongst implementation

1932366
.net	wcf
the recommended way to write web-services in .net is using the windows communication foundation wcf

1932369
managed-code	unmanaged
you cannot free unmanaged memory from managed-code

1932371
function-call	inline
the inline specifier is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to generator code for a call of fac inline rather than laying down the code for the function once and then calling through the usual function-call mechanism

1932371
function-call	inline
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the points of call is to be preferred to the usual function-call mechanism

1932373
getter	setter
as a rules of thumb i usually inline only getter and setter

1932386
value	field
instead of null i want to show the actual value from mytable mytable has id field as identity-column and contains a few rows

1932394
windows-vista	windows
like what windows did in volume mixer in windows-vista and seven

1932402
unmanaged	bstr
the bstrs on the other hand are allocated using the windows api sysallocstring and are free by syfreestirng and since the clr interop layer knows about these windows apis it knows how to free a bstr it got from unmanaged code

1932414
user-controls	itemtemplate
i have a listview in my wpf user-controls using an itemtemplate to display the items

1932414
selected	button
.when i selected one item and then click on the button of another item the previously selecteded item is still selecteded

1932414
selected	button
i wonder how to automatically selected the item the button is in .when the button is click

1932457
file-descriptor	pipe
stdout can be connect to anything that can be opened as a file-descriptor - like a disk file a network socket or a pipe

1932493
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
i know that dynamic-sql queries are bad due to the sql-injection issues as well as performance and other issues

1932493
sql-server	mysql
is enought protection against sql-injection issues against sql-server only not mysql

1932493
sql-server	mysql
my question is only for sql-server and i know that mysql has some issues with the character

1932496
any	set
the problem is the code is getting stuck in client.execut methods its not moving furthur neither i am getting any response.do i have to set any proxy

1932497
communication	messages
to solve it you have to put the communication in a while true loops and to stop the connection in a correct way send an end-of-connection messages

1932498
qt-creator	cdt
.when confronted with a big problem i tend to use either eclipse cdt or qt-creator in both cases the latest versioning versioning from a year back are not really .so nice

1932513
variables	boolean
is with a boolean variables like this and then have the code do different things depending on the value of the variables

1932518
javadoc	doxygen
this works for c# c++ c java and vb with docxml doxygen qt or javadoc format comments and does a lot of the work for you automatically generator good base documentation from your naming detection and documenting throw exception-handling and keeping the comments tidy with words wrapping etc

1932526
protected	public
access specifications public protected or private and

1932551
contains	elements
the arrays is actually longer and contains about 40 elements

1932551
contains	elements
there will be other arrays that contains a different numbers of child elements

1932563
perl	lua
assuming you don t want to write your own engine you can can look at generalized macros processor m4 gema ... or directly to interpreted-language perl lua ... to help you

1932563
any	set
in the end it really depends if you need to create something for a given set of rules or if you need to be able to read and interpreter any set of rules

1932580
function-call	inline
a compiler may inline replace a call to the function with code that performs that action of that function any function-call that it chooses

1932592
iprincipal	iidentity
i wondered if that is possible implements iprincipal and iidentity

1932600
jeditorpane	jtextpane
i m having same problem but seems the answer is that you should use jeditorpane or jtextpane instead of jtextarea

1932610
data-members	instances
if the data-members is just a std map instances then it will be copy-paste as part of your shallow clone in any case .so there is no need to do the std copy in the deep clone case it s not trying to do anything different

1932631
contains	elements
it has functions for removing css for whole pages or individual elements and their contains elements or for altering css on-the-fly whilst viewing the page

1932631
default	reset
this is a set of css styles that will reset the default rendering in each browser to the same common base to use as a starting points for applying your own styles

1932632
erlang	python
i m not sure whether this is better than python wsgi like django-middleware and there is already ewgi for erlang

1932635
required	checked
it will be best to add the cards through a for-loop programmatically setting the tag of each card like x+1 to x+52 make them respond to same action and in checked the frame for the matching frame of your card in this is a little bit tricky but much less effort is required and the things will be much more handlable

1932638
exception-handling	error-handling
you would have to create a view in your .app that send you an error mail .when called then put error-handling in your javascript that send your error information to this view .when an exception-handling occurs and is caught

1932671
updating	updates
you could just do the checked for the updates path too before updating

1932687
subset-sum	np-hard
if you redefine the problem as finding a subset whose sum equals the value of the complete set you will realize that this is a np-hard problem subset-sum

1932699
cross-compiling	qmake
specify mkspec file to qmake to cross-compiling by using -spec command-line arguments of qmake

1932708
value	field
field is the column to sum the value

1932712
sql-server	postgresql
i have only used sql-server and not much postgresql .so i can only answer for sql-server

1932712
failover	san
if you are serious you can set up a failover cluster with a san for storage but that is not really a load balancing setup in itself

1932712
sql-server	postgresql
asp.net libs are obviously very well written for sql-server but i would believe there exists good alternatives for postgresql as well

1932723
copy-constructor	temporary	temporary	copy
the compiler has the right to perform a copy of the temporary object and required an accessible copy-constructor even if it won t be actually called

1932736
logout	login
that s also one of the major reasons that i d suggest to just logout the previously logged in user instead of preventing the login

1932747
searchable	xapian
what really saved me one time was the ability to attach transient non searchable data to an indexed item attaching the db id to all data indexed for that recording very good for then going and getting the whole recording from the db .when your matches come back from xapian

1932752
temporary	copy
keep the changes in memory or work on a temporary copy

1932761
implements	super
a nice simple way to do it would be to subclassing a uitableview and implements the touch methods not forgetting to pass them to the super afterwards

1932770
haskell	prolog
what kind of problems is better solved in prolog than in haskell

1932770
haskell	prolog
is there a haskell libs kind of a logical solver that can mimic prolog functionality

1932778
defined	declare
in short a declarative language declare a set of rules about what output should result from which input and uses those rules to deduce an output from an input while a functional language declare a set of mathematical or logical functions which defined how input is translation to output

1932778
haskell	prolog
as for the added question none that i know of but you can either translation haskell to prolog or implements prolog in haskell

1932781
checkbox	button
checkbox in gridview with button

1932795
constructor	object
an alternate way to do this would be to create a date object passing the input time into the constructor

1932815
execute	declare
the second declaration only declare the outer function but then it s neither stored nor execute .so it s just throw away

1932818
haskell	prolog
prolog is a logic-programming language whereas haskell is a functional language

1932824
lightbox	jquery	fancybox	lightbox
try fancybox or jquery lightbox plugins

1932824
lightbox	jquery
with jquery lightbox you just call lightbox function

1932828
python	java	python	c++	haskell	lisp	haskell	c++	haskell	python
most notably c++ and java but also python haskell lisp and perhaps a few others

1932850
checkbox	textbox
and it seems to be binding correctly and changing the value of xmlelemmux accordingly if i click the checkbox or change the textbox

1932858
silverlight	wpf
choosing wpf or silverlight or anything else for that matter on the basis that it is trendy seems to me to be just plain silly unless you are trying to impress a girl or a pointy haired boss

1933029
contains	set
have you checked if you really set the size of the jframe or of a contains jpanel

1933037
order	join
it really depends on the size of the redundant data -- but having to do multi-select statements really is the kiss of death .when you have a large numbers of rows because it has to do looping and can t do any more sophisticated types of join on the server side but perhaps more importantly -- if your logic is making many database call those are happening across process network boundaries which in and of itself is an order of magnitude slower

1933057
required	checked
it just required half an hour spent reading and digesting the document and another half hour writing a quick set of tests to checked your assumptions are correct

1933066
value	field
the contract is that object for which equalss returns true must return equals hashcode value but in your class above the field id and rolename are independent

1933066
value	field
the practice is to use the same field to generator the hashcode value as are used by the equals methods and in the same order

1933093
protected	public
in oop terms a and b should be protected in your class and c is public available for whoever uses your class

1933108
linked-list	nodes
.when append to the last nodes naive implementation of linked-list would result in o n iterator time

1933108
linked-list	nodes
however good linked-list libs would account for the most common uses and special case accessing the last nodes

1933109
exception-handling	try-catch
in the situation you describe ie not using a smart pointers you have to free the resource in the destructor and if the constructor of someclass throw an exception-handling with a try-catch block

what i am concerned about is avoiding temporary data-structures other than lists due to limitations of the language i m using organizing these items into a temporary tree for example would be unpleasant

1933119
exception-handling	try-catch
to write exception-handling safe code use smart pointers or use try-catch blocks in the body of the constructor

1933130
linked-list	nodes
if you don t mutate the nodes of your simply linked-list you need o n time to insert at an arbitrary positioning in the list because you need to copy all the nodes from the beginning of the list to the positioning of the new elements

1934652
put	get
i really tried to put together as much as i could for people to get rolling

1934662
bufferedinputstream	inputstream
i m not sure that it will completely close the performance gap but you should be able to use the imageio.read methods that takes a inputstream and pass in a bufferedinputstream wrapping a fstream

1934669
shell	bash
you could use php on the server side or bash shell scripting it doesn t matter to the javascript code that is generator by gwt

.so a regular .source.send messages will go into my c++ .app go to the c libs which will send the messages the connection will get it then call the callback which goes back into my c++ libs and the connection tries to notify all observers which at this points is the python class here .so it call that methods

1934898
python	c++
.so my c++ python wrapper for my observers class looks like this now

1934898
python	c++
.so i am thinking that this time i have a problem calling into my c++ .app rather then calling into python

1934908

my team however is evaluation gae for use on an all-new project and our existing experience is with turbogears not django

1934976
copy-constructor	constructor
if you don t defined a constructor the compiler will generator a default-constructor however if you do defined a constructor like a copy-constructor the compiler won t generator the default-constructor .so you need to defined that constructor too

1935078
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
for example all of the code that you write in php or python ruby perl java c... should never be seen by your users

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
should work on google-chrome firefox and safari on windows too

1935145
double	int
you re getting the out-of-memory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more spaces than ints-an int representation will also save you spaces

1935154
processor	cpu
on these processor non-aligned access causes a processor exception-handling which - depending on cpu os and settings - will cause a process crash or just a lot of work for the os

1935165
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if you need something that works cross-browser firefox google-chrome safari and ie you could look at firebreath

1935166
constructor	object
given these facts the field is reset to 0 after an exception-handling object is deserialized which is certainly different from what it is set to in constructor

1935172
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if you decide to go the plugins route firebreath is a project that lets you create a plugins that you could do rendering from that will compile to be both an npapi plugins firefox google-chrome apple safari and an activex control ie

1935178
stateless	stateful
the reason why we chose to use a stateful bean over a stateless bean was because we need to open a database connection to an unknown database and perform queries on it

1935181
findwindow	setparent
look for findwindow getclassname and setparent at

1935187
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.15 gecko 2009102814 ubuntu 8.04 hardy firefox 3.0.15 dies .when trying this

insertion-sort	heapsort	insertion-sort	selection-sort	insertion-sort	quicksort	selection-sort	heapsort	selection-sort	quicksort	quicksort	heapsort
i ve checked quicksort merge sort heapsort d-ary heapsort insertion-sort selection-sort all do not answer the requirement which leads me to believe there s a need for a specific algorithm for arrays of length 5

1935229
arrays	map
map the arrays file a section at a time and .when you are done unmap and move to the next section

1935229
linux	unix
and if you do this on linux unix the systemd s disc block caching may speed things up depending on your algorithm s arrays access patterns

1935260
python	java
if you re looking for something like the remote api that the .app engine has in python then you ll be dis.appointed to find it missing in java

1935260
json	xml
that said absolutely nothing stops your from hitting your .app and .posting data either through .post json xml any other format you can think of

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function-call for apc xcache shared-objects

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached does not have any bytecode or php acceleration features which is why i would run it side-by-side with apc or xcache

1935270
transparency	frame
as an alternative to chad s option you could also do this by creating a frame and using java s transparency windows capability to make the frame transparency or translucent if you want a hint that it s there and using mouse entered exited events to return the frame to its normals solid opacity

1935309
installation	environment
it is set via a combinations of an environment variables pythonpath and a base set of directory specific to your installation

1935340

1935341
ubuntu	linux
i am now migrating most of my apps etc to linux ubuntu 9.10 to be precise

1935429
stateless	stateful
say whatever comes to your mind in terms of security application types stateless stateful db call or anything else

1935445

1935454
show	next
first i want to checked if div exists in body and then show the next div after the current div

click	mouse
to add a cursor you would have to keep some variables with mouse x y and an event on mouse click

1935474
user-interface	look-and-feel

1935487
malloc	strdup	malloc	free	calloc	strdup	calloc	malloc	calloc	free	strdup	free
on calling free you should call free once and only once on the non-null value returned from malloc calloc or strdup

double	int
why you re using a double is also a mystery unless you want to process really large-files - i d be using an int or a long for that

expression	evaluation
sql uses uses a strange and sometimes counterintuitive three valued logic in evaluation expression where nulls might be involved

1935521
firefox	safari
however .when i run this in firefox and safari latest versioning on mac the named is not returned

1935524
defined	declare
a safer way to link to sources would be to defined another java project which would link to hive sources and compile them then declare your hadoopdb as depending on the hive project

1935541
phpunit	kohana
i m starting work with phpunit with kohana

1935549
python	perl
if you ll use pl perl or pl python if i recall correctly you will get session variables for free

1935560
callback	methods	instances	self
it should not be an instances methods of course and remember that lambda actually creates a closure hence be sure not to leak any reference to self in the callback

1935560
arguments	default	instances	self	instances	destroy	destroy	self
if you need data from the destroy instances use the func default arguments approach just be sure never to reference self inside the lambda otherwise it won t work

1935658
multiplication	polynomials	multiplication	addition
i know that the standards construction of f is to take an irreducible polynomials f of degree n in gf p and then view elements of f as polynomialss in the quotient gf p x f and i have a feeling that this is probably already the right approach since polynomials multiplication and addition should be easy to implements but i somehow fail to see how this can be actually done

1935674
triggers	insert
what should i use since my triggers rely on the updates table that contains the updates row and use it to insert to another table or the same table with new pk.

1935675

contains	any
this works on any model that i invoke it with returning an arrays of size 1 contains the object of the model

1936018
subtraction	time
don t know any specific article but i think the rationale is simply that this way you get the numbers of resulting elements via simple subtraction 1-0 1 instead of having to add 1 there which you would forget half of the time anyway

redmine	trac
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugins

mac-address	ssid
you ll be needing mac-address ssid and signals strength of nearby wifi router for the geolocation api

1936199
data-structures	tree
if you want to do arbitrary lookup from a given key you ll simply need to write some helpers methods to iterate through your plist data structure or perhaps a bit cleaner is to create a couple classes to encapsulate those data-structures and create a tree of those classes .when the .app starts up

1936199
dictionary	arrays
.so you can then presume that all the key in the top-level arrays of dictionary are wire gauges and the value for each key are the wire options

1936221

the basic extension methods is to write macros but if you wish to implements an embedded editor then you will need to get more advanced - an add-in package or for vs2010 you can now make an extension

1936227
temporary	copy
because of limitations on available ram you then have to make a lower-res copy of it by smooth-scaling it down yourself or to copy it into a modifiable buffering if the image is large you may need to write it in bands to a temporary file release the unmodifiable data block and load the data back from file

python	c++
vice versa in python plain assignment is not an operators .so you cannot overload that while in c++ it is an operators and you can overload it

1936375
python	c++
is an operators and can be overloaded in both languages -- that s how and while not losing their initial connotation of left and right shifts also became i o formatting operatorss in c++ not in python

1936379

i may also need to change databases if oracle pull a surprise move on mysql users in which case i will need to somehow export the data into another database

1936395
gridview	listview
note both vb and c# never show the object or events of elements that are placed inside naming containers gridview listview

1936405
windows-xp	windows
this scripting works in windows-xp but now i want to run it in windows 3.11

1936412
sql-server	oracle
however oracle supports connecting to other databases via odbc just as sql-server has it s linked-server capability

1936415
hide	show
but the splash show up even .when login show and i have told the splash to hide

1936423
hide	show
al.so the load event fires before the form is show .so you re calling hide before the form is show in the first place

1936426

despite thinking this is something that required manual intervention one thing you could do is checked the size of the image

1936430
png	gif	tiff	gif	tiff	png
logos are more likely to be jpg png or gif floorplans are possibly going to be tiff or other lossless format - but that s no guarantee

1936434
delphi	c++
i even use delphi forms in my c++ project

1936440
subclassing	accessor
if you want the calculation to happen automatically you possibly have to subclassing qscriptclass and re-implement the properties accessor function

contains	elements
the value variables is now an arrays that contains on each arrays elements the inner text of each span matched by your selector

1936480
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

1936487
instances	self
float is immutable therefore its __init__ the initializer is basically a no-op -- nothing substantial can happen there because the self object cannot be altered if it s actually an instances of float rather than of a subclassing -- but of course float s own __init__ must operate on that assumption

1936487
constructor	object
it s a common mistake to believe that __init__ is a constructor it s not it takes an already-constructed object as its first arguments self and initializer it if feasible if that self is mutable

1936493
value	field
if you don t care about which field contains the value then you use the multi-column syntax

1936513
internet-explorer	firefox
the only problem is that due to security in both internet-explorer and in firefox the xmlhttprequest object is not allowed to make cross-domain cross-protocol or cross-port request

i have used state machine compiler in java and python project to with success

1936589
updating	updates
i have a few pretty large model that i assist in updating and the most important thing i have noticed about the updates model from wizard cmd in ef v1 is that it does not delete anything from the csdl

1936598
protected	public
my solution is to create an interface that provides the public access points for the protected methods and then subclassing the manager class and mix in that interface

1936598
protected	public
the public methods will then call its super s protected methods

1936601
versioning	migrate
the current versioning will open visual-studio project and .solution files .so zero knowledge is needed to migrate to it

1936609
contains	any
there is no way to read the data of a graphics object which is essentially what contains the information that you are after. this applies to any vector-graphics object that has already been draw either by the graphics drawing api itself or in flash-cs3 cs4 or was embedded using the embed meta-tag

1936609
export	csv
your best bet if you need to calculate the algebraic area or for some other reason retain the vectors in your algorithms is definitely export an svg or some single-purpose format like a csv of the points from illustrator and parsing that in actionscript

1936616
bash	zsh
note that afaik the construct is not standards but seems to have been supported in both bash and zsh for a while now.

git and svn and mercurial etc is great for version-control but keeping systemd in sync often required more than version-control

1936677
virtualenv	fabric
if you are a python types person you might enjoy reading tools of the modern python hacker virtualenv fabric and pip

1936677
python	ruby
pip and virtualenv are more python specific in capturing additional libs changes etc. but ruby ruby-on-rails probably have something equivalent

1936686
implements	extends
create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget methods move the java code from the jsp file into this methods map this servlet on a certain url-pattern and your problem should disappear

1936709
margins	padding
we can set the padding and margins properties of an elements e using either pixels or percentage

1936709
contains	elements
thus if e is declare directly inside elements then the contains block is and percentage value refers to width of elements

1936713
attributes	properties
you can use xml attributess to control how your properties and field should be serialization to xml as an attributes as a specific elements not at all ...

1936745
c-preprocessor	macros
these macros are defined by all gnu compilers that use c-preprocessor c++ objective-c and fortran

1936758
json	xml
if later you wanted to use a database or json instead of xml you could write a different gateway but wouldn t have to touch your custom classes

1936764
ubuntu	debian
both work well but upstart is more manageable more tools but required a newer systemd ubuntu fedora and debian is switching soon

1936776
required	checked
if this scripting works on another server i d checked that the scripting can find everything it needs to include or required

1936779
versioning	migrate
the blog has been though various updates including from wordpress versioning 2.1.3 .when the default table charset changed from latin1 to utf8 and been migrate to and from various machines and i guess at some points wordpress must have written utf8-decode characters into the database that had a charset of latin1 or vice-versa

1936784
contains	set
call process.start passing a processstartinfo contains the named of the file and with the processstartinfo.verb set to properties

1936793
contains	elements
the event doesn t actually occur on the elements that is obscured by another unless the other elements is contains in the first then it will bubble up

1936793
contains	any	contains	elements
the only way that i can think of to achieve what you want is to go through all of the potential elementss and see if any of them contains the points at which the click occurred and triggers a click on that elements if it s not the current one

1936807
data-access	ado.net
would i get any performance gains if i replace my data-access part of the application from nhiberate to straight ado.net

1936807
nhibernate	ado.net
i know that nhibernate uses ado.net at its core

1936838
create-table	alter-table
if you actually need to create new tables or columns named after the arrival time your scripting would need to call create-table or alter-table add column etc with the formatted date string

1936840
lookup	any
weel as i want to keep my entities clean without any database lookup i can t do it like you sugested

1936860

then to generator external documentation use doxygen which reads javadoc happily

1936877
linux	unix
elf used by linux and other unix clones

1936895
margins	padding
as tor mentioned the elements can have margins borders and padding of its own

1936919
python	c++
perhaps something like c++ would actually be a better example than python for that reason

1936922
nhibernate	ado.net
as you mention nhibernate sits on top of ado.net and provides a layer of abstraction

1936922
nhibernate	ado.net
nhibernate has a lot of ways to improve performance and if you really know it well you can get it to perform quite close to ado.net

1936922
nhibernate	ado.net
there are some situations where you could actually get worse performance .when switching form nhibernate to straight ado.net

1936922
sql-server	oracle
for example if you are using sql-server it might generator slightly different sql than if you are using oracle

1936931
chipmunk	box2d
take a look at cocos2d-x for the iphone which also include a choice of 2 collision engines chipmunk and box2d

1936944
put	get
edit it seems i did not explain the problem enough clearly but i get nice answer about the map object which easily put together what i needed

1936968
bubble-sort	quicksort
i vote for quicksort which is more elegant than bubble-sort and easier to understand too

1936981
value	field
each value of types a t must have a field f with the types

1936981
value	field
each value of types u must have a field g with the types for any a

1936983
contains	any	contains	elements
in any case something obvious if there aren t any whitespaces in the input string strsplit returns an arrays contains exactly one elements - the original string itself

1936987
positioning	slider
how do i say slider an elements a few pixels to the side from its initial positioning using jquery

1936988
display	width
display inline on the images will let them wrap around to the next line based on the containers s fixed width

1937015
margins	padding
.so in your case where you want to slider over to the left a bit you ll be wanting to adjust the left-hand margins or potentially add padding to the right depending on your existing styles and layout

1937017
deep-copy	object
inorder to do a deep-copy you need to create a copy of the object referenced by bar.foo

1937017
copy-constructor	deep-copy
note this solution delegation the decision of whether the copy-constructor new foo constfoo also does a deep-copy to the implementation of the foo class.

1937017
deep-copy	object	shallow-copy	deep-copy
the question as written is very confusing - it asks for the value of the pointers of the copy-paste from object that doesn t sound like a deep-copy to me that sounds like a shallow-copy this

1937027
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
you can use a skew transform in firefox safari and google-chrome

1937046
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
1 avoid having your non-rest web service business-logic-layer make further restful http request onto the data-access-layer

but much more importantly it would required you to deploy the bll web-services and the dal web-services onto separate webserver instances or separate clusters

1937055
stderr	stdout
if you want to capture the output of any scripting then on a nix-y systemd you can redirect stdout and stderr to a file

1937059
contains	elements
the sub-menu is simply a div elements contains items links

1937061
transparency	frame
there s a loophole around this problem if you make your frame visible but borderless and fully transparency it will be visible in the technical sense but invisible to the user for practical purposes

1937063
stderr	stdout
just redirect the subcommand s stderr to get mixed into its stdout

1937117
onmouseover	mouseover
since mouseover events from child elements bubble propagate to the parent i would use a timer that is cancelled in the onmouseover event of the sub menu s div if i was going the non-library route

1937117
put	get
al.so i ve put a 300ms timeout because i think it s best to have this .sort of thing .so that if you accidentally mouseout you have a short windows to get the mouse back in before it hide

1937120
scriptaculous	jquery
drag drop mechanism is relatively easy with jquery or scriptaculous we use both .so i am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two

1937135
python	c++
i have no idea how to get my c++ data to python

1937144
aggregate-functions	sum
to get the benefit of a grouping by clause you need an aggregate-functions max sum count etc

1937185
hide	show	transparency	frame
one is to capture the mouse moving over it make it transparency undecorated or otherwise acceptably out of the way and .when the mouse move over it show the new frame or panels and then hide that .when the mouse move out of it

1937185
transparency	frame
the other answers here give you the basic on how to capture the mouse events and set the frame undecorated and transparency

1937187

1937263
stderr	stdout
having the console is good for debugging since it is where stdout and stderr are output to by default

1937276
virtuoso	tdb
for example you could use a store like virtuoso or a jena based store jena sdb tdb to do this basically any store that supports the sparul language or has it s own equivalent

1937289
constructor	object
also in the second example i m converting the age object to an int in person.getage which is convenient but somehow feels wrong since person s constructor takes an age object

1937297
specifications	w3c
.so i ve been trying to figure out how to process generator the xml signature but honestly it s all a bit confusing as w3c specifications aren t exactly lighting reading

1937303
pbkdf2	salt
it effectively just applies pbkdf2 repeatedly with the same passwd and salt but also an iterator count

1937316
double	int	primitive	int
it s getting used to thinking about the world less in terms of primitive like double int and strings and more in terms of object that represent better abstractions that encapsulate and hide details from clients

1937329
linux	unix
but having a winelib ports allows you to better integrated with the unix env which may be what you want for a true linux .app

administration	account
please checked building agent windows service is running under administration user accound but not under local systemd account

1937370
postgresql	mysql
related to your database choice i d seriously look at using postgresql instead of mysql

postgresql	mysql
in my experiance with the two postgresql has show to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1937440
png	gif
you can t find this in png or gif files

1937446
ubuntu-server	ubuntu
the following hpricot code successfully extraction the stperiods in the xml on two of my machines vista and an ubuntu-server but fails on another ubuntu laptop

1937480
arrays	loops
and to loops over each elements of the data arrays you can use something like this

1937488
anonymous-function	function-call
if for whatever reason you need to wrap a function-call with anonymous-function you can use the apply or call to pass the this-pointer of the outer scoping to look

1937512
any	set
it may seem redundant to set to true repeatedly but assign a literals value to a variables ought to be an insignificant expense in any language

1937520
colorbox	jquery
i m trying to open a jquery colorbox from a link outside the rest of the colorbox images

1937520
colorbox	jquery
all of the colorbox examples just show what s in the first code block and i m no jquery expert

1937521
hash	md5
.so far i ve concatenation the information and computed a md5 hash of it using the .net classes ...

atom-editor json xml xml+http

1937595
launchd	daemons
it automatically launchd a daemons and the daemons fork an instances of the shell

1937595
.when	ready
it then display the .when it is ready for input and seems to work but sending delete characters to it just confuses it and it doesn t properly handle deleting

1937598
any	set
remember to set your header value before any output has been sent unless you re doing output buffering for your entire page

1937612
selected	textbox
the first one is .when i don t selected the textbox

1937638
subclassing	superclass
as i understand it subclassinging is not encouraged because objective-c allows a subclassing too much access to the internal workings of its superclass

1937658
textbox	button
how do i differentiate the button button from textbox value txt or dropdownlistfor value ddl

1937662
superclass	inherited
sometimes confusion w.r.t diamond inherited hierarchy where the final class inherited from 2 superclass 1 class is inherited public

1937662
malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
the other is inherited virtual public then defining a static const member that points to a dynamic memory region via new malloc calloc etc would result in a double free error

1937669
value	field
i think you can building your model the contact class and in the edit view you should allow only field that can be edited and hide or set as not editable the field you don t want to be edited then in your controllers you ll get the original contact and updates it with the value of the field you allowed in the edit view like

1937683

contains	set
inorder to set runtime options for applications created with cobol for aix one must set the environment variables cobrtopt to contains the options to be set

1937698
subclassing	nsobject
if the available controllers heirarchy does not serve your needs in terms of handling data my assumption since we don t know why you want one object to be the datasource for multiple views you can always create additional data and or controllers classes subclassing of nsobject at least

1937712
font-size	display
however the text in the category axis can be too long to display on the charts .so flex adjusts the font-size automatically to the points that the data is either unreadable or the text is partially visible

1939190
librsvg	cairo
the cairo libs website has examples on drawing svg using librsvg

1939190
librsvg	cairo
both the cairo and librsvg libs should be sufficiently cross-platform to do what you need and with wxcairo it should be possible to dock them onto wxwidgets

i want to use object s field s value while creating another object using literals notation

1939476
binary	hex
native dlls contains binary instructions mostly unstructured data and there is in general no way to work out what the data means - for example somewhere in the dll may be the two bytes in hex 43 23 and there s no way to tell whether the program will interpreter these as the characters c# or as the int 17187 or a memory-address or even an instruction to feed to the cpu

1939492
.when	ready
one thing i notice is that .when i write.table the files are ready right away whereas i always have to close r for the jpegs to be printed

1939494
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that though the overlay is opening as expected however the text is appearing under it in ie 7 while that does not happen in firefox or google-chrome obviously not

1939502
http	ssl
first you should navigate the needed http url with your browser and export the cert using ssl properties don t remember how it is done in ie but in firefox something like security view cert details save-as -- still not sure because using non-english licalization any x509 types should work

note that simply adding hyperlink on the other table columns besides col 1 is not desirable because i want a click in that row even not on top of the hyperlink to fire that hyperlink

1939647
javascript	dom
i understand that i can t use javascript to grab the xml file as it s on an external domain but can i use php to grab the xml from the server and then make it available to jquery as an xml file or other dom structure .so i can then traversal that xml using for example

1939653
arrays	loops
a foreach loops provides the fastest iterator over your large arrays based on comparison testing

this creates a new string arrays every single time through loops invalidating the previous assignments

1939727
instances	private
making these private to an instances will prevent this

is it possible to get information about any binary on os x to determine if it s a 32-bit or 64bit binary

1941826
32-bit	64bit
for some methods 64bit was nearly 10 time faster than 32-bit

1941826
32-bit	64bit
the answer below states this is due to 64bit arithmetic in a 32-bit .app

1941826
32-bit	64bit
if i use array.length performance for the first for-loop is pretty good in 64bit but not 32-bit

besides that the runtime recognizes the pattern and omits the bound checked for arrays accesses inside loops

1941844
32-bit	64bit
this will not happen in the longlength case and will result in decreased performance both for 32-bit and 64bit case

1941852
unique	words
this function currently in my iter_util module is o n n being the length of each words and you would use set splice .. with set operations such as difference to get splice unique across all wordss example below

1941864
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
activerecord provides much more functionalities such as translation scoping in queries or support for single-table-inheritance

1941868

updates seem to have found a solution if i create a variables for the httpapplication on init of the httpmodule this all occurs in the httpcontext can be accessed from that variables

1941871
basic	vba
vba visual basic for applications is the classic way to write office-automation

1941871
macros	vba
on the plus side deployment is trivial and vba offers nice features like macros recordinging which recording your actions into code and provide a good way to figure out the object-model

1941871
worksheet	excel
once added gain the same status as the built-in excel functions you can call them from worksheet like myfunction

1941871
macros	vba
this is arguably desirable but at the same time excel power-users usually know how to use vba and macros and expect to be able to tweak the code

1941871
macros	vba
personally i typically use vsto for add-ins and i use it as soon as i see that lots of logic procedural code is going into macros in vba

32-bit	64bit
however php s documentation is a little fuzzy on the details .so if you need a double which is 64bit long instead of float s 32-bit then you ll need 53 bits

1941898
32-bit	64bit
on intel macs i386 is 32-bit and x86_64 is 64bit

1941900
.net	wcf
here was my previous .post .net wcf service references use server named rather than ip-address causing issues .when consuming

1941916
logfile	tail
debugging is more of a tail -f on the logfile slightly java-ish

1941924
32-bit	64bit
for 64bit longs you need two registers on 32-bit and we have only four registers .so chances are high that all variables cannot be stored in registers but must be stored in intermediate storage like stack

1941924
32-bit	64bit
for every 1-cycle 64bit variables you need two cycles for 32-bit to load unload a long-integer into memory

1941924
32-bit	64bit
the speed gains of an order of magnitude is the reason gpus still prefer floats 32-bit instead of double 64bit

1941928
data-structures	dictionary
what makes it complicated is that the value for this dictionary is a generics itself which is a list of complex data-structures of types account

1941930
build-process	msbuild
i ve detailed this in the article inside msbuild see section extends the build-process

1941934
.net	wcf
here is a link to my .post on my issue .net wcf service references use server named rather than ip-address causing issues .when consuming

1941938

1942112
json	xml
in all the documentation i ve seen the twitter api has you submit the user s username and passwd via xml or json

1942114
constructor	object
i can guess that the fact that you are not calling addtochildren from all constructor means that some constructor are intended to building complete object of given types these constructor do call addtochildren while some other constructor are intended to be used as intermediate constructor by descendant classes these constructor don t call addtochildren

1942141
background-color	width
only four css properties work on elements - background-color width border and visibility

1942177
observers	listener
i m not aware of any real collections implementation with built-in listener observers support

1942188
font-size	width
if you wrap each tag in a frex you can measure the width of the in javascript figure out the ratio of font-size to width and then adjust the font-size .so that the width is where you want

1942188
display	width
block elements can be centered if they have a definite width you don t have to know the width they just have to have one like a display block does by setting the left and right margins both to auto

without knowing more about your implementation i would suggest the latter of your two options use php to loops through your _post arrays and count the valid value you have

1942464
contains	set
i would like to find a way to checked to see if a set of value are contains in my variables

1942476
webforms	asp.net
an active-directory framework for forms-authentication in asp.net webforms -- inexplicable because asp.net has this function built-in

1942488
implements	abstract
here s a paper on taking an abstract specifications of a protocols and implements it into c

1942505
margins	padding
remember the width is the content width and excludes padding borders and margins

1942505
margins	padding
the default width of the body elements is auto which is whatever spaces is left once margins padding and borders have been taken into account

1942505
margins	padding
since browsers have non-zero padding and or margins there by default which of the two depends on the browser this is not 100

set data-access mode in ado.net source to sql cmd and write the query

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
and you re exactly right - you just want to set the content-type and content-disposition just setting content-disposition will work in some browsers but setting both should work in all browsers

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
the nice part with this .solution is that applications that load media files directly like let s say an mp3 player in flash don t care about the content-type or content-disposition .so you can still play your files in the browser and then link to downloading that same file

1942621
click	mouse
like the mouse button click in the subscriber methods there is always eventargs e parameter

1942626
vb.net	vba
i have asked this elsewhere but have never found anyone knows how to building an add-in for vba ide using vb.net

1942638
caliburn	prism
as an added bonus your application will be more suited to evolve to a more architecturally-sound composition model as that provided by prism or caliburn frameworks if the application requirements arise

1942651
curly-braces	include
note the tokens yourgeneratedguid must have the curly-braces include and be the same as the guid in the attrib above the token yourassemblynamedfulltypenamed must be the assembly full named the token youraddinnamed.connect must be the same progid set in the attrib above

1942667

i want my methods to appear syncrhonous .so i ve created an autoresetevent called the asyncrhonous methods the call waitone on the autoresetevent instances and i call set in the callback methods

1942673
value	field
you might be able to reflect on the declare types of the field holding the list though if the declare types does not itself refer to a types-parameter whose value you don t know

1942687
callback	methods
this class would also expose methods you could bind functions to that would provide callback to your display logic

1942706
ruby-on-rails	rspec	cucumber	webrat
cucumber + rspec + ruby-on-rails + factor_girl + webrat .

1942717

unchecked-exception	checked-exceptions
in my opinion checked-exceptions are a java design flaw c# seemed to have learned from it and only offers unchecked-exception

1942748
worksheet	excel
using the officewriter designer excel add-in you could design a report with 3 worksheet right in excel and publishing it to ssrs

1942759
content-length	content-type	content-length	http-headers	http-headers	content-type	specifications	w3c
from the w3c specifications and wikipedia the http-headers are actually content-type and content-length note the uppercase second words

1942761
silverlight	wpf
i like using properties because they seem self-contained and are easy and clean to bind to the wpf and silverlight gui s that i write and i like events because it seems like it reduces spaghetti but i don t feel like my theoretical understanding of these things is very sound

1942772
any	set
essentially delphi doesn t know about any of the particular features of the mysql database but knows about a smaller set of features common across the majority databases

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the mysql boolean alias bool alias tinyint 1 is not compatible with the postgresql boolean types

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the serial datatype results in an int column and this will about the same as mysql s

1942779
postgresql	mysql
semantics varchar in mysql and postgresql and char in mysql and postgresql are the same but in mysql these types have a much shorter maximum length

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in mysql these types can have a maximum of a little less than 64kb in postgresql 1gb bytes

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the bit datatypess in mysql and postgresql have roughly the same semantics but in mysql the maximum length of the bit data types is 64bit

1942779
postgresql	mysql
i think the mysql varbinary data types is best comparable to postgresql s bytea datatypes

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the float types in mysql should be equivalent to real in postgresql and real in sqlite too

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the decimal types in mysql is equivalent to decimal in postgresql except that in postgresql the types does not impose an arbtrary limit on the precision whereas in mysql the maximum precision is i believe 70

1942779
postgresql	mysql
for both mysql and postgresql numeric is an alias for the decimal types

1942787
profiling	trace
a quick way to accomplish this is to run sql profiling and then grouping your trace by textdata

1942787
filtering	grouping
if i remember that will give you durations and other handy stats to grouping filtering by

1942793
radio	click
the javascript registers a click event for a grouping of radio button

1942793
radio	click
it doesn t seem to be execution .when the radio button are click the form doesn t get submitted

1942803
treeview	listview
that can get quite hairy .when you hook a non-trivial windows like a listview or treeview

1942812

wrap the statement in .so it will get called .when the document is ready

1942827
value	field
the last td there is the value field in the ide

1942838
click	mouse
how much simpler can this be click to set a breakpoints mouse over a variables for the value press a key to step the immediate windows debug.print etc.

1942842
overwrite	transfer
just to be extra safe we never overwrite a local file before making a backup and only transfer at all .when the remote file has two cksums in a row that match and that cksum does not match the local file

1942849
selected	textbox
this sample code keeps the textbox on the selected tab

1942853
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
the quick and dirty .solution given your existing code is to set up the submit event of your form .so that any field contains the text of their own labels are cleared whenever the form is submitted

1942854
32-bit	x86
i would assume this is really only a big deal on 32-bit x86 which is a bit starved for registers

my team has been asked to offer amf output from our web service to decrease the time spent parsing xml or json for flash modules on the front end

1942892
postgresql	oracle
i don t have enterprisedb but i have never seen this on oracle or postgresql

1942920
configuration	environment
my preferences is to not checked in project specific configuration-files to the source control but instead keep the contents of environment variables and other configuration aspects in a common folder in source control

1942920
configuration	environment	environment	building
the configuration files are then generator as part of the local building building automation or deployment scripting depending on what a given project solution environment might need at a given time

1942920
configuration	environment
this way no matter where you are deploying code too you can defined an environment specific configuration

1942920
configuration	environment
generator by templates you would also have custom configuration sections with the same environment specific configuration files but instead of renaming on deployment you can simply rewrite a section of the base configuration file directly with the appropriate configuration file named

1942920
configuration	environment
keeping your configuration files chunks up by environment though provides you with a great deal of flexibility especially once you start managing many sites that use the same or similar styles of configurationuration

1942920
configuration	environment
no matter what though your configuration should be dictated by some aspects of your automated environment

1942921
managed-code	native-code
of course you mustn t inject managed-code into another process only native-code that is very careful not to mess up the application-state

1942923
constructor	private	instances	private
note classes that do this often have a private no-arg constructor just .so that the compiler yield an error if a programmer tries to create an instances of the static-class

1942924
pointers	stack
gcc doesn t generator the code to push the frame pointers onto stack and this changes the relative address of the arguments passed to the function on stack

1942936
contains	elements
and a jquery object arrays that contains a bunch of span elements

1942937
selected	button
if you d rather generator your own selected button you should look into either commandfields or just adding your own button with a commandname of selected

1942951
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you re talking about ms sql-server it is possible to bundle and install an instances of sql-server-express if you want to distribute a database with your .app

1943092
msbuild-task	nant
you could checked the nbehave examples there s both a nant and a msbuild-task

1943118
http-redirect	request
but since redirect_to and the underlying http-redirect can only send get request it actually redirects to get player which is the index methods

1943129
credentials	account
the localsystem account does not have an actual login or passwd and .so will attempt to connect to the shared with computer credentials if on a domain else anonymously

put	get
i am needing to get the key from the first each and put it into the 2nd item without having to loops a second time

1943137
32-bit	64bit	multiplication	division
as others said doing 64bit arithmetic on a 32-bit machine is going to take some extra manipulation more-so if doing multiplication or division

1943146
communication	messages
program needs to communication with peer and keep connection and wait for messages

1943166
duplicates	elements
assuming you really want to selected elementss with a given class which is more correct as there should not be elementss with duplicates id and if there are exactly one elements with class searchfield for each elementss selecteded by then you can use

1943173
value	field
i have following xml which same child elements field and i want to get value from each child elements

1943176
swing	awt
i had to do this once for the mac os x specific extensions for awt swing found in com.apple.eawt

1943176
reflection	runtime
all this only makes sense if you need just a few classes from an external libs because you have to do everything via reflection at runtime

1943189
pascal	basic
i was taught in basic and pascal initially usually with an interpreter that made it easier to run the program till something blew up

1943189
pascal	basic
we didn t have breakpoints or many of the fancy things there are now for tracing through code though this would have been from 1983-1994 using a commodore 64 watcom basic and pascal on a mac

1943198
defined	declare
since in your example externalfunction is not declare within the scoping of the function it is global or at least in whatever scoping it may have been defined in outside ready

1943234
javascript	dom
the elements in this selected box is being added removed from javascript using dom

1943241
shell	bash
it runs a bash shell under windows and it supports a full crontab

1943248
put	get
you redirect to a get request which is correct .when it comes to rest only do updates with .post put only get data with get

1943251
coalesce	isnull
i d prefer the ansi standards coalesce function but isnull is fine

1943256
credentials	security
security should never be an issue because if you re putting sensitive information like database access credentials inside of templates files well then you ve got bigger issues

1943263
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
traditional relational dbmss ie the kind you use sql with oracle ms sql-server mysql etc are fairly bad at this or rather they do not have this as a design goal

1943263
mongodb	schema	mongodb	couchdb
if and this is a really big if checked with your client first they want to be able to change the schema more frequently then consider going to a document or schemaless database such as couchdb or mongodb

any	set
in sql 2005 2008 is there any way to set default lock_timeout value

1943302
arrays	loops
essentially you want to loops over and over the small arrays adding each elements to the new arrays until it has reached the desired size

1943309
put	get
i d be tempted to do one .dll or more specifically one class and maybe put all the classes in the same .dll for each of the n sets of convertible units and within each .dll convert everything via one standards unit .so that you get away with running one or two of 2 x - 1 conversion calcs per conversion say converting all input in to square metres and then out again rather than coding up every possible combinations

1943320
configuration	environment
doing this won t introduce any undesirable situations with 3rd-party dependencies and all our target machines are internal and maintain roughly the same environment software configuration

1943328
composite-controls	asp.net
if you add two of these composite-controls to the page there will be two controls called textbox1 on the page which violates the uniqueness and hence asp.net s ability to manage and maintain these textbox on the server side

1943329
contains	elements
i solved this by creating a list in classa that contains b and listb elements the properties b and listb now are views over that new list

1943330
highlight	selected
if i have rightaudiofile and my cursor is at the start of the words i can press command-shift-rightarrow and selected highlight just the right part of the string then i could rename cut copy-paste just that bit

1943330
any	set
any ideas how i can set this up in vs2008

1943338
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class that a series of derived classes will inherited from

1943338
derived-class	base-class
the base-class cares about whether properties on the derived-class have changed

1943346
getter	setter
properties by default will create a getter with the same named as the ivar and a setter with set prepend

1943346
getter	setter
changing the getter named or its setter with the syntax is all this properties directive does

1943346
variables	boolean
you should do this only for boolean or similar variabless - other variabless should have a getter with the same named as the variables

1943357
value	field
you re comparing your result object directly to the string 1 not the field value

1943374
decrement	increment
add explicit code increment decrement count on all assignments to reference counted variables and field

1943393
uiscrollview	subviews
how would i building multiple uiview with multiple subviews and switching between them using a uiscrollview

1943407
key-value	key
example key 2 has a dictionary key-value

1943407
key-value	key
and key 3 has a dictionary key-value

1943407
key-value	key
.so i would like to merge key 2 and key 3 and the result would be the following .sorted dictionary key-value

1943433
value	field
how to perform a concat_ws in postgresql to join several field value from a grouping by

1943441
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
sql-server is different to mysql and oracle is different to both of them

1943442
constructor	object
the constructor is explicit as you said .so you not allowed to pass an int y instead of a vector for the constructor and y is not passed x time to vector constructor the second paramater is only created once to initilialize the insert object

1943452
keyvaluepair	key
you should loops through each keyvaluepair in the second dictionary call trygetvalue to find the corresponding sub-dictionary for the key in the first dictionary if it s not there add it then repeat the process for the sub-dictionary and finally add all of the items in the list from the second dictionary to the corresponding list in the first dictionary

1943460
callback	methods
what you have looks fine but you will not be able to use methodss in dojo.number or anything else loaded via dojo.require until after the page loads -- you must wait for window.onload to fire or use the dojo.addonload methods to triggers a callback

1943469
perl	c++	perl	ruby
yes you can have a c++ client or a c client or a cobol client or a perl client or a ruby client or a .

1943469
perl	c++	perl	ruby
all you do is ports the java code to the equivalent c++ code or c code or cobol code or perl code or ruby code or a .

1943470
contains	any
we re deploying to our intranet internet-explorer 7 an asp.net webapp which we created and which we know does not contains activex in any way

1943485
value	field
for most of my field and parameters i can assume that value are not null based on previous assert

1943495
selected	button
what is the best way to deal with input elements that are currently not available or locked to a default-value a state field that is only relevant to some countries a button for functionality that the current user is not authentication to use or a dropdown menu entry that is only relevant .when the user has selected something

1943504
selected	checkbox
easiest solution here is to delete the database and selected the close existing connections checkbox before hitting okay

1943505
attributes	properties
of course if there is a possibility of any of these attributess not always being present you d want to add some null value checked to make sure each attributes exists before calling it s value properties

1943509
alfresco	nuxeo
the two most viable oss ecm j2ee cms platform that i have run across are alfresco and nuxeo

1943514
json	xml
this often happens with json output though i ve had the issue with some html or xml output as well

1943520
order	add
people would typically use at least two order of magnitude of text more and might well add some cleverness to handle capitalization

1943523
ruby-on-rails	django
hello i want to create a simple blog where users can .post comments but i don t really want to get into one of the heavier code generator or frameworks like django or ruby-on-rails or wordpress

1943523
python	php
would prefer pure php and or python but am open to suggestions

1943529
lcov	gcov
i have gcov lcov and genhtml install on cygwin i m running this under windows

1943533
portrait	screens
somehow the test .app will rotate the orientation of my .app such that the android-emulator windows is still in portrait orientation but the screens surface is in a landscape orientation

1943543
device-driver	hardware
device-driver is what sits between between hardware and kernel .so this is your only choice

1943549
folder	dir
below is a skeleton structure of the site folder structure - store is the hosted project dir for domain.com

1943551
python	php
be it php python or something else you may find the tool of your choice by browsing through the respective which framework to use

1943560
javascript	dom
if you re updating the selected dom elements by adding option children with javascript than you should have too much farther to go

1943568
highlight	selected
you should be able to selected an image by click it in reader .so it s highlight blue and then copy and paste it to an image editing program of your choice

1943582
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception	nullreferenceexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
aside exception-handling like these - nullreferenceexception argumentnullexception argumentexception .

1943600
sql-server	mysql
and this is a procedure in sql-server to run it i normally have try-catch blocks and other error trapping but have left that out for clarity.note that mysql_xxx is a linked-server that was set up from sql-server to mysql

1943602
constructor	object
in your case you would most likely want to use the di containers to initializer your object and have that object get a reference to each of its dependencies through the constructor

1943602
attributes	properties
the walkthrough also details how to annotations methods properties and even parameters using attributes to distinguish them at runtime

1943611
value	field
.when i try to drop the rate value on the y value field i get the error value cannot be null

1943619
constructor	object
from what you re describing your best option might be to make all of your object take a synchronizationcontext as a arguments in their constructor

1943625
ref	out
in the above code if you pass a null ref you will find out immediately that the calling code is using the types incorrectly

1943634
ubuntu	linux
i was doing some j2mee work on ubuntu linux with netbeans 6.7.1

1943654
singleton	facade
have you looked at the facade proxy factory and singleton patterns

1943654
constructor	object
combining factory and singleton and ensuring that all classes you want exposed have constructor requiring your main object is a good way to enforce this design

1943655
ubuntu	linux
i m playing with an xbee radio i m using linux ubuntu 9.10 and the xbee doesn t appear to send null value through the serial-port .when using my code

1943670
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
you ll be much happier using a language like python with lxml ruby with rexml or even php with simplexml

1943674
perl	php
2 some sort of active page written in asp or php that will dynamically building the marquee and the rest of the site each time the site is visited basically doing the work of the perl scripting each time

1943681
32-bit	64bit
i have a 32-bit .so binary-only libs and i have to generator 64bit program that uses it

1943686
subtract	add
new and existing files add to the total while existing unchanged files subtract from the installation requirements

1943687
export	report
development time cost is a concern constraint but it s a long enough project list they d rather not have to export the report to words or something and manually create the url links export to pdf as a third step

1943694
32-bit	64bit
you can t directly link to 32-bit code inside of a 64bit program

1943694
32-bit	64bit
the best option is to compile a 32-bit standalone program that can run on your 64bit platform using ia-32 and then use a form of interprocess communication to communication to it from your 64bit program

1943697
autodesk	3ds
i got the named of the effect parameters of the default.fx file specified in max it s at program files autodesk 3ds max 2010 maps fx

1943698
google-chrome	safari
however .when i m in app-capable mode and have launchd from the home screens .so no safari google-chrome and submit the form i get the error url can t be show

1943720
firefox	safari
i tried sending a click event in safari and firefox but no luck

1943724
constructor	object
then you add amethod to your user-controls server-side to generator a javascript object constructor call for the user-controls instances

1943726
children	nodes
for example i can end up with a document object whose children nodess i can iterate through and i want to set same-named properties in another object with the nodes s value

1943737
webserver	nginx
i am asking about a webserver running a lighting front nginx in my case with php process accessed through fastcgi

1943740
reflection	runtime
let me explain that the only way to do something similar to this in the java runtime is to use reflection

1943777
numerical	matrix
there s lots of numerical problems and matrix inversions to do

1943781
32-bit	64bit
for an example of using ipc to run 32-bit plugins from 64bit code look at the open source nspluginwrapper

1943802
vba	vb6
the second would be to figure out the binary format which is documented and alter it using the vb6 vba native binary io very non-trivial

1943809
configuration	logging
logging must therefore fabricate a default configuration

1943809
configuration	logging
only the can do a logging configuration

1943809
configuration	logging
if you do logging at a global level in a module then you may force logging to fabricate it s default configuration

1943813
mouseleave	mouseenter
implements you own and then try mouseenter and mouseleave events

1943818
getter	setter
i split imyintf into a getter and a setter interfaces

1943836
pessimistic-locking	optimistic-locking
in fact .when using optimistic-locking you avoid most of the concurrency issues that would come with pessimistic-locking

1943836
ado	jet
from ado oledb these jet concurrency control structures are going to be mapped onto the relevant functions and arguments found in ado oledb

1943836
ado	jet
since i use jet only from access i interact with it only via dao .so i can t advise on how you control these with ado oledb but the points is that the jet database engine offers control of your recording locking .when accessing it programmatically as opposed to through the access user-interface -- it s just more complicated

1943839
selection	cell
.so you ll disable selection for the affected cell while still allowing the user to interact with other visible cell

1943844
getter	setter
that s true but in java you have to add your sysbiz member variables your getter and setter and all the other logic around sysbiz anyway .so an extra line in your constructor or deserialization section isn t all that much of a nuisance

1943861
managed-code	unmanaged
in my own code the managed-code domain is torn down explicit before the unmanaged .app exit .so i don t have to worry about that particular problem

1943862
logout	login
try creating a directory for yourself on .some other partition that has lots of free spaces set your environment variables tmp and temp to points to that directory logout and login again .so your session uses those new settings and try visual-studio again

1943873
defined	declare
.so in your second case the lack of static on the prototype meant that the function was defined as not static and then .when it was later declare as static that was an error

1943883
windows-vista	windows
this was working perfectly on my windows-vista computer but won t save the file on windows 7

1943883
wamp	php
it is the same exact code as the other computer grabbed from source control and both are using php 5 with wamp server

1943895
wamp	php
try to transfer your wamp and php in other local drive

1943896
click	mouse
the player should have the ability to click on the map and drag the mouse to scroll and view map areas which are not presently visible

1943904
constructor	object
another way you can get an instances of the picturebox object bound into an instances of picmover is to pass the instances of the picturebox to the constructor of the class as a parameter i bet by the time i finish posting this someone else will have already posted an answer showing that technique

1943909
perl	php
if you could do it with javascripting i think it would suffer the same resource issues as your once a day perl scripting and every load asp php methods since it would still have to fetch the web content by making a call to the website

1943918
traffic	packets
wireshark provides a packets sniffer gui and a numbers of analysis tools that will summarize traffic by endpoint s protocols and other characteristics

1943926
javascript	dom
because all the events are attached to the elements through javascript code which accesses the dom performance in ie suffers

1943929
getter	setter
if they are not then the same can be can done with methods module mapping setter named to getter named

1943936
initializer	setter
having setter or an initializer methods are generally thought to be bad design as you need to remember to call them and make sure they don t open up too much of your implementation s state what is to stop someone from re-calling initializer or the setter

1943955
ref	out
.when i wrap this query in a stored procedure returning the results via an out ref cursor and try to use it from an external application sql-server report service the query takes over one minute to run

1943959
subtract	time
for example if you decide that 09 00 9 am is a valid boundary then just subtract 9 hours from both time which would bring them both within the same 24 hour period and allow direct comparison

1943998
png	gif
the following code will force users to save pdf rather than viewing it with browser i would love to achieve the same effect for the images jpg gif png by binding the click action with jquery how will i be able to do that

1944016
joomla	drupal
the 2 major php cms libs drupal and joomla each have some form of database abstraction although drupal s is pretty slim

1944016
joomla	drupal
joomla looks like it might have a little more to it than drupal

1944029
put	get
does get at a particular uri need to match what was put to that uri

1944029
put	get
.so to me the representation returned by get at a given uri does not necessarily have to be the same representation that was put to the given uri it just has to be consistent

1944036
background-color	transparency
if i set the background-color to be null and the gray color is 1.0 then it is transparency

1944045
value	field
the difference is the session value are stored on the server and hidden field and cookies are stored on the client

1944048
put	get
if you are transforming then it would make sense that what you put is not what you get .so i don t see why it is a problem

1944048
put	get
but if you put a user with certain information then .when you use get then it should retrieve that person just as .when i put my 4th vacation photo .when i call get i expect that photo but it may be transformed by converting to a different format or have some other transforms but if i get the 5th photo instead then that is a problem

1944057
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari
mri is a bookmarklet for internet-explorer 6+ and webkit and mozilla based browsers including safari firefox camino or mozilla

1944079
google-chrome	safari	web-inspector	webkit
web-inspector for webkit safari and google-chrome

1944084
display	height
now if i increase the height of the list control .so it has enough room to display all three items it display fine

1944105
wamp	php
while running some php code on my private wamp pc i m suddenly getting a blank response from the server - no response actually

1944105
ruby	php
i think the ruby guys throw that in there .so programmers would drop php

1944118
twitter	tweets
if anyone knew if any of the popular twitter iphone .apps eg tweetsie2 etc have a custom url-scheme implementss .so that it is possible to use their client to send a tweets from my .app without having to implements my own mini twitter client

1944168
hide	show
i have an upper bound on the numbers of years which can be returned .so i intend to create that many radio button and do a show hide based on the numbers of years returned

1944171
freeglut	glut
.when i had a hobby project that was using gl and there were certain events that i couldn t handle via glut what i did is fork the open source freeglut

1944212
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is used to make your set of code to execute after a specified time period .so for your requirements its better to use setinterval because that will call your function every time at a specified time interval

1944214
double	int
this will tell you if the double represents an int

1944214
double	int
disclaimer 1 i m saying int and not int as a double can represent numbers that are int but whose magnitudes are too great to store in an int

1944214
double	int
extremely large double for example are always int because they don t have enough significant digits to represent any fractions value

1944215
altera	xilinx
if yes xilinx and altera have lots of good verilog examples and other learning resources

1944217
sql-server	mysql
i m a sql-server guy not a mysql guy .so maybe .someone can points out how to improve this query

1944246
arrays	loops
i know i could do a foreach and fill an arrays during loops but was just wondering if there were a more elegant way through linq extensions and or lambda to do this

1944254
altera	xilinx
if you have tools from xilinx or altera install consider looking through the source code for their ip cores some cores will be obfuscation but many are not

1944255
filtering	grouping
there calling count on the filtering object is an alias for the sql grouping function count which sums up the numbers of matching rows

1944257
triggers	insert	value	field
create new field in the table which will hold the value you want to extraction and then calculate those value on insert updates with a triggers rather than selected

1944257
triggers	insert
in your query if your insert updates triggers simply sets the data_2_35 column to data or null depending on the value of fieldid

1944279
postgresql	mysql
actually the problem arises since we have named a column authentication which is ok on mysql but fails miserably on postgresql authentication is a reserved keyword there

1944288
imageview	textview
section 1 is a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview

1944294

1944309
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it seems to work on firefox but not on google-chrome or safari webkit

1944318
widget	button
to create a custom widget extends linearlayout class put all the button as its static-members and let it handle the button click

1944336
sql-server	mysql
there s an analogous feature in ms sql-server .so you should be accustomed to the concept but the mysql terminology may be different

1944341
shopping-cart	paypal
are shopping-cart and paypal 2 different things

1944351
double	int
fpus are fast enough these days that doing a double -to- int conversion or a floor really isn t that slow

1944360
haskell	erlang
to over-simplify things functional languages such as erlang and haskell are built around the notion that multithreading apps are very safe .when you eliminate side-effects

1944373
sftp	ftp
specifically wrapping and abstracting ruby s ftp and sftp libs

1944373
sftp	scp	sftp	ftp	ftp	scp
it really got my attention because it supports backing stuff up via s3 scp sftp and ftp

1944373
sftp	ftp
if i were attacking this in c# i d write a protocols interface or abstract-class and let ftp and sftp implements it

1944415
order	join
if you it to be fast particularly with join make sure you use sdo_relate it was in the order of 100-1000x faster for spanning linestrings for me over sdo_geom.relate oops

1944416
web-parts	ascx
you can use ascx files in web-parts

1944422
shopping-cart	paypal
yes shopping-cart and paypal are two different things

1944435
put	get	physics-engine	chipmunk
i have been following a few tutorials to get the hang of things and am attempting to put together a very simple level where some balls bounce around the screens using the chipmunk physics-engine

terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - gamelayer addchild z unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0xf6ff90

1944456
json	csv
if you need to read the data in javascript try switching to a text format like csv or better for parsing json

1944475
getter	setter
i just can across some code where they ve got an implicit setter but no getter eg

1944483
contains	set
also due to an obscure bug in the underlying wininet internetgetcookies implementation ieâ s document.cookies will not return a cookies if it was set with a path attributes contains a filename

1944485
display	height	display	width
like a div that can be styled but has no intrinsics display of its own though it will be the width and height specified by its width and height attributes

1944492
cross-join	inner-join
outer-join if an outer-join is specified as opposed to a cross-join or an inner-join rows from the preserve table or tables for which a match was not found are added to the rows from vt2 as outer rows generator vt3

1944514
contains	any	contains	elements
it s possible but note that browser resets the flash application if the styles of the elements contains it or any parent elements is changed

1944553
constructor	private	constructor	mutators	constructor	object	mutators	builder
a builder will help create an immutable object construct with required and or optional-parameters by chaining mutators methodss together and calling a private constructor via a builder methods

1944555
silverlight	wpf	silverlight	xbap
i heard that this is not possible directly from a silverlight .app which i guess also .applies to wpf xbap since its a security issue

1944566
hashmap	arrays
do you plan to store in your hashmap only null-terminated arrays of characters as in old-fashioned c pseudo-strings .so that strlen will suffice

1944579
lookup	any
if you need to do any per-pixel operation and are not using flash player 10 in which case you should lookup pixel-bender you can use the bitmapdata.draw function to draw your frame into a bitmapdata

1944600
textarea	textbox
if you assign the retrieve value into a textarea or multiline textbox you will have the linebreaks display without manipulating the string

1944618
digits	base
you want to convert into base digit_count and then instead of converting the digits to numbers you index into your arrays

1944635
selected	button
but if you have access to a server side language it should be easy to have one action a php scripting that include the right file based on a pressed button or selected input value

1944663
arguments	default
a second important use case is .when you pass it three argumentss rather than just two in that case if the attributes is absent from the object getattr returns the third default arguments rather than raising an exception-handling

1944663
attributes	properties
__getattr__ is a special methods defined in a class that gets invoked .when .some attributes of an instances of that class is requested and other normals ways to supply that attributes via the instances s __dict__ slots properties and .so on all failed

1944709
linux	unix
unix and ruby are both alive and well unix vendor apple s stock is headed into orbited linux has an irrevocable dug-in positioning running servers development and lab systemd and microsoft s desktop-software empire is surrounded by powerful saas barbarians like google and an army of allies

1944716
directory	folder
however i think that you should be able to use linked folder .so that you have a eclipse project directory which is basically empty but for a .project file and a linked folder which points to your .source tree

1944723
function-pointers	function-call
a function-object is anything including function-pointers that is callable via the function-call operators

.when	ready
i would like to initializer a keyboardview place it on the screens with an alpha of 0 inside an uiview and .when im good and ready fade and animate it in

1944941
value	field
this can either be passed as a urlencoded string like para1 val1 para2 val2 ... or as an arrays with the field named as key and field data as value

1944943
getter	setter
bellow is the code to generator an arrays of delegation for getter and setter for a certain types

1944943

one way to achieve the use of two images is to swap the src attributes with scripting on mouseover and mouseout events .hover in jquery

1945048
sql-server	oracle
by default it does points at sql-server but i believe there have been oracle implementation that are available

1945064
row	col
also you don t really explain how your getvalue row col and setvalue row col access the storage

1945064
row	col
are row and col more or less random

1945064
row	col
the idea i have in mind is the following sometimes for image-processing .when you have to access pixels like row + 1 row - 1 col - 1 col + 1 to average value

1945064
row	col
you might transpose this idea to your algorithm if it applies you map a portion of your file once .so that the different call to getvalue row col and setvalue row col work on this portion that s just been mapped

1945065
silverlight	wpf
if you want to building rich uis on .net today you should go with wpf or silverlight

1945094
attributes	properties
properties and filtering attributes are optional

1945094
double-quotes	single-quotes
both single-quotes and double-quotes occur

1945101
static-classes	inherited	abstract	sealed
static-classes are marked as abstract and sealed in compiled il which can be neither initializer nor inherited

1945102
constructor	object	value	field
providing a full constructor that takes the initial value for all required field as arguments clumsy to use but guarantees fully initializer and valid object

1945103
postback	ajax
if client-side validation cannot be move entirely to the front end then consider using ajax for a partials postback to a server side validation routine while retaining a better customer experience but allowing a programmer to maintain the validation rules centrally

1945109
arrays	loops
and then .when i validation the comment to see how many smilies are there i loops trough this arrays and match the smile to the content of the comment

1945110
constructor	object
the short answer is that an object should be fully initializer after its constructor was called

1945110
initializer	setter
this approach is in the middle ground letting users call setter to initializer and still be able to work only with fully initializerr object

1945110
constructor	object
a static factory-method is appropriate in cases .when the object constructor needs to be more flexible than a constructor but a builder is too complex to implements

1945110
arguments	default
may need too many constructor arguments named arguments and default value can help here if the languages supports them

1945114
constructor	object
i would say that full constructor are the way to go not only for consistency as you say fully initialization of the object is guaranteed after the object is created but also because it eases the work .when having to use a dependency-injection mechanism

1945115
constructor	object
if your language supports it anonymous object like in javascript are a great way of supply many arguments to a constructor or any function for that matter

1945116
contains	elements
if you look at the protocols guide there s a elements which contains the url you want

1945121
any	set
use a full constructor for some required field if any but mostly rely on methods properties to set the field

1945122
service-layer	crud
i ve a service-layer .so either i can have a serviebase class which taps all the crud events and logs the one in which i m interested

1945151

if you have to use java.util data-structures then a hashmap from vertexes to the list of connect vertexes offers o 1 deletion

1945151
jgraph	jung
if you could use 3rd party libs then there are a list of answers here of which jgraph and jung seem most popular

1945198
json	xml
get .post from silverlight easy and send back some xml or json data or xaml which you building manually in c++ or there are bound to be c++ libs for this too

1945205
checkbox	button
click the + button at the bottom to add new substitution of your own and click the checkbox next to each item to enable or disable it

1945208
constructor	object
it s very straightforward to me that the points of a constructor is to set up the object .so that it s ready to use

1945208
constructor	object
the callers would have to marshall all the required arguments together before being able to use the object anyway and making them do .so in the constructor removes a whole class of errors

1945218
javascript	dom
my problem is that in ie if i click many menu items too fast i get various javascript errors i believe dom elements are trying to be accessed that no longer exists as the updater is in the process updating the html

1945224
firefox	opera
setting will also allow a div to receive focus in browsers that support it ie 5.5+ firefox 3.0+ webkit for a few years not sure about opera though obviously with the side effect of making the div editable by the user

1945229
code-coverage	gcov
i am however having real trouble setting up code-coverage analysis using gcov

1945252

1945269
decrement	increment
have it parsing traversal the string and increment the parentheses count each time it encounters a and decrement the count each time it hits a

1945305
hide	show
till now we underwent two stages 1 whenever user click tabs to show hide a div in html or possible operations like fight buy some thing then we call the ajax request to get the fresh data from database each time

1945311
formatting	import
if you have a plain text file foo.txt with the formatting as in your example then just import it into mathematica with get will import and evaluate data in the way you want no need for text to expression translation

1945385
32-bit	16-bit
for 32-bit and most 16-bit architectures c++ will also be available

1945385
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	linux	vxworks	qnx	symbian	qnx	rtos	qnx
one of the reasons i suggested that it may depend on the microcontroller is that if for example it is an arm9 with a few mb of external sdram and at least say 4mb flash also usually external - memory takes up a lot of die spaces then you could run a heavyweight os on it such as linux wince or symbian or even a large rtos such as qnx or vxworks

1945395
contains	elements
this is caused by allocation the arguments elements on the stack.when the threads start it may or may not contains valid value

1945396
32-bit	64bit
in more modern time with cpus having emt64 extended memory 64 technology i7s with 12 gig ram is there an equivalent technology that allows me to use this extra memory from a 32-bit .app on a non 64bit os

1945431
sql-server	oracle
question is valid for oracle and sql-server

1945433
linked-list	nodes
each nodes can points to the previous and next nodes it is easier to add nodess to the end of a linked-list

1945437
value	field
one minor observation a magic unicorn could see in the last query - you re order the result set on a field loc that is based on another field rownum which you expect to have value based on the sortedset

1945440
selected	button
by click a button i like to insert the selected value of the dropdown into my db

1945476
decimal-point	digits
i would like to be able to have firststepreturn have 2 digits following the decimal-point even if they are .00 or

1945495
32-bit	64bit
second the better 32-bit os have already switched partially or fully to 64bit for time purposes or even just an additional flag field to handle epoch s

1945496
attributes	properties
to be honest i do not know you can query such entity using the attributes properties but if i had to guess i would do an in statement to it

1945506
controllers	routes
for example following the standards routes setup in your global-asax controllers action id

1945506
postback	ajax
you can also hit this url using an ajax request inorder to load data into the same page you re on without any postback

1945522
32-bit	64bit
i you planning to only work on 32-bit machines or use 32-bit editions of your software on a 64bit box then you not need ms-access nor will you need to install anything to read and use mdb ms-access files

1945555
constructor	object
even the invocation of the parent class constructor is a normals methods call and the object is fully operational at this points this knows about all the members inherited or not

1945555
implements	abstract
but you really should enforce the implementsation of that methods by either making it abstract forcing descendants to implements it or by providing a default implementsation that can be overwrite

1945618
configuration	logging
just having it logged to a file by clever logging configuration would be nice but enough

1945624
logging	trace
if all you want to know is that this abnormal termination occurred then some form of trace or logging is what you need

1945627
filtering	sorting
i used to know how to do this but i can t seem to get sorting to work on a view where filtering are exposed in a block

1945627

bazaar	git
three most popular are git mercurial and bazaar

1945668
selected	button
on the view button selected sql-view

1945669
haskell	c++
that said haskell is unsurprisingly wildly different from all the imperative and mixed-model languages most people come in contact with .so there would be a learning curve involved in picking it up if one came from a background of say vb or c++ or java

1945688
version-control	git
subversion and git are two widely used version-control systemd

1945692
versioning	upgrade
postgresql 7.3 is really old no option to upgrade to a more modern versioning

1945719
multiplication	bit-shift	multiplication	division
in a comment on this answer which suggests using bit-shift operators over int multiplication division for performance i queried whether this would actually be faster

1945730
required	checked
working from home at clients site becomes easier as you don t required network connection just to checked something in and if you wait till back at base to push changes the history is preserve rather than lumping everything into one change

1945742
haskell	python
while python does indeed support some functional construct haskell is a functional language

1945742
arrays	loops
thus some imperative-programming construct will be available to you references loops mutable arrays etc and you won t have to cope with the monads until you actually want to

1945753
machine-code	disassembly
vs will show you the disassembly machine-code

1945785
arrays	loops
accessing the vector inside loops is just as fast as for the arrays

1945804
any	set
i ve done this on the cheap before by having apache install on the same machine as iis listening only on ports 443 for however many ip cert combos were needed then have apache set up as a reverse-proxy to iis on the same machine listening only on ports 80 but for any hosts header

1945811
value	field
could not get a field value by reflection getter

1945822
viewwillappear	viewdidappear

1945924
foundation	cocoa
i am attempting to create a cocoa framework that is an object-oriented wrapper around a procedural framework written in the core foundation

1945947
double	int
the 0 arguments that you re passing to the propertymetadata constructor will be interpreter as an int rather than a double

1945950
backslash	regex
your problem is that you need to escape the backslash it self double escape else the regex constructor in reality get this string passed in

1945989
curly-brackets	parentheses
i ve always assumed that - in the absence of constructor parameters - the parentheses curly-brackets follow the classname .when creating a class instances were optional and that you could include or exclude them at your own personal whim

1946001
postgresql	oracle
some database engines like oracle and postgresql support bitmap indexes

1946016
difference	datediff
mysql has datediff which returns the difference in days between two dates since mysql 4.1.1

1946018
any	set
here setting caching false will not set any caching

1946025
arrays	loops
i think compiler optimizes away whole loops as assign value are never used or replace arrays with .some precalculated value .so that loops isn t even execute and you get 0 milliseconds

1946046
derived-class	subclassing
the qobject children doesn t work here because the qt user-interface compiler .when converting the .user-interface file to a c++ class doesn t defined the user-interface_myuser-interface class as a subclassing of any qobject derived-class

1946121

jax-ws	cxf
are there any implementation of the ws-discovery specifications for jax-ws ri axis2 cxf or other toolkits

1946214
contains	any	contains	elements	external	root
technically what you have there is not a well-formed xml document which has exactly one root elements but rather an well-formed external parsing entity which can have any numbers of elementss not contains in other elementss as well as text not contains in any elementss

1946216
unsigned-integer	int
output unsigned-integer for which holds 0 to 4294967295 matching the size of a 4-byte mysql unsigned int

1946247
arrays	map
it looks like you need this to be an arrays in which case there isn t really a better way than searching through the arrays unless you want to put a map on it which you could do if you have control of the generator of the object

1946247
arrays	map
of course if you do that you have to updates the map .when you modify the arrays which could become a maintenance problem

1946247
arrays	loops
details here but you can t use for..in to loops through arrays indexes or rather if you do you have to take special pains to do .so

1946247
arrays	loops
for..in loops through the properties of an object not the indexes of an arrays

1946247
arrays	loops
your best bet with a non-sparse arrays and yours is non-sparse is a standards old-fashioned loops

1946247
any	set
but it break as soon as you set or a framework sets any other properties on the arrays object which is perfectly valid

1946263
malloc	strdup
note that the use of strdup suggested by greg performs this call to malloc under the covers

1946284
subclassing	base-class
i created an interface and a base-class interface was only needed for temporal subclassing whose parent was not temporal for entities that supported this approach with 2 properties starttime and endtime and a base-class for daos working with temporal entities that had some functionality often needed

1946288
fiddler	charles
and obviously the smaller the request response size you can use tools like fiddler charles to find the size the faster the response

callback	methods
make sure you get the time difference right at the beginning of the callback methods before any rendering

1946295
any	set
the following example will protect the worksheet if any of the three protection elements are not set

1946295
vb.net	vba
it also sets a passwd and passes in the userinterfaceonly arguments as true which means that only the user is blocked from editing the worksheet while code such as vba vb.net or c# would not be prevented from manipulating the worksheet

1946326
put	get
iâ ve used two different approaches in the past one was using adomd to pull results and put these into a dataset the other was using sql openquery to a linked ssas server to get results out as a sql stored procedure result set

1946352
parentheses	braces
that i have to remember to escape grouping parentheses and braces and other difference .when i m using emacs regex it s all confusing a syntax comparison table would be good for minimizing confusion

1946399
libpng	zlib
since libpng uses zlib

1946399
libpng	zlib
the my_jpeg_read_func my_png_read_func grabcolorvalue create_colored_tile_by_color_space_warping draw_tile my_jpeg_wrapper_write and report_error_to_user and maybe some others have to be written yourself and you may need to include libjpg zlib and libpng in your project and add headers and or #includes

1946400
constructor	object
one reason to do it may be if you have several actions that need the same object instances and things like that you can create them once in the constructor

1946466
exception-handling	try-catch
notice now i am relying on that try-catch but this means that any protocols exception-handling will not throw an error .so its not a reliable function

1946475
python	perl
you could alternatively write an applescripting perl python or bash scripting that can be execute from xcode

1946481
braces	macros
all code in my macros is itself include in braces but without the do-..while

1946482
stderr	stdout
you can redirect stderr and stdout to dev-null via something like

1946482
stderr	stdout
what this does is take send the standards output stdout from to dev-null that s the and additionally send stderr the 2 into stdout the 1

1946495
handler	service
you need to implements a javax.xml.ws.handler.logicalhandler this handler then needs to be referenced in a handler configuration file which in turn is referenced by an handlerchain annotations in your service endpoint interface or implementsation

1946513

in your configuration environment development.rb file updates the log level

1946675
height	frame
inorder to do .so my idea is to resize the frame of my current view to reduce its height let s say 50 pixels less and add my ads view in the free spaces i created

1946675
height	frame
it is possible to reduce the height of my view frame and raise its bounds .so my ads subviews is really part of my view

1946681
display	height	display	width
.so i use textfield to display text and try to get the width and height of the text through

1946681
display	height	display	width
why nearly 20 part of the text height width are not display

1946686
contains	any
i have seen regex examples that will parsing any ini file and get the named value pairs i just want to get the url value only from a file no matter what else it contains

1946698

you might use setter to implements dependency-injection .when you can t inject in the constructor

1946731
tcp-ip	udp
i ve had working solution using udp but then my boss told me he wants to use tcp-ip for some reason

1946732
children	tree
you therefore have a simple get all children of a node-request as which lets you perform a standards tree traversal

1946734
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i love asp.net-mvc but if you re under the gun go with webforms

1946759
selected	cell
..works but only selected the first cell not all cell in the column

1946763
display	width
you could try increasing the width of the jscrollbars .so that the button has more room to be display

1946768
double-quotes	single-quotes
then you still wouldn t be able to parsing xml but you d rather to primitive text process which may easily fail as soon as maybe single-quotes are used instead of double-quotes

1946788
python	perl	vbscript	perl
vbscript is the best you got besides cripple batch-file if you hate the idea of using other tools like gawk sed python perl or other xml parsing writer

1946794
tcp-ip	udp
.when people are talking about the tcp-ip stack they often mean the whole internet protocols stack which include udp

1946807
nsdateformatter	date-format
i m not entirely sure why nsdateformatter could not recognise the iso date-format

1946810
webforms	asp.net
simple web application + tight scheduling asp.net webforms

1946810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so if you re going to develop a web .app that relies heavily on ajax then webforms may just beat asp.net-mvc

1946821
udp	tcp
you can ask your boss for a specific reason to use tcp and then implements that particular service for example basic reliability or an error correction service over udp

1946840
entity-framework	nhibernate
i am aware of linq-to-sql entity-framework and nhibernate but would prefer subsonic

1946861
click	mouse
mouse click re-paints and .so on.

1946862
ubuntu	linux
i use dogtail to do such things using this i have created a automated testing fromework for my linux ubuntu .app

1946875
instance-variables	local-variables
setting local-variables with the locals option is simpler and much more dry than using instance-variables

1946878
children	nodes
i took a look at some genome data to see how this idea stack up using a hardcode acgt - 0123 mapping and 4 children per trie nodes

1946918
abstract-factory	factory-method
often designs start out using factory-method less complicated more customizable subclassing proliferate and evolve toward abstract-factory prototype or builder more flexible more complex as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed

1946919
any	set
however in ie any cookies you set without a â domainâ will get an implicit â domainâ of the current hostname

1946930
e-commerce	product
i d like to create an product image-viewer for an iphone versioning of an e-commerce site and have it behave something like the photos .app

1946932
udp	tcp
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

1946949
json	xml
but the response actually is an xml document contains some json text causing the error you have

1946949
json	xml
or set the handleas attributes to xml and parsing the response to extraction the json content

1946961
implements	extends
these child factory all implements or extends the abstract-factory

1946974
attributes	properties
i then added the types to the inherited attributes on the register page and in the controllers added a new instances of the model to the viewdata.model properties

1947000
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
as far as i m concerned i d love the other way around redirect any user with ie6 to firefox google-chrome safari -

1947020
json	xml
3 do the search in the server methods and return the result in a html or xml or json format

1947020
callback	methods	hide	show
4 on the javascript callback methods hide the please wait messages and show the search result

1947031
subtract	time
after detonation time gravity starts to pull with each time step the gravitational constants which happens to be 2 two is subtract from every spark s speed_y

1947031
subtract	add	subtract	time
for each time step after the detonation time you first add the speed vector to the positioning then subtract 2 from speed_y

1947033
vb.net	vb6
also sorry for the vb6 vb.net confusion

1947037
udp	rtp
most voice application are building using the rtp protocols which is streaming over udp ports

1947084
double	int
as with int and system.int32 object and system.object string and system.string double and system.double

1947089
contains	any
but .when i checked the email received html document that was sent doesn t contains any image

1947095
postgresql	oracle
added this should work ok on both transact-sql mssql sybase and pl sql oracle postgresql

1947111
player	movie
second about the overlay you are right the overlay gets the events but you cannot put it under the movie player controls

1947113
boolean	int
to selected the right elements it uses a conditional which return a boolean but boolean in python are int .so you can use it as special indexes they can be either 0 or 1

1947118
lookup	any
if the optimizer can find three rows in table1 without doing any join and then do a lookup join three time to get matching rows in table2 that will be very very fast

1947128
calloc	malloc
however you shiould look at memory allocation before you start using libs code such as vectors -- c++ new calloc malloc thread-local memory etc.

1947128
data-structures	binary-tree
vector s main use is for contiguous memory regions you can almost always improve on vector by using linked data-structures perhaps in a binary-tree for searching on a key d

1947131
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
currently it is correct in ie8 firefox and opera but wrong in google-chrome ie7 and ie6

1947147
attributes	properties
what i m looking for is the php equivalent of an asp.net c# properties attributes which in the above example is signified by the line above the properties declaration

1947155
ternary-operator	operands
i personally tend to use the last since the order of the operands is the same as the c ternary-operator

1947160
button	popup
they touch the button and uiimagepickercontrollersourcetypesavedphotosalbum popup using presentmodalviewcontroller

1947161
wamp	php
for php i would need to install apache and php or a nice package like wamp and start putting php files in the web root

1947184
google-earth	google-maps
you may want to consider using kml inorder to display your markers on both google-maps and google-earth

1947188
textbox	button
all i have is a textbox on a webpage and given the textbox id i want to write a value in it and press a button

1947203
wamp	php
for php i would need to install apache and php or a nice package like wamp and start putting php files in the web root

1947211
enumerator	any
the reflected code in .net looks exactly like the code in your class except it adds two things it verifies that the parameter value is defined in the enumerator since you can pass any int to the methods and it demands that the caller has path discovery permission a new fileiopermission

1947211
static-classes	class-members
see the .net documentation about static-classes and static class-members for more information

1947216
arrays	map
after submission the form the code should be able to map the field into and arrays

1947219
contains	any
the trouble is we are using mxml databinding to bind the contents of that list generically the trouble is we never reference the types of object contains in the list explicit .so it s never compiled into our swf is there any way to ensure that object in a list for a remoteclass is compiled in

1947243
attributes	properties
php does not have properties nor properties attributes

1947243
getter	setter
if you d like to do something similar in php you d have to declare a private field and write public getter and setter methodss and do some sort of null checked within the setter methods

1947244
put	get
i couldn t get hooked into this without digging into the source for dotnetnuke which of course is another option but the bottom line was that all i wanted to do was put another textbox right after it and make sure that the email addresses matched

1947254
contains	set
set the width properties on your textbox to whatever you want it to stay at -- then set the textwrapping properties to wrap and then make sure the content control holding is not set up to stretch it vertically and it will do what you want text wrap and the box grows vertically to contains it as you enter stuff

1947258
udp	rtp	rtcp	rtp
rtp rtcp over udp is normally used for delivery of the media streaming

1947258
rtcp	rtp
rtp rtcp therefore provides some but not all tcp functionality

1947258
buffering	streaming
for streaming media over tcp this can be solved easily by having a large jitter buffering

1947258
udp	tcp
one main advantage to tcp though is that it traversal firewalls more easily than udp

1947258
rtsp	sip
there are ways round this but they can be complicated and may involve understanding the session control protocols like sip or rtsp

1947282
internationalization	translation
spring supports internationalization by registering a bean with named messagesource in the configuration file but this assumes i know exactly what is the fully qualified named of the class or properties-file that contains the translation strings

1947291
revision	updates	revision	svn
if you are keeping a versioned code-tree on production that is you did an svn-checkout onto your production machine then the easiest way to do this is to have the programmer simply use svn updates --revision rev on production where rev is the revision that programmer wishes to updates

1947291
.when	ready
the programmers can checked in to their own branch .whenever they want and .when it s ready to go to production they can merge their branch back into trunk or another release branch and trunk can be copy-paste up to production via svn export or svn updates

1947299
windows-vista	windows-xp
i get this error .when i open a program i created in windows-vista in c# with wpf on a computer with windows-xp

order	add
.when i access my customer object on the client and want to add an order there is no add methods and the order properties is an arrays

1947409
put	get
the get doesn t necessarily have to return the same representation as what you put but it does have to be the same resource

1947409
json	xml
i m currently working on a web application that will return any resource as xhtml json or a custom xml dialect depending on what you ask for in the content-negotiation headers

1947423
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
unfortunately mysql does not support function based indexes like postgresql and oracle

1947423
triggers	insert
a possible workaround in mysql is to add another column for lower case email addresses and a triggers that populate it with lower case email on all updates and insert

1947430
aptana	egit
my development-environment is aptana and i use the egit plugins as aptana is basically eclipse underneath

value	field
the warehouse table has a 1-to-many realtionship to cars tvs toys on the warehousenumber field i ve been trying to make a query that would give me the sum dollar value that is a field in cars tvs and toys tables

1947474
value	field
first i am trying to get distictive recording based on the warehouse.warehousenumber field value like this

1947475
uppercase	toupper
the advantage of toupper is that it checked the current locale to convert characters to uppercase

1947476
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
here is what happens during a normals visit with firefox safari google-chrome

1947499
stateless	stateful
in the context of a simple point-to-point communication protocols what are the advantages disadvantages of stateful and stateless protocolss

1947499
stateless	stateful
another question about simple point-to-point communication protocols brought up some good examples namely hdlc stateful and modbus stateless

1947504
contains	set
this will create a recording set contains

1947520
updating	updates
i m looking for advice on whether it would be better to store the cardholder s current status as a field at the customer level and deal with the potential updates anomalies resulting from potential updatess of invoices recordinging without updating the corresponding cardholder s recording or whether it makes more sense to simply calculate the current cardholder status based on data in the database every time the status is requested which could place a lot of load on the database and slow down the .app

1947531
javascript	dom
2 there s adding it to the dom properties for the event in javascript

1947548
keydown	keyup
.when i listen for keyup and keydown events with wmode transparency i receive 2 keydown events followed by a single keyup event for the following key f-key arrow key ins del home end page up page down pause printing screens application key windows key and the equivalent numeric keypad key

1947548
keydown	keyup
our application required wmode transparency and needs to handle both keyup and keydown events for the problematic key .so i m looking for the best way to .solve this

1947575

1947587
lightbox	jqmodal
you can try facebox lightbox but the simplest is jqmodal

1947606
user-controls	ascx
i actually see another solution to embed the ascx aspx in the user-controls libs and then use a custom virtualpathprovider to get them

1947612
document	editing
cs menu s are not appearing in solution-explorer or in the document windows .when editing the controllers file according to walther video he simply right-clicks on the index methods and he gets a cs menu option to create a view an add view dialog windows

1947626
extends	sealed
they want iis to be around they are sealed .so you can extends or mock them

1947630
constructor	object
if i were you i would create a constructor for your handler that accepts an httpcontextbase object and use a mock inorder to test your headers properly

1947634
windows-xp	windows
i am getting the following odbc exception-handling .when i move my development platform from windows-xp x86 to windows 7 x64

1947634
32-bit	64bit
what i m sure it means is that the server it is connecting to is 32-bit and the computer i m running on is 64bit and the odbc drivers in use is 64bit

1947634
32-bit	64bit
the application i am writing is set to run in 32-bit mode because some of the third-party software that we employ is not 64bit compatible

1947653
short	base
short of doing reflection in a base controllers to checked the current action the user is calling i cannot think of an elegant way to discard the data on the disallowed request

1947658
.when	ready
execute your scripting .when the dom is ready

1947661
directory	folder
instead of sending a directory why not zip the folder to save bandwidth and time

1947664
linked-list	nodes
by making the first nodes pointers a static-class member you are basically saying that there will only be a single linked-list in your whole program

1947682
boost	stl
i have been using a using a boost tuples as the value in an stl map

1947694
any	set
if cs has the no pad characteristic then the pad character is an implementation-dependent character different from any character in the character set of x and y that collates less than any string under cs

1947695
32-bit	64bit
it sounds more that you ve setup a 32-bit dsn using the 64bit odbc administration

1947698
exception-handling	try-catch
plus enum.parse will throw an exception-handling if its not defined and since there s no tryparse you d need to wrap it in try-catch block

1947705
linked-list	nodes
static means that every nodes in every linked-list in your entire program has the same beginning

1947740
duplicates	contains
this code execute without error but the output contains a duplicates of every column of every row like .so

1947740
duplicates	contains
i also checked the db and the table does not contains duplicates entries

1947742
virtualbox	vmware	virtualization	virtualbox	virtualization	vmware
with the ease of virtualization it s rather easy to spin up a vmware virtualbox image foor the various distros to create test packaging for each of them

1947770
subclassing	base-class
in general if you re implements a base-class ie subclassing form it s better to overrides the base-class methods

1947788
default-value	arguments
the default-value for the 2nd arguments to mysql_fetch_arrays is mysql_both which gives you back an arrays indexed numerically and associatively

1947792
order	join
you will most probably need to force the engine to use the correct table order in the join using a hint like this

1947808
derived-class	base-class
in derived-class your hiding the variables field declare in the base-class

1947829
callback	methods
2 + the upside of option 2 is that .when the service provider methods is being called the selector specifying the callback action must al.so be specified .so the programmer knows right there which methods will be invoked back to process the results

1947850
unique	words
in other words if my listview has column1 column2 and column3 i want combobox1 to display all unique items in column1

1947852
firefox	opera
i have firefox opera and chromium web browsers on my ubuntu box and i manage to run cycles of development and testing pretty quickly and happily

1947854
constructor	object
you can prevent the default-constructor by requiring the other object to have copy constructor also or use special constructor which pass in all information needed to construct the object

1947875
constructor	object
if your class contains user defined types and .when you create object of it then compiler has to call default constructor for each object

1947902
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
ajaxterm works great with firefox and ie8 but is unusable with google-chrome safari and opera

a good way to explore the shape object is to recording a macros while you try to manipulate the image and then look at the vba code it created to see what you did

1947926
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
mysql specifies collation for every character column which may be case-sensitive or case-insensitive

1947931
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
copy-constructor is a completely independent full-fledged constructor that construct an object completely by itself

1947931
constructor	object
it is not possible to apply two different constructor to the same object

1947931
constructor	object
if you construct your object in both ways then they become two completely independent constructor each having its own independent purpose

1947954
instrumentation	debugging
i will be shure there are plenty of leaks in your .app and with instrumentation you can find and debugging even the hardest memory issues

1947977
subclassing	inherited
.sometimes it pays to inherited from the regular controls and provide configuration information in the subclassing .so that they know how to load themselves

1947986
output	mode
you can specify that the output be treated as cdata .when using explicit mode xml queries

1947987
initializer	setter
initializer that properties from the arrays of strings from default in your initializerr and updates the arrays of strings in default in the properties s setter

1948011

lookup	any
what is more we never repeat ourselves should any of the lookup logic need to be reused anywhere

1948047
any	set
before deleting a department i would like to set any user having that department id to a default-value 1 to avoid a referential integrity error

1948053
any	set
in postgresql 8.2 any insert delete updates query may have a returning clause that acts like a simple selected performed on the result set of the change query

1948054
javascript	dom
this is where memory-leaks occur a javascript object is referencing a dom object and vice-versa

1948071
constructor	private
also in your example the functions declare in the constructor function are private to the scoping of the function

1948071
constructor	object
.when you create a new object using a constructor function the value of the function s prototype properties is assign as the new object s prototype object

1948078
value	field
another example from the framework is datarowcollection.add it s useful to be able to add field value without building an object arrays first

1948086
16-bit	x86
q1 q2 the x86 instruction set maintains its 16-bit history

1948086
16-bit	8bit

1948125
profiling	trace
have you tried to do a sql profiling trace on the production machine to find out which sql is being emitted

1948126
32-bit	16-bit
one 32-bit variant works like the 16-bit multiplication but writes the register into edx eax

1948129
restart	exit
if .so you could test the error level in the batch-file and if it s 1 loopback and restart the program but if it s zero exit the batch-file

1948131
haskell	ocaml
it s my understanding that structural-typing is used by types inferencers and the like to determine types information think haskell or ocaml while duck-typing doesn t care about typess per se just that the thing can handle a specific methods invocation properties access etc

1948139
arrays	loops
use a for-loops or a foreach loops that iterates over the arrays index...same difference

1948139
arrays	loops
i don t know of any systemd variables that holds the current arrays index inside a foreach loops and i don t think one exists

1948145

1948263
panels	grid
construct the grid tab panels

1948263
panels	grid
now that you re setting cookies updates step 1 .so that you construct the grid tab panels using settings you read from the user s cookies

1948267
compact-framework	.net

external	embed
i need to embed a tiny webserver in a compiled jsfl external libs for adobe flash-cs4 .so that an outside process can communication with it

1948451
telnet	ssh
.so an alternative is to tunnel the telnet connection through the secure ssh connection using ports forwarding

1948451
telnet	ssh
with this strategy you ll continue to run telnet on your client and server but the connection is encrypted using ssh

1948451
telnet	ssh
.so on your client you d telnet to localhost and the connection will be forwarded to the telnet server running on the same box as the ssh daemons

1948452

1948638
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
what i have found over my 12 years of developing front-end interfaces is you d be better off to start development on ie and test for bugs on firefox opera safari and google-chrome opposed to going about it the other way around

1948638
javascript	dom
if you know the dom html css javascript not jquery and the like surely you ll be able to overcome most if not all cross-browser inefficiencies

1948652

normally with a large amount of recording one show a subset of it for example only 100 out of hunderd thousand and then page through to the next 100 etc.

1948731
push	pull
some of the decision is just down to whether you want a push pull systemd though

1948740
nsmutablearray	nsarray
are you using nsarray or nsmutablearray

32-bit	64bit
for example if you aren t sure that a 32-bit int will do use a 64bit int

1948752
key-value	key
if all you have is a surrogate key you can always add another row with every other attributes exactly identical to an existing row as long as you give it a different surrogate key-value

1948760
selected	textbox
lets say if the user selected foo or bar in the first dropdown then the behavor changes .so that the second dropdown is disabled and the thrid dropdown will show a textbox instead

1948762
onresume	onpause
you should try cleaning up on onpause and then onresume re-instate the stuff you need

1948763
versioning	upgrade
however some changes were made to the data-access application block in versioning 3.1 may 2007 which may affect applications written for earlier versioninging if you upgrade to the current versioning of enterprise libs

1948763
sql-server	oracle
i guess if one wanted to provide for an easier switching to say oracle from ms sql-server this is a useful way to configure things

1948765
parsing	comma
if you want to allow multiple selection of value give the user multiple textbox could dynamically generator or consider simply allowing the user to enter a comma separated list of numbers and parsing it in your code-behind

1948765
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1948781
nested	order
here s how i would write that query relying on order of precedence between and and or instead of .so many nested parentheses

1948782
put	get
an alternative way to solve the problem is to use an extra arguments in put and get which changes the delimeter

1948785
fclose	fopen
you ll probably need to rely on an fopen fseek fclose etc

1948796

1948831
primitive-types	reference-type
in javascript primitive-types are copy-paste by value and reference-type are copy-paste by reference

1948881
tree	trie
a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to int

1948881
binary-search-tree	map
even a binary-search-tree stl s map might be superior to a hash based containers in terms of memory use and numbers of key comparisons

1948882
click	mouse
vertical scroll settings work well in other apps such as firefox but netbeans only scrolls one line per mouse wheel click

1948893

it works beautifully in firefox but in internet-explorer any table on the page gets hidden but there is nothing in the view-source that show it hidden

1948927
getter	setter
i agree that getter setter are verbose

1948943
conditional-operator	operands
the strange if you are accustomed to the c-like ternary conditional-operator order of the operands is attributed to many things

continuous-integration	teamcity
for continuous-integration we use out the box teamcity configuration

1948947
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit dll cannot be inject into a 64bit process and a 64bit dll cannot be inject into a 32-bit process

1948947
32-bit	64bit
if an application required the use of hooks in other process it is required that a 32-bit application call setwindowshookex to inject a 32-bit dll into 32-bit process and a 64bit application call setwindowshookex to inject a 64bit dll into 64bit process

1948947

the solution i d propose would be to abstract the object passed to accountant to an interface iaccountee and have person implements it .

1948956
output	cat
if it doesn t solve the issue paste here the output of git-branch -a and cat .git configuration run n both repo

1948957
bison	yacc
keep in mind that with yacc or bison you will have to write a grammar in their language

1948986
haskell	python
as a purely-functional language haskell basically mandates that one program in a declarative functional styles .so hands-down haskell is more functional than python

1949010
shell	bash	subshell	bash
sometimes that is appropriate - but most often it is stuff that a c shell programmer wrote not realizing that the notation means run a subshell in bourne shell and derivative - such as korn shell the posix-compliant shell and bash

checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button	value	field
i also have a updates button and .when the user click it i want to insert rows into my table with the same value for the dropdown and checkbox field in all the rows but i want different value for each row depending on the list items that were selected

1949054
selected	listbox
i know that multiple rows can be insert into a table using the union selected statement but how am i supposed to apply that with a listbox

1949066
imageview	textview
the .app runs once fills the information on the screens layout listview textview imageview etc and user reads the information

wrap the call that is throw argumentexception-handling with a try-catch exception-handling ex and step into the exception-handling block to see the raw exception-handling

1949073
installation	packaging
you have some options though assuming you are not ready to switching to using something more flexible such as wix or a commercial installation packaging product

1949077
enterprise-architect	visio
for more details you can checkout my full answer at what is a good visio enterprise-architect replacement

1949117
pointers	stack
what happens .when someone passes me a pointers to something on stack

1949125
object-reference	instances
the editor is created on an article instances and if it works with that object-reference its contents will change posibly change it after a confirm rollback descision in the ui.

1949125
callback	methods
the save methods in article and publication can callback to methods in the articlestore interface this would not need changes in entitymanager if a new subclassing is added to the hierarchy

1949145
reflection	runtime
as far as wiring up the function-pointers or signals and slots at runtime based on a configuration file to do this elegantly will required reflection which c++ doesn t provide for you

1949181
debugging	trace
alternatively the traceappender can write out to the standards .net trace listener for further redirection or display in the debugging output windows in visual-studio

1949193
triggers	insert
if performance is important use a triggers or indexed view to store the calculations .when the data is insert updates or deleted

1949200
value	field
i have this working but for some reason datetime field are formated as hex value that are casted to datetime

1949210
lookup	any
we have all sorts of non-build related tasks for the exact same reason as your coworker had i want one spot to lookup any and all jobs i need run

1949221
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
i generally use git but .some people find mercurial a bit simpler to use there are lots of others like subversion bazaar and .so on but git and mercurial are the most popular distribute revision control systemd which make it easier to just version-control a directory on your disk without setting up a server

1949227
masstransit	nservicebus
i am reading enterprise-integration patterns and i ve also been looking a little bit at nservicebus and masstransit

1949240
platform	anycpu
be sure to take advantage of it with project properties building tab platform target anycpu and prefer 32-bit unticked

1949259

how can i remove the messages as a parameter from the constructor and then set the messages based on the value of field and fieldvalue

1949286
openssl	gnutls
gnutls and openssl being two of them

1949289
value	field
if you want to overwrite all of the existing field of an object with the value from another instances there is no easy way to do it

1949289
value	field
it can be done if you re willing to write some wacky reflection code to visit each field of the object and copy the value

1949292
deep-copy	object
are you trying to get a deep-copy one where every field with a reference-type is also set to a memberwiseclone of the originally-referenced object ad infinitum

1949299
show	next
the next relevant question would be why is it not sufficient to show errors via song#create

1949305
filtering	sorting
i would use the built-in capabilities of linq-to-xml to handle filtering sorting

1949307
decimal-point	digits
if you don t want to go with chris s answer you could use numbers and punctuation keypad and then disable all non digits decimal-point input by implements the methods of uitextfielddelegate

1949363
getter	setter
however there are often benefits .when using getter and setter related to versioning and api compatibility

1949368
strncpy	strcpy
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949377
firefox	safari
it works both in ie and firefox and the last time i checked safari too

1949390
hide	show
this would only stop average users who run windows with the default hide systemd files and don t have show hidden-files checkeded from copying the file and including the volume id disk size and volume named also in your checked would insist that it is only allowed to a mirrored device

1949394
.when	ready
.when you re ready then just

1949394
any	set
the only tricky thing is to always building a new table or toggle between two tables but this shouldn t be too difficult to set up and probably easier than totally avoiding any problems that might occur with your original suggestion

1949400
crystal-reports-xi	crystal-reports	crystal-reports-xi	business-objects	business-objects	crystal-reports

1949426
windows-vista	windows
has anyone got apache ftp-server to function as a windows service in windows 7 or even windows-vista

1949432
getter	setter
getter and setter also give you more control over what value the variables can be set to

1949437
value	field
the color preferences page is an example of a simple page that uses a single jface field editor to manage its value

1949439
operator-precedence	binary-operators
only the operator-precedence may be a pitfall with binary-operators

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter cost more in most languages but they buy you flexibility down the road

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter let you do parameter validation

1949448
getter	setter
but i use getter and setter only .when i need them right away or .when i m pretty sure i m going to need the flexibility

1949457
children	nodes
each time you start with the children of a nodes you add the right value of that nodes to the stack.

1949457
children	tree
to show the tree children

1949457
children	nodes
children of that nodes have a right

1949462
comet	chat
if you mean in an ajax kind of way you should look at the comet chat .app

1949471
uisearchbar	uitableview
i have an uitableview and i did put an uisearchbar on it

1949471
uisearchbar	uitableview
what i want to achieve is that if a user is going to scroll i want the uisearchbar elements to be fixed on the top plus i want the first row of the uitableview fixed as well

1949471
uitableview	uiview	uisearchbar	uitableview	put	get
one way to get the uisearchbar elements fixed could be if i put an uiview under both elementss uitableview and uisearchbar and put those two consecutively among themselves just a thought of me don t know if this actually is working

1949478
value	field
not the short versioning but you can use urlvariable to get all the field named value into an object and then add or delete any field you want

1949491
contains	elements
the format of the xml is very simple 4 header elements then a repeat sequences contains the recording elements

1949493
.war	jar
something like a jar hidden inside a .war or something which could have been building with an earlier versioning of the class

1949494
dictionary	arrays
.so your plist would have the arrays of your entries and it would have another dictionary

1949494
dictionary	arrays
the dictionary contains the definition text keyed by the value from the first arrays

1949499
display	outline
if one is then selected i want the fields-for that outline to be display and modifiable just like an inline field

1949511
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implements by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1949511
required	checked
secondly to return to the original question the more preferable way to determine the even-ness odd-ness of a value is certainly the num 2 approach since it implements the required checked literally by definition and clearly expresses the fact that the checked is purely mathematical

1949529
jquery-file-upload	uploadify
i strongly suggest you give this jquery-file-upload plugins a try uploadify

1949530
button	popup
a windows popup data is changed and the ok button is pressed we send a messages to our cmd handler to handle this change

1949530
response	timeout
given that timeout are hopefully exceptional and that response should normally be received within a few seconds would mean that this list should normally have at most 1 outstanding cmd in it

1949539
expression	evaluation
in java .when we invoke recursion we do .so by evaluation the expression tree and re.solving each part of it until we determine the value of each part of the expression

1949539
expression	evaluation
in the case of recursion what we are doing is making a call to the same function hopefully with different terminating value which needs to be resolved before we can complete the evaluation of the current expression

1949552
arrays	loops
instead of doing foreach loops on the arrays it would be faster to use arrays_search to find the proper key

1949583
javascript	dom
jquery and prototype rely heavily on the browser s dom not just javascript

1949597
panning	pan
the expected output is a normals smooth pan without the additional jump in the case of panning and no jump prior to the zoom scale in the case of the scaling

1949625
distinct-values	contains
why not just create another properties that contains only the distinct-values from the list using a linq query or something like that

1949626
portrait	screens
whether the iphone is in portrait or landscape the screens coordinates don t change .so you ll need to adjust for that in your .app

1949641
any	set
does mysql give any guarantees to which order the result set rows will be given

1949663
versioning	upgrade
if you ports your .app to another branding of rdbms or even if you upgrade to a newer versioning of mysql that may implements storage differently the rows could come back in some other order

1949666
innodb	myisam
per this thread default sort is insert order for myisam and primary key ascending for innodb

1949680
gnome	xfce
exo-open in xfce see the comments in the gnome link

express-checkout	paypal
you are required to use direct payment api and express-checkout together as part of the website payment pro solution. as express-checkout required you to show paypal logos etc

1949708
constructor	object
my initial approach was to implements constructor for each object that could take a datatable row as an arguments and create an instances that corresponded to the data

1949720
decrement	increment
you probably can do this with increment decrement - just keep a reference counter right next to your reference

1949721
sdl-ttf	sdl
if you want some of the non-core sdl sub-libraries you ll have to include those separately ghc source.hs -lsdl -sdl_ttf -package sdl -package sdl-ttf

1949721
packaging	building
you may also want to consider setting up a building file using cabal the haskell packaging systemd especially if your program expands beyond a couple source files

1949741
lighttpd	apache
i don t really have an answer for you but after some very basic inspector i can tell you that staging apache is returning a 200 with the entire file and stream29l lighttpd is returning a 206 with a partials file

1949749
javascript	dom
in internet-explorer using document.domain on a page and then creating an iframe with javascript will cause you to be immediately locked out of the iframe - you can create it but it s not created in the correct document.domain .so you re not able to access its dom due to security restrictions

1949749
attributes	properties
to get around this i m setting the dynamically created iframe s src attributes to load a static html file that s hosted in the same domain different subdomain and setting its document.domain properties to the appropriate value

1949749
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this happens in firefox 3.0 and all versioning of ie possibly other browsers though it does not happen in some browsers i ve tested firefox 3.5 safari google-chrome

1949793
if-statement	loops
in other languages like java i know that if-statement and loops create a new block-level scoping but that s not the case here

1949814

i am trying to connect to a .net wcf service in android using ksoap2 v 2.1.2 but i keep getting a fatal exception-handling whenever i try to make the service call

1949845
pascal	forth
it goes back and forth between camel casing and pascal casing

1949852
foundation	cocoa
foundation appkit and core data together are cocoa

1949852
foundation	cocoa
thus inorder for the compiler to know about nsexpression you need to have already import foundation foundation.h or cocoa cocoa.h

1949853
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
git mercurial and bazaar are the new boys on the distribute version-control scene but all of them are mainly used in a nix environment

1949871
boolean	int
public static session createsession string smtpserver int smtpport boolean ssl boolean authentication

1949874
python	java
.when i first came from java to python i hated this

1949888
put	get
all items dragged out of list2 and dropped anywhere outside the list get put back into list 1 in their correct place in the list by alphabetical or natural order.

1949894
perl	c++
expanding on mark bessey s answer i really like cxxtest because it s just a set of c++ header-files perl scripting

1949894
perl	c++
as long as you have a c++ compiler perl it will work on nearly any systemd

1949903
contains	any
the event does not do anything to that other object .so that other object like form1 in my example above does not in any way related to this event contains a reference back to the object

1949909
unsigned	bigint
change the datatype to an unsigned bigint

1949925
directory	folder
stop your service delete the artifact directory folder and restart your service

1949937
hide	show
this way you have the images and location in the master page and can hide and show the appropriate one based on the themes

1949944
any	set
.so in conclusion you just need to set up a new area for each balloon or for that matter any area of the image you want a hover effect on

1949956
value	field
how can i get the current value of a field

1950010
required	checked
and i will be checked for function_exists in any functions that required taxonomy.php .so as to suppress errors.

1950015
click	mouse
there was a ton of code that could be reused and the difference between interpreting a local player click with their mouse versus receiving a messages through the network to indicate that a remote player did something similar helped me see what logic simply couldn t be tied to the view at all

1950015
keyboard	mouse
once you re thinking of the model as a separate entity from the view it should be easier to imagine how player integration through mouse and keyboard could triggers cmd from controllers to make changes to the model and notify the view of those changes

1950028
height	frame
a floating-point numbers specifies a fractions of the frame s height

1950051
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit viewmodel and .so i suppose the 64bit viewmodel from sun does not take account for available physical memory .when calculating the maximum heap but is only limited by the 2gb addressable memory on windows and linux or 4gb on .solaris or possibly failing to allocate enough memory at startup for the management area

1950068
any	set
if you set this to yes on your view the uiimageview shouldn t extends outside of that view any more

1950072
silverlight	wpf
but wpf has previewevents .so it will be easy to monitor the activity in wpf than silverlight

1950115
racket	scheme
if you re finding it difficult you might want to try standards ml or racket formerly called plt scheme or drscheme

1950126
udp	tcp
the .app streaming real-time audio data using a preexisting tcp protocols .so switching to udp isn t an option

1950133
entity	poco
a linq-to-sql entity is supposed to be a poco with no awareness of sibling entities or the underlying database at all

1950133
filtering	grouping
be aware that this may break queries that try to filtering grouping on the new alias wrapper i believe linq will complain that it can t find a sql mapping

1950149
xlsx	xls
or perhaps consider just using the file cck elements and using its settings to only allow files with xls and xlsx extensions to be upload - that would probably save you a whole lot of time

1950150
defined	declare
a member function can be declare but not defined using a typesdef for a function types

1950172
subclassing	inherited
any subclassing of uiviewcontroller will inherited this properties

how can mootools 1.11 determine if a div contains any checked checkbox

1950242
arrays	loops
i wanted to get the value from the articles table only once and get the category_id in a loops .so that i can add those loopsed value in an arrays and carry on my process

1950242
arrays	loops
.so my question would be how do i get all the category_id from the 2nd table in a loops and add them to the arrays and at the same time make sure that the value from table 1 are fetched only once i do realize that the value fetched from the table 1 are the same but does not make sense to loops on them

1950272
value	field
it resembles a key-value relationship where the first field of a row is the named and the second is the value

1950275
event-loop	libev
it is also based on libev and is designed to be completely nonblocking meaning you don t have to worry about context switching between threads everything runs on a single event-loop

1950301

i wonder is there already an open source implementation or example of arpack eigensolver that works well with pardiso solver and intel-mkl libs

1950349
any	set
in this many-to-many scenario you describe you can t avoid duplicates data in any single result set you get

1950361
dictionary	arrays
the dictionary contains a bunch of arrayss each arrays contains named and the key is an alphabet the first letter of those named

1950366
asp.net-mvc	webforms
or to make it even easer use a custom view page for asp.net-mvc or custom page class for webforms that has a methods that does this already for you

1950367
gnome	kde
it attempts to defined some basic functionality that will work in all unix-like desktops such as gnome and kde

1950367
pthreads	fork
doing fork and calling systemd instead of execute is undefined-behavior on pthreads .so i don t recommend that

1950377
postback	ajax
there is an ajax option in the system.web.mvc.ajax to use an ajaxform with ajax options for doing the postback async and it s easy to setup

1950384
hide	show
then every time someone click that div again it toggle hide show

1950394

ssrs big pro auto export in the report viewer to export report to pdf excel etc

1950438
javascript	dom
i would like for the javascript to identify if the child or next dom elements is-empty to not fire

1950457
perl	ruby
however and perhaps a bit surprisingly regexps as defined in perl java ruby and a few other languages but also grep and sed are not suitable for dealing with this problem

1950461
protected	public
this include public protected default package access and private field but excludes inherited field

1950464
any	set
then you can control the operation easily being able to set how many operations can run concurrently set up any dependencies some operations may have on others

1950472
getter	setter
i suggest you use the setter getter methods instead of accessing the field directly

1950472
naming-conventions	getter-setter
tools like bean copy utils also use getter-setter that s why they work only on beans which have getter-setters that conform to the naming-conventions

1950474
superclass	inherited
the problems with multiple-inheritedance arise .when two superclass defined the same member variables or .when you run into the diamond-problem d1 and d2 inherited b and d3.js inheriteded d1 and d2 inheriteding b twice

1950542
margins	padding	hidden	reset
just reset all margins and padding to 0 .so that no hidden spaces is taken up

1950557
derived-class	base-class
however i often drop that for a derived-class where the base-class must have include them because of member function-prototypes that are overrides -- which is true for this and that in your example

1950593
deep-copy	object
the deep-copy function is recursive and it will work its way down through a deeply nested object

1950595
cryptography	security
ffx has security proof independent cryptography review and is not a new cypher

1950611
handler	service
i d look to see if your performance needs really justify the extra hassle and overhead of an async handler eg you need to service many more concurrent request than threads in the process etc

1950612
.when	ready
and .when everything else is updates and ready to move on i call

1950627
mersenne-twister	generator
you can generator your own pseudo-random numbers -- there s a huge amount of theory behind that start for example here -- and of course you won t be able to compete with python random mersenne-twister explained halfway down the large wikipedia page i pointed you to in either quality or speed but for purposes of understanding it s a good endeavor

1950661
base-class	inherited
in my opinion the object dc refers to should have only one non-override methods - public void f methods which make it the public methods invisible .when refered to with base-class reference.since the object dc referes to does not have the private void f methods either because the deriverclass could not inherited the private methods how could the object dc refers to call methods f

1950664
allegro	sdl
there s also allegro if you re not a fan of sdl

1950665
requiredfieldvalidator	radiobuttonlist
this question is tagged asp.net unless i am missing something wouldn t a radiobuttonlist with a requiredfieldvalidator be ideal

1950687
dictionary	arrays
in one of my navigation view controllers i building an arrays of dictionary to display in a table

1950687
dictionary	arrays
based on which one i selected i then remove the dictionary from the arrays using

1950696
value	field
now the code using this to parsing an input with a possible arrays as an a value and validation each elements and regenerate the exact form submitted with the identical arbitrary field

1950700
selected	listbox
there s no need to pull the data out of the listbox but you can use code in a form to look at value s selected in the listbox and do a useful things with those selection made

1950700
selected	listbox
again to work with the selected data from that listbox you don t need an arrays you don t need connection strings and you don t need to write a whole bunch of code to repeat what is our data currying and is available inside of that form hint the data inside of that list box is available for you as a collections

1950702
subtract	add
if you know the user s offset-from-utc in seconds you can just add subtract that from the time_t and pass the result to gmtime_r

1950714

your y coordinates are negative because you are doing a 90 degree rotation of the 320x480 screens probably because you re playing in landscape and not portrait

1950769
value	field
i wonder if you haven t stumbled upon a bug where writing that length field is overwriting part of the callback value

1950771
instances	private
a common ish misconception is that private is per instances rather than per class

1950771
instances	private
that is not the case any foo instances can access the private variables methods of any other foo instances

1950771
private-members	instances	private-members	private	instances	private
private just means that instances of other classes other than foo in this case cannot access the private-members

1950802
push	pull
subsequent push pull operations will presumably be less traffic-hungry

1950804
contains	elements
you master page can then simply contains an elements with always the same css class

output	cat	git-commit	git-diff
paste here what git-diff git-status cat .git configuration say on and what is the exact output of git-commit -am test

1950905
static-class	inherited
why can t a static-class be inherited into a normals class

1950921
subclassing	inherited
if b inherited from is a subclassing of a that means an instances of b can be stored in a variables of types a and its virtual methods will call those of class b

1950921
static-classes	inherited
for static-classes you don t have the concept of an instances of the class .so there s no way to inherited

1950941
difference	zero
if the difference between consecutive months was greater than 1 then the months were not adjacent and we should set their value to zero

1951025
python	ruby
python ruby etc

1951025
python	java	python	ruby
i would suggest getting a good sampling of each java ruby python c# and work on what feels most natural as the next step

1951047
textbox	button
1 i have a textbox and a button in my page consider it as home.aspx

1951056
binaries	install
you should install cygwin and his python package and even git package if you want to get a correct pthreads environment with binaries and libs prepare for it

1951081
getter	setter
but you will need public setter getter for the properties you want to copy and you should have them anyway and you will have to create the instances of the target object beforehand

1951110
mechanize	hpricot
i recommend using a combinations of mechanize and hpricot but here s a fairly comprehensive list

1951119
abstract-class	subclassing	abstract	super
any instances of a concrete subclassing of an abstract-class implicit is an instances of the abstract super types too

1951119
javassist	cglib
if you mean can i have an instances of an abstract-class without defining a concrete subtyping -- yes if some libs for example javassist cglib generator a concrete subtyping for you

1951120
spring	grails
i personally don t believe learning spring and hibernate is worth it unless you have a good job related reason to grails is much easier to use

1951122
checkbox	button

1951123
http	ssl
i solved my problem by adding a service dependency to the service for http ssl service httpfilter

1951123
.net	wcf
i had the exact same problem on an xp machine with a windows service that i wrote in .net that exposed a wcf endpoint with a netpipe and http binding

children	tree	children	nodes
in the best case the tree is completed balanced and each nodes has two children

1951147
dictionary	arrays
plus if you are going to use a lot of these stuff you can make use of vbscript s dictionary collections or arrays to store your variables

1951157
value	field
but then where does the propertyvaluesbinary field come in if you ve already put the value into the propertyvaluesstring

1951172
jython	pypy
but most other python implementation jython on the jvm ironpython on .net pypy on all sorts of backends pynie on parrot unladen swallow on llvm if and .when it matures per its published roadmap ... do not guarantee the use of reference count -- many garbage-collection strategies may be involved with all sort of other advantages

1951174
sql-server	mysql
i have 2 big tables in sql-server that i need to sync to mysql

1951182
any	set
however webrat gives you a workaround the header methods with which any header can be set for the duration of the request

1951184
derived-class	base-class
specifically if a derived-class has a private methods and a new versioning of the base types introduces a non-private methods with the same signature the derived-class and new base-class cannot be used together

1951210
compact-framework	.net
i need to use a com object in my .net 2.0 compact-framework project but i can t use the createobject function

case-when a friend-function is defined not only declare inside class is covered by 11.4.5 a function can be defined in a friend declaration of a class if and only if the class is a non-local class the function named is unqualified and the function has namedspace scoping -- your example fulfils these requirements

1951235
decrement	increment
using const saves you the overhead of increment decrement the refcounter for the string that you use

1951237

optimally i would like to checked for any numbers of levels without having to loops through the whole arrays

1951250
margins	padding
you probably want a combinations of margins offset outside elements and padding offset inside elements

1951254
value	field
once you change a field in this case marks the previous value is lost

1951258

don t know what jquery versioning you are using or if you are testing with ie but there is a bug with jquery 1.3.2 using fadein fadeout that might be causing problems

1951267
export	csv
there s a simple api to query it and you can export your results to csv or db

1951271
decrement	increment
in general loops performance isn t going to be dictated by the control logic the increment decrement and the conditional that gets checked every time through

1951271
decrement	increment
having to go to memory more often than needed is much more expensive than compares increment or decrement

1951272
margins	padding
how would i give a nstextview some padding a margins to the left

1951282
textbox	button
now the button doesn t add new textbox

1951290

otherwise you are stuck using the streaming read methods much like a systemd call to read data into a buffering

1951373
firefox	safari
we re working on a project with a numbers of applets that has to work across a large range of os windows mac linux browsers ie firefox safari etc and java versioning 1.5+ and it often happens that a fix we apply will cause some sort of security exception-handling an another platform or some other error

1951394
uniform	points
to answer your question directly soap primarily violates points 6 it doesn t provide a uniform set of verbs across apis

1951410
order	join
however since you have the order by operation in there i think that a sort-merge might still beat it as the query is written right now because the optimiser will sort a smaller dataset for the sort-merge than it would for the hash join because in the latter case it would have to sort more columns of data

1951418
pixels	line
it just repeat the next line of pixels over and over again until your image stretch to the proper width

1951425
implements	extends
abstract-class implements some functionality and on top of that defined additional abstract-methods which must be implementss by the classes extends

1953811
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i want to create a methods that can take an nsmutablearray or an nsarray object

1953811
nsmutablearray	nsarray
or convert the nsarray to nsmutablearray before passing

1953814
groovy	scala
i cannot speak for scala but i have personally used spring with groovy

1953820
value	field
propertiesnames holds a string value contains information about the .profile properties value present in the propertiesvaluestring and propertiesvaluebinary field

1953820
value	field
the second parameter which is either b for binary or s for string indicates whether the corresponding properties value is stored in the propertiesvaluesstring field s or the propertiesvaluesbinary field b

1953820
value	field
startpos and length indicate the starting positioning 0-based of the corresponding properties value within these field and the length of the data respectively

1953820
value	field
the s value in the propertiesnames field contains the offset and lengths needed to decompose propertiesvaluestring into individual properties value

1953820
value	field
the b value in the propertiesnames field contains the offset and lengths needed to decompose propertiesvaluebinary into individual properties value

1953838
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsmutablearray derives from nsarray .so as long as you re only using the nsarray members such as readonly enumerator you ll be safe

1953842
python	java
then your java can move on to the next thing while python runs in the background

1953842
python	java
your python backend runs concurrently with your java simulation front end

1953843
nsmutablearray	nsarray
use -- nsmutablearray inherited from it and you can iterate both as if they were nsarray s

1953846
nsmutablearray	nsarray
since nsmutablearray is a subclassing of nsarray just have your methods take an nsarray parameter

1953868
value	field
i would like to get document that have the same value in similar field like first named last named across two indexes

1953872
required	checked
the slightly stronger approach is to install a self-updating exe .so it goes to a database to checked release versioning downloading those assemblies that it required before loading the final application

1953888
lookup	any
...so the service to connect to is simply defined as channel 1 without any sdp lookup

1953889
expression	evaluation
is it possible to have this expression utilized to retrieve either the string named or the value of evaluation it

1953893
directory-structure	subdirectories
if you cd to the subdirectories before firing up the javac compiler your compiled .class-files will end up in the same directory-structure with each .class-file sitting in the same directory and next to its .java file

1953931
callback	methods
the stubs generator by wsdl tool will create the begin end invoke methodss .so that you can provide a callback methods to effectively allow you to submit your request and continue your code without waiting for a reply

i have an aspx masterpage with jquery and thickbox references

1953973
communication	messages
i have been able to make a sample chat application where one user can communication with other user by transmitting messages to server and then from server to other user s by using it but i am finding it some what difficult to manage sockets established in peer - to - peer chat and getting mixed up in server and client delegation provided by asyncsocket class .when both are implements at one nodes

1954014
gzip	zip
you can zip files using gzip but usually if the server is set up correctly the server will automatically serve gzipped files if the browser signals it can handle them

1954040
attributes	properties
the datacontractserializationr will serialization either all public properties if you don t specify anything - possible as of .net 3.5 sp1 or the approach i prefer anything you labels with a data-members attributes

1954040
attributes	properties
.so the best you can do is mark your class with a attributes and all the members properties field etc. that you really want in your datacontract with a attributes

1954040
attributes	properties
if .so you ll probably have to use the xmlserializationr for that serialization process instead - there you can get more control over how things are serialization but as a drawback the xmlserializationr will serialization every public properties that s not explicit marked with a attributes - an opt-out scheme

1954046
any	set
this user should never have any group-policy applicable and should never have passwd expiry set

1954056
textchanged	textbox
you can set updatesourcetrigger to explicit and in the textchanged event handler of the textbox you can call updatesource explicit after performing the things you want

1954062
revision	svn
what i cannot really emulate .so far is the automatic detection of a local uncommitted changes based on the last checked out svn revision that makes subwcrev .so useful

1954062
revision	svn
i am replacing with the revision numbers of the svn repository as subwcrev would do but this time i add my abbreviated git-commit hash to identify the code i compiled

1954062
revision	svn
my question now is is there a way to distinguish in a shell scripting whether my current head differs from the last fetched svn revision .so that i could omit adding the part and set to false

1954066
keyboard	mouse
for this code i need it to show the data for pc mouse keyboard but it only show pc how can i make it do that as i have to write the code three time and the xslt .sort code doesnt work on all of the prices for each elements as it only does pc the mouse and then keyboard i want them together .so the show properly in accending format

1954084
time-complexity	big-o
you can also use this data to determine the effective big-o time-complexity for each data structure

1954086
callback	methods
try using an asynccallback like rubens suggested but have the callback call into a separate methods to load the data to its destination

1954093
keyboard	mouse
assuming that only pc mouse and keyboard are children of list2 there are no other children you could write

1954098
rollback	commit
otherwise it will rollback the transactional then try to commit it

1954139
mathml	latex	mathjax	latex	mathjax	mathml
mathjax seems to have a chance at being a practical solution that offers a high quality display of latex and mathml math notation in html pages

1954159
value	field
is there anyway that i can set a default parameter value in my log4net configuration for this int32 field .so that i don t need to set it explicit to 0 if no value is supplied

1954159
value	field
and it makes me wonder why it does not happen to field which are set as varchar though no value is supplied to them

1954175
python	java
there are many ways for python and java to communication but consider a language-agnostic communication methods .so these components can be changed later if necessarily

1954175
python	java
this is just as simple as finding libs that support both java and python and trying them

1954175
python	java
and the answer to the direct question how to get python and java to play nice together

1954175
python	java
is simply use a language-agnostic communication method. the truth of the matter is that python and java are both not important to your describe problem-set

1954177
adventureworks	northwind
we have of course adventureworks northwind and pubs

1954183
order	join
you can also explicit force the order of the join

1954241
macports	fink
if you install fink or macports you can install a lot of open source programs without much trouble

1954248
python	php
seeing all the unix guys have memcached php python etc. are the .net libs stress tested and equally efficient

1954251
scala	java
the problem is that jsp or for that matter most templating languages supported by spring-mvc doesn t understand scala collections types .so i found myself converting between scala and java collectionss quite a lot

1954252
filtering	sorting
i m finding though i m repeat alot of the logic as currently i ve not found a good way to store node-sets in xslt variables and then use xpath on them for further filtering sorting

1954255
formatting	printing
i liked craig s code here because it keeps the layout of the existing worksheet and yet show what is calculated and what is not at a glance but i have reworked it a bit .so it does a better job of working out the active area of sheets and i added an unhighlightformulas subroutine .so one can easily undo the formatting before printing

1954258

for instances if your tree contains positive numbers and you return a signed int from your tree search function then a garbage value is any negative-number

1954322
32-bit	64bit
to manage a datasource that connect to a 32-bit drivers under 64bit

1954346
fwrite	fclose
fclose will fflush any unwritten output via ffflush before returning .so the error results from the underlying write won t be reported at fwrite or printf time but .when you do the fclose

1954351
static-class	nested-class
there are some difference - the nested-class has access to private-members of the outer class and extension methods have to be in a non-nested static-class for example - but it doesn t affect the lifecycle

1954371
abstract-factory	singleton
abstract-factory and builder are just some patters that use the singleton classes

1954373
arrays	loops
this loops through both the arrays and the object

1954398
fwrite	fclose
after finishing all the fwrite s which all succeed because you meticulously checked the return-value from fwrite you fclose the file

1954398
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fread	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen	fclose	fread	fopen	fread
in the above code we have been careful about fopen fwrite and fread but even then not checked fclose may result in data loss .when compiled with maylose_data defined

1954401
double-quotes	single-quotes
i m using zend-framework and it is escaping single-quotes double-quotes and backslashes

1954405
rollback	commit
as you re doing it the commit and rollback line are redundant

haskell	python
i ve already heard about resolver one which uses python but i m more interested in anything which uses a purely-functional language like haskell

1954471
updating	updates
it should be stable since constantly updating lots of index value is a costly affair - especially since the clustering key would have to updates in all non-clustered indic as well

1954473
contains	any
your page needs to be saved as utf-8 if it contains any non-ascii characters

1954473
contains	any
any serverside scripting must contains only ascii characters

1954520
controllers	routes
typically i handle things by just configuring my admin routes the way i d like them and points them at an administration controllers

1954527

an alternative approach would be to add a non-unique field to which the id would be assign

1954549
while-loop	infinite
.when i call the server class it automatically runs an infinite while-loop

1954552
tree	trie	children	tree	children	nodes

next i d read through some of the questions here tagged core-graphics quartz-2d or quartz-graphics

1954596
core-animation	quartz-core
by quartz-core you probably mean core-animation

1954609
javascript	dom
on client side you can parsing the xml in javascript using dom

1954613
json	xml
instead let the server convert your xml into json after using php s file_get_contents to read the xml to a string

1954613
json	xml
you ll find that navigating the dom of an xml is clumsy by comparison to working with native json

1954624
scala	java
i ve seen great results with ruby-on-rails too and now there s some buzz about scala too in the java world

1954657
null-terminated	c-strings
in any case make sure your c-strings are null-terminated before using functions like printf

1954665
silverlight	wpf

enumerator	any
you can t have a declaration for the high function because it works on typess that haven t even been invented yet any enumerator types

1954755
checkbox	textbox
but then i upgrade that machine from ubuntu 9.4 to 9.10 now the text of checkbox and labels does not show up but the text inside textbox and tab labels does show up

1954775
annotations	mapping
i don t really know openjpa .so there is maybe a better way to do this but one option would be to first generator the xml schema file from annotations entities using the schema tool and then the orm.xml file from the schema.xml using the reverse mapping tool

1954775
required	checked
i ve checked the openjpa maven-plugin but it doesn t seem to support the reverse mapping part it only has a openjpa schema goal that allows to create a file which contains the schema mapping xml the first required operation but nothing for the second part

1954780
children	nodes
.so if a nodes has the same named in both files a new nodes should be created with the children of both original nodess

1954783
protected	public
also be sure to use visiblity properly by assign certain methods and properties as public private protected etc

1954787
connected-components	edges
it depends what you want to do with the border if you are looking at getting just the value of the edges of the region use an algorithm called the connected-components region

1954796
contains	set
making the call to the function conditional on the current module being run as the main scripting rather than import from another module makes for potential reusability of nuggets of functionality contains in the module since other modules may import it and just call the appropriate functions or classes and even more importantly it supports solid unit-testing where all sort of mock-ups and fakes for external subsystems may generally need to be set up before the module s functionality is exercised and tested

1954805
contains	any
ments did not contains any valid contracts or service

1954807
python	c++
which is in c++ or python

1954863
json	xml
and have it return some sort of xml or json representing the directions

1954870
fortran	pascal
you should use the idioms and thought patterns appropriate to the language not try to write java or pascal or fortran with c++ syntax

1954888
swing	awt
offhand i can t recall if any of this code relies on swing i import javax.swing and the servlet is about 300 line long .so i may have thought i needed it for .something else a quick checked on google looks like this is squarely in the awt spaces

1954913
expression	evaluation
to make equality testing useful in basic cases sympy tries to rewrite mathematically equivalent expression to a canonical form .when evaluation them

1954913
difference	zero
likewise sympy fails to detection that the difference is zero

1954922
sql-server	sqlcommand
also if you call sql-server from c# i d strongly recommend you use the native .net sql provider sqlconnection sqlcommand etc. - not oledbcommand

1954927
height	frame
uipickerview is very sensitive to changes in height .so directly altering its frame or applying a transform to the uipickerview leads to rendering artifacts

1954971
aes	rsa
aes 256 bits sha-1 ephemeral diffie-hellman key exchange using rsa certificate

1954973

subtract	add
i have a numeric up down and i want it to either add or subtract one depending on if the up or down arrow is pressed

1955074
callback	methods
.so to use the callback here you would need to overrides the dogo methods to call whatever function you want

1955074
callback	methods
to use the callback methods here you will need to create a function pointers to be called by the callback object

1955079
default	reset
for what it s worth i see many frameworks using error_reporting but both options appear to be set during runtime only then reset back to their default in php-ini after scripting execution

1955091
freebsd	linux
i have done some cross-platform development before on freebsd linux which was considerably easier - and i had people in the grouping with experience that i could talk to

1955091
linux	bsd
that s kind of what we did for the linux bsd work

1955095
decrement	increment
then you compare the current value to the last value and you ll know if the value has been increment or decrement

1955109
callback	methods
may be slower than functor methods for callback that can be statically computed at compile-time

1955109
callback	methods
using functor with a non-virtual call as a callback are the highest performing methods to use a parameter to templates functions because they can be inline and even if not inline do not generator an indirect call

1955162
json	xml
along the same line as returning xml if you re returning to javascript code you may want to consider returning your complex types as serialization in json

1955175
large-files	readfile
i ve had problems in the past dumping large-files with readfile

1955188
tablelayout	framelayout
you can simplify your layout using the more advanced layout classes like framelayout and tablelayout

1955303
children	nodes
the top level needs to have a to-many relationship to the leaf nodes i called this children

1955310
tokenize	parsing
personally i would disrecommend loading a regular sql dump in this way because you would need non-trivial code to parsing or at least tokenize sql

1955317
coldfusion	railo
i am trying to setup the coldfusion server railo on tomcat6 and using apache2 to connect to tomcat via mod_jk

1955317
coldfusion	railo
im planning on having multiple virtual hosts in apache that would all ideally have all of their coldfusion pages served by railo since several of the subdomains would be rarely used admin etc .so it seems a waste to have a separate railo .app for them

1955322
difference	factors
nobody seems to know if the performance difference will be a factors of 1.1 2 10 or 100+ and this is something that matters

1955322
compression	streaming
this libs extends the h2 dbms lzf classes by adding additional compression levels more compression and compatibility with the byte streaming from the c lzf libs

1955322
buffering	streaming
one of the things i m thinking about is whether or not it s worth trying to reuse the fixed-size buffering used to compress decompression streaming

1955322
buffering	streaming
buffering may be allocated one or more time per streaming

1955330
perl	ruby
i m now reading some books of r but i want to know if i can use this language as i use perl or ruby

1955330
perl	ruby
but it s usual and simple as in perl or ruby to do things like this

1955331
httpwebrequest	webclient
downloading pages - this is done through the httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or the webclient classes

1955334

then use a callback from .post methods to hide the iframe

1955384
execute	prepare
database apis generally include a prepare cmd which can prepare to execute an sql statement

1955386
python	ruby
edit and i forgot to stress that r as a statistical language and environment is more domain-specific than either ruby or python .so the compari.sons aren t entirely appropriate

1955392
ubuntu	debian
just install on ubuntu debian via

1955401
directory	folder
create a directory named public in the folder of your django project

1955407
javascript	dom	.when	ready
can i add a custom javascript as some dom nodes attributes to perform .when it s ready like javascript added as onclientclick attributes performed .when you click on it

1955409
directory	folder
there is one more advantage predictable folder structures can help with autodiscovery of javascript base directory

1955417
associations	model
you may need to specifically describe product as a named scoping or associations in the role model and you can simplify the whole thing even more by wrapping that finder into a named scoping as well

1955419
put	get
but what i do is put common resource-files that get used by lots of pages in central location javascript is where the javascript libs go

1955441
worksheet	excel

1955644
environment	building
checked whether building environment is sane.

1955651

practically all the solid patterns apply here but particularly the single responsibility principles srp and open-closed-principles ocp

1955662
scala	java
note java scala novice here...

1955678

1955817
windows-messages	sendmessage
windows-messages sendmessage postmessage

1955825
lookup	any
it s worth points out that if you use varchar x or varchar max with base64 strings and you use the base64 string in any where clauses for lookup you should use a case-sensitive collation on the column because case is significant with base64 encode data

1955826
selected	listbox
hi the problem is that your tab controls selected event will fire .when you click on the shared listbox which brings in the instances of the list box that has focus in the other tab

1955831
order	join
if you are just doing basic selected without any kind of join where or order then you probably wont see speed improvements

1955832
lgpl	gpl
also beware of gpl and possibly lgpl code

1955832
lgpl	gpl
if you release a libs with a gpl dependency or modify an lgpl libs you will need to supply the code and allow redistribution as per the gpl

1955851
default	reset
i m guessing from your comments that the button are not rendering correctly most likely because your reset stylesheet is overrides the default list styles

1955889
contains	elements
this is done .so that the dialog scripting can be confident in its positioning to be sure that the data being dialog d isn t contains say in a relatively positioning elements

1955889
value	field
you can still get their value through accessing the individual field by id or anything like it but if you want to use a handy serialization function you re going to need to have a form within the dialog

1955895
value	field
if the user s scoretype field can change and the field points or percentage used would dependent on scoretype s value at the time the score is stored you have to add scoretype to my versioning of userscore inorder to keep the rules for interpreting that data with each recording since you can t rely on the parent recording being consistent but it does eliminate the need for a join

1955895
triggers	insert	value	field
if you have no option to change the schema you could do it with on insert updates triggers to fetch the scoretype field to verify that the resulting recording will only have a value in the proper field

1955923
getter	setter
the dependencyproperties systemd operates independently of the c# properties getter and setter which are provided as a convienience to the programmer

smalltalk	lisp
ioke is a prototype-based programming language that is inspired by io smalltalk lisp and ruby

1955964
order	join
performance will be harder to tune because you are not allowing the sql optimizer to work its magic - look at row count join order etc

1955972
expression	brackets
the regex highlight any combinations indicated by the brackets expression

1956007
vb.net	vb6
i have to upgrade a legacy vb6 .app to vb.net

protected	public
however if i change the access modifiers on that properties from protected internal to public it gets populate fine which tells me that it s not any obvious problem with the mapping itself

1956015
javascript	dom
the only other option would be to add a javascript function that overrides the styles of the object after dom ready or windows ready event

1956030
contains	elements
the key idea is to split the contents of each text nodes within a paragraph on the . character turn each fragment into a new text nodes and then assemble the new text nodess with the span elements contains the degree symbols between them

1956034
.when	ready
fire .when ready

1956037
managed-code	unmanaged
trying to pass addresses of something in managed-code .net to an unmanaged might not be the best plan

you use this methods if you want an alert with button to popup and .when the user click on one of the button have the class that invoked the alert do something possibly different things depending on which button was click

1956064
webserver	upload
from your description it sounds like you also want users to shared document created with the .app which would required your .app to be able to upload .apps to the webserver

1956074
scp	ssh
a generics way ssh and scp

1956078
delphi	basic
for keyword the list at delphi basic

1956079
ftps	ftp
2 uses ftp and not ftps

1956082
contains	any
however since any patch to improve performance for multibyte encoding must at least contains some if-statement somewhere it is actually impossible to write a patch that does not at least slow down fixed-width encoding by at least the overhead of that if-statement

1956082
debian	osx	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	osx
since this patch is already from 2005 i assume that it is also used in centos. this patch is also used in mac osx debian ubuntu ... pretty much nobody uses grep as distribute by gnu

1956088
.when	ready
since git push does not merge you could have each developer push to a branch on the central repository and then .when you re ready log on to the machine that hosts the central repo and merge them with

1956089
input-field	selected
on your fla s libs right-click on them and click on properties and selected export for actionscript on the class input-field enter rowa for this example and rowb respectively

1956091
associations	model
do you have an associations setup between the two model

1956095
constructor	object
there are other examples of roles functions can play a constructor is called .when constructing an object a callback is a function passed as a parameter to another function to call and .so on

1956096
swfupload	uploadify
if you really need to customize the look-and-feel of your field try a flash based uploader like swfupload or uploadify

1956117
hide	show
this way you can pass arguments to your program or batch-file and decide to show or hide the execution console

1956123
file-descriptor	pipe
this means that a pipe like any other open file-descriptor is closed normally

1956123
signals	sigpipe
one interesting thing about pipe though in pthreads if a process writes to a pipe that has been closed the writer will get a signals sigpipe

1956134
json	xml
you can get fancy by using a standards format like json yaml or xml within each .post file and even fancier by requesting these with ajax call in mostly client side code

1956142
stderr	stdout
also preferably i don t want to create a subprocess and read its stdout and stderr in separate thread

1956147
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	synchronous	nsoperation
synchronous nsurlconnection work great inside of an nsoperation - and because you are using them synchronous an nsoperationqueue handed the nsoperation will automatically use a background-thread to run them you have to do extra work otherwise

1956150
hash	md5
obviously this may cause collision but the small numbers of machines 100 means this is unlikely and using the truncated output of a cryptography hash say md5 makes this even less .so

1956153
carbon	cocoa
are you using the eclipse swt carbon or the eclipse swt cocoa

1956153
carbon	cocoa
switching to the eclipse swt cocoa from eclipse swt carbon helped

1956156
switching	screens
i m trying to play two videos using the mpmovieplayercontroller class and allow the user to switching between the two videos by swiping their finger across the screens

1956156
player	movie
i m not sure what s happening but the overlay view does not actually seem to be on top of the movie player and is certainly not responding to touch-events

1956172
value	field
if then i would create a database to contains those value i would rather use 3 field and use two different field-for quarter and year

1956173
arrays	loops
.so i should expect allocation to run about as fast as system.arrayscopy or a fully jited arrays initialization loops about 1gb s on my last bench but i m dubious of the result

1956175
nscharacterset	nsarray
- nsarray componentsseparatedbycharactersinset nscharacterset separator

1956188
grouping	sorting
i d like to do all join grouping sorting and advanced data-manipulation using linq

1956248
python	ruby
just substitute python everytime he says ruby and everything will be just as valid.

1956256
attributes	properties
using properties is the best way to provide a methods of control and security to the attributes in a class always keep the attributes private if possible

1956261
spring	grails
that s where the usual spring grails idiom would have such logic

1956265
contains	any
here is the main answer with code please note that you can get any numbers of dates time accuracy seconds minutes or seconds minutes and days anywhere up to years which would contains 6 parts segments

1956272
arrays	loops
if you have a really large arrays that you are loopsing thorough you can use the following loops syntax to make it slightly faster be careful though as imo it makes it much harder read

1956276
contains	set
in the code-behind where you set the context simply use an anonymous types contains all the desired value

1956284
compression	streaming
there is streaming oriented xml shredding there are xml compression formats for delivery protocols that deal with fragmentation and fairness and there are many a storage systemd that can hold terabytes upon terabytes of data

1956323
signals	sigint
with sigint it depends on whether the process handles the signals

1956323
buffering	streaming
if .so then yes any material in the buffering will be fflush as the standards i o streaming is closed

1956323
buffering	streaming
after you mentioned popen i looked it up and the manpage says its return-value identical to an i o streaming and the streaminging are fully buffering by default

1956323
buffering	streaming
with the file streaming if there is data in the i o buffering then a close or equivalent will ensure that the outstanding data is fflush and the file-descriptor is closed

1956330
design-time	designer
but at design-time in blend this is marked as invalid xaml---and in visual-studio design-time the load cancelled screens show but loads properly after click resume loading the designer

1956342
queue	fifo
given only fifo support for a given single queue you will of course have to introduce either multiple queue an intermediary or have a more complex consumer

1956346
duplicates	contains	contains	set
to detection duplicates across the whole table i guess you got to have some kind of map or set contains all the cell s data

1956349

in safari and firefox looks fine but in internet-explorer 6 and 7 looks too tall

1956356
javascript	dom
is all of the javascript and dom guaranteed to be downloading interpreter and ready by the time this delegation methods is called

1956363
user-controls	tabcontrol
in this case if you only want access to a specific control on the user-controls s parent form like a tabcontrol you might consider that you want to make the properties you set of types tabcontrol rather than form the same coding technique show above can be used in the user-controls

1956369
show	next
lets say i want show an advert next to some primary content on a webpage that is hosted on my origin server

1956369
specifications	w3c
are there any books website published model that summarise all the w3c specifications best practice seo termininology and wrap it all up into nice n handy a published object-model that can be a truly ubiquitous language for web-.applications that i can adopt for my web .app

1956377
for-loop	loops
unless you need to access its value after the for-loop ends leave the variables inside loops it will be closer to the code that uses it your code will be more readable and its scoping will be bounded by loops itself your code will be more elegant and less bug-prone

1956379
arrays	loops
i just want to move the beginning address of my buffering arrays into the esi register loops it howmany time while copying each elements to the al register

1956384
developer-tools	console.log
i tried the developer-tools and console.log their firebug equivalent

1956387
constructor	object
a notable exception-handling is c++ which does extra work because it needs to call constructor and destructor .when the stack-allocated object is created or destroyed.

1956398
arguments	default
if you put the -classpath option after the classname it will be treated as application arguments and you ll execute your application using the default classpath

1956404
double-quotes	single-quotes
let s say that you have 10 000 places where you used double-quotes instead of single-quotes at a 25âµs difference per page load who knows if it actually will work out that way you need to benchmarking your actual code that would be a would be a 0.25 second difference in execution-time

1956407
stderr	stdout
i would like to log the output of both stdout and stderr from a python scripting

1956407
stderr	stdout
also it is possible to get stdout and stderr like this

1956421
any	set
i am trying to save a photo taken from my .app to camera roll this can be done by using uiimagewritetosavedphotosalbum however i noticed there isn t any way to set the photo named by using this .approach am i right

1956424
perl	ruby
i know ruby 1.9 and perl coro both have support what else

1956433
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if python ruby and perl are all unsuitable for your purposes despite all meeting your stated requirements you presumably have other unstated requirements or preferences -- care to spell them out

1956434
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
primitive value such as int boolean chars floats and double allow the actual value in memory to be changed

1956439
unique	words
the named will be more readable and easier to debugging but namedd are not guaranteed to be unique .so it will need to be augmented by a uniqifier i believe this is actually a words used in unification to append digits to the end of the named

1956447
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double
the same is true for all primitive-types boolean byte char short int long float and double

1956454
conditional	operators
the last part of the where-clause building on the unsimplified snippet above by adding an extra or conditional to handle doing the extra compares against the new join following the pattern made by the and operators

1956494
click	mouse
it is an object that holds all the associated properties of the mouse click

2 - i couldn t grasp what exactly the put and get functions do

1956525
jquery	.post
i have a jquery ajax request in my website page and every page i need to .post this request to server to get the status

1956547
web-deployment	web
specifically i think the shared-configuration and web-deployment tools for web farm is exactly what i need

1956596
json	xml
using a standards format like xml or json will be the best way to make sure the data is accessible in various languages since those languages will already have a way to read the format

1956621
network-drive	intranet
if you call native-code then you can t be run from a network-drive or intranet site at least not without additional configuration because these sources are by default less trusted than the local machine

1956631
order	add
see above add order by curr.weight - prev.weight desc and limit n

1956631
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has explain analyze dunno about mysql you ll probably find you need to index columns that participate in where and join not the ones that form the result set

1956635
.when	ready
.when you selected as long as set session has already been issued the date-time wrapped in date_format it will be in the user s timezone formatted and ready to display to the user

1956663
carbon	cocoa
carbon is just the old graphical api it was replace by cocoa

1956706
subtract	time
it means you d store the users initial weight in say the user table and .when you write recording to the foodbar table a user could supply the weight at that time but the query would subtract the initial weight from the current weight

1956714
autodesk	maya
the .ma .mb format is not intended to be read by any program other than maya itself .so autodesk does not put any effort into making this an easy process

1956714
maya	mel
all of the maya-based pipelines i ve seen either first export content into a standardized file-format or run mel scripting within maya to dump content using the mel nodes interfaces

1956714
maya	mel
note than maya can be run in a headless mode where it loads a scene execute a mel scripting and exists without loading the gui

1956723
worksheet	excel
if it s a hyperlink on your website and you can choose what worksheet you want to use simply open that particular sheet save then close excel

the definition of an autoincrement field is that every new row insert is guaranteed to get a unique value

1956741
nsdata	nsurl
nsdata imgdata nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl urlwithstring

1956747
python	java	python	c++
i m decently experienced with python and java but i recently decided to learn c++

1956749
display	height	display	width
you can t use fadeout because it sets the div styles to display none and thus the div has a zero height and width making the scrollto plugins mess up pretty bad

1956760
javascript	dom
this way you don t have the overhead of the javascript restructuring existing data in the dom its just positioning it from scratch

1956764
qaction	qmenu
the code for insert the enum seperator to the qmenu is easy and i have that working but i thought this code would work for insert a qaction to a qmenu

1956784
keyboard	mouse
you can do application wide keyboard and mouse handling but you have very few options if your application is not the foreground application

1956809

write code in vb6 to do what you need call it from c# vb.net

1957012
required	checked
and all the pages are in total css mess which we need to clean up unfortunately.for this i required a tool which works similar to firebug for mozilla.also to checked headers cookies caching and postdata compression redirection chunked-encoding a similar tool to http watch is also desired

1957014
twitter	tweets
twitter indicates .when new tweets are available for a given user or for a search

1957024
data-access	nhibernate
at the end of the day i would simply make sure that i choose an orm that will work for me can t really go wrong with something like nhibernate and make sure your code is loosely coupled which should ensure that your data-access code is isolated

1957030
firefox	safari
i have tried using javascript to save the hash value in cookies but that isnt working with firefox and its too slow in safari the html will show first .so one has to refresh the page a second time for the correct content to be show

1957036
arrays	loops
basically i have my css made and i m using jquery for some effects but i d like to do something like a for each loops to display all the data in my post arrays seperated into their own little sections

otherwise if the arguments does not match a pointers earlier returned by the calloc malloc realloc or valloc function or if the spaces is deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

1957118
versioning	upgrade
3- then i building a new versioning of this program and upgrade it

1957119
malloc	free
of course other implementation of malloc free can choose other way to achieve this

1957119
malloc	free
but they generally don t support to free on a different pointers than what was returned by malloc or equivalent function

1957173
any	set
these are variables that are set by the server and can be access in any context

1957173
contains	any
generally most people just checked if there is any data contains in to tell if a form has been sent through but this methods works as well

1957176
contains	elements
the workaround for this bug in a general case i am told is to include positioning relative in the contains elements

1957176
contains	elements
but that is not possible since my contains elements needs a positioning absolute in ie to make the fixed elements work

1957190
apache-fop	batik
make sure the fonts you want to use are install in your operating systemd .so batik has access to them via awt java-2d and configure for apache-fop easiest way

1957192
arrays	loops
loops on i 0 to n-1 where n length of arrays

1957193
put	get
how do i put a downloading button on a site to get a csv of a table query

hibernate can use optimistic-locking as well as pessimistic-locking to prevent that from happening

1957223
cursor	row
what happening is whenever i move cursor one cell to another cell on the same row it fires

1957245
mouseleave	mouseover
like .when you want to hide a mouseover menu not exactly at the time .when a mouseleave it but a few milliseconds later

1957245
hide	show
for example you have a function that show and hide a menu

1957251
instances	self
why there is also no super instances with typical usage super self .__init__

1957254
arguments	default
after removing the newline from the .ini file none of your arguments will be recognized and the launchd resorts to default

1957267
implements	super
i think super was implements to be explicit redundant just to be on the safe side and keep the logic involved as simple as possible no sugar or deep logic to find the parent

1957271
mouseover	mouseout
using console.log or some other logging methods you should be able to determine if the mouseout is firing before the mouseover is finished adding content or if there is another problem

1957277
worksheet	excel
excel 2003 does not allow the worksheet to be passwd protected but 2007 may have some encryption magic that gets round this

1957286
subtract	add
by changing the textures combiner state you can add subtract interpolation or take dot product of your textures samples instead

1957301
jquery	.post
if you re not using jquery try removing the filtering attributes from the elements that are display non-cleartype d text and it should work according to that blog .post

1957311
integration-testing	system-testing
component testing like integration-testing or system-testing but on an even smaller scale

1957312
any	set
is there any way to set these numbers in a func at runtime

1957314
getter	setter
getter and setter are created manually

1957314
getter	setter
the getter setter then just access that arrays with the appropriate key

1957338
remote-desktop	rdp
you are somewhat ambiguous with your terminology - do you want a client .app that runs on the user s machine or do you want an .app that runs on the server and the user connect via remote-desktop rdp

1957338
silverlight	wpf
with a client .app you have several options .so consider them carefully - do you want silverlight wpf or a native winforms .app

1957338
silverlight	wpf
personally i would never again use asp.net-ajax etc for a web types application it would be wpf or silverlight all the way i would only use asp.net for simple web sites

1957338
silverlight	wpf	silverlight	xbap
deploying the .app need not be difficult - silverlight or wpf xbap are delivered via the web the user has to do nothing except for the simple install of the silverlight plugins or installing the right .net for wpf - checked this link

1957363
.net	wcf
microsoft has also combined the connect systemd in .net 3.5 they now call it wcf asmx remoting etc...

1957419
lookup	any
i don t think you ll do any better on disk spaces and lookup time are o log n

1957423
lookup	any
i don t suppose it ll get any smaller but you should get very good lookup performance and it s very easy to implements

1957429
compare-and-swap	atomicity
in nutshell spinlock employs atomicity compare-and-swap cas or test-and-set like instructions to implements lock-free wait free thread safe idiom

1957437

home .vim for linux unix

1957543
google-chrome	safari
works in ie8 ff3 but not ie7 or google-chrome webkit .so probably safari too

1957571
google-chrome	firefox
per.sonally i don t like web-applications that required a lot of user integration there are .some of them that is a pleasure to use but i think it is very easy to do it the wrong way and end up having a buggy or not .so responsive application probably because of the incompatibilities in browsers i have ie firefox and google-chrome install on my computer and i use one for .some website because they run faster on it and others for other sites because webpage show up correctly only on them

1957575
bug-tracking	workitem
we re trailing the use of the built-in bug-tracking and have written some integration into our helpdesk software that allows for escalation via workitem

1957583
background-image	width
the second technique is to have a separate ab.solutely positioning div to show the header background-image and put it under an elements with the browser windows s size and set its width to 100 .so that it never exceeds the size of the browser windows and hence create scrollbar

1957587
rollback	commit
depending on your application you could open a separate windows where user does the modification and then confirm cancels .so you can do your commit rollback

1957590
contains	any
or any other source that navigates to some content contains some markup

1957601
instances	destroy
.when an instances of this class is destroy the dealloc methods will be invoked which will in turn release both strings

1957603
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are part of what s called a class cluster - .when you create or modify a string it may or may not be an instances of the class you re expecting

1957610
contains	set
the arguments would be a context object and attributeset contains attributes you set in the xml

1957613
annotations	mapping
you can list the xml mapping files using but if you re using jpa annotations like entity then this is unnecessary hibernate will auto-detect them

1957613
annotations	mapping
you can mix annotations and mapping xml if you choose but that s by no means necessary in most situations

1957626
mathml	latex
i am developing an application for undergrads and i was looking for something less complex than latex and easier to write than mathml

1957642
mstest	nunit
as much as the console runner is nice i enjoy the instant red green view of a graphical runner such as nunit or mstest for quickly glancing at broken tests

1957644
binaries	install
the install itself isn t required to do anything special just dump some binaries and shared-libraries and sometime execute an external process

1957647
printf	scanf
i can only use if-else while simple math operators and printf getchar scanf - no functions arrays or pointers

1957654
markup	mathml
it converts the markup to mathml but seems to be easier on the brain.

1957655
display	outline
webkit honours the tr outline if you give the tr display block .so the following works

1957656
protected	public
use exception-handling .when checked parameters passed to public or protected methods and constructor

1957671
arrays	loops
i m thinking that it would help with things like off by one errors in arrays indexing too for example inside a loops -

1957680
contains	set	background-image	width
set the min-width on the div contains the background-image to the width of the content

1957686
temporary	copy
if the parameter was not a const reference then you could alter the data in the methods not realising that your reference was to a temporary copy of the data and .so it s prohibited

1957688
digits	base
then you take the original value + base and start dividing again till you come to the second highest value digits

1957717
getter	setter
this is an over-simplified example as the properties simply wrap the private field by returning it in the getter and setting it in the setter

1957717
value	field
if program flow required something happen every time the value of a field is set say an event is fired it can be fired from the setter of the properties

1957720
getter	setter
a properties can have a setter or a getter or both and you can also specify different accessibility level for each

1957721
assign	add
yes the code in the second line you are making available directly the member in memory whereas in the first line you have one level of indirection where you can add some logic in the future to validation and lazy-evaluation assign

1957721
getter	setter
also if you use a reflection you would have to lookup for properties setter and getter for the first example line and for the second you would need to directly retrieve a member variables

1957724
getter	setter
the main difference is that if you later need to add logic into your getter or setter and other dlls have already been compiled against yours you can easily change

1957741
hide	show
you can hide some portions using css if you don t want and show the others

1957786
mathml	tex
if you want typesetting then use either tex or presentational mathml as they have well-developed toolkits

1957786
markup	mathml
one of the main grouping involved with math markup is the mathematical knowledge management community mkm and their choice is mathml

1957814
external	embed
probably what you need it s not compile the code which it s not possible but to embed an interpreter in the right architecture with the code to allow running the code without an external installation of the interpreter

1957820
superclass	inherited
in the class hierarchy c inherited b inherited a in c.__init__ you want to call superclass init from c s perspective and you call b.__init__

1957825
value	field
this will allow you to assign a value to the symbols either in the field initializer or the static non-static constructor

1957826
digits	base
the second starts from here or rather one power before and works back to base 0 1 to compute the output digits most significant first

1957838
conditional	operators
in conditional expression unless you use the types matching operators or

1957840
python	java
finally if you are developing in java python or a few other languages youtube already provides some implementation for the parsing and requesting here

1957862

.so if two line would occupy the same half of a pixels the antialiasing blend it to 75 filled rather than 50 filled

1957901
pixels	line
with enough line draw on top of each other the pixels blend clamps and you end up with alias line

1957903

1957986
value	field
you shouldn t be attempting to insert a value into an auto increment field - as the hint is in the named this will be automatically increment by mysql

it is specific to firefox or rather the gecko rendering engine

1958951
any	set
if i set margins to any numbers greater then 0 it just adds it to initial margins of 42pt

1958967
contains	any
to make sure it doesn t contains any html that would break your markup

1958968
configuration	environment
i m not certain that this is the best solution to your problem but one way of doing this would be to declare in the configuration file a variables to indicate what environment this is running in dev or prod

1958978
revision	updates	contains	set
the log could contains a revision column to tracking in what order changes were made a types column to specify if it was a insert updates or or delete a the row-id if your affected row and finally have the entire set of columns from your master table

1958994
enumerator	any
at the time there was no way to add this as an extension to any enumerator - it would have to be part of the interface which i agree doesn t necessarily fit since enumerators can be infinite long and this would be bad

1958997
protected	public
this way only the integrity of the public key needs to be protected

1959011
typename	typedef
the key is the typename part of the typedef

1959031
value	field
enter value in each of the field and click on the capacity charts button

1959031
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
also this currently works best in ie google-chrome and safari - there is an issue with firefox that i am working out separately

1959034
click	mouse
but if you really wanted to you could just put a blanket click listener on the stage recording the positioning of the mouse and the time that it was click and any other state that would be necessary

1959049
administration	account
you need to login using sa account systemd administration which should have all permissions

1959052

it has scripting for sql-server oracle mysql sql-server compact

1959053
32-bit	64bit
if you are looking for 32-bit vs 64bit you can checked the size of an intptr it will be either 32-bit or 64bit as per the documentation

1959058
32-bit	64bit
as you mentioned using shgetknownfolderpath from a 32-bit application will not work on a 64bit operating systemd

1959059
authentication	login
i think they re using cookiess to pass authentication .so first you ll need your .app to login to facebook and keep the cookies in a cookiescontainer then assign that to req.cookiescontainer and only then req.getresponse

1959068
irrlicht	ogre
see some examples using ogre and irrlicht here

1959078
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onload
don t use javascript to change the content onload rather do it only during user-controlled events onclientclick onchange onfocus etc

1959081
fadein	show
if you are also affected you might try using show instead of fadein

1959089
put	get
you can get round this by either using badd and then bufdo as above or by doing something like this put it in your vimrc

1959095
persistent	transient
if that is the case would the domain-object for the metadata contains a reference to the raw byte object that is marked as transient .so jpa won t attempt to persistent it

1959118
value	field
yes you can do it within excel and the description field can remain as dry white etc as you do not need to split the comma separated value

1959118
value	field
field description value and year bought

1959127
implements	abstract
strategya does not implements inherited abstract member void dosomething baseobject

1959134
strategy-pattern	visitor-pattern
it sounds like you re actually trying to reinvent the visitor-pattern instead of just using the strategy-pattern the way it was intended

1959144
scrollable	panels
the panels has a few textfield and a scrollable panels below in a verticalpanels

1959144

google-chrome	firefox
this is an html5 api and it ll work on webkit-derivatives google-chrome and firefox 3.5 for now

1959165
groovy	java
is groovy a superset of java yet

1959165
groovy	java
if not what are the incompatibilities between groovy and java

1959165
groovy	java
by superset i mean source backward compatibility in the sense that you can take a java file and compile it as groovy source file and it would work just as before

1959165
groovy	java
it has been the goal of groovy to make very similar to java to minimize the learning curve

1959168
associations	model
i ve set up the individual model in cakephp and the associations some of which are as follows

1959175
stateful-session-bean	ejb
question 1 as per the book i follow to learn ejb author told that every lookup creates a new stateful-session-bean

1959176
any	set
now all the static resources should resolve correctly there is no need to invoke any binding or set any datacontext inorder to get this to work

1959192
ip-address	hostname
then for any hostname checked if it resolves to one of the ips in iphostentry.addresslist this is an ip-address

1959194
ip-address	hostname
you can get the ip-address that the hostname resolves to by writing

1959197
decrement	increment
then .when you call npn_retainobject it increment the refcount and npn_releaseobject will decrement it

1959199
administration	account
but what i can say is that you can impersonate any user successfully only if the account the application is running is an administration

1959216
linked-list	arrays
for most data types optimal sorting algorhitm is o n log n but keep in mind that some structures are still slower for instances sorting linked-list is slower than arrays athough both have n log n complexity

1959221
order	add
add an order by conditional into the subquery to defined the order

1959241
double	int
.when you use f make sure that the arguments is a float or double not an int

1959253
groovy	java
is groovy a superset of source compatible with java yet

1959253
groovy	java
if not what are the incompatibilities between java and groovy now

1959253
groovy	java
groovy extends java and there are difference between groovy and java a groovy file can not be compiled by the java compiler

1959253
groovy	java
the page difference from java list all the major difference between java and groovy

1959253
groovy	java
that said the groovy compiler can converts a groovy file into a .class-file that can be run using the java interpreter this required groovy-all-version.jar to be on the classpath

1959260
javascript	dom
similarly if you need to return an arrays to javascript another option other than writing a methods to emulate an object as i suggested in the thread that jldupont linked to is to use npn_getvalue to get the npobject for the dom windows and then invoke arrays on it with no parameters

1959279
constructor	object
you could create a parsing object using the new-operator but without passing arguments and then use apply to re-run the constructor function

1959282
revision	svnadmin
for instances you can create a repository commit a few revision and then svnadmin load more revision into it

xsd	xml
in c# how can i get a list of all xsd schema referenced in an xml file including those referenced via xsi nonamespaceschemalocation

1959302
ftp	ssh
phing and capistrano should be able to deploy to a server via ssh capistrano or ftp phing

1959319
subclassing	inherited
2 does a subclassing of class a which implements interface i inherited the conformance to that interface or should it also declare itself as implements i

1959321
joomla	drupal
the best way for your users would be to write an installation routine of your own and bundle it with the application similarly to drupal joomla etc

1959321
linux	osx
the quickest way would probably to write an installation shell scripting for linux osx and a batch-file scripting for windows

1959327
callback	methods
if you take the code from that page where the nsurlconnection is initializer and make the connection an ivar instead of just creating it as a local variables you can then compare connection object in each of the callback methods and respond accordingly

1959333
click	mouse
i can get back to the parent .app dilaog box but the problem is that even if i click on it with the mouse it remains hidden behind the child windows

1959334
environment	building
i m automating the process of building development-vms for a project and having a really hard time getting sun-java-6 to install in a non-interactive environment because it really wants to ask about licenses

1959336
firefox	opera
i don t need markup for ie firefox opera etc

1959348
put	get
this is a c# example. in this properties get all that customer s order put them in list object maintain it in a private variables in case the properties is called again and return that list object

1959348
order	add
then create an order class that inherited from to replace your basic and add the properties firstorder

1959353
implements	extends
one could extends button and implements this interface to get a simple button rendering

the css you list is the clearfix methods to force a containsers to have a height big enough to contains a floated child elements

1959372
dbd	dbi
dbi talks to the appropriate dbd module for your database

1959387
value	field
in a test iphone .app i am developing i am trying to set the value of a float field in my core datamodel

1959388
instances	self	subclassing	inherited
your subclassing of str does not overrides format .so .when you call format on one of its instances it just uses the one inherited from str which uses self s intrinsics value as str the string form of whatever you passed to offset

1959401
base-class	inherited
the wrapper class can use reflection to call the fill methods since if i m not mistaken the table adaptor don t implements a common interface or inherited from a common base-class

1959417
configuration	installation
once you points the wizard at your database it will recognize the tfs_configuration database from the previous installation and restore your previous configuration as well as your collections

1959428
dependency-injection	inject
you can then use dependency-injection to inject a concrete versioning of the interface depending on whether you re running in console gui or as a service

1959437
android-emulator	adb
you can find the ports for running android-emulator with the adb devices cmd

1959437

i want a regex pattern to checked that the string doesn t contains any digits

1959467
contains	any
i m coding a hospital systemd and i want from user to enter the named of the patient of course the named shouldn t contains any digits how can i do this by regex

1959493
msbuild-task	msbuild
.when running msbuild anything passed in on the command-line using is accessible from every msbuild scripting invoked via the msbuild-task from the main scripting

1959495
getter	setter
this object may be composed of getter and setter but it is a model of a student and would thus be extremely useful in a database systemd

1959495
entity-relationship	diagram
to further understand this i recommend reading on entity-relationship diagram

1959499
compatibility	platform
if you are going to be calling it from c code or are interested in cross platform compatibility write it in c

1959517
stateless	stateful
webserver are stateless web-application are stateful -- this leads to dependance on a data-layer to persistent state

1959517
web-applications	scalability
nosql databases provide plug play expansion and required programming changes from the web-applications therefore you will learn a lot about scalability from the material

1959523
contains	any
i have a heterogeneous list that can contains any arbitrary types of object

1959524
javascript	dom
i m wondering what the ease of these libs is doing to actual knowledge of javascript and the dom

1959525
wamp	php
i have install php using wamp server in windows and i have give the entry for xdebug in php-ini and debugging not working in netbeans

1959531
triggers	insert
if it does then you would add an insert updates delete triggers on the first table that updatess or insert or deletes as necessary the second table s countnicknames attributes every time a recording is insert updatess or deleted from the first table.

1959543
value	field
this is unlikely to be useful on your real data but it gives the idea that you would need to take a separate field make some subset of that data be equivalent for the purpose of sorting in this case everything with the same 10s value and the have a secondary sort on client_id

1959552
gtk	x11
in my opinion jquery is to dom as the .net is to the win32 api or gtk is to x11 programming

1959552
javascript	dom
it s also important to recognize the difference between javascript and the dom

1959552
javascript	dom
the dom is not part of the javascript language

1959552
javascript	dom
.so while using jquery might hinder one s knowledge of the dom it won t hurt their knowledge of the javascript language itself

1959562
return-value	arguments
it does not hold true with the arguments passed into your invoke function but the return-value you set will get release by the browser .when it s done

1959566
perl	c++
here is ports for the lucene search-engine in perl which will give you access to the c++ api

1959572
show	next
it s not compilable but it show where the code stepped through i checked with next and step cmd in the debugger that the code indeed follows this route

1959574
build-system	cmake	build-system	cpack
for c++ project i d go with cmake cpack if you are also willing to change your build-system

1959581
.when	ready
my first question is let s say i have one thread who keeps all the files handles and waitformultipleobjects on them .so it will know .when one of them is ready to be read from disk

1959606
text-editor	editor
.when i click on it now says the associated editor are the php editor and the text-editor

1959611
wordpress	blogs
specifically i run several wordpress blogs on a vps and would like to find .some tools to help me find issues worth looking into .so i can address them

1959643
nskeyedarchiver	nsarray
the quick and dirty way is to use an nskeyedarchiver to write the nsarray out to a file

1959670
pointers	stack
this sounds like s is a pointers to an arrays that was on stack which is overwrite as soon as a new function is called ie strcmp

1959681
python	php
in my demo i load the j.son object from a php file .so i m sure that you can do the same with python

1959688
kdevelop	anjuta
other solution is used ide like netbeans eclipse anjuta kdevelop .

1959692
subclassing	superclass
does each subclassing really represent a different concept than the superclass

1959702
dictionary	arrays
any time automapper finds the foo foodto pair whether it s in an arrays of value dictionary collections child member or whatever that foo foodto configuration will be used

1959714
callback	methods
the callback methods that sets the autocomplete piece up is only execute after the getjson call is completed

1959715
binary	hex
how to printing int literals in binary or hex in haskell

1959721
kdevelop	kde
the kde ide kdevelop has an experience similar to visual-studio if that s what you re looking for

1959736
groovy	java	expression	evaluation
in fact i don t know of any solution in java to do evaluation of arbitrary arithmetic-expressions - you could try groovy instead or parsing the expression yourself

1959746
primitive	int
if you need numbers that .when evaluated would overflow some primitive like an int you can create two bigint and then evaluate the result

1959754
modifiers	final
also regarding code like this will compile given a final modifiers on x

1959777
nested	order
and i have a warning .when compiling barrier region may not be closely nested inside of work-sharing critical order master or explicit task region

1959786
contains	set
to address this i maintain a libs and set of tools that generator assemblies contains these types for you

1959787
callback	methods
is it possible to get the serialization list of items from a ul in jquery by calling the serialization methods directly instead of using a callback

1959795
innodb	myisam
your server tuning will now necessarily be a compromise - you cannot use all the memory for either myisam or innodb nb this does not apply if they are on different servers

1959795
innodb	myisam
then you can pretty much forget about myisam and not devote resources to it and get the full benefits of using innodb

1959795
innodb	myisam
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959816
joystick	keyboard	joystick	hid	keyboard	hid
also there s a usb hid pos point-of-sale mode that some higher-end usb scanners support that gives you an even greater degree of flexibility with the added bonus of drivers free installation it looks like a generics hid device to the systemd like a joystick or keyboard but with 2-way comm ability

1959819
vbscript	perl
here are examples of how to directly edit the odbc registry settings with vbscript powershell or perl

1959828
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	synchronous	nsoperation
an approach i like to use is synchronous nsurlconnection call inside of an nsoperation which in turn is managed by an nsoperationqueue

1959832
contains	any
if you want to compile the code on-the-fly you create a compiler object tell it what assemblies to reference systemd and the one that contains imodule plus any other references needed tell it to compile the source file into an assembly

1959841
memset	calloc
i realize that the gdb output makes no sense because you do verify it s a null-terminated strings but i ve had a lot of string.h bizarre problems go away with a memset bzero calloc or whatever you want to use

1959842
switching	screens
.when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to lookup the function directly

1959842
switching	screens
.when each state handler becomes longer than a couple of screens split each event out in a separate function similar to the way that the state switching was split

1959842
switching	screens
i have used state event tables in the past but i have to say that for the simplest cases i do not find them necessary and i prefer the clarity and reliability of the switching statement even if it does extends past one screens full

1959853
binary-tree	tree
for an order besides alphabetic i would use a binary-tree std map in c++ is implements with a red-black tree usually

1959866
gentoo	linux	binaries	install
an example of a stable and successful linux distribution would be gentoo where all binaries are compiled on the server before install no binaries exist in the distribution

1959866
binaries	install
building binaries on the server is a good idea as it makes sure your binaries are optimized at some level for the hosts platform provided the install provides the correct flags to the compiler

1959873
numeric	zero
nb adding zero to now makes it return a numeric value instead of a string value

1959901
checkbox	textarea	checkbox	button
.when building medium to large scale javascript applications i find it convenient to move all control creation initializer into a single class were each methods is a factory for that control combo box textarea button tooltip checkbox etc

1959911
verilog	vhdl	verilog	rtl	vhdl	rtl
the high-level model can then be used as a golden reference to verifiy the register transfer level rtl description which is typically coded in vhdl or verilog

1959919
perl	php
historically web apps were the ones with code and or scripting in perl cgi php asp etc. on the server and sites were the ones with static pages

1959930
lambda-calculus	coq
i m not sure why you separate coq from dependently typed programming coq essentially is programming in a polymorphism dependently typed lambda-calculus with inductive types cic the calculus of inductive constructions

1959933
postgresql	mysql
allows you to connect to different kinds of databases mysql postgresql using a consistent api

1959949
google-chrome	firefox
if you get frustrated because something works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie this will happen a lot don t give up

1959950
interpreter	runtime
assumption assignment is more expensive in python than a conditional jump which makes sense since its interpreter and it has to read a runtime hash to get the new value then upload it in the same hash

1959968
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
for me i develop in firefox then make sure that things are solid on google-chrome safari

1959968
margins	padding
.when you can opt for using a little sub-container elements with a margins in-place of padding

1959980

export your data to csv and import into excel or set up an odbc datasource in excel and run the queries directly

1959985
firefox	opera
various versioning of firefox opera and

1960012
perl	ruby
ruby is a recent programming language that shared most of its heritage with perl and smalltalk

1960012
ruby	php
just like you can use php to write webpage you can do the same thing with ruby

1960013
ruby	php
if you re looking for something to compare it to for someone coming from php think of it like cakephp for ruby

1960013
ruby	php
it uses ruby and an html templating language based on ruby erb rather than php

1960020
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
ruby an elegant object-oriented programming language with object like smalltalk and syntax something like python and perl

1960020
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
that is ruby takes features from advanced real languages and combines them with the interpreter efficient syntax and library-rich practicality of perl python and php

1960026
scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java
is it possible to replace any java coding which i use daily with groovy or scala

1960032
32-bit	64bit
i ve got a nasty feeling this is something to do with using 32-bit python and or 64bit mercurial but i m new to macs and i don t fully understand the background

1960047
scala	java
i ve completely replace my server side process data crunching that would previously be written in java with scala

1960047
json	xml
scala s xml handling combined with a simple json outputter i use twitter s makes this completely painless

1960047
scala	java
just start writing scala as if you were writing java at it s worst it s just java but much less verbose

1960053
dictionary	arrays
one with a dictionary of the alphabet in 26 arrayss within each arrays is a series of technical terms

1960053
dictionary	arrays
then i ve created another plist of definitions as an arrays of dictionary one for each words definition pair

1960075
ubuntu	linux
i am currently testing on linux using ubuntu 9.10

1960100
arrays	loops
try the following which works using a sort of iterator idea rather than an arrays loops

1960101
put	get
the main thing i think is to get the normals product s application code out of the test and put in some test code instead

1960112
defined	declare
answer c won t compile methods isn t defined in the declare class

1960112
defined	declare
answer e isn t polymorphism methods is defined in the declare class

1960112
implements	abstract
all remaining answers uses a methods which are either implements from an abstract definition or overrides or subclassing of which all are polymorphism behavior

1960137
base-class	inherited
however i recently needed a custom idgenerator which i based off the same base-class in nhibernate that hilo inherited from

1960165
put	get
first block elements had to be put inside td elements inorder to get z-index working in several browsers

1960167
32-bit	64bit
if you re running 64bit windows be sure to install the 32-bit and 64bit versioning of tortoise alongside .so you get shell integration from within 32-bit ides

1960177
pygtk	pyqt
i ve done lots of stuff with pygtk however i m deciding to learn pyqt im stuck at the qgraphicsview i have absolutley no idea how to get signals from the items i place on the graphics view primarily mouse events.how do i get the mouse events from idividual items in a scene

1960180
subdirectories	absolute-path
they can both be used to obtain and absolute-path to the images directory of mytheme regardless of structure of whether wordpress is install on the root directory or in a subdirectories off the root

1960182
put	get
i discovered that no matter how i put the first map on the page weather via a direct div on the page or on a floatingpanels i couldn t get a floating panels to show another map

1960183
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
with any of those you d set up a custom view for that section of your table view using either a clear background-color or contains a labels and a segmented control arranged .so that they match up with the rest of the table sections

1960184
command-line	cmd
i want to be able to power it on and off from software - say from serial-port cmd or by running a command-line or something i can get to from ruby or java

1960191
contains	any
id abcabc would result in id 0 .so in worst case you won t find any recording matching this id but id would never contains any string especially not sql because of this int cast

1960199
solaris	linux
a more recent memory allocation strategy has been the slab allocation adopted by solaris and linux

1960230
switching	screens
in this main screens there is a switching controllers remember-me .so that .app will remember the user next time he run the .app

1960235
value	field
as you can see an account recording has several field with value the user will not enter themselves

1960235
value	field
what would be the proper flow for 1 hashing the passwd entered in the form and storing that and 2 setting and storing the date_time_created field s value in the database on form submission

1960258
updating	updates
however if you are really going to expect a large amount of games to reliably updates every 30 seconds you may want to take a different approach if updating a game would take any significant amount of time

1960275
16-bit	8bit
0 is always silence but 8bit stereo will end up taking the same amount of time to play back as 16-bit mono

1960275
32-bit	16-bit
same with float 32-bit mono and 16-bit stereo

1960286
oracle	mysql
started with mysql and using oracle now

1960286
oracle	mysql
but i don t want to use oracle and want better performance than mysql

1960294
fadein	show
the data show but it doesn t fadein

1960313
dbd	dbi
the reason to use dbi instead of using dbd directly is that it provides a consistent abstraction layer for working with databases

1960329
hash	md5	salt	md5
i m not that an md5 is the best way to store passwd i think the general accepted practice is to use a hash and a salt checkout the way restful_authentication or authlogic does it for best practices

1960331
export	report
you can building report in ms-access that have the export to words functionality built into them

1960331
export	report
you can invoke the report from your code and then call the export functionality and give it parameters .so that it will export to a .doc file that you named

32-bit	16-bit
using a two phase bootloader the first 512bytes is 16-bit then the second phase switches the processor into 32-bit mode setting up the registers and gate selectors in preparation which in turn then jumps to the entry code of the actual program to do the booting up - this is taking into account in having to read from a specific location on disk or reading a configuration file which contains data on where the boot code is stored

1960367
32-bit	x86
implmenting threads in 32-bit mode is something that will be tricky to produce as you will have to create some kind of a scheduling in assembly since you mentioned implements threads on a x86 architecture bootloader

1960371
javascript	dom
according to this it will if it has a but from my testing it only works if the table is in the original dom - not from javascript

in my opinion the book that i ve started to read .so i know what i m talking about provides more guidance which might be preferable if everything is new for you it covers both the java ee platform and its apis and the environment to building deploy your applications

1960447
stripes	spring	stripes	wicket	stripes	grails	spring	grails	wicket	spring	wicket	grails
now as i said i can already hear voices saying things like java ee is heavy use spring instead learn struts or wicket or stripes for the presentation layer learn hibernate for persistent or not because i don t like orm use ibatis or straight jdbc instead you ll see it s cool with spring spring is .so cooool and use tomcat and why not jetty or jboss or just forget all this and go for grails and bla bla bla...

altova diffdog looks like a complicated commercial product and it did contains an option to ignore the elements order which is the key feature for me

1960701
contains	elements
i want to ignore all the difference on these elements whose named contains .size or .location or .width but it s not possible to defined such a conditional at the same time

1960703
contains	elements	null-terminated	c-strings
your list arrays contains elements where the elements are pointers to c-strings null-terminated sequences of characters

1960756
margins	padding
what is the difference between margins and padding

1960756
margins	padding
if you ask about margins and padding and you get a clean drawing of box content added padding border line and margins possibly collapsing against another box you know the guy knows what he is talking about

1960822
arrays	loops
you re having to loops anyway to building the rows and columns i assume .so why not pull the data down first for that month put the data into an arrays old fashioned i know and checked the offset in that arrays as you increment through the cell rendering

1960825
put	get
...you ll get an error if you put the brackets around the and part of a between statement

before the while-loop and the randomization part has to go after loops

1960919
callback	methods
placing the layout logic i m trying to create in the callback isn t an option as each methods callback and my layout div handler shouldn t know about the other

1960927

1960991
memmove	memcpy
using memcpy .when source and destination overlap can lead to undefined behavior - in those cases only memmove can be used

1960991
memmove	memcpy
but what if i know for sure buffering don t overlap - is there a reason to use specifically memcpy or specifically memmove

1960995
any	set
if the primary-key or any coloumn is set to auto-increment the data-table will have those latest value .post recent updates

1960996
memmove	memcpy
memcpy doesn t have any special handling for overlapping buffering .so it lacks .some checked therefore it is faster than memmove

1960996
memmove	memcpy
also on some architectures memcpy can benefit from using cpu instructions for moving blocks of memory - something that memmove cannot use

1960999
any	set
if the primary-key or any coloumn is set to auto-increment the data-table will have those latest value .post recent updates

1961005
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
you might want to look into the domnodeinserted event for firefox opera safari and the onpropertychange event for ie

mongodb	couchdb
i m looking a way to automate schema-migration for such databases like mongodb or couchdb

1961049
parentheses	operators
this will return the numbers and the delimeters whoch in your case are the operators and parentheses you need to evaluate

1961059
expression	evaluation
that permits evaluation of simple java expression

1961082
highlight	selected
what i would like achieve is basically the storing of the highlight selected text into a persistent

1961096
contains	any
no csv doesn t specify any way of tagging comments - they will just be loaded by programs like excel as additional cell contains text

1961103
internet-explorer	firefox
since you mentioned within their browser and firefox if you are using internet-explorer you can disable the page header footer by temporary setting of the value in the registry see here for an example

1961115
windows-mobile	symbian
.so windows-mobile has its directshow for media editing capturing and .so what is its analog for symbian os s60 v5

1961121
memmove	memcpy
it s quite possible though unlikely that the person who wrote memmove for your particular compiler was a certified genius while the poor soul who got the job of writing memcpy was the village idiot -

1961121
memmove	memcpy
although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility

1961124
latitude-longitude	location
is there any openstreetmap api available to get location info based on latitude-longitude

1961134
highlight	selected
display to write down an expression and evaluate it by selected highlight the text with the mouse and pressing ctrl+shift+i

1961136
launchd	daemons
if you re looking to building such a thing on os x lookup daemons and launchd .

1961142
defined	declare
i think you talking about static function.you have to declare and defined that function as static then you can use that void function without initializing the class in any view controllers

1961163
internet-explorer	firefox
does someone know a plugins that allows me to open jpeg files on my browser internet-explorer or firefox with zoom and rotation button

1961172
.net	wcf
since you re using .net you might be interested to learn that workflow can be used server-side to tracking the state of a web-services wcf based conversation

1961191
webserver	upload
use a distributed-filesystems like hdfs and prepare dedicated webserver as filesystems clients inorder to save upload images and service request

1961191
webserver	upload
again webserver bridge image upload and request

1961192
put	get
i want to put 1000 entities into my .app engine server production server but i get timeout errors and also 500 server errors

1961210
margins	padding
you have to set either the margins and or the padding left and right to a total of 50px

1961215
margins	padding
note most browsers use a default margins for the body but .some opera use a default padding instead .so you should always specify both the margins and padding for the body

1961227
value	field
you should have the value in the table where the data that you now have in the field named is where data belongs

1961229
.when	ready
the funny part is that .when i have an error inside the ready function of jquery the part try i.dont.exist + 0

1961229
.when	ready
anyone having an idea why this break .when an error occurs inside the ready function of jquery

1961237
memmove	memcpy
assuming a sane libs implementor memcpy will always be at least as fast as memmove

1961237
memmove	memcpy
however on most platform the difference will be minimal and on many platform memcpy is just an alias for memmove to support legacy code that incorrectly call memcpy on overlapping buffering

1961237
memmove	memcpy
both memcpy and memmove should be written to take advantage of the fastest loads and stores available on the platform

1961265
selected	button	input-field	selected	input-field	textarea
the html input-field this also include selected textarea and button only send the named-value pairs to the server side as been specified in the named and value attributes

1961275
hide	show
for show and hide tabs i used this jquery code

1961279
subtract	time
but if the file is too large or it would make your line handler more difficult another thing you could do is read the file into memory line by line 10 time or .so without process average the time and then time the function the way you have it now including process and disk i o and then subtract the average disk-reading time from the total time

1961286
put	get
i agree with the other answers that resource that you put is not required to be the same as the one that you later get

1961291
perl	php
almost comet solution uses php and one file written with perl

1961293
compatibility	platform
i m basically looking for a replacement for richtextbox or textbox components that is fully written in c# without using pinvokes inorder to keep cross platform compatibility

1961342
margins	padding
i do this min max... calculation on each dimension taking into account borders padding margins

1961343
mersenne-twister	generator
as to what random.random the default generator is doing it uses an algorithm called the mersenne-twister to create a seemingly random floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 not including 1 all the numberss in that interval being of equals likelihood

1961346
arguments	default
the second arguments is there .so you can provide your own rng instead of the default

1961383
selected	button
can you have a jeditable selected that submit on selecteded the dropdown instead of needing the extra submit ok button

1961387
buffering	streaming
in general it is a good idea to write diagnostic messages to standards-error cerr rather than standards output as the error streaming is not buffering

1961442
linux	osx
could you recommend another options to get more concordance between win and linux osx versioning

1961443
32-bit	64bit
my guess is that you are running vista 64bit and trying to run a 32-bit eclipse

1961443
32-bit	64bit
the solution is to either install a 32-bit jvm and make sure it is found before the 64bit one in your path or to use a 64bit eclipse

1961459
average	median
you can use the median instead of the average if your data happen to present outliers spikes

1961483
groovy	java
for this particular use is there any reason why java would be more cumbersome than groovy or beanshell

1961483
groovy	java
i m not asking for a comparison of groovy beanshell and java as there are many

1961483
groovy	java
rather i want to know if it s easier to dynamically load groovy or beanshell classes from files compared to java

1961485
bullet	physx
havok definitely uses this i think it s an option in bullet but i m not sure about physx

1961551
getter	setter
the compiler actually creates a private backing variables and a simple getter and setter as in your first example

1961551
getter	setter
if all you re doing is creating a getter and setter and nothing actually happens .when either occurs then the concise syntax is a good option

1961551
any	set
if you have to perform any other actions redraw a control for example .when you set the value then the full syntax is required

1961566
hsqldb	mysql
i have 2 databases mysql and hsqldb

1961567
click	mouse
if the mouse is not within the form then conclude that the console x was click and call freeconsole

1961590
jquery	dojo
thus jquery extjs yui dojo etc

1961591
overlay	widget
.so i thought an widget overlay is an nice looking

1961608
decimal	hex
take a look at this questions which is very similar but dealing with hex how to convert numbers between hexadecimal and decimal in c#

1961634
value	field
for the 50+ .profile mysql field .sometimes i need to do stuff with the data for example the join date and birthdate have other code that must run to convert them al.so if a recording is-empty then i would like to show an alternative value .so with that knowlege should i be using methods

1961641
bison	yacc
there are many parsing rules that cannot be parsing by a bison yacc parsing for example distinguishing between a declaration and a function-call in some circumstances

1961641
bison	yacc
yacc and bison are lalr 1 parsing generator which are not sophisticated enough to handle c++ effectively

1961642
abstract	extends
you should look into making .some kind of class to abstract this all .so that your .profile could extends it and all that functionality you ve written would already be in-place

1961646
mersenne-twister	generator
python random module uses a particularly good and well-studied pseudo-random generator the mersenne-twister with a period of -- a numbers that has more than 6 thousand digits .when written out in decimal digits as will confirm

1961674
version-control	cvs
the problem is that they don t use all the tools available version-control automated building continuous-integration etc to their full extent mainly a project is one big project in eclipse netbeans using cvs for version-control and everything checked in including libs jars they started using branching for the first time .when i started doing branches for small tasks and merging them back

1961703
attributes	properties
a points to note here is that a mapper would be required to map the properties from the source dataobject add some metadata to it like html elements attributes etc and then carry out the transformation

1961714
vsts	tfs
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro versioning of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1961719
version-control	git
i also recommend you take a look at git for version-control

1961720
callback	methods
you can use the callback arguments of to execute the sortable methods after the html has been inject to the dom

1961722
contains	set	contains	elements
that happens because you have set up to absolute the positioning of each div to_text nav_deals etc. but the div that contains the footer is rendering as a normals div elements because its positioning is not absolute

1961729
getter	setter
after a while you can start using hide methods on the getter and setter

1961749
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem is not a qobject and cannot send signals nor receive slots

1961752
hash	md5
3 million strings - 3 million md5 hash

1961752
hash	md5
a good solution will include a bash perl scripting that takes a list of strings from stdin and output a list of their md5 hash

1961761
uibinder	gwt
i m learning to use gwt 2.0 and i m trying to convert the stockwatcher demo to use the uibinder

1961774
python	perl
it s not hard to do in c or perl or python using any of the many md5 implementation -- at its heart md5 is a hash-function that goes from a character vector to a character vector

1961775
fadein	hide
i tried several variations of this including hide .show and .fadeout fadein and just setting the opacity seems to have the fewest ill effects flicker changing page height etc.

1961776
hash	md5
to get better performance you would probably need to use a different program or create a c program that call one of the publicly available md5 hash apis

1961777
checkbox	textbox
the textbox value email the textbox value passwd and the bool checkbox value remember-me

1961777
value	field
to note i have tried updatemodel which does not throw an exception-handling but all of the field of the user object are null tryupdatemodel with similar results tryupdatemodel returns true but all null properties on the user instances acceptverbs .post in a homepagecontroller methods signin with and without parameters again no value passed or able to be retrieved from the user-controls correctly

1961805
hide	show
i am trying to create a way to show and hide a numbers of different elements on my page depending if the user is logged in or not

1961805
logout	login
for example i want to hide logout is users are not logged in and login .when they are

1961818
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i don t understand javascript nor the wysiwyg editor fckeditor that deeply yet but it somehow seems to be a pointers or other direct reference to the actual elements that resides in an iframe within the wysiwyg editor

1961841
contains	elements
the floats are by default aligned to top of the contains elements and the display-inline is by default aligned to bottom of the contains elements

1961843
subclipse	m2e
eclipse ide with m2e and subclipse subversive

1961843
integrated	manual
docbook for manual integrated into building

1961843
stress-testing	jmeter
jmeter for stress-testing and long-term performance monitor

1961870
pascal	basic
the above stands true for any high level language such as c pascal or basic

1961871
visual-c++	turbo-c
if it comes to understand a programming-language it is about the programming-language not about understanding now to configure an ide and the turbo-c compiler is as good as visual-c++ for learning the language caveat not for production code

1961894
version-control	cvs
most commonly small companies currently use cvs or svn and there s nothing bad in that in fact i d be really worried if no version-control was really used at all

1961894
environment	building
automated building and continuous-integration environment

1961894
acceptance-testing	bdd
this part is very lively field and you re better of googling for the following tdd bdd unit tests integration-testing acceptance-testing xunit.net mock object

1961894
code-coverage	cobertura
cobertura - code-coverage metrics very useful to see how the coverage develops over time

1961894
.war	jar
we soon came to realize that these extra step are completely useless since by using ant - by the way you can invoke ant tasks directly in hudson - we could tell the jar .war building step to ignore everything by either file named say everything that ends-with test or testcase or by source folder

1961918
subclassing	inherited
create a subclassing that inherited from the libs s class and implements reference-counting in the subclassing

1961919
id3v2	id3
a nice small cli tool which helped me a lot with checked what i did while developing id3 stuff is mid3v2 which is the mutagen versioning of id3v2

1961922
hide	show
if you are using the standards cflogin built into coldfusion you can show hide elements by checked for a logged in user

1961950
any	set
if weâ d set a themes inside page.init event handler then by that time viewstate would already be tracked and thus any data applied by themes would be tracked and marked as dirty which would consume lot of bandwidth

1961950
any	set
are there any other reasons why themes canâ t be set after page.preinit

1961966
directx	gdi
after that you may have to look at using gdi or directx to get closer to the hardware

1961978
sin	exp
suppose i have a function y t x exp -t sin x

1961978
contains	any	contains	elements
now how do i defined matrix y without using any loops such that each elements y i j contains the value of desired function y at t i x j

1961997
binaries	install
i ve downloading all the binaries and have pyqt4 install globally on my python2.6 directory

1962006
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
support differs between oracle 10g+ sql-server 2000+ postgresql mysql 5.1+ .so we d need more information before recommending a specific one

1962006
sql-server	oracle
sql-server and oracle support native xml at their respective versioning

1962012
unique	words
in other words it only needs to be unique i don t see any rea.son why it should be unique per user from what you have said .so far .so you might as well just use the primary key unless you re planning on integration with .some other data store

1962032
put	get
if you put u or d in it would still work and you would get out the numbers represented as an unsigned-int in based 10 or a signed int in base 10

1962037
sql-server	mysql
if you want to produce a string and you re using mysql there s a group_concat aggregation function but there s no simple equivalent in sql-server at least

1962074
getter	setter
doing this seems to reduce everything a player does to itself as a series of getter and setter or am i just wrong here

1962074
getter	setter
i ve read countless time that a class that exposes everything as a series of getter setter indicates a pretty poor abstraction being used as a data structure instead of a class

1962087
any	set
also header must be set before you start any output on this request else it will cause error

1962092
directory	folder
ok .so i have a directory in my root folder called pages in which i keep all my pages that i include thru index.php

1962101
any	set
instead i m suggesting that we want to guarantee them - that given a predetermined set of 100 monsters we want any given mp3 file to map to one of them

1962113
updatepanel	gridview
i used placeholder to hold the gridview components while searching for a solution i found updatepanel as a better alternative - as far as i understand the page can be partially refreshed - which means that only the updatepanel has to be refreshed...but it doesn t work

1962116
soft-keyboard	ime
you might want to look at the keyboardview code in the platform which is used by the standards soft-keyboard and sample ime

1962119
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
if you just want to get the text properties of the selected textbox admiting your listbox is in single selection mode it it quite simple

1962142
directx	gdi
directx bypasses everything and talks directly to the device-driver thus gdi and other usual methods won t work - unless aero is disabled or unavailable all that appears is a black rectangle at the top left of the screens

1962175
abstract-class	derived-class
i m finding it hard to design the classes of applications i m trying to write because .when does one decide what functionality goes in which class and whether it should really be in a derived-class or there should be an abstract-class or interface for this class

1962181
comma	words
however .when i do all that some words end with comma or a full stop . or even have brackets attached to them which is all perfectly normals

1962205
getter	setter
i advise you not to fear the fact that player will be a class of getter and setter

1962218
solaris	linux
while it s available on every systemd i ve ever used various bsds mac os x linux solaris cygwin if you somehow manage to find one in which it doesn t the following should work

1962228
principles	srp
in fact i d argue that s the whole points of principles like the srp - not to make it easy to design everything beforehand but to make it easy to change things as your requirements grow and change shape because you can t predict everything beforehand

1962229
communication	messages
signals and slots were made to simulate messaging between object at the libs level cause c++ does not support messages like smalltalk does .so you can use them any where you want to make object communication to each other either to pass .some data around or to activate .something .

1962229
communication	messages
i have used them almost for every thing and they worked fine the only problem i got was with concurrent code where i had multiple threads communication with each others using signals and slots it was really bad i needed a real time process of messages because the execution of the slot was not immediate

uilabel	uiview
my approach would be to create an png image in the styles of the bubble only useful for a fixed size bubble of course subclassing uiview and draw this image into the uiview s background .when it s created i would also add a uilabel or uiimage depending on what i wanted to do whether it be display text or an image

1963323
uiresponder	uilabel
next step is to subclassing the uilabel and add a methods that response to the touchesbegan uiresponder methods this will be called each time it s touch

1963411
google-chrome	firefox
i need a browser-independent way that works in google-chrome firefox

1963441
arrays	loops
on the other hand copying a one-million elements arrays could be faster than a hand-coded loops because arrays.copy might employ optimizations for large arrayss

1963441
arrays	loops
besides that array.copy might use loops unrolling and for large byte arrays might copy one machine words at a time

1963457
javascript	dom
i have firefox firebug dom inspector and would like to trap whatever javascript event is leading to the pop-up

1963459
traffic	packets
sounds similar to this bug have you tried inspector the network traffic with packets sniffer to checked for this conditional

is there any cmd or api to set x.org linux color brightness

1963493
for-loop	loops
on i.solating the error i found that if the second for-loop is not run for the last iterator i mean like in the sample test case n 5 .so i run loops only till i 3 instead of i 4 then it doesn t crash and produces the expected output

1963514
dictionary	hashmap

i never used erlang and php but i used erlang and python with some success knowing php it should be pretty easy just try to keep everything clean and keep the state on the erlang side using php only to generator the user-interface

1963651
callback	methods
said another way .when you pass a callback to your methods it s as if you are providing additional instructions what you should do next

1963651
callback	methods
with a callback you can tell class b here s the messages that i want you to listen for and this is the methods in class a that i want you to call .when you receive it

1963679
hide	show
how can i have my show hide function work together to make sure at minimum the show was display to the user for at least 1 2 second

1963683
hide	show
you can perform this math either inside your callback or within the savebanner function itself within the show portion you would set the starting time within the hide portion you would checked the difference and set the settimeout

1963698
required	checked
for code from an outside assembly to call the checked methods it would required an imessage reference to your class not a newclass reference

1963703
abstract-base-class	abstract-methods
this is one area where you may want to consider an abstract-base-class - there you can create protected abstract-methods which inheritors can implements without exposing them to external callers

.when programming in c i often use malloc to allocate memory and free to release it

1963748
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
you can use a lot of other technologies that are closer to php though ruby python and perl should all be usable

1963750
exception-handling	error-handling
turns out .net has a sweet error-handling architecture baked right in using exception-handling

1963766
malloc	free
the only thing that matters to free is getting the exact same address as what malloc returned

1963794
malloc	free
for the case of malloc the heap allocation stores a mapping of the original returned pointers to relevant details needed for free ing the memory later

1963794
binary-tree	nodes
this typically involves storing the size of the memory region in whatever form relevant to the allocation in use for example raw size or a nodes in a binary-tree used to tracking allocation or a count of memory units in use

1963794
malloc	free
attempting to free any pointers with a value different to those returned by previous malloc s and as yet unfreed is an error

1963794
malloc	free
it is not possible to partially free memory regions returned from malloc

1963798
malloc	free
your code call malloc in one routine stores the pointers somewhere and eventually call free in a different routine

in both cases addition is performed modulo the arrays size and make sure to increment the other index .when needed that is .when the queue is full or empty

1963878
children	nodes
i believe there is a beforeselect event you can tap into which should allow you to cancel nodes selection if the selected nodes has children

1963916
execution	exit
technically execution continue on past the header call unless you specifically stop it after die exit

1963918
nsurlconnection	uiwebview

dynamic-dispatch	implementation
there is behavior dynamic-dispatch based on what class was new ed and there s implementation

1963955
subclassing	base-class
.when you specify a member function as virtual there is a chance that you may try to use subclassing via a base-class polymorphically at runtime

1963955
contains	any	subclassing	base-class
only .when a base-class containss a virtual function do any other subclassing contains a vtable

1963977
data-members	instances
remember that a vtable is similar to a static data-members of a class and instances have only pointers to these

1964010
erlang	python
then again if you re still a newbie to erlang maybe you ll save time in the long run with python and twisted or tornado

1964040
logout	login
fyi the logout user server behavior sets that session variables to an empty string rather than destroying the variables that s why you need to checked for it not being an empty string using the dreamweaver login out server behavior

1964055
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	mysql
you don t really have a variety of choices here you can caching them in ram using something like memcachingd or push them to disk reading and writing them with a databsae rdbms like postgresql mysql or dod like couchdb

1964056
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
the class types is polymorphism if it contains at least one virtual function or any of its direct or indirect parent are polymorphism this is answer 3 from your set

1964082
double	int
now the pointsers pointers may points to an int or an arrays of int it may points to a single character or arrays of characters it may points to a single double numbers or an arrays of double etc

1964082
pointers	stack
if it is not possible to find out that a pointers is points to an arrays or a simple variables then suggest a technique by which i can write the push methods of this stack

1964083
arrays	loops
notice that in this versioning the construction of the inner arrays is happening outside of loops that is meant to be iterator it

1964093
callback	methods
each subclassing should then implements this methods and callback on a particular methods on event-listener

1964095
pointers	stack
consider having your stack types take a pair of pointers one to the first elements in the arrays and one to the last elements in the arrays

1964123
nunit	moq
my test code using nunit and moq

1964128
constructor	object
the copy-initialization form works as follows convert the rhs value to the temporary object of lhs types by any means possible standards conversion conversion-operator conversion constructor

1964128
copy-constructor	temporary	temporary	copy
and then use the copy-constructor of the lhs class to copy the temporary object to the lhs object

1964128
copy-constructor	temporary
you can immediately notice that the copy-initialization syntax unconditionally uses the copy-constructor the copying and the intermediate temporary can be optimized away but conceptually they are there

1964148

1964246
malloc	free
you either need to malloc free the pixels buffering or better yet use stack

1964246
malloc	free
malloc free

1964250
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it should also demonstrate their ability to write cross-browser compatible code just open their examples in ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1964269
boost-serialization	boost
since you re already using boost why don t you look ate boost-serialization

1964278
updating	updates
but if multiple threads might be updating it and are also reading it to do the updates increment then you definitely do need some kind of synchronized

1964281
directory	folder
you can then reference that external directory from within your project with a linked folder

1964300
primitive	int
primitive like int are thread-safe in the sense that reads writes are atomicity

1964310
keydown	keyup
checkout the form.keypreview properties it will allow you to trap all keydown keyup and keypress events at the form level before allowing them to be process by individual elements

1964327
checkbox	button
the pages of the web .app will have some data grid some with link columns inputbox labels dropdownlistfor checkbox radio button and submit action button

1964327
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve read .some earlier questions comparing webforms to asp.net-mvc .so i m curious how has asp.net-mvc evolved over the past year or .so

1964327
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
another question that occurred to me is the transitions from asp.net webforms to asp.net-mvc anything like going from standards wpf using code-behind to mvvm

1964327
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so i m wondering how similar a jump it is to go from webforms to asp.net-mvc

1964344
display	height	display	width
the problem is i want background images for header and footer that are not getting display until i specify a height and width for them.moreover the height and width specified in the css inside the #header and #footer have to match the exact dimension of the original images which are dimensionally large otherwise the images are not being display properly parts of them get cut

1964358
contains	lookup
we lookup a table in db let s say table_hosts that contains this data user host_id

1964373
uiscrollview	subviews
the way i have used uiscrollview in the past was to programatically add the subviews to the uiscrollview s contentview such as uilabel uiimagesviews etc. while keeping tracking of how much vertical spaces height the subviews and spacing between them are taking up

1964373
uiscrollview	subviews
at the end of adding the uiscrollview s subviews you set the uiscollview s content view

1964389
any	set
no if you use fulltext indexing and have any of its parameters set differently including stop-words hint don t use full-text indexing

1964398
g++	gcc	binaries	install
the default installation prefix is usr local which is why make install put gcc and g++ binaries into usr local bin etc

1964408
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another thing - there s a bunch of myths about asp.net-mvc framework along those who have touch only webforms

1964419
uiimagepickercontroller	uiimage
- void imagepickercontroller uiimagepickercontroller picker didfinishpickingimage uiimage selectedimage editinginfo nsdictionary editinginfo

1964425
google-docs	spreadsheet
especially now that spreadsheet presentations and docs are all basically used under the google-docs moniker the entire google-docs suite is best used as the sum of its parts

1964436
.net	wcf
interoperability - remember wcf was built from the get-go to be as interoperable as it could possibly be - not just .net to .net but interoperable with any numbers of other systemd like java ruby - you named it

1964436
.net	wcf
this is a common issue - many .net developers just simply forget that wcf is not a .net specific and .net only technology - it has to strive to maintain as much compatibility as possible with lots of other systemd that might not offer all the features of .net

1964436
.net	wcf	exception-handling	error-handling
another case in points is the error-handling in wcf - don t just throw .net exception-handling - those are .net specific and don t mean a thing to a java client - use soap faults in your wcf service

1964444
environment	execution
however we do not control the execution environment of win client .app plus the user that is running the .app on his her systemd is the only one that stands to gain something by gaming the systemd

1964471
rollback	commit
commit transactional or rollback if there was an error

1964484
environment	execution
if you don t control the client .app s execution environment anything your .app can do can be analysed automated and reproduced by an attacker that does control that environment

1964494
decrement	increment
.when the count changes on the server i want all connect browsers to reload the count .so that everyone sees the increment decrement

1964496
constructor	object
but what is the standards for the named object that should be passed to the exception-handling s constructor

1964500
configuration	environment
ruby-on-rails has the concept of environment and automagically can deduce if you re in development or production .so you can specify your connection information connection-string in a configuration file and the framework dynamically pull the appropriate one

1964502
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have used this successfully in firefox ie opera and safari haven t needed to test in google-chrome

1964511
directory	folder
to be more specific i have one directory the backup folder which i constantly updates using findfirstchangenotification

1964514
grouping	sorting
you could create a sorting table the more sanely grouping the characters like

1964520
postgresql	mysql
you might see for mysql postgresql sqlite to use in applications for example to archive my books

1964538
javascript	dom
i m confused about the relationship among object created in javascript and object that are part of the dom

1964538
javascript	dom
.when using jquery user-interface the tabs feature my program behaves differently depending on whether i manipulate my object from javascript directory or if i first access it from the dom which leads me to believe that the two references are not equals

1964539
publishing	release
there is a publishing wizard in visual-studio wich let s you change parts of web-config for release building automaticaly

1964548
contains	set
.when a webpage is loaded ie tries to see which set of conditional is met - page title is account login the page contains a login textbox a passwd textbox

1964565
latex	tex
programming tex engine which latex is based upon is more complicated

1964574
libcrypto	openssl
or use the openssl libcrypto

1964583
python	java
i d prefer any python solution but java would be fine too

1964588
malloc	free
afaik free usually doesn t take much time but malloc can take a lot of time if memory is fragmentation

1964618
locale	hebrew	culture	locale
the trick is you ll need to set the culture of the current thread and for some locale like hebrew also need to set the calendar within that culture

1964622
textblock	viewbox
you can put your textblock inside a viewbox .so the fonts will adjust to display the entire text

1964623
malloc	free
ok well i tried to replace the malloc free with new delete and that had no effect on the speed

1964643
malloc	free
you could turn these into a single malloc free call althought that would make the code less clear and harder to mantain

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
and jta capable application-server means a real j2ee containers or a non j2ee containers like tomcat with a standalone transactional manager like atomikos jotm bitronix simplejta jbossts or geronimotm jencks

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
fwiw i ve seen lots of complains about jotm i think that geronimotm jencks lacks of documentation i can t really say anything about jbossts arjunats except that it s a rock solid product simplejta and bitronix have both good documentation and atomikos is an impressive product greatly documented too

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1964713
superclass	inherited
multiple-inheritance is where your class inherited from multiple interfaces superclass

1964730
any	set
unfortunately this cannot be done efficiently better than o n in any of the standard-library set containers

1964735
compact-framework	.net
.when using the .net compact-framework you can use system.net.httpwebrequest instead of webclient which isn t supported on .net cf

1964735
httpwebrequest	webclient
since webclient is implements on top of httpwebrequest you can do everything with httpwebrequest that you can with webclient albeit with more code

1964751
contains	any
.so the idea was a write a recursive function that compares two strings to see if string prefix is contains in string other without using any standards string functions and using pointer-arithmetic

1964768
populate	row
you can t save the row until you populate its foreign key .so referential integrity is satisfied

1964768
populate	row
it would do no good to pass the row object to setcategory if it doesn t have the primary key populate

1964780
contains	any
the first thing an elegant function must do is to perform one task and your description of the function - compares two strings to see if string prefix is contains in string other simply doesn t make any sense

1964796
strcmp	strstr
even if you wanted to create strstr which is a c function and not a c++ function you really don t need to avoid using strcmp

1964804
put	get
.so i could put the selectedindex in a hidden input before submission the form and then get that selectedindex and set it with a javascript function.

1964823
linked-list	queue
the specific pool have a certain numbers of elements preallocated and are implements as a linked-list actually a queue .so allocation and release is never more than a couple of pointers updates and the cost of entering and leaving a critical-section

1964825
output	cat
cat proc versioning - output this

1964831
default-value	arguments
the second arguments to the .pop methods plays no role in this case it s only used .when the first arguments is not found as a key in the dictionary on which the methods is called in which case .pop s second arguments would be the default-value returned by the call to .pop without any alteration to the dictionary

1964833
malloc	free
having had a look at the code one big thing that comes to my mind is this - mixture of malloc ... new ... delete ... free ...

1964833
malloc	free
in short you are mixing the c++ s runtime in calling new ... and delete ... with malloc ... and free ...

1964833
malloc	free
why did you use the malloc ... and free ... which is from c in the middle of this c++ code

1964848
stdin	pipe
if what you are reading is a pipe or an input device stdin rather than a file you can get a short read whenever your buffering is larger than what is currently in the input buffering

1964864
bots	api
if i were to write a bots to automate something without a good api or text-based interface sikuli is probably the first tool i would reach for

1964870
hide	show
this has a few caveats first of all if you have two or more places the loading image can be show you re going to need to kep tracking of how many call are running at once somehow and only hide .when they re all done

1964871
hide	show
let s create an elements that we can show hide anytime we re making an ajax request

1964896
httpwebrequest	webclient
the answer almost certainly is to replace usage of httpwebrequest with webclient and to use the async methods of webclient

1964896
callback	methods
the iasyncresult pattern uses beginxxx and endxxx methods uses iasyncresult instances uses delegation for callback and supports waiting for completion

1964896
callback	methods
the event-based pattern uses xxxasync methods to initiate async actions uses xxxcompleted events instead of callback to handle completion and this is important to your case transfer thread-specific context into every callback event handler

1964896
callback	methods
if however you use a beginxxx methods like httpwebrequest.begingetresponse and a delegation callback your callback will be execute in the context of a thread that does not guarantee to have the right asp.net context attached

1964896
httpwebrequest	webclient
typically the low-level classes httpwebrequest will use the iasyncresult pattern while the higher-level classes webclient will use the event-based pattern

1964896
httpwebrequest	webclient
.so if it s easy to do i d suggest moving to webclient and event handler instead of httpwebrequest and callback delegation

1964904
any	set
you can set these up to expose any repository as a website

1964921
temperature	battery
yes the temperature could play a role in how fast the battery drains

1964944
wamp	php
but .when i click the run as php webpage it tells me it cant find the localhost wamp and .when i even load zend newly it cant find any server.

1964946
daemons	systemd
see for a discussion of issues keeping the systemd clock accurate via the ntpd 8 daemons

1964950
malloc	free
+1 to malloc free making my eyes hurt in c++

1964950
malloc	free
roll up your malloc call to one large malloc and free for the x y left right etc structures instead of 12

1964950
pointers	stack
.when it is not just set your pointers to the local stack buffering

1964954
meta-inf	jar
by including a meta-inf service java.sql.driver file in the jar file there is no longer the need to do class.forname

1964967
variables	boolean
generically if you have a session variables called loggedin and assuming it s boolean it s as simple as

1964975
selected	button
the problem is that it s a special button descended from tbitbtn and whenever the button is selected it tries to draw a border around it with a dotted-line and that gets in the way

1964977
configuration	environment	environment	building
the other possibility is that the gcc compiler .when it was built for your environment the configuration during the building of the compiler from source was specified to points to the .lib path

1964980
arguments	default
i know the __getattr__ must be 2 arguments but i want to get a default attributes if the attributes is no being

1964981
silverlight	wpf
anyone who has mimicked the silverlight datagrid default styles to wpf should please .post his answer and i will mark it as answer and give him a vote

1964982
logout	login
also is this a good solution or should i let the user login in the other browser and then logout the current user and display a messages you are logged in from another location just like messenger does

1964986
margins	padding
first of all you need to reset the padding and margins on the elements

1965010
value	field
inorder to control a user s login you could simply have a field in a database users table is fine indicating what the current sid is retrieved with session_id for the user and if it doesn t match the cookies value you just received then you immediately call session_destroy for that id and consider the user as logged out

1965027
contains	set
i ve managed to set the uniform variables arrays of matrix properly .when i checked those value in the shader all of them are import correctly and they contains the correct data

1965028
perl	php
furthermore you can get xampp which contains apache mysql and php perl stack for windows

1965037
operators	keyword
defined a small set of keyword and operators to describe an issue then have the program convert it to the super-efficient regex

1965081
sftp	ftp
i am working on a cocoa application that uses ftp and sftp transfer and the best way i ve found to accomplish this is by using libcurl

1965081
libcurl	libssh
now i m pretty sure that mac os x does not ship with libcurl install and even if it did it most likely wasn t built with libssh which i would also need

1965091
value	field
i want to selected all the field where a certain column is not a value i specify

1965098
binaries	install
i would al.so recommend you add a prefix to the binaries and install them into a different directory .so you have no problems with the compiler integration with the systemd compiler

1965136
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc forms are not like the forms in asp.net webforms where you have a bunch of viewstate and event field and other magical elements

1965139
push	pull
push or pull

1965160
compatibility	legacy
the old-style classes exist only for compatibility with old legacy code that relies on their quirks and were finally abolished in python 3

1965160
instances	self
if what you re trying to do is whether x is defined in the instances dictionary of self don t bother __getattr__ doesn t even get called in that case -- it s only called .when the attributes is not otherwise found in self

1965167
pointers	stack
creates the same constants string mike but then just assign the pointers to it instead of copying it to the local stack

1965233
selected	listbox
for your stated needs i suggest you use a listbox with a custom itemcontainerstyle - one that always has a border but only makes it visible if the item is selected

1965234
javascript	dom
they have slightly different implementation of javascript dom css etc..

1965235
value	field
if you do need to use user specific info create a scheduling agent that will set the value in a field and then reference the field as part of the view formula

1965253
minimum	max
obviously one can use a loops and only exit if the generator numbers was between the minimum and maximum but that could go on for a long time if min max are too close together or too far out along a tail

1965277
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
many of these new features are not yet supported by ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1965277
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
google-chrome opera and safari need new abbreviations really.

1965280
subclassing	base-class
if not you can easily add one by wrapping your xaml in a generics contentcontrol base-class not any subclassing and setting its templates like this

1965289
.net	wcf
i am implements wcf web service hosting in iis with basichttpbinding those should be accesseble by .net 2.0 client like accessing asmx service

1965299
contains	any
you can fade from any brush to another using a that has a canvas contains two overlapping 1x1 rectangles painted with each of the two brushes

1965313
installation	environment	rubygems	rvm	rvm	gem
unless you are using custom gem environment variables or a .gemrc or some multi ruby systemd like rvm then the location where rubygems are install for each ruby installation will be different

1965313
installation	environment
you can find the environment settings for a rubygems installation by running

1965321
memset	memcmp
rtlcomparememory rtlfillmemory sound like they re probably the underlying implementation for memcmp memset

1965331
nspredicate	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nspredicate
i know how to compare the day of two nsdate s using nsdatecomponents and nscalendar but how do i filtering it with an nspredicate

1965334
getter	setter
don t worry too much about the player class being a bunch of setter and getter

1965340
variables	boolean
the boolean variables is set to no as default

1965344
constructor	private
one way to simulate java enums is to create a class with a private constructor that initializer copies of itself as static-variables

1965350
windows-applications	silverlight
if you are proficient in .net windows-applications then you should go for silverlight

1965357
dialog	pop-up
what i m trying to get from a dialog plugins is that it can help pop-up panels like interface which allows dragging and resizing

1965392
stderr	stdout
my carefully scripted arrays job worker generator no stdout and no stderr .when they function properly

1965392
stderr	stdout
unfortunately sge insists on creating an empty stdout and stderr file for each run

1965392
stderr	stdout
stdout and stderr of arrays job tasks will be written into dif-

1965394
configuration	installation
attaching your configuration to the bug report might help under about eclipse - installation details - configuration copy and save to a text file

1965421
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the expectations of my framework is that you ll pass in the imodule s .so it can easily be used in asp.net-mvc webforms etc

1965427
click	mouse
my problem is .when the user reaches the end of the small div box scrolling the entire html page that contains the div box then begins to scroll assuming the user is scrolling via the mouse scroll and not by actually click the div box scroll button themselves

1965437
required	checked
i know i can shut the storage from the outside world and allow access to it only through an .application checked this stuff but this would required the .application to be on azure as well and on-premise .app won t be able to deliver any content from azure storage

1965454
any	set
is there any way to log transactional just to ensure i set up everything correctly

1965470
contains	any
varchars can contains any chars even 0x00 since its not a null-terminated string but a length specified string where the length is specified at the beginning of the string as a 2 or 4 byte value

1965476
windows-server	windows
another is to try the robocopy utility which is part of the windows-server resource kit and which replace xcopy in versioning of windows above server 2008 r2

1965487
g++	gcc
has anyone seen any numbers analysis on whether or not use of the c++ restrict keyword in gcc g++ actual provides any significant performance boost in reality and not just in theory

1965510
python	php
i m not a php guru however in many other languages python the fastest way to building a long string out of many smaller strings is to append the strings you want to concatenation to a list and then to join them using a built-in join methods

1965510
arrays	loops
if you are building a huge string in a tight loops the fastest way to do it is by append to the arrays and then joining the arrays at the end

1965526
arrays	loops
i was taught that for arrayss length is not retrieved through a methods due to the following fear programmers would just assign the length to a local variables before entering a loops think a for-loops where the conditional uses the arrays s length. the programmer would supposedly do .so to trim down on function-calls and thereby improve performance. the problem is that the length might change during loopss and the variables wouldn t

1965527
any	set
or selected .some sane numbers .sort the selectedion using python in any way you like and caching if its going to be static for all users which it looks like it will - set caching expiration to a minute or .so

1965541
double	int
however .when i changed those int s to double s which is what python would probably do i got this

1965541
multiplication	division
i haven t benchmarking any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using int division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1965541
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
it did both the division multiplication and addition in a single instruction

1965550
sql-server-express	sql-server
but even with sql-server-express install as mssqlserver you can still easily install a full copy of sql-server under a different instances named - i don t see any problems in that respect

1965555
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome and firefox

1965559
http	ssl
secure the transport layer use http with ssl to protect the entire pipe going from the client to the server

1965562
keyboard	mouse
for how to do this in c# see george mamaladze s article process global mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1965568
authentication	login
in android i launchd the browser for the user to login and authentication

1965573
httpwebrequest	webclient
classes inside the system.net namespace webclient httpwebrequest seems to do this automatically on the first request

1965577
silverlight	wpf
a pattern i like is prism which has some interesting patterns and best practices on achieving composite windows in both wpf and silverlight

1965578
decrement	increment
this leads me to believe i should increment something .when a downloading starts and decrement it .when it finishes

1965582
silverlight	wpf
codeplex link composite wpf and silverlight

1965583
textbox	button
i want it to be like stackoverflow where you have some button above the textbox where you can click for different thing you want to insert eg

1965585
linux	osx
if you run an os with real symbolic links linux osx

1965599
fckeditor	wysiwyg
there are also full-blown wysiwyg editor out there like fckeditor

1965618
allocation	deep
it catches things that amount to bugs that are correct but usually unintended like allocation something and deleting it over and over but for things like this you often need to have a deep understanding of everything happening to figure out exactly where the issue is but like i said surprisingly often it s memory-management related if you are stuck in systemd call a lot

1965633
environment	building
what we have done is during our automated building-process hudson we alter value in web-config depending on which environment the building is for

1965635
data-members	instances
i have an instances of a class i want to change an object data-members of this instances only with another object of the same types swap

1965635
value	field
basically i would like to change the value of a field of a variables the field is an object contains inside another object - the variables which its instances i have

1965643
ready	live
drop in an .htaccess to refuse connections from anyone but you and your client s ip and use this to make changes until the updates are ready to be pushed live

1965646
versioning	upgrade
.net last i checked has versioninging issues that might force the user to have to upgrade but maybe this problem can be avoided by developing against an older versioning

1965655
boost	stl
it s not practical to use stl or boost for any types of video game for starters

1965659
value	field
to change the value of a hidden private protected internal field

1965668
triggers	insert
what kind of triggers are preventing you from insert

1965670
configuration	environment
we use enterprise libs environment to configure the different environment paramters and via msbuild invoke the merge configuration tool that generator the different configuration for each environment

1965670
configuration	environment
the deploy process pick the right configuration file depending on which environment to install

1965713
abstract-class	subclassing
the user subclassing this abstract-class and implements that methods to return the templates file named

1965737
expression	brackets
my second pass takes the top level tokens of any bracketed expression and returns them in brackets - i didn t like this .solution .so well as we lose the information that .some and in various places are not contiguous

1965738
protected	public
the only way i can think to do this is create a public final methods in the parent class that the calling code will use and a protected methods which will be called by the public final methods

1965738
protected	public
the protected methods contains the functionality and the public final methods validation the return-value of the protected methods

1965744
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you find yourself fighting the unit test model with webforms you will find things easier with asp.net-mvc

1965744
webforms	asp.net
in case it helps i walk through these issues from the webforms side in my book ultra-fast asp.net

1965762
stdin	pipe
normally pipe will yield to stdin as soon as the output becomes available no or very small buffering there

1965764
loading	png
you could just try loading the resource with the png loader and if it s not a png image it will fail returning false

1965817
contains	set
set alternationcount of listview to value which is greater than numbers of rows that listview can actually contains

1965822

hide	show
i m using parent child grid and on child grid i m doing show hide throw javascript

1965837
jface	swt
are there any all-in-one jface controls example out there like the swt examples in eclipse

1965842
textbox	button
i want to show a button .when the caret cur.sor pipe thing in the textbox goes is in a numbers .so like

1965842
put	get
i have written code to checked if it is in a numbers and to get the numbers .when the button is click but it doesn t work correctly if i put the code in the selection changed event

freeglut	glut
freeglut is a completely opensourced alternative to the opengl utility toolkit glut libs

1965891
jface	swt
aside from the swt jface examples and introduction courses you have some project based on jface controls

1965891
jface	swt	nebula	jface	nebula	swt
nebula is a place where different eclipse-projects and independent developers collaborate on building custom swt widget and reuseable ui-components useable in ui-applications built using swt and jface

1965891
jface	swt
as with all frameworks there might be points in time where it just does not work and you have to dig deeper into the secrets of swt jface user-interface forms or databinding

1965904
required	checked
this methods depends on that the user doesn t empty their cookies .so if you need a more strict .solution you have to checked the ip-address and save that in a database but that will required more server re.sources

configuration	environment
my understanding here is that value in more specific environment configuration files like this should overrides the shared environment.rb configuration file .so if i have declare .some email settings like .so in configuration environment.rb .

1965945
configuration	environment
then code here in configuration environment development.rb below should overrides the actionmailer base.smtp_settings hash

1965961
environment	building
in particular you should maintain an environment in which a new building can be and is created daily

1965961
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
with respect to dbms selection any modern rdms sql-server mysql oracle would serve you well

1965961
build-process	release
you can always move to new hardware as long as your development-process include with a reasonable release build-process

1965964
twitter	gmail	myspace	twitter
fact 500m users is more people then the total of users who have twitter facebook myspace or gmail combined

1965978
configuration	environment
in configuration environment development.rb

1965978
configuration	environment
note that in configuration environment development.rb you will need to specify the full set of settings and not just domain as the hash overwrite the existing value rather than being merged with it

1965979
jquery-scrollable	sortable
try this .post jquery-scrollable sortable filterable table

1965987
switching	screens	portrait	screens
however even for the simplest of their samples the one that only rendering a blank screens if you switching the orientation several time switchinging like 5 time between portrait and landscape is usually enough the .app freezes and i need to force close it

1965989
groovy	scala
there are many dynamic-languages that target sun s jvm groovy scala jython jruby etc and i was sure there are many that target adobe s avm as well

1965989
scala	java	python	java
could it be that no one yet wrote a simple java python scala avm2 compiler that can be used as an alternative to the proprietary adobe flash-builder formerly flex builder

1965999
contains	set
now my question in my first example below you will see i have a variables set that contains a mysql query then i have another line that runs a function with the above variabless mysql query

1966010
constructor	object
in the constructor i create a configuration object

1966037
aquamacs	emacs
emacs aquamacs on mac

1966050
arrays	loops
i guess the real question is...will an arrays value continuously loops through the first value given from the initial call or once the new arrays is returned and set will it loops through that new arrays

1966055
error-handling	try-catch
a try-catch makes you put the error-handling at the bottom of the function while a returning bool required and if-statement at the top

1966057
16-bit	8bit
on an 8bit controllers an int is probably 16-bit

1966087
dropbox	github

build-server	teamcity
if you by create mean setup a build-server then i suggest you take a look at teamcity from jetbrains

1966149
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
a linked-list of line will be fast to insert newline or delete line and fast to move down and up if you have a doubly-linked-list from a specific line by a small numbers of line and fast to move to the start of the document

1966149
linked-list	arrays	document	editing
i would prefer a linked-list over an arrays based list for the purposes of editing large document

1966149
contains	any
in either case you may have problems if the document contains any extremely long line as strings are immutable and changing each character will be slow

1966187

note how i use single-quotes within my double-quotes

1966197
contains	elements
wrappanel positioninging child elements in sequential positioning from left to right breaking content to the next line at the edges of the contains box

1966205
linked-list	arrays
arrayss are often faster or equals to updates then linked-list because they have a much better caching locality then linked-list and for a single 1st level caching miss you can move already a few dozens pointers items in an arrays

1966205
binary	hex
then a gap buffering model is better it is also much better if you don t have line at all for example .when display binary files in hex mode

1966209

add a default to your switching because if x is 10 alphachar will never be assign

1966341
required	checked
any c++ .libs compile checked in the config.m4 file will also required linking the c++ .lib

1966341

1966420
web.py	django
web.py and django are nice

1966429
sql-server	sqlcommand
add a breakpoints at executenonquery inspect your sqlcommand object take a look at the parameters with the sqlcommand and make sure ticketid is being set to what you expect it to since your updates is driven by the ticketid ensure it is being set correctly or try running the tsql equivalent directly on sql-server my guess is that your ticketid variables isn t being set code looks fine at first glance

1969589
response	timeout
if they got served before configure timeout period user will get his response or a server busy like error

1969592
32-bit	64bit
not sure if this is an issue but you may run into problems on 64bit systemd if the the file was generator on a 32-bit and vice versa since the size of the int would be different which would throw off the mapping to the struct

1969608

make a table contains your possible value and reference the field to that table with a foreign key

1969876
difference	count
i guess it s better using mysql s count i don t think there s really a great difference in performance

1969890
difference	count
but as your forum grows it will make a huge difference count the numbers of post in a simple query

1969890
innodb	myisam
the difference will be even more apparent if you store the post in an innodb table instead of a myisam

1969901
any	set
we are also using a default value mechanism to provide default value for the object in case the serialization versioning doesn t have any value set

1969915
getter	setter
synthesize propertyname automates the generator of getter and setter methods

1969919

returning an empty collections for getmessagesinmyinbox communication you really do not have any messages in your inbox whereas returning null might be useful to communication that insufficient data is available to say what the list that might be returned ought to look like

1970016
delphi	c++
the viewer is written in delphi and you can also use tracetool with c# c++ activex and java

1970048
administration	credentials
the only way around would be to grant the credentials you re using access to the specified folder run the application as administration or run the application as the specific user for each user s folder

1970050
triggers	insert
i think it would be very bad practice to have a triggers which failed to or decided not to insert a recording without raising an exception-handling but it could happen

1970059
arrays	loops
loops through the route arrays looking for wild-cards

1970060
bluetooth	usb
all the libs i found until now supports devices connect via com usb bluetooth infrared but non of them supports a direct connection via ip using a com to ip redirector or virtual com ports is not an option for us

1970068
keydown	keyup
what i usually do is start the timeout on keyup and clear the timeout on keydown or keypress

1970101

mako jinja genshi all offer a more flexible alternative to django-templates

1970101
werkzeug	jinja2
my favourite bag of tricks is werkzeug + sqlalchemy + jinja2 but really whatever fits your needs and programming styles

1970101
pylons	django
a words of caution is that pylons and more diy frameworks required a better understanding of python than django for even trivial project

1970113
ruby	php	scriptaculous	jquery
jquery scriptaculous prototype raphaeljs and even css phantasia not in the base distribution combinations with an oodb for persistent gemstone provides a lot of why is the current state of the art in php java ruby or c# .so much worse

1970139
textbox	button
how can i get the value of textbox into labels .when i click on a button using jquery

1970142
getter	setter
val html methods in jquery act as getter and as setter

1970160
innodb	myisam
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970160
innodb	myisam
.so .when i create a table should i always try to use innodb engine instead of myisam

1970163
any	set
2- any special route area you may set eg admin

1970176
innodb	myisam
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational-database systemd

1970179
postgresql	rdbms
therefore if you need transactional innodb or another rdbms such as postgresql is the obvious choice

1970200
put	get
and if you want to insist on typing a prefix to get completion put the above in a class

1970210
innodb	myisam
you could use innodb for your write database transactional but read back from an myisam database which is denormalization

1970210
innodb	myisam
you know you re data is safe with referential integrity from innodb and you can read it as fast as you d like with myisam

1970220
database-table	mysql
i have a text file which was originally a mysql dump of a database-table

1970229
jquery	.post

selected	checkbox
in the admin for the registrationprofile model simply click the checkbox for the user s youâ d like to re-send the email for then selected the â œre-send activation emailsâ action

1970235
python	java	python	ruby
java has the scriptinging framework in java 6 which would permit you via the web to submit a scripting in numerous different languages off the top of my head plugins are available for ruby python javascripting

1970242
innodb	myisam
myisam is fast but may get corrupt easily innodb is slow but is more stable thanks to transactional and foreign key

1970249
user-input	output
al.so whiptail 1 writes the user-input of the input box to the standards-error streaming .so again you can t use its standards output streaming to set a variables

1970254
stderr	stdout
this is probably because whiptail uses stdin and stdout to printing the input box .so you cannot redirect stderr directly to stdout but you need to swap them e.g

1970256
innodb	myisam
taken from mysql - innodb vs myisam

1970258
innodb	myisam
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1970268
revision	updates
or you can updates your existing checkout to an older revision

1970282
attributes	properties
if i recall correctly asp.net allows you to add undefined attributes to controls which will be available in the control s attributes properties

1970312
put	get
.so that means show gets one the recording to show index will get all a .post will create new put will edit and delete will destroy

1970326

1970331
fiddler	charles
http proxy like fiddler httpwatch or charles are other alternatives

1970337
nonetype	iterable
that s the cause for nonetype object is not iterable because you re trying to iterate over it with for x in all_mods

1970340
double	int
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive-types int double and .so on

1970341
google-apps	gmail

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
is it possible in safari google-chrome firefox with firebug or anything else to break at the points any request is made

1970359
exception-handling	try-catch
as a general guide .when you are looking to gradually fix this don t wrap your proxy s with a using statement i ve seen a lot of people do this i was doing it until i read an article by idesign that doing this might cause the dispose to throw an exception-handling and mask a real exception-handling explicit close your proxy in try-catch if close causes an exception-handling use abort for resource clean up

1970365
put	get
.when i put in import statements such as from entries.model import entry i get the model from these apps ignore by syncdb because the import are circular or .when i remove one or both of them i get validation errors

1970370
ref	out
you can of course pass the struct using ref out - in which case no copying will occur - a reference to the struct will be passed to the methods

1970386
instances	private
in ruby you can not you can only access private methods for your instances of object and not for any other object instances of class a

1970405
python	java	python	c++
i don t think this kind of distinction of class vs object private exists for the most common languages oo such as c# c++ python java objective-c .

1970406
background-color	display
in one important place it has a grid that display a named column and several checkbox and both the background-color and the text color of the named column can be customized for each individual recording

1970420
innodb	myisam
people say innodb is not .so fast like myisam

1970446
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen in firefox nor google-chrome

1970459
command-line	cmd
here is a little background i m comfortable with command-line and my team is pretty new to it but can follow use cmd

1970469
value	field
and you can defined a value generator for a field properties

1970470
windows	winpe
by doing this the dialog is not dependent on any other windows files and can be run in winpe 2.0

1970475
required	checked
i don t like that your function returns the collections size to emulate one past the end. it required the caller to know the collections size inorder to checked whether the function succeeded

1970476
youtube	flickr	youtube	vimeo	flickr	vimeo
the match methods looks if there are any substring that match the list of providers youtube flickr vimeo etc

1970480
rhino-mocks	nunit
it uses rhino-mocks and nunit

1970487
value	field
i ve had a numbers of time where a systemd has asked me to enter some numbers i enter zero and i get an error messages telling me that i must enter a value in this field

1970489
textbox	button
.when i click on the button i want a labels to be updates with the textbox value and it s href points to whatever i have attached to the file types

1970535
innodb	myisam
for example - selected count queries are cheap .when run on a myisam table but can be really slow .when run on an innodb table

1970535
innodb	myisam
also a lot of people don t configure their installation for innodb performance - especially if they re used to myisam which performs pretty well on a rather default mysql installation

1970535
innodb	myisam
my advice would be to run your own tests by taking a couple of top queries and running them against myisam tables and then innodb versioning

1970588
hide	show	loading	gif
after the image is loaded you hide the loading gif and show the image itself

1970598
multiplication	addition
in addition to the other suggestions you might try using int multiplication as part of the hash-function for example

1970605
attributes	properties
if your goal is to simply have extra information of why the form is closing you can simply store it inside the form object as a public attributes or properties to access it later assuming said form wasn t dispose

1970624
attributes	properties
if that s too crude you can write a uitypeeditor .so only the allowed dock styles can be selected and apply it to the overrides dock properties with the editor attributes

1970629
profiling	debugging
the one project that meets all your requirements with the exception-handling of profiling is the excellent django debugging toolbar

1970655
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms	authentication	login
i am new to asp.net-mvc and have used traditional asp.net webforms but don t know how building a login authentication mechanism for a user using asp.net-mvc

1970663
delphi	c++
every delphi 7 developer knows that if he compile a application on delphi 7 the styles will be as windows 2000 applications but there is any methods to make this better as the application can have the default themes of the windows versioning as c++ and c# applications

1970665
any	set
then the scripting can only be run by root or any account that has the special grouping in the grouping set after supplying the account passwd at the start

1970668
controllers	routes
the question i have is that .when i create my configuration view i lose my posted value .when the form is submitted because it routes back to the above index controllers

1970694
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
consider using a sorteddictionary or a sortedlist instead if you need an order map

1970713
put	get
i at first thought it was a package issue .so put the three classes in a package but i didn t know enough about package to get it working

1970728
arrays	loops
you could loops over the elements of your arrays testing for each one if its aid is 4

1970735
arrays	loops
first you need to allocate arrays of pointers like then allocate each row with a separate call to malloc probably in loops

1970741
put	get
if you can t change the j.son i would put the object into an as.sociativity arrays using there aid as the key .so you can directly get to the object as needed

1970748
arrays	loops
the first step is to allocate a single arrays then loops through it allocation arrayss for each column as you go

1970754
culture	locale
culture called a locale for

1970755
getter	setter
the hydration process is the process of converting a plain boring mysql result set into nice object having getter and setter

1970764
subtraction	addition
this gets complicated though especially if you want to start overloading operators to support year addition and subtraction

1970796
automake	gnu
i am using gnu autoconf automake

1970796
command-line	cmd
for example suppress mv and cp cmd being printinged out to the screens only printing the named of the file being compiled by gcc rather than the whole command-line highlight gcc warnings in some way

1970801
innodb	myisam
for instances innodb can do row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking

1970823
contains	any
.so data will contains any data that was returned from the request if you re declaring your content-type as text j.son or application j.son - i don t remember off the top of my head and

1970832
debian	linux
i am working with an atmel at91sam9263-ek development board arm926ej-s core armv5 instruction set running debian linux 2.6.28-4

1970832
freebsd	linux
yes i realize that freebsd is not exactly the same as linux but my points is that it doesn t hurt to be carefully sure

1970833
spring	guice
you ll find that frameworks like spring and guice encourage programming to an interface

1970858
forms-authentication	credentials
yes the asp.net membership controls are not very configurable .so you would have to implements your own easy to do and use the membership object to handle validation users and forms-authentication to handle other forms related tasks such as logging out saving the user s credentials in a ticket etc

1970866
put	get
on the other hand there s a possibility the tcl isn t the problem at all - if you can get at the tcl source put after 1000000 or the like after the tool call

1970866
telnet	ssh
if there s no good way to edit the vendor tcl then perhaps you can use tcl on a slow remote machine and call the application itself on the fast machine using ssh or telnet

1970880
value	field
before the new longer string will cause me to have to change the database to hold longer value in the field

1970891
touch	drag
i have the touch and drag scrolling working great but i m having trouble with the flick gestures

1970903
youtube	vimeo
i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to only allow embed codes like ones from youtube vimeo blip.tv etc

1970904
double	int
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive-types int double and .so on

1970917
keydown	keyup
and this actually works of course in my code i also do a keyup after the keydown .

1970931
keyboard	mouse	progress-bar	progress
in this case you need to put the ui-thread into a busy wait loops where it call application.doevents to keep messages handling running .so the progress-bar will work but you need to add a messagesfiltering that only allows your application to respond to safe events it would allow paint events .so your application windows continue to redraw but it would filtering out mouse and keyboard messagess .so that the user can t actually do anything in the proigram while the export is in progress

1970931
progress-bar	progress
the solution is to set the progress to 100 then to 99 and then back to 100 - .when the progress-bar is told to move forwarding it animates slowly towards the target value

1970950
click	mouse
on a mouse click it execute a function called window.tgs

1970983
redmine	trac
while requisite pro enforces a standards and that can certainly help you in your task i d certainly second mark on trying to standardsize the input by agreement with personnel and using a more flexible tool like trac redmine which both have incredibly fast deploy and setup time especially if you hosts them from a viewmodel or even a custom one if you can get the management to endorse your project

1970986
perl	lua	perl	ruby	python	lua	python	ruby	python	perl
this means you could write plugins in lua python perl probably ruby and many other languages that support c-style interfaces

1970995
progress-bar	progress
you could always just implements the progress-bar and have no relationship to anything of actual progress

1971001
checkbox	textbox
also it is better to defined an arrays of checkbox and textbox instead of func1 func2 func3 func4

1971005
hide	show
after viewing the adobe slideshow i think the way i would attempt to get that to work using the android java sdk would be to create a listview object with a transparency background and then dynamically hide show it in that positioning .when the menu button is click by setting the view s visibility to visible or gone

1971016
contains	set
i would have also set up an event handler on collectionschanged for that selection collections that loops through the audioobjects in each tracking control and sets their visuals depending on whether or not they are contains in the selection collections

1971043
contains	set
yes json allows for nested object and each object could contains one set of results

1971084
put	get
if you put in x then you should get y i don t see any issue there

1971107
updating	updates
.so it shouldn t be a problem if you use the same updates methods for updating the whole model or just a few attributes

1971119
ready	live
i m about ready to unveil a coming soon page and one thing i need is a way for users to enter their email-address for me to email once the site goes live

1971136
progress-bar	progress
the simplest possible way to report progress of a long-running methods is to run the methods on the ui-thread and have it report progress by updating the progress-bar and then calling application.doevents

click	mouse
if the user can click anywhere with a mouse and cause some updates to be made to some object that your long-running methods ever looks at you ll have problems

1971138
python	perl
c perl or python

1971151
attributes	properties
in my opinion themes are a failure for exactly the reasons you are describing - properties don t cover a wide enough range of dom attributes to be more than marginally useful in specifying custom rendering for web-controls

1971156
autotools	gnu
john calcote also explains the purpose of aclocal and aclocal.m4 in the first chapter of his book about autotools chapter 1 a brief introduction to the gnu autotools

1971156
utility	gnu	utility	manual
the aclocal utility is actually documented by the gnu manual as a temporary work-around for a certain lack of flexibility in autoconf

1971168
environment	building
i m unfortunately with no building environment .so it s from memory but i hope it helps

1971169
contains	set
another such set of macros deals with the intricacies of the ibm informix esql c compilation systemd as it has evolved over the last two decades it handles esql c 5.20 where versioning 5.00 was release in 1990 and it also handles the latest versioninging of ibm informix clientsdk 3.50 - which much to my chagrin contains esql c 3.50 even though it was release in 2008

1971175
32-bit	64bit
if you are running on a 64bit os try starting mmc as a 32-bit process mmc 32 iirc and see if your snap-in isn t available there

1971214
communication	messages
this might be because the messages is an unsecured fault or because there is a binding mismatch between the communication parties

1971236
value	field
dereference the variables pointers then returns the value of member field

1971257
hide	show
then .when you want to hide flowlayoutpanel1 you can just toggle the visible properties to hide show it

1971279
apache-config	.htaccess
then checked your apache-config - is .htaccess allowed in the particular virtualhost and or directory

1971280
swing	awt
awt swing

1971303
dependency-injection	inject
this also allows for easy dependency-injection as the impls simply reside on the classpath then something like a proxy or spring can inject the implementation

1971338
apache-config	httpd.conf
if you use apache as a front end of the svn server you could try to redirect the url in the apache-config httpd.conf

1971339
for-loop	loops
but the value of hole just before the for-loop was already 1 then you can slip this initilization part of loops

1971356
django-haystack	whoosh
i m trying to setup django-haystack with whoosh backend

1971358
arrays	loops
if you have an irregular 2d arrays some rows have different lengths then you ll have to either keep tracking of the total numbers of chars somewhere else or loops through and count how many chars you have before you do the cudamalloc

1971359
mstest	nunit
i am new to tdd and i know that both have their pro s and con s however i want to know from a simplicity points of view which would be easier mstest or nunit

1971371
mbunit	nunit
i d switching to nunit or personally mbunit later on

1971400
double	int
were num_elements 2 ist an int and kappa is a double but contains only int numbers for example 79

1971405
ubuntu	debian
this complements the answer recommending a virtual to-pdf printer in that it s the more linuxy command-line solution all of the tools mentioned are available in debian s and ubuntu s package repository

1971418
any	set
one of publication in your own local repo you can setup as many branches as you want not one for every file modification of course but one for any new task or set of tasks you need to develop

1971427
while-loop	arrays
before i come into the while-loop i want to create the arrays data and initializer the data 0 pointers with dummy value as i do not want to use the 0 pointers value

1971433
web-services	api
given your requirements and since you re using c# the exchange web-services managed api is probably your best option

1971454
managed-code	unmanaged
and the midl compler is pretty hard to work with you would probably end up having to write another unmanaged to do the interop between managed-code and your target dll

1971456
radio-button	selected
i am trying to selected a radio-button based on an asp variables

1971456
value	field
this variables directly correlates to the value field of the radio-button

1971467
any	set
my resources pick up the right language from the current thread which i set before trying to display any resource

1971484
nsuinteger	nsarray
nsarray â s -count methods returns an nsuinteger which is unsigned .so subtract from the count will not result in a negative value

1971491
required	checked
my question it would seem that for me to do this i am required to put a call at the top of each restrict php page which checked the credentials and redirects if they are missing or insufficient...is this a sound approach

1971523
primitive	int
lower-case int is a primitive and does not inherited from object

1971525
uicontrol	uilabel
you say your uicontrol has three labels do you mean you are adding three uilabel s as subviews of the uicontrol

1971532
groovy	java
if your pojo really is a java class and not a groovy class then that is your problem

1971532
groovy	java
in short even groovy can t overrides java methods call it can only overrides call from groovy or that otherwise dispatcher through invokemethods

1971539
build-process	build-system
if the source to be compiled supports the gnu build-system it should be as easy as typing instead of . configure but all types of problems can occur that the build-system tries to run compiled code during the build-process which is not possible since you are building arm code on a x86 i assume machine

1971570
value	field
once you get your query results create an enumerator that returns a column named and a field value for each iterator

1971589
cvs	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git
- has a numbers of visual clients or rather a numbers of solutions for integration svn and git hg bazaar cvs even...

1971596
javascript	dom
you could do this dynamically on page load using javascript dom

1971599
value	field
you could always pull the value of your other field from the context map and perform your validation on multiple field

1971601
controllers	routes
i have created an asp.net-mvc application that dynamically routes actions and controllers based on user data .so that there are no standards actions but dynamically named actions

1971605
subclassing	superclass
if you want a per-subclassing counter then declare a map in the superclass with key subclassing s class and value the counter value as suggested by

1971612
bmp	png
one easy way to get a hash sum of just the pixels data would be to convert the jpeg into a 32-bit bmp or alternatively into png and to calculate a hashsum from that

1971627
contains	elements
in ie i get an error saying that an xml document can only contains one toplevel elements

1971635
mapping	unique
part of a link mapping key could technically change also it is best to have a surrogate key instead of composite key since you can unique identify a recording by a primary key instead of composite columns

1971651
textbox	onblur
i d prefer javascript validation methods associated with the onblur event for that textbox

1971655
selected	button
selected the default button

1971671
contains	set
the recursive query will return all available seat sequences in a set that contains the starting seat numbers and the length of the sequnce

1971674
32-bit	64bit
another idea is to use 64bit int casting them to 32-bit .when needed

1971677
contains	set
i.e. the directory .app controllerss admin holds a set of files each contains a controllers for handling a separate portion of the admin section

1971681
asp.net-mvc	wcf
without dependencies on any particular technologies such as asp.net-mvc wpf wcf ef nhibernate or whatnot

1971696
16-bit	8bit
an important thing to understand is that at the time 16-bit 8086 machines was just coming out to replace the current 8bit machines where the cp m operating systemd was the windows of the day

1971722
python	php
if you have the function value stored in columns already then it should be possible to do this by building up the appropriate sql query in python but should be easily convertible to php

1971742
contains	elements
...which will selected only those fieldset s contains a legend elements that in turn contains the character sequences grouping

1971796
subtyping	generics
.when genericss were added to java the designers knew better and in generics-collectionss a collections of is not a subtyping of a collections of object .so if in your example you switching from arrays to generics arraylist s say neither of the line will compile

1971799
javascript	dom	contains	set
an easy way to achieve this is to make the styles that collapse your list and its contains div dependent on a class higher up in the dom hierarchy and set that class at load-time using javascript

1971814
subtract	add
i don t know how to add subtract 1 hour in oracle dateadd hh... does it in sybase

1971817
contains	any	contains	elements
one option might be to checked if system.windows.forms.application.openforms contains any elements

1971825
attributes	properties
this attributes appears to have an order properties

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox as the main testing platform and google-chrome for mac as the secondary

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
just to be clear google-chrome is showing the textarea 20px down as compared to firefox

1971840
contains	any
if any of your code contains gpl licensed code your entire source code must be release under the gpl

1971848
executable-jar	jar
i use jdic in my executable-jar file .when it runs it needs to have ieembed.exe and mozembed.exe in the same dir as the jar file i wonder if there is a way to package all 3 files into a single executable-jar file .so .when i distribute the .app there is only one executable-jar file to worry about besides there are problems sending and downloading .exe files what s the .solution

1971848
executable-jar	jar
for instances my executable-jar file is called java_app.jar how to get 1 ieembed.exe 2 mozembed.exe and 3 java_app.jar into a jar file called my_app.jar and .when user double click on my_app.jar it will run the java_app.jar and find the needed ieembed.exe and mozembed.exe files from inside the my_app.jar package without unpack and save them into a local dir

1971854
interface-builder	iboutlet
to get the annoying obvious response out of the way are you sure you ve connect that iboutlet in interface-builder

1971872
sql-server	oracle
in sql-server i think it s called the data and procedure caching and in oracle it s called the buffering caching and the sga

1971878
callback	methods	buffering	streaming
streaming extends marshalbyrefobject .so if you include a reference to an open streaming eg points at the file data or buffering you want to send in an object that s sent to the client the client will callback to the server .when you call methods on the streaming proxy

1971884
malloc	free
later .when the pointers from malloc is passed to free a corresponding diagnostic versioning of free is called

1971884
malloc	free
diagnostic wrapper functions for malloc can also address other misuses of malloc such as multiple call to free for same memory block

1971884
realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	realloc	malloc	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	calloc	malloc
.when wrapping the malloc api one must wrap all of the related functions including calloc realloc and strdup

1971884
parentheses	macros	malloc	free
if the need arises to code a call to the standards implementation for example the allocated block will be passed to a third-party binary-only libs which expects to free the block using the standards free implementation the original function namedd can be accessed rather than the preprocessor macros by using malloc s -- that is place parentheses around the function named

1971912
environment	building
i need to execute some ant cmd depending on an environment variables passed in as a parameter to the maven building cmd

1971941
duplicates	lookup
another option is to also store say bytes 9000 through 9020 and use that as a third conditional .when looking up a duplicates copy or alternatively to compare byte-to-byte .when the aforementioned lookup methods returns possible duplicatess in a last attempt to discard false positives

1971941
rar	zip
edit i forgot to mention that the files are generally going to be compressed archive zip rar and on occasion jpg images

1971950
click	mouse
what i am currently stuck on is .when a user click to change the mouse positioning how can i get the index in the string of the new positioning

1971957
compact-framework	.net
iâ m trying to use a webservice in a .net compact-framework 3.5 project which has no wsdl and where i have to use httpwebrequest

1971983
.when	ready
.when the feature is ready to enter the mainline of development eric can simply merge the wysiwyg branch into master

1971983
.when	ready
.when it is time to release 1.3 eric should make sure that the accumulate fixed in 1.2-stable branch and ready feature branches have all been merged into master

1971986
joomla	drupal
im developing well im still in planning phase a web-app where i would give to other developer the possibility to write theyr own plugins modules in the way of cms does drupal joomla etc

1971986
postgresql	mysql
im running on postgresql but i suppose the problem is the same on mysql

1971993
webforms	asp.net
is there any way to checked what events have fired during the asp.net webforms page control lifecycle

1971998
click	mouse
you re using events to handle all the form actions mouse button click etc already .so you should have a basic idea of how it works and there are lots of articles on the .net about c# events and c# event handling there are .some search terms for you that will give you more info .so i won t go into detail here

1972004
constructor	object
i would cautious of calling a delegation inside a constructor for the same reason that virtual should be treated with caution - in a deep object-model the entire class may not be fully created at the points your mid-level constructor that invokes the delegation or overrides methods fires providing dodgy access to an object in an incomplete state

1972015
32-bit	64bit
i also looked in the windows syswow64 folder the 64bit equivalent to windows system32 folder on a 32-bit machine

1972017
svnkit	svn
svnkit implementation of svn in java

1972021
constructor	object
the constructor is what creates the object

1972021
this-pointer	construct
now it may work and yes you can get the this-pointer but calling code would expect it to be fully construct

1972037
getter	setter
workaround renamed outlet variables named or renamed setter getter methods to be different from kvc notation.

1972039
subclassing	superclass
a subclassing needs to know .when particular events occur withing its superclass but there are more than one ways for the superclass to break the news

1972043
contains	elements
your signature of taking an arrays with a given length might give the illusion that the parameter is guaranteed by the compiler to contains at least idx elements

1972043
for-loop	loops
i would probably give loops index in the second for-loop a more desciptive named like marblesremaining .so it s clearer what it is and does not need to be explained by comments

1972049
any	set
i ve set the project properties to the correct versioning of python although it doesn t seem to make any difference what it is set to

1972057
versioning	upgrade
a team responsible for a project that has a reference to the libs can decide on both the versioning that they are going to code against and the timing of any upgrade

1972067
mstest	nunit
i ve actually never used mstest myself since i started learning tdd with nunit right away

1972079
derived-class	pure-virtual
call a pure-virtual function called dispatcher that will match the right path to the right function in the derived-class

1972131
.war	jar
you are not really providing enough details do you bundle jax-ws or any other jar in the .war that could conflict with weblogic s one

1972138
constructor	object
this methods is a constructor -- it gets called .when you create a new namesurferentry object and pass a string

1972160
python	java
python support in netbeans is not yet perfect and does not come anywhere near to java netbeans peformance and support

1972203
push	pull
you can then checked server side if there are some new notifications and if there are then you ll push it even though it s a pull - to the client and kill the scripting

1972207
mersenne-twister	generator
or use a pseudo-random numbers generator algorithm known to work well such as the mersenne-twister

1972215
rhino-mocks	moq
preface i m not familiar with using moq rhino-mocks user here .so i may miss a few tricks

1972243
gnome	kde
you need to have they install but if you re on linux using kde qt is natively install for default the same for gnome and also the same of cocoa on mac and cocoa-touch on iphone and ipod touch

1972252
if-statement	loops
i would like a function that execute in constants time with no if-statement or loops .so .something like the java random.nextint n function is out

1972257
meta-inf	jar
regarding your meta information question sometimes you get some environment information .when you unpack the jar and have a look at meta-inf manifest.mf file

1972258
coalesce	isnull
if you want to return non-null data use a null translation function like isnull or coalesce

1972284
optional-parameters	named
but in my real code i actually have a bunch of optional-parameters in addition to a few required ones and i d like to put the optional ones in the params hash .so that i can easily only specify by named the few that i want rather than having to list them all inorder and potentially having to list ones i don t actually want

1972288
pkg-config	freeglut	pkg-config	nix
as long as your dependencies use pkg-config which most nix programs do unsure about freeglut then it is simple to use the pkg_check_modules macros in autoconf to give friendly error messages and get the correct command-line arguments for the libs

1972289
clearance	devise
i suggest clearance or devise if you haven t

1972290
istream	ostream	instance-variables	local-variables
are istream and ostream instance-variables or local-variables

1972294
autotools	gnu	autotools	automake	automake	gnu	toolchain	gnu	toolchain	automake	toolchain	autotools
it s a bit of a steep learning curve but the most common solution for all of these problems is to use the gnu autotools toolchain autoconf and automake specifically

1972294
toolchain	automake
the wikipedia article provides a bit of an overview and the automake manual provides a tutorial introducing the toolchain

1972294
autotools	gnu
while the gnu autotools systemd is very complete and supports a lot of platform it is a bit baroque

1972294
scons	cmake	autotools	scons	autotools	cmake
there are some alternative building systemd that support some similar auto-configuration behavior like cmake and scons that might be worth looking into if autotools feels like too much

1972296
contains	any
youâ ll end up with options being a hash contains the passed in value with the options from your default hash as any that werenâ t provided

1972301
contains	elements
now to answer your question in a simplified way you ll have to start with the porttype elements that contains

1972303
contains	elements
perhaps its one of the contains elements a rules on a parent div or table td or who knows

1972303
firefox	gecko
gecko browsers firefox

1972303
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers google-chrome safari

1972315
sqrt	sin	sqrt	cos	cos	sin
if anyone can break this down into something i can understand with basic operators + - and functions sin cos sqrt etc. i d really appreciate it

1972317
double	int
the int local is convertible to a double the literals is convertible to a double and obviously they will never be equals

1972318
vba	vb6
vba thus vb6 doesn t have a garbage collector per se but it does use reference count to automatically clean up after itself

1972318
execute	declare
if your vba class object is local in scoping declare in a procedure then you really don t need to do anything to make sure the destructor runs it will automatically execute .when the procedure ends

1972318
instances	destroy
if it is a module level variables in a vba class module then .when the instances of the vba class is destroy all it s module level variabless will be destroy and the destructor will run

1972329
packets	ping
the ping packets could be trying that

1972329
packets	ping
one thing i noticed on gtalk was that often a user appears online even after they have disconnect until someone send them a ping packets

1972334
in-place	heapsort
sort all sets using heapsort for in-place sorting o 1 spaces

1972339
dialog	pop-up
i ll assume by dialog you mean a pop-up that is invisible at page load and made visible by say a click on something in the existing html

1972339
hide	show
lastly you can play with the visibility of your pop-up div with the display none styles and the show and hide methods on the widget

1972342
contains	sorted
once you have that sorted turn your attention to the page s code-behind file which contains a ton of event wire-up code that is probably needed to get the control working

1972357
sql-server	oracle
is there a function or a workaround in sql-server 2005 that is equivalent to the new_time function in oracle

1972366
perl	php
i m guessing that you re new to javascript and your previous language was either php or perl and .so you think what you re using is an as.sociativity arrays

1972366
perl	php
javascript-objects on the other hand are similar to an associativity arrays in php or a hash in perl

1972371
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	bugzilla	trac	bugzilla	redmine	bugzilla	mantis	mantis	trac
possible options that i ve heard of .so far are bugzilla mantis redmine and trac

1972384
value	field
the section merely spells out the syntax that struct s follow value semantics that they are implicit sealed and inherited from system.valuetypes that assignment to a variables of struct types creates a copy that passing a struct as a parameter by value creates a copy how struct s are set to default value all value-types field in the struct are set to their default value and all reference-types field are set to null the rules surrounding boxing and unboxing of struct the meaning of this for struct s and how field initialization constructor destructor and static constructor work for struct s

1972386
sql-server	oracle
no there is not equivalent functionality to oracle s new_time function in sql-server 2005

1972388
python	ruby
in python if i want to give out an application without sources i can compile it into bytecode .pyc is there a way to do something like it in ruby

1972460
malloc	free
thus a reviewer can glance at the code to make sure that each malloc has a matching free

1972475
void	main
int main void

1972490
ostream	std	istream	ostream	istream	std
std istream and std ostream respectively

1972501
malloc	free
the simple advantage is this if the programmer un-intentionally introduced a memory leak the warning is there as the adage in c is this for every malloc there should be a corresponding free if you do not have it then you have a leak

1972504
for-loop	arrays
most will prefer the for-loop because that is the familiar way of doing something to every item in arrays in sequences

1972513
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
i wrote a much more detailed answer to this question in the question can ruby php or perl create a precompile file for the code like python

1972526
getter	setter
the third option is also considered bad practice since you should not provide getter setter for all of your field only the ones that need it

1972530
selected	button
for example given radio button r1 and r2 you might have logic like this to ensure one of them is selected

1972530
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
as another example you may have an other types of button with an associated if you selected other please explain textbox

1972530
selected	textbox
you could checked if the other radio is selected then checked the textbox etc

1972535
short	zero
should you need to specify also filenameds to be created you can create them with zero size in advance from python using unicode filenameds and pass the short named of the file as an arguments

1972560
google-chrome	firefox
i have exactly the same problem as you do except i m using ie7 ie takes about 16 seconds to load localhost while firefox and google-chrome loads it in an instant

1972572
versioning	upgrade
all iphones and ipod touches can upgrade the firmware as new versioning become available

1972575
any	set
by default easymock will throw an exception-handling for any methods that are called that you didn t explicit set expectations for

1972613
perl	ruby
this works similar to the split function in perl or ruby

1972630
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1972630
ironpython	ironruby
however we rarely pin ironruby up against ironpython

1972640
json	xml
the ideal xml json design would be

1972644
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
the text editor with sharpdevelop and monodevelop may be useful

1972722
c++	lua
however in the project i m writing in c++ i m also using lua

1972742
python	lua	scheme	lua
i use scripting languages like lua python or scheme to provide an interface for the user to extends the software

1972748
boost	stl
read sources of boost and stl try to copy and modify some of the code from them that is a good way

1972792
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
edit0 make textbox receive focus right after listbox item gets selected

1972797
windows-vista	windows
in windows-vista the application cannot locate the mqrt.dll which is found at c windows winsxs cd x86_microsoft-windows-msmq-runtime-core_31bf3856ad364e35_6

1972798
contains	set
similarly you can set an nsnumber num contains a double value by

1972803
16-bit	x86
i will take both x86 assembly 16-bit and c code though as that is pretty easy to convert

1972810
superclass	inherited	class-variables	superclass
as you have probably already figured out objective-c doesn t really have class-variables that you can inherited from a superclass

1972818
subtract	add	subtract	time	multiplying	subtract
.so you loops down the digits and every time you multiplying the value .so far by 10 subtract 0 from the current character and add it

1972819
environment	building
as it seems you re missing a sane building environment for buildinging native extensions

1972819
environment	building
.so if you do not have a c-compiler like gcc and the whole building environment including make autoconf and the whole bla install you won t be able to building those native extensions

1972873
json	xml
after that i generally convert the resulting xml document tree or a sub tree to json for easy access in javascript

1972881
output	mode
use msvcrt.setmode 1 os.o_binary after you write the headers and sys.stdout.flush them to set standards output to binary mode -- poor apache is innocent it s a windows thing

1972891
file-format	corrupt
the file-format is not disclosed and even if you d manage to somehow make updates in it the integrity checked would at best cause the modified tables to be marked as corrupt at worse place the entire database offline

1972934
contains	elements
right now i m getting the entire contains elements as a string and using a regex to parsing the string for the tag

1972941
click	mouse
is there javascript grid component where in readonly mode i would be able to selected somehow several rows shift or ctrl with mouse click and tracking process selecteded rows

1972942
sftp	ssh
the idea is to sftp the files to a temporary directory then once that s done have the same client execute via ssh a scripting to mv the files over to the directory the crontab is looking at

1974643
value	field	base-class	inherited	getter	setter
all your transactional classes inherited from the transactionalentity and should operate over some sort of dependency-properties field properties getter setter which store it s value not in local-class field but in dictionary which is stored in the base-class

1974643
contains	set
transactionalcontext class internally contains a set of dictionary one dictionary for each entity that participates in the transactional and .when a transactionalal entity participates in transactional it writes all data to the dictionary in the transactional context

1974647
pointers	stack
the issue of passing the table pointers is a bit more delicate - even though lua allows to retrieve the pointers off the lua stack using lua_topointers there is no way of putting that back

1974659
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
as you can see i have a case-insensitive field called recordtype and it s copy-paste to a case-sensitive field frecordtype which does not tokenize the text

1974717
constructor	object
in this case i think you only want to set the object once in the constructor and never change it .so no problem

1974735
gethashcode	equals
object-identity doesn t work properly unless you abuse equals gethashcode

1974735
any	set
now although the class in itself does not have any persistent-framework-specific attributes or base classes etc. to me it is not really persistent ignorant because it must follow a set of design guidelines to facilitate use by the chosen persistent framework

1974735
entity	poco
where i m having trouble with the definition of persistent ignorance poco is that i don t see how conceptually this is really any different to adding attributes such as or or or any other persistent-framework-specific annotations that facilitate the persistent and retrieval of the entity using that framework

1974735
gethashcode	equals
clearly the definition of it as being able to persistent ordinary classes is a fallacy because the nhibernate ones are only ordinary insofar as not referencing framework-specific classes whereas they are extraordinary inasmuch as they required unusual design choices such as default constructor and all-virtual members and equals gethashcode implementation on mutable types

if you need your code to see it there are numerous solutions popen being the simplest giving your code access to stdout and open3 giving your code access to both stdout and stderr

1974841
derived-class	base-class
i have two classes a base-class foo base and a derived-class foo base sub

.so you should remove the listener from the mxml on creationcomplete of your .app use as to add the event-listener then whatever you do to cause your state to switching can fire an as function to remove it

1975126
callback	methods
i don t know anything about erlang but if you can write a collections class and put function methods callback into it it should be trivial to ports the event systemd over

1975131
callback	methods
i think you can specify jsonp with your methods by adding callback

1975156
selected	checkbox
however i only get ids to be filled with something if i selected the top checkbox in the header

thus the user should be able to selected object with a checkbox and after selecteded an action with the dropdown the selecteded action is conducted on all selecteded object

1975184
maxima	maple	maxima	sage	maple	sage
if you want to do very precise arithmetic as opposed to writing c++ code to do very precise arithmetic you should look at mathematica maple and their open-source competition such as maxima sage and probably others

1975218
httpexception	httpcontext
httpexception 0x80004005 path delete is forbidden. system.web.httpmethodnotallowedhandler.processrequest httpcontext context +80 system.web.callhandlerexecutionstep.system.web.httpapplication+iexecutionstep.execute +179 system.web.httpapplication.executestep iexecutionstep step boolean completedsynchronously

but you can use native winapi from c++ or c# extensibility package to set a global mouse hook - this will give you ability to intercept mouse click

1975316
python	java
there s this for java but i d prefer a python solution

1975325
overwrite	preserve
i don t want to overwrite the key numbers with new value as the code works - eval preserve this already .so my new code should do the same

1975328
base	zero
in javascript a token starting with zero is an int literals in base 8

1975331
lighttpd	apache
i know that i need an httpserver such as apache or lighttpd

1975332
constructor	object
typically you would have the parsing passed in via the constructor and create your object using the inversion-of-control containers this would then inject a parsing instances into the constructor for you

1975336
duplicates	sorted
note as mentioned by the poster above you can always generator the list in sorted order to avoid generator duplicates

1975344
revision	utility	revision	svn
the svn diff utility just needs two revision which could be got from svn log or could be stored via some other mechanism

1975346
decimal	octal
the reason you re getting the error is that javascript treats numbers that begin with 0 as octal numbers which cannot have decimal

1975358

google-chrome	browser-tab
i am thinking something along the line of google-chrome which appears to be running each browser-tab in a separate process while display all output in a single windows

1975444
arrays	map
also you can refactor the implementation to use a map internally or an arrays or whatever and see what is the fastest uses the least memory without having to change your api

1975449
lighttpd	apache
.when the request arrives at ports 80 it is collected by your httpserver which is probably apache but might be lighttpd or any other httpserver

1975449
lighttpd	apache
cgi containers do the same job in a slighly different way the reason you might choose one over the other is likely to be related to what httpserver you are using mod_python is designed for apache for example something like fastcgi is used more with lighttpd and to performance considerations

1975454
mongodb	couchdb
i m considering using mongodb or couchdb on a project that needs to maintain historical recording

1975461

you d have to setup some field in a database for those value and then on the page load set those value on the page load

1975494
uitextview	nsstring
that means that i m translating a const char i think - at least i ve been casting it as such into an nsstring before i use it in uitextview s -settext

1975495
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
i ve read many articles and really like the idea of separating our project into a data-access-layer dal business-logic-layer bll and presentation layer we re coming from classic asp .so this is a massive step for us

1975508
extends	super
in the constructor of your class that extends dialog call super context r.style.customdialog

1975511
fflush	gets	fflush	stdout
i fflush stdout .so the web browser gets the whole page

i fork twice to make sure that the webserver will be able to exit even if the process i m trying to spawn is still running

1975525
dependency-injection	inject
i don t know if the objectfactory will initializer and inject your validation .so you might not have all the features of dependency-injection

1975528
decrement	increment
the desired behavior is that .when the user click the up down button the ordinalposition is increment decrement .so that they can specify what order the sections appear in

1975541
pixels	line
.so even if you have a million line collectively obscuring 50 of a pixels the resulting image value will show roughly 50 coverage

1975548
checkbox	textbox
each row contains a couple of textbox a dropdownlistfor and a checkbox which are all .net form controls rather than plain html controls i should points out

w3c s specifications

1975649
value	field
a structure has the benefit that you can access data by field named as opposed to having to remember an index value

1975653
traffic	packets
from there you could perform deep packets inspector to see where traffic is going what pages are visited etc

1975664
constructor	object
however the constructor for streamingwriter takes a streaming object as a parameter and the call to createobject fails

1975664
constructor	object
even if i could get a parameterless constructor to execute without error the basestreaming properties of the streamingwriter class is readonly .so i couldn t set it to my streaming after object creation

1975674
nested-loops	loops
nested-loops are good if the conditional inside loops is sargable that is index can be used to limit the numbers of recording

1975684
any	set
in any case even .when i set the classpath manually using

1975712
entity-framework	nhibernate
i have done some tests with entity-framework but also with nhibernate

1975712
entity-framework	nhibernate
but this really looks like entity-framework and perhaps if i am deeper in there i can use it or nhibernate

1975714
perl	awk	perl	ruby
i can use sed awk perl or ruby

1975715
textbox	button
now i want it edit it change the labels to textbox .when i click the edit button on the right of the page

1975717
any	set
in that code-snippets they didn t show the definition of it but it s just a constants int .so you can set it to any value you like

1975770
exception-handling	try-catch
try a different exception-handling inside the try-catch

1975779
derivative	splines
in the second case fit a splines to your data and ask the splines libs the derivative at the points you want

1975780
sql-server-express	sql-server
i ve got a sql-server-express 2008 install on my webserver which by default does not allow remote connections probably a good thing. i opted not to install sql-server management-studio-express along with it for disk spaces and other reasons

1975786
selected	checkbox
it would contains the value of the selected checkbox

1975792
value	field
i think â œmodeâ helps convey that this isn t to do with the value of the field or how the user is currently integration with it

1975810
any	set
also note that changes to this configuration will required a restart of the sql-server service and .when you set the ports to listen on the default is 1433 you will need to create rules in any firewall you may have running to allow the communication

1975817
sql-server	postgresql
i am working on making an application run on both postgresql and sql-server

1975836
filesystems	fileinfo
no fileinfo only works against things on the filesystems

1975843
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
the ibm jvm was able to do heap dump programatically on signals or on out-of-memory and the heaproot utility was very useful to tracking memory-leaks less intrusive than profiling

1975875
hash	md5
email hash are md5 signature computed from an email-address used to avoid exposing the user s plain email-address and still allow identity matching

1975929
nested-loops	arrays

1975932
development-environment	virtual-machine
do you run your development-environment in a virtual-machine

1975956
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
we ve built an asp.net-mvc application to replace our old asp.net webforms monster

updating	updates
i have a labels that is bound to a properties and updating nicely on screens and now i d like a small animation that flashes the background colour of the labels whenever the value is updates

1976035
margins	padding
it is inaccurate because height doesn t consider the margins padding of the .block

1976035
margins	padding
how do i subtract the padding margins either automatically or manually

1976070
selected	cell	selected	button
i want to visually change the css of the specific table cell a specific td .when the user changes the value of one of the radio button inside that td is selected

1976070
radio-button	selected
basically .when the form loads the n a radio-button is selected by default

1976070
radio-button	selected	highlight	selected
if any other radio-button is selected 1b 2b k etc... then that td should be highlight

1976084
arguments	undefined
also note that .when null or undefined is used as the this arguments with call or apply the this object will refer to the global object similar to the case #2 normals function invocation

1976087
selected	cell
i need to match the cell content of the first columns cell with a textbox.text first before selected the row

1976102
json	xml
if xml doesn t work here i d propose something less verbose like json

1976132
double	int
if it s a value-type like int double etc. setting the variables to nothing will set it to the default-value

1976138
buffering	streaming
if you have very large-files the whole file has to be held in the buffering and the servers memory will get used up quickly as a result if you don t chunks the file into various parts .when streaming

1976140
any	set
it is not guaranteed to properly set to zero any floating-point value it is not guaranteed to produce proper null-pointers

1976142
uiactivityindicatorview	viewdidload
in viewdidload i wrote the code for uiactivityindicatorview but the spinner started after loading of the image and it is not stopping

1976164
keyboard	mouse
you ll have to find out that mouse the computer uses what keyboard key layout hardware button etc

1976166
radio-button	selected
then to clear the selected backgrounds you would want to give write a function that .when the user click the n a radio-button does something like

1976177
selected	button
plus you should be able to set the debuggingger up .so that .when you click debugging it will only debugging the selecteded project selected the asp.net-mvc winform or silverlight before click the debugging button

1976187
callback	methods
in this case still start your spinner in viewdidload then deal with the nsurlconnection stuff and in the delegation callback methods that s called .when the data is finished being downloading hide the spinner since you ll be back in the main thread at that points i believe

1976189
conditional	parentheses
more generally you could put as the second arguments to the next built-in whatever you required in that case or omit the second arg and in that case you can remove one set of parentheses if you re ok with getting a stopiteration exception-handling .when no item satisfies the conditional you know that situation is impossible

1976190
while-loop	loops
also your code uses a while-loop with two line indented but the second line is not actually part of loops since it s not enclosed in braces

1976193
highlight	cell
table cell highlight

1976195
exception-handling	try-catch
what you need is a try-catch handler wrapped around the functionality in question inorder to catch the throw exception-handling and deal with it

1976200
value	field
my main purpose is to building .some kind of feature that enables single sign-on to .some pages .so i d need to know every time a page has completed loading to checked the html and set .some field value for example

1976212
.when	ready
plus even .when the source code has loaded completely it still doesn t mean the page is ready

1976215
put	get
.when i run this from the command-line i always get the same value for maxidleness which is to be expected curidle which should change and timeremaining which is always at the maximum value...understandable since i m execution from the command-line but i get the same result if i put it in a batch-file with sleep.exe in between or in a program that iterates with a sleep between each call to callntpowerinformation

1976218
protected	public
you cannot make a protected properties public

1976234
synchronous	.when
the kernel handles software interrupts either as part of hardware interrupt handling or synchronous .when a thread invokes kernel functions related to the software interrupt.

1976241
entity-framework	nhibernate
i would start at the bottom with a data-access-layer dal using the entity-framework or nhibernate

1976264
positioning	slider
implements the properties of this custom slider required both components to be rotated and also their relative positioning to be adjusted left right or top bottom which wouldn t be easy with a grid unless i miss something obvious while it is with a stackpanel

1976264
panels	grid
a solution is to replace stack panels by a grid in the code below but i don t want to use a grid because i need to use the orientation properties of stack panels to show both controls stack vertically .when the enclosing user-controls is set in the orientation vertical

1976295
restart	exit
since you restart the process yourself you could attach a handler to the process.exited event and restart the process after it exit

1976297
keyword	synonym
you could explicit declare keyword to be synonym everything else will be more or less guesswork

1976301
tcp-ip	tcp	tcp-ip	udp	udp	tcp	ethernet	packets
example would be the tcp-ip stack - copying packets out of the nic into the os buffering is done initiated from the hardware interrupt routine but protocols process ethernet - ip - udp tcp is deferred to a software interrupt

1976311
put	get
.when you put an existing entity after get ting it and changing something that primary key lets the db overwrite the existing entity rather than creating a new one

1976312
associations	model
see the associations join model section in the activerecord associations class methods api for more details

1976312
callback	methods
you could defined a descendants methods that returned children + grandchildren and iterate over that for example or you could implements the callback on the child and grandchild classes in which case you might want to pull it out in to a module for maximum dryness though for a one-line methods in only two classes that might be overkill

1976357
constructor	object
since we created this object with the model constructor put adds the new object to the datastore

1976381
postback	ajax
after an ajax postback all the structure field are setting to nothing

1976383
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie but won t rendering in google-chrome or firefox

1976384
ssl-certificate	ssl
i don t want to buy an ssl-certificate yet but still want to test ssl on my development server

1976389
swing	awt
if you look at the source you will see that there is a load of hardwired fudges for awt and swing beans

1976396
oracle	mysql
i m involved is a project to migrate a project from oracle to mysql

1976408
value	field
.so after you have added a new recording just load the data.source and bind the gridview to it and the datakey field will have the new value

1976415
groovy	java
any suggestions for groovy or java examples or opinions on the various libs mentioned on the twitter site for java

1976419
parser-generator	antlr
yes using parser-generator like antlr is the way to go imo

1976422
contains	any	contains	elements
is there any way to query for the list of families that contains the elements yyy

1976435
strstr	strlen
the problem turned out to be a loops in strstr which used strlen more or less as show above

1976436
firefox	opera
it works great for me in opera 10.10 chromium 4.0 firefox 3.6 and ie8

1976451
windows	ms-dos
operating systemd which internally use the cr linefeed pairâ such as ms-dos windows openvms in stream_crlinefeed mode etc.â are able to deal with linefeed-only

1976490
click	mouse
the problem is that if the user click in certain spots on the titlebar...the mouse is unlocked

1976490
click	mouse
the machines this is going on has a ball types of mouse .so if you scroll fast and click fast enough...it can al.so unlock

1976494
return-value	arguments
a brief comments saying what each function does its arguments and return-value is always good

1976495
dynamic-programming	branch-and-bound
typical solution techniques for ip problems are dynamic-programming or branch-and-bound

1976506
selected	cell
it iterates through cell of the datagris s first column and checked if cell content equals to the textbox.text value and selected the row

1976510
ellipse	pixels
i don t need pixels perfect accuracy just long enough to ellipse at roughly the right spot

1976516
any	set
since snow leopard cam with python 2.6.1 preinstalled .so i didn t do any extra set up

1976522
debugging	exit
similarly if you don t have real-time debugging tools you need to log or be able to turn on logging for key entry exit points

1976529
selected	cell	selected	checkbox
i need to add checkbox to every cell in the calendar .so that the user can selected multiple dates and the dates get stored in the database for later retrieval

associations	model
i ve actually found one related answer but i m not quite sure about what it says polymorphism associations with multiple associationss on the same model

1976560
updating	updates
updates i m not sure why but now instead of not doing any apparent updating it s not finding the properties at all

1976568
callback	methods
you can just join the threads and wait until they both finish or pass a callback methods

1976572
any	set
you could use any fonts available to your image editor rather than the limited set of fontss you can count on in a browser

1976577
packets	lan
.when you make an outgoing tcp connection your nat router puts the connection in a table .so that .when data comes in it knows what machine in your lan to send the packets to

1976592
udp	tcp	traffic	packets
everyone mentions tcp but nat works for udp as well the first outgoing udp packets associates that source ports with the internal ip-address and your nat device will forwarding incoming traffic to that ports to the correct hosts on the internal network

1976619
javascript	dom
client side in javascript or whatever you can have the browser rendering the text and look to see how long the renderinging dom object is as jordan said

i have tried this with mysql and it worked successfully but i had to switching over to oracle and now i get a string representation of the id and not the actually sequences numbers

1976633
culture	locale
are you sure your culture locale settings aren t interfering

1976633
parsing	comma
if the culture isn t specified parsing is done in the current systemd culture which might for example use a comma as the decimal separator

1976670
jquery-forms-plugin	.post
i d like to get this working without javascript and once it is i ll add the jquery-forms-plugin .so it will do an ajax submit if javascript is enabled otherwise it will do a normals form .post

1976672
administration	account
i suppose setting up svn on a regular hosting account is the main alternative but i was specifically looking for something that takes care of administration stuff like that

1976683
c++	lua
it allows you to subclassing c++ object with lua object

1976687
aggregate	grouping
second anything you want to be generator in the output of the query that is not a column or expression which is part of that grouping by set must be based on an aggregate function.

1976701
rollback	commit
the only difference between one that is explicit in a transactional and one that is standing on it s own is that the one that is standing alone starts it s transactional immediately before it execute it and commit or rollback immediately after it execute

1976701
rollback	commit
you only commit or rollback each transactional

1976701
rollback	commit
then every statement is execute within that transactional until you explicit terminate the transactional with commit or rollback or if a failure occurs that causes the engine to terminate and rollback

1976714
.when	ready
you need to copy the list stored in mysession operate on the copy and .when ready to save set mysession.userlist to the copy

1976720
checkbox	button
i was wondering if anyone knew of a plugins available that would change hudson s radio button into checkbox to allow me to configurationure multiple scm repositories in the project s configuration on hudson

1976722
rollback	commit
.when i end session one s transactional commit begin or rollback and checked again from that session the table will show as empty

1976760
decimal	hex
if the returned hex string is actually the id in hexadecimal flavor then you can try converting it to decimal by long#valueof or integer#valueof

1976761
display	width
usually elements will expand to display their entire contents unless that expansion would exceed existing constraints in which case that constraint is its width

1976762
e-commerce	product
2 e-commerce section which consists of a thousand static physical product pages

1976780
entity-framework	ado.net

1976781
registration	login
instead .when they re try to access the login registration pages in wordpress i want those pages to redirect them to my own login registration pages

1976784
background-color	transparency
since body elements has a margins of 70px then due to marginss being transparency and thus they donâ t have the same background-color as their elements i would expect the edges of the browser windows to have white color but instead they have same color as the body elements blue

1976794
checkbox	textbox
that way your datagridview will have the grouping named in the first cell as a textbox and a checkbox for each specific permission like

1976817
value	field
depending on the details of your design you should be able to overrides the field unused by the current versioning of the document overrides in a subclassing for that document and throw a notsupportedexception or similar in the implementation of that methods if the form tries to assign a value

1976817
protected	public
if there is some commonality between code that s slightly changed but mostly the same you may be able to refactor some of that commonality into a private protected methods that is used by multiple public methodss

1976820
contains	elements
.when i query the database with the hsqldb manager everything is there and the column in this table contains the named of the enum elements as it should

since i have no idea what the data is you are dealing with i am not sure if the exact proximity would matter - in which case you can just stick w the average - or if you need to do some sort of inverse distance weight

1977539
uilabel	uiview
the way i d do this would be to create a parent uiview that holds your uipickerview add a series of uilabel for column title

1977541
contains	set
b or should i load only a lightweight recording set contains only all the order_id s and load 100 item ghost object which only have the order_id set but everything else null - and as soon as an item object is accessed to fetch more details from it lazy-load that specific item object data

1977544
contains	elements
the operators on a map will give a reference to the actual contains elements but it has the nasty side-effect of creating a map entry if none existed before

1977552
deployment	install
it will install python package as well as other stuff and lets you automate installation and deployment of complex project

1977557
fadeout	fadein
as far as i can tell you would use fadeout change the source with attr and then fadein again

1977571
ftp	ssh
i m looking at existing python code that heavily uses paramiko to do ssh and ftp

1977574
stdin	pipe
the easiest way to capture the stdout from another program is to simply pipe it into the stdin of your program via the command-line or | operators

1977574
linux	unix	stdin	pipe
this is a pretty standards conventions in the unix linux world - programs read from stdin and write to stdout in .some well-formatted way .so that you can pipeline different programs together by simply adding pipe to the command-line

1977580
fadeout	fadein
are you sure you re using the callback you pass into fadeout to change the source attr and then calling fadein

1977580
fadeout	fadein
you can t call fadeout attr and fadein sequentially

1977582
fadeout	fadein
you pass a function as the callback arguments to fadeout that resets the src attributes and then fade back using fadein

1977614

if you have access to the server you can put the same code in your httpd.conf file otherwise ask your hosts to do it or give you more permissions in .htaccess files

1977620
credentials	account
and because you re not using a constructor where you re explicit specifying a username and a passwd the directorycontext-object will get using the credentials of the user running the application-pool in iis 6+ in iis 5.1 the application will if memory serves me right always be a the local systemd account - iusr_xxx - which won t be able to access active-directory because it s not a domain account

1977624

gnome	kde
on windows you will need some trickery with pywin32 and the windows api on linux the answer will depend on which desktop is running - kde gnome or something more exotic

1977790
gnome	kde
under kde and maybe gnome you can probably send a messages using dbus which you could do without including any new libs by using the command-line tool dbus-send

1977796

contains	set
the most common approach i ve seen is to make a stored procedure which uses execute to executeute dynamic-sql contains both the set identity_insert and the insert itself

1977884
exception-handling	try-catch
i tried surrounding the ant copy with a try-catch to catch the invokerinvocationexception-handling but somehow the exception-handling comes through anyway .

1977909
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited
that way you can subclassing a base-class and have the subclassing inherited the initializer which is normals behavior in class-based languages

1977912
default-value	arguments	value	field
if the global field separator has been changed from its default-value of nil then that value is output between each of the arguments to printing

1977912

export	csv
i d export csv from the sheets and deal with them

1977974
eof	eol
.when i was working in c++ with sockets i set up a dedicated thread to iterate over all the open sockets poll for data which would be available without blocking take the data and stuff it in a buffering sending the buffering to a callback on a given circumstance eol eof that sort of thing

1977981
app-bundle	info.plist
the info.plist and everything in the app-bundle is readonly once it s install on an iphone

1977982
export	csv
some of the comments suggested export the excel files to csv and parsing the csv file line by line but that seems to not be a solution to your problem

1978007
telnet	ftp	telnetlib	paramiko
no paramiko has no support for telnet or ftp -- you re indeed better off using a higher-level abstraction and implements it twice with paramiko and without it with the ftplib and telnetlib modules of the python standard-library

1978019
continuous-integration	jenkins
svn itself does not do continuous-integration but there are many codeigniter servers that integrated well with svn cruisecontrol.net cruisecontrol.net.net jenkins hudson...

1978028

if you want any variables to persistent it should either be set in the model where it will persistent with the associations or passed on in a function or set in the session explicit using the session component

1978030
latitude-longitude	location
either come up with a new user-interface elements for having multiple users in the same location or ignore a user if their latitude-longitude has already been added to the map

1978050
libxml2	lxml
libxml2 which is available in python as lxml is something else to investigate but i have even less experience with that

1978050
xsd	xml
another possibility is to convert the dtd to xsd with one of many programs then use a regular xml processor to manipulate the tree and return it back to dtd

1978059
latex	tex
generally most users of tex latex wonâ t care much about these features anyway and well you can see that in the document they produce

1978066
positioning	slider
upon editing i am trying to slider a row into positioning 0 of the first section

1978102
callback	methods
you could use begininvoke but instead of calling endinvoke from the gui thread which will block it if the methods isn t finished pass an asynccallback parameter to your begininvoke call instead of just passing null and close the progress form in your callback

1978123
any	set
git log is for display a set of revision potentially including the diff between each revision and its parent while git-diff is used for display the difference between any two revision in your repository

1978183
32-bit	x86
one more thing i m thinking of doing is reinstalling my 32-bit jdk and getting it out the the directory with the x86 in the named

1978191
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
a jvm is not virtual in the same sense as a virtualbox or vmware virtual-machine

delphi	c++
this isdelphi program by bruce mcgee will find all applications built with delphi delphi for .net or c++ builder that are on your hard-drive

1978223
response	timeout
and performance is response timeout in the user-interface

1978226
dosbox	bochs
the jvm and other software-based vmms such as the ones that allow to to emulate x86 on solaris hardware - i think bochs and possibly dosbox fall into this category runs like any other application using the operating systemd to gain access to the hardware or emulation its own hardware purely in software

1978237
multithreading	wait
you can use any of the typical multithreading techniques here wait pulse reader writer lock slim wait handles or just have the worker thread-sleep for a few seconds if the queue is-empty

1978237

assuming that you re using sql-server you can use scoping_identity to return the last identity value insert into an identity-column in the same scoping

1978358
error-logging	logging
i mean .when do we use info logging .when do we use debugging logging error-logging etc

1978389
background-color	width	background-color	height
to do this create another div with a background-color usually black or white then set the opacity to something like 50 - 70 - then set its z-index higher than anything else on the page but lower then the pop-up and set its positioning to absolute its top and left to 0 and width and height to match the page

cocoa-bindings in a nutshell are a way to keep an attributes in a view in sync with a properties of a model object

1978407
communication	messages
but even if your target is network packets sent pages of ram allocated blocks of disk read written or just watts of power consumed the messages i am trying to communication is that you should have a performance target that target should be quantified and the target should be connect to the needs of your users

1978412
selected	cell

1978449
explode	implode
if you know that your arrays will just be a list of numbers for example then you should use implode explode

1978454
portrait	screens
this is a problem because the content view is now a different shape portrait than it was before landscape and .so all the elements on the screens are in the wrong places .when they should just be scale down within rectangleview

1978454
contains	elements
and i am confused because some of these elements even move out of rectangleview which i didn t even know was possible since they are supposed to be contains within rectangleview

1978545
selection	cell
you can t easily to my knowledge change selectable parts of a cell - the whole cell must be selectable no matter what you can set the styles to no selection but you ll still recieve touch updates

1978559
constructor	object
i know i can put in the constructor class but the request object is null at that points

1978560

1978954
callback	methods
you could use the registerstartupscript methods in the callback that is called by the updatepanel

1978973
contains	any
as long as the dictionares are merged into the application dictionary in the correct order any named resource that is found in the localized dictioary will take precendence over the one in the main dictionary for example your spanish localization dll could have a xaml file contains this

1979344
c++	lua
what i seem to gather from your examples and the discussions is that you are expecting lua to be the primary language and c++ to be the client

1979344
c++	lua
since c++ is a much low-level language and object definitions must be static and lua dynamically defined its object it is much easier to have lua adapt to c++ object

put	get
if you put it in a form tag with methods get it should work

1979415
principles	srp
martin s agile principles patterns and practices in c# helped me a lot to grasp srp

order	join
.so join is excellent to flatten a hierarchy of items of known depth customer - order - order_items into one bigtable which only duplicates the master items for each detail item

1979588
callback	methods
i have a feeling this is because the errors are causing my buffering to call the callback methods instead of my error handler

1979591
placeholder	required
you may create namedd placeholder for variables parts of the path by using named for required elements and

1979604
mousedown	mouseup

and .when user logs in fadeout the present tableview to show the tableview below it

1979681

scala	java
according to the scala help test it is possible to provide java properties using the -d option

1979812
scala	java
i don t think this proposal will be part of scala 2.8 since martin odersky wrote that it is probably best to keep things as they are in java honor the file.encoding properties

1979832
perforce	cvs
if we look at the tools perforce subversion cvs for instances we see that branching is taking a copy of the trunk

1979844
any	set
are there any neat solutions to this other than him having one tool set up customer-facing and me having my tool and us manually replicating things between them

1979850
user-controls	ascx
another option - and approaching the problem from a slightly different angle - is to have a single aspx page for all edit pages then create ascx user-controls that contains all the user-interface and possibly process logic for each logical page

1979850
user-controls	ascx
showing hiding individual ascx user-controls can be done via dynamic control loading placing all ascx on the page and setting their visible properties using the asp.net multiview control or others etc

1979853
maven-plugin	mojo
the source code will be helpful here checked for example mavenprojecttest or maybe the maven-plugin api actually this task would be much really much simpler to achieve from a mojo for some guidance

1979911
output	mode
the output file should be called spam.pyd in release-mode or spam_d.pyd in debugging mode

1979925
swing	awt
you should probably be using paintcomponent instead of paint since the latter is the awt methods and the former is the swing methods

1979931
python	java
100 python no com no .net no java no parsing serialization xml with regexs no crap

1979961
javascript	dom
the template-function will support the use of javascript and therefore you get the looping functionality and full access to the dom .so any jquery or other frameworks are at your disposal

1980003
value	field
this semantic data may be information about accepting or rejecting nulls duplicates object of wrong types or with unacceptable field value etc

1980011
expression	evaluation
yes and the reason is that on the very beginning of evaluation any expression references are being replace by the object that s referenced as defined at in the standards

1980035
account	api
i am unable to help you with your second question simply because i don t have a twitter account and have no experience working with the twitter api in general

1980068
constructor	object
you can do that in the object s constructor you just have to make sure you are listening for the right event

1980079
configuration	environment
although i would prefer yaml as configuration language since it is not .so verbose as xml and have nice means of composing hierarchical configuration files which are usually needed .when you have multiple development environment like dev test live

1980103
google-chrome	opera
i don t understand why the two green boxes don t align properly on google-chrome and older versioning of opera

1980138

1980217
punctuation	words
but i found that it does not recognise words correctly with punctuation like

1980240
communication	messages
my personal preferences would be a named pipe sending small heartbeat messages since that could be detected across a network as well but if you want to avoid the complexity of pipe communication - which i guess is understandable - then you could updates a dword in a predetermined registry key

1980259
google-chrome	firefox
these are what i want works in firefox and what iâ ve got in google-chrome

1980278
32-bit	64bit

1980281
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1980304
constructor	object
do not be tempted to just defined a load of abstract-methods and overrides multiple time to implements them differently .when you could have a single class and inject arguments to constructor an object implementss an interface that you call to do whatever variables functionality that you would otherwise have put in the abstract-methods

1980305
arguments	default
by default yii passes the command-line arguments in a variables to your run methods .when you extends the cconsolecommand

google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in firefox google-chrome

1980353

i install the 32-bit versioning by accident noticed the mistake and install the 64bit one

1980378

1980385
background-image	transparency
to make part of the windows transparency call the updatelayerdwindows function and give it a partially transparency background-image

1980385
background-image	transparency
you can also pass the ulw_colorkey instead of giving a partially transparency background-image and every part of the windows that is the color you specify will become transparency

1980389
getter	setter
userbase supplies some general functionality like the defined properties age named email and getter and setter for these

i am running into an issue with logging into an asp.net-mvc website using forms-authentication while running on azure using a cname to redirect my domain to the url of the azure application

1980472
logout	login
i can tell this because a logged in user will only have the option to logout but i am seeing the login link

1980480
instances	destroy
the right way to do this sort of thing in c++ assuming you need dynamically allocated buffering as opposed to vectors which you probably don t is to perform the memory allocation for offset and value as part of a constructor within the struct types and have a destructor deallocate those elements .when the struct instances is destroy either by a delete or by going out of scoping

1980482
hide	show
you can easily hide styles display none the upload forms and show them with a link like upload an image onclientclick #link_id .show

1980485
web-services	security
libs to help with common tasks like persistent jdbc hibernate ibatis jdo jpa etc. remoting rmi http web-services asynch messaging messages driven pojos validation and binding web asp.net-mvc spring or struts utilities like email scheduling security etc

1980488
attributes	properties
i m still pretty new to objective-c coding as evidenced by this question and i think i m not completely understanding how using the retain attributes in a properties declaration works

1980488
attributes	properties	getter	setter
my understanding was that adding the retain attributes to the properties declaration and using the necessary synthesize delcaration in the implementation file will basically do the following setter and getter for me

1980513
spring	guice
here s a good video given by bob lee and two of his under studies about guice guice is a dependency-injection framework like spring

1980519

.when i try to use it inside the code i find the default false for is false i assume this is the default-value to a bool variables does anyone have a clue what is wrong

1980527
order	join
most notably join operations but also subqueries and range opertions queries like order created between now and a week ago can be considerably slower than what you might expect

1980530
attributes	properties
the default-value attributes is only used to tell the visual-studio designers for example .when designing a form what the default-value of a properties is

1980535
controllers	routes
thankfully url routes and of course controllers are testable .so you may want to simply write unit tests for your router configuration

1980550
python	ruby
in most cases what we call configuration is not sophisticated enough be worthy of the named scripting or programming but some systemd based on ruby python or lisp -- emacs -- use the programming language as a configuration language and then configuration really does blend into programming

1980572
ironpython	ironruby
rather than write a custom language you could embed any of the dlr languages ironpython ironruby or jscript or you can use compiler service to compile vb.net from your application

1980578
any	set
in this case the main thread wait for any event that are set by the other threads

now if i put immediately after the addtxn then the subsequent code does indeed get the post-addtxn acctbal value

1982083
ref	out
most use cases for passing a reference variables by reference involve initialization and out is more appropriate than ref

listbox	textbox
i have been able to achieve these results using a textbox stack on top of a listbox but it isn t very elegant and it takes up more screens real estate

1982183

1982367
children	nodes
defined a set of swaps trading children between nodes for example to act as possible mutation and then iteratively mutate and checked against your fitness function

1982379
digits	zero
i m quite sure it is because it treats the last few digits of the numbers as zero

1982380
constructor	private
some may argue the private variables should have simply been declare as new in the first place or initializer in the constructor rather than the properties - but this should at least highlight a possible issue as this is a common approach

1982388
system.out	system.in
see the documentation for system.in particular system.out system.err system.in

1982389
stderr	stdout
use system.out and system.err to write to stdout and stderr respectively

1982391
jquery	.post
as mentioned in a previous .post there are widget libs based on mootools jquery and yui

1982403
swing	awt	system.out	system.in
there s not a new console project or similar in eclipse but you d just make a new java project and read write to system.out system.in system.err and not use a gui framweork such as swing awt to be a console application

1982411
put	get
they re not just magic devices where you put in the sql and get out result sets but rather very complicated pieces of software with their own logic and quirks

1982432
sql-server	mysql
building a database for mysql or access or sql-server has become .so routine that databases have become almost a routine part of an ordinary application

1982440
void	main
potentially any class file with a public static void main methods can be a console application with parameters passed from with eclipse or from the command-line

1982442
python	java
i am porting some java code to python and we would like to use python 3 but i can t find ldap module for python 3 in windows

1982476
getter	setter
it creates accessor methodss to get and set the properties it would create a getter methods to return that nsmutablearray and a setter methods to allow you to replace it with another nsmutablearray

1982511
constructor	object
you mention that you re calling this from the constructor of a frameview but i assume you re talking about an implementation or extension of that interface object

1982512
attributes	properties
the properties task can read properties from any types of resource using the ref-id attributes

1982535
.when	ready
.when you compile your c application you get executable byte-code machine-code that is ready to run on whatever platform you compiled for

1982538
revision	svn
a high level overview the .app takes a repository url then looks for all external and adds the last commit revision for them - i do a svn info and get the commit revision

1982541
shell	bash
from a bash shell i did this

1982562
signals	sigpipe
on posix-compliant platform sigpipe is the signals sent to a process .when it attempts to write to a pipe without a process connect to the other end

1982567
sql-server	mysql
i made a test case - insert read delete data about 1000 recording in ms sql-server 2008 and mysql community edition

1982574
web-services	webserver
however if there s anyone with a better update-class idea that doesn t required an asp.net webserver nor web-services already tried and failed on that one i ll be grateful

1982581
value	field
value of the column called field

1982591
configuration	environment
it seems like eclipse doesn t like to updates it s configuration files i ve noticed this even in the flex environment .when i try to change a server types

1982598
environment	building
never tried it but maybe add a run scripting building phase to your project that simply printing the environment to stdout and parsing that

1982610
digits	zero
the second ensures that the string has only digits and the first isn t zero

1982611
z-index	tooltip
change the css to have a higher z-index for the tooltip than for the block-uied div

1982611
z-index	tooltip
add css to have a higher z-index for the tooltip content

1982647
order	add
you might also index by word-length but here s another idea add an order index on the reversed dictionary words

1982654
panels	grid
whether you do it with the grid s properties like in the example you linked or by just wrapping it in a panels with a height and overflow set on it it doesn t matter much

1982659
append	input
all i can think of is for the logger thread to not printing the messages but append them to some shared list that the raw_input thread can see and have that thread printing the messages after the user enters input

1982709
callback	methods
as mentioned commonly delegation methods would include the object initiating the callback .so you can differentiate that way

1982729
scripting	shebang
then to make your scripting use your current preferred python the traditional solution is to use the env program in the shebang line of your scripting

1982733
selected	cell
i al.so need to maintain a reference to the item the item has a unique id field as well .so i can determine the item in the selected cell

1982733
value	field
would the preferred approach to this be putting the actual object in each cell in the table and using various rendering to display the item or to simply put the field value in each of the cell and have a hidden column that has the item id that i can reference .when i need to know the item id

1982736
account	userid
they have some fake out magic that makes their sample account controllers work to let you supply a fake userid

1982764
push	pull
you can do a pull or push from the website database wsdb to the enterprise database edb and vice-versa

1982771
calayer	nsimage	uiimage	calayer	uiimage	nsimage
if you want sample code for how to rendering a calayer hierarchy to an nsimage or uiimage for the iphone you can look at the core-plot framework s cplayer and its -imageoflayer methods

1982772
value	field
my preferred approach is to have a table model which returns a value from the field for each column

1982773
expression	evaluation
evaluation of the expression contains the function _nsprintfordebugger will be abandoned

1982775
quicktime	vlc
i have noticed that quicktime 10 is now able to open transport-stream video files and also search reliably within that video file which is something that vlc can not seem to handle

1982775
quicktime	qtkit
also does anyone know the difference between the quicktime player and the qtkit that is supplied to developers

1982780
viewdidappear	viewdidload
also i d move this code to viewdidappear rather than viewdidload

1982781
network-interface	multicast
has anyone had any luck getting msmq multicast pgm to bind to a specific network-interface using the multicastbindip registry setting

1982795
gearman	worker
i did some reading about gearman and i am wondering if it can be used as a worker pool for background process

1982795
gearman	worker
that is i should be able to have a worker pool and i am expecting gearman to dispatcher multiple worker in separate threads

1982802
getter	setter
.when should a class use its own getter setter vs accessing the members directly

1982828
groovy	java
it s not strictly speaking only java but groovy has a nice console from which you can easily try and play with java libs

1982841
engineyard	heroku
i would also second other people s recommendations of heroku and engineyard as well

1982849
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
if there are common tasks responsibilities in your two timers you could create an abstract timer that implements these common tasks and extends it for more specific behavior methods implementation

1982850
keyboard	mouse
then all you have to do is hook up the event handler to deal with the mouse and keyboard

1982868
ms-access	mysql
the database that will store the form-data is mysql but report will be generator from the data in ms-access using a mysql odbc connection

1982868
checkbox	textbox
have one table with a boolean column for every checkbox and a textbox for other

1982868
concatenation	comma
.when process the form concatenation checkbox value into a comma separated string and put that in the textfield along with the other data

1982876
user-controls	treeview
i ve read up on how to add custom user-controls by using a web user-controls .ascx but it doesn t seem to work that way for overrides the treenode and treeview

1982885
virtual-machine	vmware
clone your vmware virtual-machine and selectively upgrade the clones

1982909
internet-explorer	google-chrome
internet-explorer and google-chrome are doing the right thing

1982914
user-controls	ascx
edit the submitage function is inside a .js file agerange.js and only .when move here does it stop working here is the linking methods headers from the ascx user-controls inwhich it is all contained.

1982916
base-class	inherited
i m trying to serialization a class that inherited from a base-class that implements ixmlserializable

1982920
user-controls	ascx
the problem is that the aspx page is referencing an ascx user-controls that is located in a different folder

1982937
revision	updates
additional to greg s answer you may also have a look on the possibility to updates to a specific revision

1982944
logout	login
for secured resources which for us is everything except images javascript css static html and the login logout pages and remove the above from the web-config

1982954
removeclass	addclass
rather than removeclass and addclass

1982980
atomikos	bitronix
the exact same error occurs .when i switching from the bitronix transactional manager to the atomikos transactional manager

1982986
scrollbar	widget
create one scrollbar and connect it to each widget

1982988
lgpl	gpl
i have tried to read about the gpl bsd mit lgpl licenses but cant seem to understand what they mean to me in real life

1982988
lgpl	gpl
some client side javascript ajax + jquery mit gpl + json own minimal license + a lgpl licensed plugins for jquery

1982994
virtualbox	vmware
i used virtualbox .when it only had linear destructive snapshot reversion -- i understand that vbox has improved but vmware still has it beat for snapshot capabilities

1983001
contains	any
for the sake of completeness the existing query stored procedure starts by gathering all leaf nodes contains the final term then join upward and excludes any whose paths don t match with the earlier terms

1983003
click	mouse
by wrapping it in a link via jquery wrap browsers think it s a link and don t scroll on middle click even if you drag your mouse around

1983003
google-chrome	safari
but this solution works like a charm on google-chrome and safari

1983005
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the service itself and all of the clients to the service will have access to one another over an internal network and are currently all .net 3.5 sp1 windows-services 3.5 asp.net-mvc 1.0 asp.net webforms 3.5

1983005
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i ve already dismissed ideas of building as a custom asp.net-mvc service and as an old-school soap web service as wcf will have more flexible transport choices at the cost of ability to customize the response

1983027
.net	wcf
at the moment wcf remains the most obvious option for a communication api between .net service

1983036
web-config	app-config
i am not sure if you can just put this in your app-config web-config

1983038
.net	wcf
any new directions in .net communication will likely be built on the wcf platform which is extremely extensible

1983041
.net	wcf
wcf is not changing dramatically in .net 4 .so the migration should be very straitforward

1983051
oracle	mysql
however it looks like libmysqlclient is gpl unless you purchase a commercial license from mysql sun .soon-to-be oracle and the mysql extension in php uses it .so you may be linking to a gpl libs if you use that

1983053
profiling	debugging
it does a great job of helping you analyze this information including directly showing you how your code lays out showing you misses blocks and many other useful tools for debugging and profiling concurrent apps

1983063
any	set
a set of nibs seem to be an unsatisfactory answer even .when represented in xml as a xib because there s no easy way to compare or merge them with any standards subversion or scm-style tool

1983067
contains	set
suppose that you ve set up a site search parameter called q .so that .when a uri is tracked that contains ga will mark it as a search hit

1983087
unsigned	zero
one thing that comes to mind for example is that the semantics of signed integral division requiredd by c++ round towards zero is often different from the semantics implements by the hardware platform round towards negative infinite which means that for signed types the division might required more instructions to adjust the result than for unsigned types

1983116
configuration	environment
what i do in this situation is create a constants in each environment s configuration file

1983120
for-loop	arrays
that tends to be less error prone since you can just use a for-loop across the arrays and not have to keep tracking of start and end pints which i always get wrong for what it s worth

1983124
python	php	cvs	git
it has optional support for subversion cvs git and several javascript libs jquery extjs prototype etc as well as php python and ruby-on-rails

1983134
contains	elements
every one of those elements except the textbox and combobox vertically positioning the text they contains differently and it looks plain ugly

1983134
font-size	display
that works except that the margins is in pixels and not relative to the resolution of the display or the font-size or any of the other things that are going to be variables

1983159
python	java
as long as you aim for something that is pc wintel based which runs any current 32-bit versioning of windows win98 you should be able to write software using standards tools like .net java python etc

1983164
annotations	mapping
for more info see the mapping with hibernate annotations section of the following link

1983183
processor	cpu
support cpu dispatching this is really important since it allows the compiler to target the processor for optimized instructions .when the program runs

1983186
getter	setter
now i had this problem in the past and that was caused by me trying to over optimize each entity class by making the setter and getter final

1983186
getter	setter
hibernate needs to setup proxy for the entity classes .so it can lazy-evaluation load stuff .so if i make a setter getter final it can t do that

1983197
groovy	java
put this in src java it can t be written in groovy because of a weird compilation error and register it in datasource.groovy using the configclass attributes

1983213
value	field
you also need to updates the header with the correct length of the file because there are field whose value depends on the length of the sample-data

1983215
nsarray	plist
you can create a plist file with the developer applications utilities plist editor.app part of the standards developers tools that nsarray can read in directly with initwithcontentsoffile

1983228
json	xml
this is not unique to json -- xml would exhibit similar phenomenon

1983249
display	height	display	width
display a rectangle and binding width height angle to a viewmodel class works as i expect in xaml

1983270
abstract-class	subclassing	implements	abstract
this is an abstract-class which you can subclassing and implements the abstract methods which maps namespace uris on to prefixes

1983275
value	field
i m trying to copy some field value to a duplicates database

1983275
value	field
i don t want to manually save the value in a variables because there are hundreds of field

1983275
value	field
.so i want to go to the first field save the field named and value and then go over to the other database and save the data

1983276
value	field
what if i had to store multiple value an arrays into 1 mysql field for each link recording posted

1983276
explode	implode
if there is 5 items for every link i could have an arrays of 5 items on the page a list of 5 items seperated by comma or i could use json encode decode what would be best for performance for saving a link to the db and showing it on the page something like implode explode with a list of item json encode decode or serialization un-serialization the arrays

1983282
python	java
what portlet implementation branding would run on gae java and gae python

1983285
quicktime	qtkit
quicktime player should use an almost identical backing as any other .app on the systemd qtkit

1983298
any	set
after which you don t need to set any -i and -l flags

1983310
lisp	let
too many let -bindings is a sign of an unreconstructed ml programmer or lisp programmer

1983310
parentheses	operators
use the operators judiciously to cut down on parentheses

1983312
shell	bash
if you are trying to run a binary that required the cygwin1.dll which include most cmd you can execute from the cygwin bash shell then you can run it by specifying the cygwin bin directory in the path environment variables like this

1983337
value	field
if you want to simply display the value of the field but not make it editable you could use a custom templates or some javascript to mask alter the value

1983337
value	field
this smells like a disaster in the making as a person editing a field like that if you hid the value would not know what the full value is

1983343
shell	bash
if you are trying to run a binary that required the cygwin1.dll which include most cmd you can execute from the cygwin bash shell then you can run it by specifying the cygwin bin directory in the path environment variables like this

1983352
converter	export
you may be able to export git to svn and use cs converter to go from svn to tfvs

1983387
push	pull
if you re not a vb expert you could mabye even do the pull push outside of excel on scripting level pulling the data from mysql into an excel sheet before opening excel easy and writing it back after closing it

1983393
nsdateformatter	date-format
turns out its the date-format string used to set up the nsdateformatter that was causing this for me

1983406
required	checked
checked what runtime dlls it required

1983410
scrollbar	widget
additionally it should set the same range for the other scroll area widget s horizontal scrollbar

1983410
scrollbar	widget
the horizontal qscrollbar s valuechanged int value signals should be connect to every scroll area widget s horizontal scrollbar s setvalue int value slot

1983410
scrollbar	widget
the other would be to install event filtering on those widget and either ignore the scroll or process it with the main scrollbar

1983415
value	field
otherwise you d be indirectly modifying the value each time the object got modified even if the actual field wasn t changed at all

1983434
webforms	asp.net
why can none of my asp.net webforms pages get the control into scoping

1983443
web-config	app-config
based on a application setting in the app-config and in the web-config have the sessionfactory built accordingly by setting the current_session_context_class properties manually in the code and remove it from the hibernate.cfg.xml file

1983443
web-config	app-config
include a in the web application s web-config and in the app-config of the console application

1983443
web-config	app-config
if i am not mistaken the in the web-config and in the app-config overrides the value of the hibernate.cfg.xml

1983443
web-config	app-config
if i am wrong then you will just have to include in the web-config and the app-config the complete and remove the hibernate.cfg.xml file from your libs

1983480
spring	seam
on the negative side just as any product you try to market seam was years after spring had already become popular .so spring is by far still more popular

1983480
spring	seam
if you look on spring there are roughly 40k registered users while seam has about 7k

1983480
spring	seam
depends on what is important to you as a java developer engineer programmer you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are you will most likely encounter a spring application before a seam one

1983480
spring	seam
if you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each development becomes much easier whether you re using spring or seam

1983504
nested	order
try creating the master dataset and its nested dataset in different order

1983505
interpreter	runtime
the use_ok call is at runtime .so the mod_table sub is only compiled and import after the call to it is encountered during compilation .so the call to mod_table is interpreter as an illegal bareword

1983517
keyboard	mouse
george mamaladze s article process global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# which works if the .application is in the background on codeproject has been around since 2004 been through multiple revision and he s still supporting it and updating it as i understand it he started his project because he could not implements global hooks in .net that worked .when the .app was running in the background but later discovered you could hook certain low-level events formerly q318804 now msdn article revised

1983529
gtk	gdk
such tests are common in gtk gdk internals - things like i m expecting this-pointers to be a such-and-such but i better make sure before i treat it that way. each messages pair you see indicates a pointers has been passed to such a routine but what it points to is not only not the expected object types it s not even points to anything the rtti systemd recognizes .so the rtti systemd is throw up its hands

1983536
function-call	hoisting
if the definition is not visible or if the function is very big and complicated then the compiler will probably assume that the function-call can not be move safely and then it won t automatically hoisting it out

1983541
erlang	lisp
if you are not scared of lists you might try using lfe lisp flavoured erlang to generator code as with all lisp there is no special abstract form it s all homoiconic and much easier to work with

1983563
windows-vista	windows
i m trying to tracedown a huge slowdown in the heap memory functions in windows-vista and windows 7 i didn t test on any server editions

1983563
windows-vista	windows
why are the heap memory function .so slow on windows-vista and windows 7 with heap_no_serialize

1983563
malloc	free
lastly it seems that any program created with visual-c++ 6 using malloc free or new delete seems to be affected on these newer platform

1983563
windows-vista	windows
this problem explained why my normals php on windows installation was crawling and may explain why windows-vista and windows 7 seems slower at time

1983568
nsimageview	nstextfield
i hand-wrote two iboutlet nstextfield nsimageview made sure to do the properties line in the .h and the synthesize in the .m file

1983616
alpha	rgba
i get the box-shadow styles and need to split it at the rgba alpha value then vary that value to get the shadow to fade

1983624
defined	declare
i have a set of defined constantss and for some i m serializing new instancess of a class and setting as a constants probably not the best idea i know... the problem is that .when information changes in the instances of the class it doesn t updates the referenced memory that was declare in the constants.

1983627
logout	login	registration	login	registration	logout
i am trying to integrated my custom user systemd with wordpress and i have recently asked a question on how to redirect request to wp-login.php to my own login registration page but as i was working on the pluggable functions i realized that request to wp-login.php can either be for login registration or logout

1983630
capacity	storage
.so if you want to keep the originals you can use the running time in seconds of you tapes time the maximum datarate of hdv constants 27mbit s i think to get your needed storage capacity

1983658
checkbox	button
using checkbox for radio button is there too

1983660
radio-button	checkbox
you can place a checkbox on the form that will control the checked properties of an invisible radio-button

1983677

1983715
contains	any
a built-in properties of the lidor treeview is the checkednodes collections contains all currently checked nodes and you have your choice of three selection modes including one multiextended that allows you to have very complex selection that include child and parent nodes in any order at any level of nesting

1983715
contains	any
and of course you have a selectednodes collections available at any time contains all selected nodes

1983720
32-bit	64bit
if your code call mex-functions that are compiled for 32-bit windows you can try and recompile them for 64bit windows

1983724

but i can t figure out how to get the new value saved along with other customer field

1983727
frame	width
essentially for each side - there s a gridsizer inside a sizer which has a spacer for the width of the section which are on a panels that s inside a sizer for that half of the sizer that s on the main frame

1983729
.when	ready
in it the author told readers to wire up all their onclientclick events not inline but .when the dom s ready like this jquery example

1983737
n-gram	words
a words based n-gram solution might also be worth investigating

1983741
function-call	inline
but i allow myself a maximum of a function-call .when doing stuff inline

1983761
javascript	dom
in general if you decided to use javascript manipulation of the dom through javascript should be minimal

1983773
put	get
all the line of code does is changes a pointers but for some reason every time i put it in i get this error

1983783
lightbox	jquery
if the jquery lightbox works anything like the normals one you need to call lightbox after every insert of a new link

1983807

children	nodes
please help me to find the error in this program.actually i was trying to bind treeview control with a database using nhibernate.as part of implementation i was trying to checked if the current parentnodes has some children or not.if it has children the bool value is set to true and populateondemand properties is set to true for that nodes

1983896
version-control	cvs
you can adapt for your language and version-control systemd if not cvs

1983907
instrumentation	trace
at any rate instrumentation should be able to give you stack trace of where that block of memory was allocated

1983933
malloc	free
if something malloc d memory before it started and then free d it while it was running you d get a negative count

1983952
32-bit	64bit

object-reference	instances
i m getting a object-reference not set to an instances of an object error

1984020
constructor	object
that you are calling roverobject as a constructor with new roverobject is irrelevant as you are returning a different object from the function

1984020
constructor	private	subclassing	base-class
note since the â privateâ local-variables in the base-class constructor really are private even the subclassing cannot get at them

1984116
python	java
you will also find out that the way you program in python is very different from the way you program in java hence the use of self tends to decrease because you don t project everything inside the object

1984117
contains	set
regarding the comment about everything inside the jframe ending up without a cur.sor it seems that the component s which are contains in the jframe will end up inheriting the cur.sor of the containers the jframe .so if it is a requirement to have a certain component have the cur.sor appear one would have to manually set the desired cur.sor

1984117
contains	set
for example if there is a jpanel contains in the jframe then one could set the cursor of that jpanel to the systemd s default using the cursor.getdefaultcursor methods

1984119

1984242
scriptaculous	jquery
how do i get intellisense for prototype scriptaculous like we get for jquery in visual-studio

1984273
google-chrome	safari
by the fact that you are asking the question though i would suggest that you use jquery as testing as various browsers and getting your own framework to work across ie6+ google-chrome safari and other browsers is obviously doable but there are .some issues to deal with .so unless you want to test on many browsers and re.solve the issues go with the one that is already tested

1984277
svnadmin	dump
theoretically no as the dump can be only performed by svnadmin cmd

1984322
attributes	properties
leave my entities classes clean withouth any attributes for properties and classes

1984356
margins	padding
sort of hard to tell without your markup but it seems that in some cases your width + margins + padding would exceed 960px horizontally

revision	svn
it will basically get every revision of a source svn database and commit them to your backup database

1984430

0xab practically always means a byte with decimal value 171 not two bytes and it s extremely common to display a byte as two hex digits where you use a-f in your example

1984445
python	java
process part of the process java .app collects text and request the python .app to process and return process text as part of a flow

1984453
python	java
look into jython - you can run python programs directly from java code and interact seamlessly back and forth

1984458
python	java	python	ruby
in recent years rather than struggle through this with java i ve just been using python or ruby instead

1984479
listitem	selected
the easy way is to put them in the updatepanel and bind the selectedindexchange event to the from place dropdownlistfor .when the request is posted to the server remove the listitem of the to place dropdownlistfor based on the selected index of the from place dropdownlistfor

1984499
put	get

1984603
ftp	scp
put simply url is the full way to indentify any resource anywhere and can have different protocols like ftp http scp etc

1984723
directory-structure	organization
i need to implements a relatively big libs the solution project files will be generator by cmake and my problem is that i would like the organization of the files in vc gui to reflect the directory-structure on the disk

1984739
value	field
this mean this activity is not created again but resumed unless it was killed by core because other applications need memory .so its field and attributes keep their value

1984739
value	field
.so if you store your datas in .some activity field you might be able to retrieve their value and display them without re-download them

1984742
communication	messages
for the communication between the main application and the cgi s you can use sockets or systemd v messages queue if those are available on your embbedded platform

using some hash-function h say md5 take the hash of each image and store the image with a filename equals to the digest

1984779
32-bit	64bit
i ve recently been engaged in moving several of our large matlab codes from 32-bit windows-xp to 64bit windows-xp

1984779
32-bit	64bit
but as others have remarked matlab is indifferent to the numbers of bits .so a pure matlab code which works on a 32-bit release will work on the 64bit versioning of the same release

1984779
32-bit	64bit
if you move from an older 32-bit release to a newer 64bit release you may find some matlab functions have been retired but you d have the same issues moving to the newer 32-bit release anyway

1984796
coalesce	nvl
coalesce is the ansi equivalent more or less of oracle s nvl function

1984824
antivirus	security
the principles is the same as an exe packer and has some of its downsides like cheaper antivirus heuristics sometimes reacting on them a slightly elevated memory load just more focussed on security

1984847
execution	restart
i have a python based application which works like a feed aggregator and needs to be part of init.d scripting .so that i could control the execution with start stop restart options

1984866

however .when i scroll the table loads the new cell s starts the nsurlconnection but .when the image is finished loading in code they do not get put into the view until the table actually stops scrolling

1984870
put	get
a standards fresh codeigniter install works perfectly but .when i put my .app in the same dir i get errors

1984871
python	perl
i ve been a perl guy for over 10 years but a friend convinced me to try python and told me how much faster it is than perl

1984871
python	perl
.so just for kicks i ported an .app i wrote in perl to python and found that it runs about 3x slower

1984871
python	perl
is this a problem with my installation or is python really that much slower than perl

1984873
tstringlist	tlist	tobjectlist	tstringlist
i would recommend against using tstringlist tlist tobjectlist because insert deletion in very large lists millions can be painfull because the deletion insert is o n and insert in the middle means shifting half the data

1984873
32-bit	64bit
i ve got the core server part of above 32-bit solution working in 64bit in under an hour

1984879
value	field
it s good that the errorprovider validation entries on date field by default i didn t set up my custom object to display this particular error for the date but it should allow blank value

1984901
python	perl
python is not particularly fast at numeric computations and i m sure it s slower than perl .when it comes to text process

1984901
python	perl
since you re an experienced perl hand i don t know if this applies to you but python programs in the long run tend to be more maintainable and are quicker to develop

1984901
python	perl
i then ran simple perl and python programs that search the file line by line for an existing pattern

1984913
annotations	mapping
and by the way if you go for hibernate maybe consider using standardized jpa and ejb 3.0 jsr-220 object relational mapping annotations provided by hibernate annotations

1984917
ubuntu	debian
anyway since you ve mentioned ubuntu i must say that the scripting you ve linked doesn t comply with the current standards for initscriptings neither for ubuntu nor for debian lenny

1984919
python	perl
python is slower then perl

1984920
python	java	python	c++
not betwee c++ and java and not between python and javascript or any other two languages

with onmousedown event you can get the co-ordinates of initial letter and with onmouseup the last letter

1984966
for-loop	arrays
i was once curious about this as well and wrote a simple program in java and then an equivalent in c not much more than doing some operation with a for-loop and a massive arrays

1984988
entity-framework	ado.net
the major downside of linq-to-sql is the uncertainty surrounding it with the advent of the ado.net entity-framework - unless the situation has changed there has been strong rumours that linq-to-sqls future is cloudy as ms are concentrating on the entity-framework and moving away from linq-to-sql

1984990
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you need more flexibility more database backends more granular mapping you should definitely look at nhibernate or later on at entity-framework 4

1985083
contains	any
your code doesn t contains any data-structures function-calls or oop operations

1985083
32-bit	x86
and then there is the psyco jit which would probably run your toy example well under 1 second but i can t checked it now because it only works on 32-bit x86

1985089
jms	jta
strictly speaking from java ee apis i d suggest to start with jsp servlet jpa ejb 3.0 jax-ws and then maybe jms jta and once you ll have reached this points i think that you ll be skilled enough to learn any other api if required

.when you switching off nat from your wireless router it can operate as a hub switching and not a router anymore .so that you could connect it to the modem using one of its lan .socket instead of thro its wan .socket

1985186
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
my advice is that you skip everything that s called asp.net webforms and go directly to asp.net-mvc

1985199
keyboard	mouse
for example if the site uses javascript that required the use of a mouse and doesn t have keyboard alternatives it will not be 508 compliant

default-value	arguments
in php a function can receive any numbers of arguments and they don t have to be defined if you give them a default-value

1985225
exception-handling	try-catch
i can put try-catch clauses around all the call to the service client and reinstantiate the singleton instances on communication exception-handling but that will involve a lot of boilerplate code

1985230
rollback	commit
you ll certainly want to do intermediate commit to help preclude the possibility that you ll run out of rollback segment spaces or something similar

1985247
emacs	vim
both vim s and emacs coding satisfy these requirements.

1985247
emacs	vim	jedit	emacs	jedit	vim
here is a simple modeline generator which generator modelines for vim emacs and jedit

1985376
attributes	properties
these attributes have to following properties

1985385
google-chrome	firefox
the problematic part for me is the inclusion of javascript file - it works ok in firefox and google-chrome but ie 7 and 8 as i tested behaves strange

1985393

don t forget to mark this field as protected to be visible in inheritors or public to be visible both in inheritors and from outside the class

1985448
protected	public
if the access modifiers of the named field is public or protected you will be able to access it in your derived classes

1985448
protected	public
the modifiers public will make it visible to all other classes while protected will restrict visibility to the derived classes

1985467
contains	elements
the first row is actually the one contains the elements

shallow size refers to how much memory is taken up by an object not including any child object it contains

1985610
versioning	upgrade
that way .when the database gets upgrade the sproc would get upgrade as well to match the new schema and you wouldn t have to worry as much about whether the code versioning matched the database versioning or not

1985644
default	reset
a reset stylesheet will reduce browser inconsistencies like default line height margins and fonts sizes of headings

1985650

sql-server	postgresql
after moving from micro.soft sql-server which has a free edition but anyway to postgresql i was blew away that people pay .so much for sql-server

1985791

i m sure there will be an easy way out of this given the extensibility of wcf and asp.net-mvc

1985793
wikitext	bbcode
however one key design decision is common to each should i provide the user with a simplified markup such as wikitext markdown or bbcode forcing users to learn that or should i give them a wysiwyg editor like ckedit or tinymce and filtering or transform the resulting html behind the scenes

1985801
lgpl	gpl
only for the gpl and lgpl code

1985802
communication	messages
sound service-oriented-architecture dictates that you use messages based communication regardless of whether your service is on another machine in another process in another appdomain or in your appdomain

1985815
asp.net-mvc	wcf
this may not be the easiest or least time-consuming answer but one thing you can do is avoid using the add service reference option and then copy your contract interfaces to your asp.net-mvc application and initiate the connection to wcf manually without automatically creating a service proxy

1985834
subtract	time
you can then subtract time to get elapsed time in milliseconds

1985848
margins	padding
either rearrange the source code or use float left on the centering set and use padding margins to place where you want

lgpl	gpl
now many probably most pieces of mpl licensed software are distribute under a dual license in which you may choose to use and distribute the software under the terms of the mpl or under the terms of the gpl or sometimes lgpl

1985894
lgpl	gpl
but in that case you shouldn t list the mpl in the list of licenses you are distributing software under because inorder to link to software release under the gpl you must be using the gpl or lgpl option of the dual-license

1985894
lgpl	gpl
in particular the gpl and lgpl do not required you to provide source code to anyone else in these cases

1985906
updating	updates
for example for simple counters and similar metrics apps will often queue up their updates and have a single thread in charge of updating shared state asynchronously from the queue

1985944

find a nice javascript toolkit like jquery or prototype mootools dojo ... that has an ajax implementation and use it

1986507
base-class	inherited
is it possible to make all the classes inherited from the same base-class

1986507
reflection	runtime	subclassing	base-class
if .so one thing you could consider would be at runtime in the base-class s constructor use reflection to validation that the subclassing is following the rules you describe and throw an exception-handling if it fails your validation rules

1986533
implements	extends
you can extends the elements class by using implements methods

1986562
instances	private
_buttonflags is a private instances struct

1986562
instances	private
as a side-note a variables prefaced with _ is usually a private instances variables

1986571
any	set
in any case the basic idea is to somehow set the itemgrid to a collections of object whose shared public properties can be found by reflection

1986575
activation	account
back on the launchd and activation permissions page highlight the network service account and checked the local launchd and local activation checkedbox

1986578

av foundation is a new and fairly high-level api for recording and playing audio on the iphone os

1986595
punctuation	tokenize
.when you calculate the hash be sure to pass the phrases through a tokenize that will remove punctuation and whitespace

1986609
low-level	hardware
and in your ioproc fill the buffering yourself listen for hardware changes and deal with real-time threading and a lot of other low-level stuff

1986633
firefox	safari
in css 3 you can use border-radius which safari and firefox support currently as -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius

1986641
g++	gcc
without any real life experience with gcc g++ it seems to me that it supports every major platform one can imagine .so code that compiles on g++ can run on almost any systemd

1986675
json	xml
in the above case i am expecting text back from the server but this can be xml html or more json

1986678
json	xml
for this reason a lot of web apps use json or xml

1986678
put	get
for instances if your api has a methods that will return some information about a user you ll need to building up an http-request in your iphone client and send it to the server via the api url specifying whether it is a get or put or other types of http-request

1986691
progress-bar	progress
and subscribe to the reportprogress of the backgroundworker to make your progress-bar progress

1986698

for linux and other unix x11 based

1986714
json	xml
xml json html

1986717
base-class	inherited
basically they are three different detail views which all inherited from a single base-class which in turn implements a single interface

1986717
user-controls	tabcontrol
then i have a composite user-controls that adds the individual detailviews 1-3 on a tab on the tabcontrol

1986718
contains	any
as the c-standard-library does not contains a sign x function of any sort i don t know how you justify your views

1986718
double	int
there s an abs int and fabs double and fabsf float and fabsl long but no mention of sign

1986718
instances	self
if x is an instances of a user-defined class which implements the __abs__ self methods then abs x will call x.__abs__

1986742
environment	building
after all having people in diverse environment building the code is sort of the points

1986747
llvm	gcc
both intel compiler and llvm are faster than gcc

1986749
python	java	python	c++
whether you re using python c++ c# java whatever you should always look to the built-in data-structures first

1986753
show	next
it also show the current time next to the named to each time zone in my list

1986753
any	set
the problem is i think the previous set time zone for the page the code above i think it is messing the time in my dropdownlistfor if i show the current time on the page it is correct to my time zone if i look at time in the dropdownlistfor they are hours off any idea how i can do this

1986755
g++	gcc
several project use gcc g++ as a day-to-day compiler for normals use but every .so often will checked to make sure their code follows the standards with the comeau c++ compiler

1986755
strict	let
compiling every .so often with a compiler as strict as comeau or even better compiling with as many compilers as you can get your hands on will let you know of errors people might experience .when trying to compile your code things your compiler allows you to do that it shouldn t and potentially things that other compilers don t allow you to do that you should

1986756
selected	button
i have sounds files in my res raw folder and i want to selected a sound to set as a ringtone on the click of a button

1986761
python	c++
it s not possible to implements something like a c++ vector in python since you don t have arrays primitive the way c++ do

1986777
design-time	designer
we had similar issues as the designer seems to use formload at design-time not what you would expect

1986796
contains	elements
or you could selected only s that contains a elements as the first child

1986805
shell	bash
on bash shell i types ctrl-z and then kill 1 to break out and kill since ctrl-c won t work

1986849
any	set
is there any way to easily get the tite description url-for a specific user set in flickr

1986880
final	super
.when i changed the text this is a test to this is a super test in the pdf file itself i was able to change the final pdf file and it opened in foxit

1986912
value	field
i would combine the value into one encode field except that i need to query each value separately at time

1986930
realloc	free
if realloc fails you lose the original pointers and realloc does not free the original memory .so you will get a memory leak

1986938
external	root
more importantly however i don t like installing external debs and other stuff as root because it can interfere with the packaging systemd pollute systemd directory and break things in ugly or worse unrecoverable ways

1986941
callback	methods
actually i use the wrapper from the ios recipes book because they give nice block callback rather than needing to implements delegation methods

1986950
widget	button
the problem is yahoo s code for the button widget handles the click event and in it they programatically submit the form

1986955
ip-address	hostname
ip-address or hostname in jdbc url is wrong

1986955
authentication	login
you would have gotten a login failed or not authentication sqlexception otherwise

1986960
attributes	properties
the viewmodel properties are already decorated with dataannotation attributes for validation .so i was hoping that i could defined .some rules that does

1986971
streamreader	streamwriter
you should put the streamreader and streamwriter in using blocks .so that they will be dispose even if an exception-handling occurs

1986980
put	get
it turns out that i want to also get back some db.assets that do not have relations in db.assetbundles however i am not sure how to do this i want to put empty spaces blank strings in the place of the bundle field of the recentlycreatedassetviewmodel .when there is no relation

1986981
distutils	buildout
distutils and easy-install in addition to buildout

1986988
export	csv
i would also suggest providing your users with a collections of example files in various formats excel access etc and give them explicit instructions for how to enter the data they want and step by step instructions to export as csv and upload

1987019
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary	tuples	set
python gives you some powerful highly optimized data-structures both as built-in and as part of a few modules in the standard-library list s and dictionary s of course but also tuples s set s arrays s in module arrays and some other containers in module collections

1987019
python	java
.when you need something more than the rich libs provides consider the fact that an object s attributes and items in collections are essentially pointers to other object without pointer-arithmetic reseatable references in python just like in java

1987019
python	java	python	c++
in python you normally use a none value in an attributes or item to represent what null would mean in c++ or null would mean in java

1987025
pointers	stack
i m not sure how your implementation of stack works but i see that you push into stack a pointers and then you pop an object

1987025
children	tree
.when you insert the newnode into the tree remember to set newnode s left and right children to null maybe you already do that in your constructor but i m not sure

1987037
32-bit	16-bit
i would bet it s because the natural words size on your machine is 32-bit and doing 16-bit operations actually puts more strain on the systemd to cut and mask the bits

1987046
required	checked
checked request parameter for the required page and offset based on the numbers of items to display on the page

1987053
common-lisp	lisp
it s a conventions used in other lisp such as common-lisp to distinguish between special variables as distinct from lexical variables

1987055
strcpy	memcpy
in other words in some implementation you d probably have to use strcpy not memcpy to force the data into the controlled sequences like that

1987055
strcpy	memcpy
while in some other implementation you d have to use memcpy and not strcpy

1987058
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql it is easy with limit and offset clauses

1987066
contains	any
at any specific time the receive buffering is going to contains a numbers of bytes that are not guaranteed to correspond in any way to application messages boundaries .so clearing it might get rid of many correct messagess and possibly leave only a partials messages for the next read

1987066
communication	messages
this is by the way a common mistake made by beginning network programmers since if your application communication only rarely it might appear as if tcp preserve messages boundaries

1987087
getter	setter
if however you use a dao you end up not being able to trivially extends the data object one of the strengths of xml and you have to create getter and setter for the object that do

1987096
webforms	asp.net
i ve been trying to integrated the jquery-ui-datepicker into our asp.net webforms application

1987101
nested	order
as an order list nested with questions and some groupinging as links to view response by question or by grouping

1987101
nested	order
as an order list nested with response append to each question

1987104
ip-address	hostname
you must pass an hostname or ip-address here .so localhost is good but isn t

1987106
binary	hex
i can open a file in a hex editor and know that each 2 digits is a byte they are 8 digits in binary correct

1987132
contains	elements
.when you checked the request value at the second postback all the hidden elements that haven t been modified between 1st and 2nd postback will contains true

1987135
authentication	login
i am creating an application for which i am trying to use ldap with authlogic for login authentication

1987137
children	tree	traversal	parent
write a custom class extends zend_db_table_rowset that has a function to iterate over the rows in the rowset setting parent and children references .so that you can subsequently traversal them as a tree

1987137
children	tree
then you can call getchildren also on any of these intermediate children and recursively output a tree in any format you want

1987147
.net	wcf
the wcf service is hosted in a windows service running on the .net 4.0 platform

1987150
unique	words
this means you ll have two unique non-repeating numbers on your invoices table and the obvious one invoices_no will not be the primary key but it can and should be unique .so there s a bit of evil creeping in but the alternative - which is to create the invoices row with one value in the primary key then change the primary key after the invoices is created - is just too evil for words

1987153
paradox	dbase
filext has limited information and almost no signature on the types i need specifically .db for paradox dbase iv sql anywhere novell groupwise progress and oracle and .dat for clarion and dbisam

1987156
glsl	hlsl
look into hlsl glsl cg or you can do the shader in assembly

1987157
cursor	row
where current of cursor .when the row is a duplicates of the previous row

1987169
sql-server	mysql
i think sql will be very efficient but don t want to install a server like sql-server or mysql all i need is a simple engine i can import the data into and then do a few queries from the local machine

1987180
digits	base
.when you use a hex editor to view a byte you see two digits because the hex value are in base sixteen

1987184
environment	building
the problem of including not including the correct files per deployment environment should be delegated to one or two ant building scripting

1987188
boost	stl
i would recommend effective c++ effective stl boost beyond the stl the important thing to note is that there are no game specific design-patterns

1987189
zend-framework	codeigniter
as for specifics i m using zend-framework but it will be similar in codeigniter

1987193
selected	cell
i ve been trying to find out how to selected all cell under a column with a mouse right click+menu+selected this column .

1987214
selected	cell
loops through the cell in the column and set their selected properties to true

1987230
textures	fbo
rendering into an opengl textures using an fbo

1987230
textures	fbo
draw from the fbo textures to a glxpixmap which is attached to an x pixmap

1987230
textures	fbo
step 3 works great and step 2 works fine if i replace the fbo textures with normals opengl drawing

1987236
contains	elements
in html the doctype must come first followed by a single elements which must contains a elements containss a elements followed by a elements

1987236
any	set
for this reason html5 specifies that any meta tag which is used to specify the character set either or simply must be within the first 1024 bytes of the file inorder to take effect

1987266
profiling	debugging
as far as you re allowed to install stuff on the server xdebug is the way to go for both debugging and profiling

1987286
derived-class	base-class
i hope to get the derived-class types from a pointers points to the base-class and defined a variables of or a pointers to the derived-class

1987306
python	lua
possibly scripting support - lua python javascripting

1987313
reflection	runtime
i ve written my own annotations but i checked them at runtime using the reflection api rather then at building time

1987314
ip-address	proxy
i wouldn t depend on that as a reliable client ip-address though since not all proxy servers honor that http header and it could also be easily spoofed

1987317
selected	button
selected a button presents a slideup screens from the bottom covering the tabbar

1987317
selected	button
this is not a modal screens as witnessed by the fact that you can selected a different button from above and the picker will dynamically change

1987317
selected	button
i can dynamically change the picker in the slideup screens by selected different button

1987317
height	frame
in short increasing the tabbarcontroller.view.frame height effectively makes the frame larger than the screens and the tabbar which is anchor to the bottom is removed from the user s view

1987326
value	field
field value

1987326
value	field
field value

1987347
selected	cell
is there a way to keep the selected cell of a datagridview selected after the datasource is changed

1987356
16-bit	8bit
if you don t mind the doubling of spaces required to store each 8bit byte into a 16-bit char and you don t need the string to be composed of printable characters you could do it the direct way

1987356
16-bit	8bit
you could write more elaborate code to pack two 8bit bytes into each 16-bit unicode char but then you d have to handle the special cases of odd byte arrays lengths which could be done using an extra sentinel byte in the last character

1987357
throttling	throttle
i would suggest throttling the bandwidth on the network http-request .when connect to cellular and having no throttle on wifi

1987368
.when	ready
.when ready to submit your git commit into p4 use git-p4 submit

1987453
any	set
i can t find any keypress handler being set .so this might be a conflict between two of the javascript components you are using

1987471
any	set
another person with this problem who unfortunately can t do any better than set the projection like i did

1987478
duplicates	elements
i would recommend first getting a list of all elements and then iterate through the list and add them to a dictionary to detection duplicates

1987487
shell	bash
here s a bash shell scripting to do the calculation which gives an answer of 523128 after about a quarter-second of calculation

i m setting up teamcity as my build-server

1987508
dreamweaver	notepad++
i have tried modifying it using notepad++ and dreamweaver

1987509
revision	updates
this is even simpler because you can change the current revision in one updates instead of two

1987509
revision	updates
updates re your updatess question i agree that proper relational design would encourage two tables .so that you could make a few attributes of a .post invariant for all that .post s revision

1987510
append	input
if you are using ajax to push the image to the server try returning a taconite response which makes multiple changes sticks the id in one place append a hidden input someplace else etc. to your dom

1987515
textbox	button
wrap everything in a form tag and place the textbox and a button in there

1987519
put	get
this gets called by the process methods which is in turn called by the get .post head or put methodss

1987520
any	set
nothing prevents you from using the characters in such a way that the bytes correspond to utf-8 which you should by the way but it s your responsibility to send the appropriate content-type header before any output is sent and or meta-tag to make sure the page is interpreter correctly and to ensure any database connections use the proper character set

1987538
wmv	mp3
i ve got some heavily modified code that ultimately came from the windows media sdk that works great for reading tags out of mp3 and wmv files

1987556
text-editor	editor
you can shorten the display in each tab under tools - options - text-editor - editor tab and status bar

1987561
file-descriptor	stdin
first of all stdin is file-descriptor 0 zero rather than 1 which is stdout

1987584
jeditable	jquery
i am using jquery jeditable which idealy would want something like

1987598
contains	elements
then you get a list of all direct children in this elements but these children contains their children

1987602
virtual-method	destructor
i understand why calling a virtual function from a constructor is bad but i m not sure why defining a destructor would result in a pure virtual-method called exception-handling

1987605
quirks-mode	doctype
if you re inspector the doctype to determine if you re in quirks-mode or not this is known to be cross-browser

1987610
if-statement	loops
i tried using two different loopss one for the portfolio then inside that using another loops to get all the files by doing an if-statement to compare if it belonged to the portfolio but i would prefer to find out if i can get it out of mysql first

1987687
interface-builder	iboutlet
the uitextfield has to be connect to your file through interface-builder and declare as an iboutlet in your header file

1987693
value	field
the same query for mms returns a bunch of nulls or numeric value field that i can t make any sense of

1987709
json	xml
specifically i am wondering...if i decide to use xml or json as the format how do i return the data in that format for the client application to use

1987714
instances	self
c is an instances attributes set directly on self

1987723
instance-variables	class-variables
instances of the class may have different value for their instance-variables but they shared the same class-variables

1987735
blackberry-simulator	blackberry
if your aim is to very specifically target blackberry then why not set up your development-environment to deploy a hello world .app to a blackberry-simulator as your first step

1987740
webforms	asp.net
for asp.net webforms i have always needed the following server login machine_name asp.net

1987759
linux	osx
.so fromutf8 would work on linux and osx but it won t work on windows

1987783
value	field
this can either be passed as a urlencoded string like para1 val1 para2 val2 ... or as an arrays with the field named as key and field data as value

1987788
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome but in ie6 7 8 i m getting a this cmd is not supported error messages

1987789
javascript	dom
an alternative methods would be to use the javascript dom to replace the field with the replacechild function of a nodes

1987803
jms	jta
xml xslt ejb jms jta and junit

1987803
websphere	ibm
and or ibm websphere application

1987803
spring	jsf
j2ee frameworks like spring and jsf

1987803
cvs	git
subversion git cvs

1987803
linux	unix
unix linux environment

1987805
scheme	lisp
learn a dialect of lisp scheme is currently quite popular

1987806
haskell	scheme	haskell	python	smalltalk	scheme
many languages have support for arbitrarily large numbers including in alphabetical order haskell icons python scheme and smalltalk among others

1987806
haskell	c++
if you are willing to try another language besides c++ i would recommend using haskell because it has very good facilities for creating new numeric types and you can use quickcheck to test your numeric types automatically which is a tremendous time-saver and bug-finder

1987812
getter	setter
you can apply scoping to properties getter setter

1987845
scheme	lisp
lisp ml and scheme all permit body to have side-effects

1987845
scheme	lisp
in lisp and scheme the closure stores the location of the free variables

1987858
sql-server	mysql
i have to do four things install .net 3.5 install sql-server 2005 and run mysql scripting on the server and create the database and install my application how to do it in a single setup-project using visual-studio 2005 2008

1987874
authentication	login
.when connecting locally to a sql-server on the same hosts the network service authentication as itself and you need to grant login permissions to it but .when it connect remotely to a sql instances on a different hosts the network service will authentication itself as the hosts machine account domain machinename and that account needs to be granted login permissions

1987875
emacs	vim
not real ides but still very popular development environment emacs vim

1987877
emacs	vim
on linux ides like emacs vim geany code blocks netbeans use gcc as their compiler

1987889
comma	words
.so this query finds all rows where it finds the matching words in the set of comma separated value

1987892
executable	jar
i know about class jar executable format

1987932
button	popup
a user click on the fb-login button the popup appears and they authentication the popup closes and the on-login function is called

1987932
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the popup redirects to the canvas url and doesn t close

1987932
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have googled and it seems to be something to do with the xd-receiver.htm file however it seems weird that it is working in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or safari

1987933
implements	abstract
one solution is to provide both an interface and an abstract implementation that implements the convenience-methods

1987933
abstract-class	subclassing	implements	abstract
.so client can subclassing from the abstract-class and just implements the abstract methods

1987940
put	get
and then you wrap all your puzzle put them in a map and get them out again hellip

1987963
order	add
.so if you then subclassing and add .some new invariant perhaps for example you make add add things to a separate containers to store the insert order or whatever there are many variations on containerss that are useful in different applications you now have to know if addall call add

1987963
linked-list	nodes
specifically a methods can manipulate nodes links and thus use an in-place merge sort--something difficult or impossible for any reasonable linked-list interface

1987965
cygwin	gnu
if you are on windows you can have gnu diff distribute with cygwin from www.cygwin.com

1988006
32-bit	16-bit
for example let s say early versioning of microsoft s c compiler had a 16-bit int and a 32-bit long

1988006
32-bit	64bit
now let s go forwarding a few years to a time where microsoft c uses a 32-bit int and a 64bit long

1988022
cassini	iis
what are the advantages of cassini over iis

1988023
variables	boolean
both of these will ensure than variables is a boolean value but the latter seems more clear

1988023
boolean	double
the double exclamation mark is something i ve only heard of in javascript which doesn t have boolean typecasting

1988034
cassini	iis	any	set
cassini doesn t claim to be multithreading or handle any of the advanced e-tags or other header control issues that can be issues with iis but are also usually set at sensible default in later versioning of iis

1988035
getter	setter
the basic idea is to have a builder class that has setter but usually not getter for the different constructor parameters

1988035
constructor	private
the outer class s constructor is often private

1988035
required	checked
you can add runtime checked or you can use this only for optional-parameters and make required parameters normals parameters to either foo or the builder s constructor

1988065
macros	let
don t let the shortcomings of c and c++ s lame macros sour you on the power of compile-time resolved code

1988075
cassini	iis
will launchd the built-in cassini webserver not iis

1988087
background-color	transparency
if you draw a 50 transparency versioning of the active image you need to erase with the background-color first

1988088
environment	building
however in the building environment the above mentioned error occurs

1988088
environment	building
building environment versioning 9.00.1399.00

1988105
temporary	copy
temporary copy of the data to be used

1988117
return-type	arguments	void	main
.when you launchd a java application it looks for a static methods with the named main return-type void and a single arguments of an arrays of strings

1988117
return-type	arguments
overloading is providing multiple methods with the same named but different arguments and potentially return-type

1988150
qtextdocument	qpainter
i tried using qtextdocument in html and alternatively qpainter

1988161
return-value	arguments
in rubycocoa a methods will return the methods s return-value and then any double indirection arguments source

1988168
decimal-point	digits
keep count the digits as long as it s a valid floating-point numbers 1 or more digits then optional a decimal-point with 1 or more digits after it

1988168
decimal-point	digits
collect the digits into a floating-point numbers by shifting powers of 10 before decimal-point multiplying by 10.0 and add new numbers after decimal-point divide by a growing power of 10 and add

1988191
order	add
my idea is user can mix the order of base32 arrays as per requirement and can add similar looking characters like i and 1 etc

1988199
low-level	hardware
in theory yes but you ll still have to have some low-level assembly code to bootstrap the java viewmodel that will run on the machine and also low-level code for accessing hardware drivers

1988205
strncpy	strcpy
the solution is to either make messages a pointers if your strings are all known at compile-time or if you don t mind dynamically allocation memory or to use strcpy strncpy i personally don t like strncpy because it might not null-terminated the destination

1988213
ogre	sdl
the problem ends up being that ogre s mac gl backend does not honor the currentglcontext option .so the best .solution is to change to sdl 1.3 directly from subversion as of time of writing and use the sdl_createwindowsfrom call to start getting events from a windows created by ogre

1988213
ogre	sdl
it should also be noted that the ogre windows needs to have the macapi set to cocoa or else sdl won t recognize the windows handle

1988221
arrays	loops
loops through the arrays and updates the dom elements by converting the arrays index to the corresponding row and column in the matrix

1988242
dialog	pop-up
for example my service class has a showdialog methods that takes a frameworkelement and show it in dialog styles either as a windows for windowss application or as a pop-up on a page for xbap

1988247
contains	set
considered narrowly as breaking up a sufficiently high-quality 2d bitmap into rectangles each contains an identified latin character of one of a set of well-behaved prespecified fonts cf

1988257
virtual-machine	virtualbox
a words of advice use a virtual-machine like virtualbox for running the modified kernel - this way you can easily experiment without harming any real hardware

1988263
account	in-app
however if i add a new page payment.html.erb in-app views user restart the server and visit account payment i get

1988267
httpd.conf	hosts
i have done the cname configuration and added below virtual hosts configuration in httpd.conf file

1988282
linked-list	arrays
if your arrays is going to be large and or you are going to rotate a lot you might want to consider using a linked-list instead of an arrays

1988293
margins	padding
you need to add another div around the links or they can t have padding margins at the same time as being relatively sized

1988293
margins	padding
unless your padding and margins are also relative

1988293
margins	padding
inside the a -tag causes it to automatically fill the parent tag .so no width is needed and the padding and margins are automatically adjusted for

1988293
margins	padding
the alternative is of course to set a fixed width to the links taking into account the padding and margins and the max width but you d end up with a floating-point pixels value which isn t .so nice

1988296
ubuntu	linux
each linux distribution has it s own set of programs and features you can change around to your liking but i doubt you want to edit everything that comes in a standards distribution like ubuntu as recompiling everything each time to see changes will take a while

1988313
contains	elements
.when the user click the displayobject contains the bitmap data a sprite in which the bitmap is draw using a bitmap fill or that wrap a bitmap look in your model which of your game elements was hit by that click

1988313
click	mouse
here whenever the player click the world graphics loops tries to find that elements which was directly under the mouse positioning

1988345
any	set
this relies on that there is a given background-color at any time that the pixels can be set to and that you can identify the colors to remove

1988363
python	perl
i m not up-to-date on everything with python but my first idea about this benchmarking was the difference between perl and python numbers

1988363
python	perl
i see similar results for the original benchmarking on my macbook air 32-bit using a perl 5.10.1 that i compiled myself and the python 2.5.1 that came with leopard

1988364
gentoo	linux
for the specifics install any linux distribution then install the kernel source package gentoo will probably install this by default

1988385
python	java	python	c++
i am looking for documentation on how to commonly do the technical part of publishing the source of first open source project in particular with library-intensive stuff in c++ java python

1988395
command-line	cmd
nothing prevents you from issuing these cmd directly on the command-line

1988396
nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
using nsurlconnection the timeout is set in the nsurlrequest and the default in the nsmutableurlrequest request is 60 seconds and can be changed using the settimeoutinterval methods

1988400
contains	any
in an ideal world the manifest of a structural types should be equals to the manifest of any types contains the required methods

1988421
canvas	scale
i m trying to do an matrix animation where i both scale and transpose a canvas at the same time

1988428
any	set
set a default-value for the properties .so that it has a value .when you don t pass any value to the page

1988435
assign	add
one could add management modifiers cards which can speed up or slowdown the pace of your dev team good bad managers and are assign at the start of the game make their bonuses kind of small .so as to not make them too unfair

1988482
arrays	loops
there s also an error in your loops you need rather .when checked against the length of the history arrays

1988484
python	c++
i have to ports a c++ stl application to python

1988516
binary	hex
by using binary int often expressed in hex or

1988522
python	c++
if i were you i would take the time to learn how to properly use the various data-structures available in python instead of looking for things that are similar to what you know from c++

1988522
python	c++
doing this the python way would help you and more importantly future maintainers who will wonder why you try to program c++ in python

1988522
python	c++
just to whet your appetite there s also no reason to prefer stl s styles to python and for the recording i m also a c++ programmer who knows stl throughly consider the most trivial example of constructing a list and traversal it

1988536
autotools	gnu
as you seem to be writing linux apps you might want to take a look at the gnu autotools such as autoconf

1988545
multiplication	division
.so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1988552
negative-number	zero
you d pad on the left with binary zero or ones in a two s complement representation of a negative-number

1988552
addition	division
the problem with ascii is that manipulating the numbers is harder addition is fairly simple but imagine what division would look like

1988555
decrement	increment
a semaphore object is like a special counter that can be atomically increment and decrement across threads or process if created shared

1988562
digits	zero
in fixed width you choose some limit to the size for example 10 digits and pad with zero if it is less

1988571
autotools	cmake
nowadays some applications use cmake instead of autotools the stufff with configure scripting

1988594
python	c++
for the most part the c++ brain-cramping doesn t exist in python

1988594
python	c++
often the management reason for converting c++ to python is to get rid of the c++ complexity

1988594
python	c++
while it s generally true that python is slower than c++ it s also true that picking the right algorithm and data structure can have dramatic improvements on performance

1988594
python	c++
it s possible that your c++ has a really poor algorithm and you will see comparable performance from python

1988594
python	c++
it s also possible that your c++ program is i o bound or has other limitations that will leave the python running at a comparable speed

1988610
autotools	automake
if you develop for pthreads linux platform or you work only with mingw under win32 that i would suggest to learn how to work with autotools -- autoconf automake libtool and friend

1988610
configuration	installation	installation	packaging
it gives you source-code packaging configuration testing installation

1988622
attributes	properties
if the elements has an id attributes and if it has a value attributes then you can use value properties

1988625
selected	textbox
basically i needed to implements a combobox that insert or append an item selected from the dropdownlistfor to the textbox instead of replacing all text in the textbox

1988625
selected	textbox
if the textbox has some text selected that selection would be replace with an item selected from the dropdownlistfor

1988625
selected	textbox
if the textbox has no text selected an item chosen from the dropdownlistfor would be append in the textbox field

1988625
selected	textbox	textchanged	textbox
as it turned out i could not achieve this behavior by handling a combinations of combobox s events such as selectedindexchanged selectionchangecommitted textchanged etc. because the combobox control would finally synchronized the textbox field with the selected item from the dropdownlistfor without raising any further events afterwards

1988636
greenhopper	alm
the atlassian product line for alm is is great jira greenhopper confluence fisheye crucible bamboo

1988648
python	java
one-class-per-file is a java habit that is frowned on in python

1988657
performance-testing	profiling
i do feel that its use prior to profiling and performance-testing to be premature-optimization

1988665
children	nodes
reordering the children of a nodes should distinctly change the resulting hashcode

1988668
xcopy	cmd
error 1 the cmd xcopy d users johndoe document visual-studio 2008 project myproject myproject.modules.ribbon bin debugging myproject.modules.ribbon.dll

1988671
shopping-cart	cart
i have a quick problem i have a remove button for a shopping-cart and the code works for it everytime except for the last product thats in the cart

1988675
xcopy	cmd
your xcopy cmd failed for some reason

1988675
command-prompt	command-line
run the same command-line in a command-prompt and see what error it printing

1988676
textbox	button
a textbox a list box and a button combine to create a control designed to simplify a common methods of providing a compact user-interface for simplified textinput and selection

1988676
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
therefore my suggestion would be to separately create the textbox listbox and button and manually defined how they interact rather than trying to fight the pre-definedd behavior of the combo box

1988687
textbox	button
you want a textbox and a button that .when click gives you a dropdownlistfor of tokens which can be insert into the textbox

1988687
textbox	button
notice that the button is not typically inside the textbox but a completely separate button

1988702
children	tree
to hash a tree hash its root pick a child numbers h mod n where n is the numbers of children of root and recursively hash the subtree of this child

1988702
children	nodes
hash root first than hash one of nodes that are its children then one of children of the children etc

1988710
conditional	operators
i wrote a pure ruby implementation of ruby s boolean operators and conditional expression once for fun

1988717
32-bit	x86
knowing that it is running on x86 we have the int datatype with 32-bit

1988742
environment	building
in a codeigniter environment what exactly is considered a broken building

1988742
environment	building
how do you configure your codeigniter environment is every revision built or only the newest versioning after each complete building or do you use time based checked for new revs

1988756
any	set
breaking a building is preventing any user that relies on the same standards tools and set of code than your codeigniter environnment to get a compiling and running systemd

1988763
children	tree	children	nodes
now the hash of a tree is the hash of a string that is created as a concatenation of the hash of the current elements you have your own function for that and hash of all the children of that nodes from recursive call of the function

1988772
sftp	ftp	sftp	ssh	sftp	ftps	ftp	ssh	ftps	ftp
it supports regular ftp ftps explicit and implicit and sftp ftp + ssh

1988790
children	nodes
if however you want to have only the child nodes and not their children as well only the span elements but without their child elements you must use two expression

1988806
contains	set
the lookupaccountname call .when successful always results a sid that does not contains the full set of user rights

1988813
attributes	properties
properties or attributes from which to

1988829
bug-tracking	trac
as a project-management tool that integrated version-control bug-tracking tickets a wiki and more i wholeheartedly recommend trac

1988847
dictionary	arrays
its basic data types is a table which is a cross between a dictionary and an arrays which is very flexible and powerful

1988850
selected	cell
you can match what should be selecteded based on criterion specific to your needs and just set the selected properties of either the cell or row to true false depending on your matching

1988850
selection	cell
if you want to retain reapply cell selection the approach would be similar

1988850
selected	cell
to implements the same functionality for selected cell do something like the following

1988850
selected	cell
but the general principal of setting the selected cell is illustrated properly and can easily be tested and debugged for understanding i hope

1988858
pointers	stack
the temporary arrays made on stack will be free before you can use the pointers elsewhere

1988864
binary	octal
binary in the octal systemd base 2 the alien would write 1011

1988864
binary	octal
octal in the binary systemd base 8 the computer would use 13

1988900
autoresize	margins
then you just fill the open spaces at the right of a cell with another uilabel layout it to cover the open spaces and set it to autoresize it s width and set the right margins to be fixed

1988903
stderr	stdout
you need to redirect stderr to stdout by using and then pipe | to your logger process

1988928
required	checked
updates having just checked the foreign_key parameter shouldn t be required as long as the named of the foreign key is the named of the associations followed by _id which it is in this case

1988929
background-image	transparency
i tried giving it a transparency background-image

1988929
any	set
why won t the movie handle click any more .when set to transparency

1988930
selected	button
- list all tags like selected distinct tag for a autocomplete tag list and button tags like here on stackoverflow

1988931
javascript	dom
note that an applet is represented in the dom as a good-old javascript object which you can invoke methods on

1988949
difference	zero
if there are two numbers with the same difference it will choose the one closest to zero

1988954
contains	elements
the example contains templates for the child-elementss for the elements which then are process

1988957
web-applications	webserver
i run an apache 2.2 webserver to serve asp.net web-applications with mod_mono

1988958
canvas	scale
.when i set scale in in mxml the width and height of the canvas are adjusted accordingly

1988963
order	add
for example consider building a limited sequences of int hashcode tokens and add what you want to this sequences in the order of preferences

1988965
display	width
iphone users are used to propionate width text display

1988966
updating	updates
updates finally got around to updating this the devart guys have fixed the behavior in later versioning to work perfectly

1988988
freebsd	linux
on some platform that support separate namespaces for linker like windows os x and some commercial unices but not linux and freebsd you can workaround conflicts by stuffing code in a libs and only export the symbols from the libs you really need

1988990
pseudo-class	anchor
presumably the link pseudo-class does not apply to anchor tags without a href

1988991
webforms	asp.net
there is one restrictions - controls that required postback will not work as in asp.net webforms

1988997
32-bit	64bit
for the compilation process i al.so need to make .some adjustments i want to compile it at first for 32-bit and after that for 64bit operation systemd - .so i have to do two different compilations

1989004
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c specifications

1989024
postgresql	mysql
from what i ve seen at least on the web mysql and postgresql are the most ubiquitous free database systemd

1989033
32-bit	64bit
compile two versioning of the executable one for 32-bit and one for 64bit and combine them with lipo

1989036
32-bit	64bit
one mach-o executable file can contains both binaries for 32-bit and 64bit intel machines and the kernel runs the most appropriate ones automatically

1989036
32-bit	64bit
if you have a machine with 64bit cpu you can run a user-land program in a 64bit mode even .when the kernel is running in the 32-bit mode with leopard or snow leopard as long as all of the libs you link with are available with 64bit

1989039
silverlight	wpf
although this article was written about wpf you can now do all of the things in it with silverlight

1989050
sql-server	oracle
if you need to use databases in corporate environment then i would aim to test also oracle and sql-server which both have express versioning that can be install free for yourself

1989054
derived-class	base-class
.so now you have base-class vehicle.type and derived-class bus.type that mean completely different things

1989080
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql sqlite - pick one

1989080
postgresql	oracle
postgresql is more like oracle and in my opinion a bit more mature

1989084
perl	php
actually i can t even run a simple hello world perl scripting to run from a php scripting and handle the output

1989087
exception-handling	try-catch	required	checked
if it s a checked exception-handling the compiler will required that they wrap call to this methods in a try-catch block

1989117
unchecked-exception	checked-exceptions
in short unchecked-exception can be throw without a throw clause in the method-signature while any checked-exceptions must be indicated there

1989120
configuration	environment
because this is regarding mysql and php it brings in questions about your server configuration environment etc

1989127
tuples	set
basically we are mapping a predicates in the first-order predicates logic sense a set of tuples to binary relation form by creating an artificial entity the action key

1989129
instance-variables	local-variables
if there was a way to pull all arbitrary instance-variables into the local-variables scoping of fetchtemplate it would be possible to simply write

1989146
tuples	set	contains	set	contains	elements
in python you can add tuples to an unordered-set and ask the set if it already contains an elements that we seek

1989155
global-variables	call
add .some random call to random subroutine make it very alleatory try to fake the use of registry key and global-variables turn the hacker life in a hell .so he will eventually give up

1989171
mapping	unique
and last but not least if the pointers size is larger than 32-bit the mapping will not be unique

1989182
subclassing	inherited
you may be able to create a new class that is inherited from groupbox and subclassing it to intercept mouse move event

1989190
debugging	trace
you need to run a debugging building for the trace to be symbolicated

1989203
entity-framework	nhibernate	activerecord	datamapper
3 -- ok .so if you ab.solutely can t use an orm framework like nhibernate or god forbid entity-framework then i would suggest you adhere to one of the standards patterns that the orm frameworks use like activerecord or datamapper

1989203
activerecord	datamapper
martin fowler s activerecord and datamapper patterns both use an insert methods to persistent new object to the database

1989206
python	java
are there any server implementation that i can use without re-coding the ajax pages in java or least coding in java python

1989216
children	nodes
the page is not throw an error but none of the children nodes of the feed are showing under the parent

1989221
python	java	python	c++
python lists are not linked lists -- they re like java arrayslist s or c++ s std vector s in low-level terms a resizable compact arrays of pointers

1989221
python	c++
.so the performance characteristics of python lists are essentially those of c++ s std vector python append like c++ s push_back is o 1 but insert or removal in the middle is o n

1989221
python	c++
.so for purposes for which in c++ you d use a std set and rely on its being order a hashset wouldn t do -- python set s are hash-based not order you may be better off avoiding python built-in containers in favor of .something like this module if you need to keep things pure-python or this one which offers avl tree not rb ones but is coded as a c-implemented python extension and .so may offer better performance if c-coded extensions are ok

1989221
python	c++
boost-python the python extension package that wrap the powerful c++ boost libs might perhaps serve your purposes best

1989222
16-bit	8bit
does anyone know how to calculate the error of quantizing from 16-bit to 8bit

1989226
attributes	properties
in winforms i could add a category attributes to a custom control properties to specify which properties category should contains the properties

1989235
constructor	object
it seems logical that i would have a constructor methods for this class that took the student_id as an arguments .so i could reference it from within the object for all of those different crud operations

1989263
ticket-system	trac
bigger tasks should always be tracked by a ticket-system like trac or jira

1989265
http-redirect	request
cause the current response to perform an http-redirect to this path and call responsecomplete on the facescontext instances for the current request

1989280
16-bit	8bit
i think you need to convert both the 16-bit value and the 8bit value to their respective analog value that they represent and then take the difference between those

1989283
32-bit	64bit
but hashcode are 32-bit int and therefore hashcode can not be unique you can not map 64bit spaces to 32-bit spaces without collision

1989290
triggers	insert
defined an on-update triggers for table-a that insert the recording into table-b .when table-a.status is being changed to move

1989291
activerecord	datamapper
this is one of the reasons that ruby-on-rails upcoming move to merb has been generally seen as a positive move for ruby-on-rails as merb makes use of the datamapper pattern in addition to activerecord

1989294
javadoc	doxygen
and since doxygen can use javadoc styles comments i guess it is kind of easy to try it

1989301
random-access	sorted
i am asking because i need random-access nth .. to huge sorted vectors - which are now huge sequences after the sort with horrible o n random-access time

1989315
jvisualvm	jstat
use jvisualvm or jstat to observe if you re doing frequent garbage collections

1989316
any	set
there are of course good algorithms for that see for example the python source code for the networkx package but a brute-force one would simply start by copying the immediate adjacency mapping to the connection mapping then iteratively expand the sets until one iterator doesn t expand any set any longer

1989316
any	set
with the connections dictionary at hand all we have to do is examine every combinations of k nodes for example in python 2.6 or better itertools.combinationss range n k gives us those combinationss it s going to be a clique if it s a subset not necessarily a proper subset of course of the set of items connect to any one of its members

1989317
python	java
the server portio is written in c .so you dont need to worry about running a java or python server

1989322
spaces	output
.so checked to see if anything is output in that include or that the file include blank line spaces at the end of the facebook.php file

1989348
any	set
what i m looking for right now is a way to tell yaml load that any string that comes in should be treated as and therefore have its encoding set to utf-8

1989349
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseup
note ...at design-time if you defined the event handler for mouseup mousedown and mousemove while the control is on a form the parent of the control is the form and then cut and paste it into a containers like a panels you ll have re-establish the binding linkage between the control and the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events in the ide for it to work

1989373
stderr	stdout
namely the consts stdin stdout stderr and their variables counterparts

1989381
loading	png
in the iphone example of opengl-es the rocket ship one you can see the texture2d class which handles loading png s and display them

1989386
directory	folder
i have a simple .bat move.bat file in the sendto folder which move files and directory from any location to a specified folder by using the context menu

1989386
runas	cmd
it doesn t even work with cmd opened as admin runas

1989390
protected	public
also is db a protected or public variables

1989408
onmousedown	onkeydown
to keep tracking of the originator event capture the onmousedown and onkeydown events and set an internal indicator of the types of the latest one received .so you may checked for the later oncollapsing and onexpanding event process

1989425
lookup	any
my gut tells me to use the ip-address as to avoid resolving the named and avoid any unnecessary lookup

1989431
ubuntu	linux
i program c++ applications on ubuntu linux and compile them to 2 operating systemd natively to linux by using g++ gnu c++ compiler and cross-compiling them to windows by using i386-mingw32-g++ mingw c++ cross-compiling

1989431
ubuntu	linux
fortunately ubuntu offers precompile mesa3d libs libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev for linux but unfortunately there are not any precompile libs for using with mingw cross-compiling thus windows versioning of them - .so i must manually compile them from .source which can be downloading from homepage

1989431
environment	building
and also i would like to do all the required things to building up opengl environment from linux and using mingw32 for cross-compiling

1989437
freeglut	glut
freeglut is a reimplementation of the glut api under a mit license

1989437
freeglut	glut
there has been more development on freeglut and it has extensions to the api as well but in my experience there are some quirks of older versioning of glut that aren t replicated in freeglut

1989437
freeglut	glut
however if you just start using glut you might as well use freeglut

1989437
freeglut	glut
but i wouldn t recommend using glut or freeglut for windows management in the first place

1989450
png	gif
i have a png file which must be converted to a gif file

1989459
mongodb	couchdb
i think the most known one currently is couchdb but you can also go for tokyo-cabinet or mongodb

1989462
stderr	stdout
the variables let you give ruby different io object for stdout stdin stderr

1989479
alpha-transparency	alpha
png uses alpha-transparency meaning that each pixels in addition to its color also contains a value denoting how transparency it is called alpha

1989483
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
2010-01-01 13 40 35.183 timesheet 15382 20b terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - uisegmentedcontrol view unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x3f5c3e0

1989485
decrement	increment
well it isn t entirely clear what you are trying to do with the lock flags and understanding the code is critical with threading but in the absence of lock monitor i would expect to see a lot of interlocked for the increment .increment decrement .decrement test .compareexchange

1989492
png	gif
you could convert the png to a 256-color palette bitmap and replace any fully-transparent a 255 to colors.transparent and then save the new image as a gif

1989494
swing	swt
i m writing an application that has an swt gui currently but would like the end-users to be able to choose between swt and swing

1989499
swing	gwt
this will allow you to slot in a swing view in-place of a gwt view or vice versa with the minimum of duplicates code

1989500
markup	xhtml
i am a beginner and wants to have solid foundation of markup but as i started learning i found some people use html and some xhtml

1989522
any	set
i tried to set the button opaque to false but it didn t add any affect

1989536
jquery	.post
the code below is a jquery .post request javascript

1989549
any	set
i want to see if there are any .post variables set

1989560
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
simple _.post is an arrays contains all .post variables just count how any items are in the arrays and you know if there are any set

1989570
digits	zero
in marc s answer there is a leading zero in the hours if it is a single digits hour

1989573
dependency-injection	inject	dependency-injection	service-locator	service-locator	inject
use annotations to inject your dependencies rather than requesting them because you are thus turning a dependency-injection framework into a service-locator

1989580
tcp-ip	udp
transports such as tcp-ip and udp ip

1989582
markup	xhtml
what is important however is to write consistent and efficient markup and this is what the xhtml standards was designed to encourage

1989605
any	set
the trouble using any particular gui libs is that each gui comes with a set of basic design tenets that influence every use of the libs

1989620
oracle	mysql
not db2 not mysql not oracle not any-of-them

1989636
swing	swt
i m writing a gui .app that i want to use swing and swt

1989636
swing	swt	jface	swt
swt is what i prefer generally and i have been looking at jface but it seems like if i use its most powerful features i will increase the coupling between the gui and the model and make it far harder to abstract the gui .so swing can be used as well

1989645
value	field
double-click on it go the the image tab and copy-paste the value of the field command-line

1989646
value	field
if you store the encrypted value in a cookies or as a field in a form .post request then the credentials is no longer in the url and .so it can t be easily copy-paste note that i said easily

1989647
contains	elements
first insert data in sql and if success then where contains query of index elements from database

1989678
scala	java
i am using buildr with a java scala project

1989680
google-chrome	firefox
my logo has a difirefoxerent positioning in ie7 than in other browsers like ie8 firefox and google-chrome

1989681
postgresql	mysql
what are specific features from postgresql that are not available in mysql

1989684
processor	cpu
processor speeds have been advancing faster than disk and network speeds for decades and now individual cpu ops are rarely a concern particularly in your c++ case

1989708
linux	osx	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	osx
i have some piece of code that behaves differently under mac osx and linux ubuntu fedora ...

1989708
g++	gcc
the code is compiled with gcc g++

1989708
linux	osx
to my surprise this here works on both mac osx and linux

1989722
buffering	streaming
wrap your gzip streaming in buffering streaming this should give you a significant performance increase

1989722
buffering	streaming
using the buffering input output streaming reduces the numbers of disk reads

1989725
compression	streaming
you can obviously break a file into pieces and create independent compression streaming for each of the pieces that run in their own threads

1989747
contains	any
i want to checked if any of the arrayss contains in the outer arrays have the same value as

1989754
for-loop	arrays
in php in a for-loop if i want to create an arrays i just do

1989766
capture	player
the player move by pushing the arrow button on the keyboard .so i need to capture those keystrokes

1989776
arrays	loops
i assume you can t get any speed benefits from comparing the lengths before doing the inner loops as your arrays are of fixed size

1989777
glassfish	resin	glassfish	weblogic	weblogic	resin
jetty resin weblogic jboss glassfish - any of them will do

1989794
textarea	textbox
the view contains a textbox that is used for entering the contactname or contactaddress and a textarea that is used for the messages

1989794
textarea	textbox
the textarea which is set up the same way show the asterisk and also turns red and has a red border but the textbox does not

1989800
default	reset
the goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line height margins and fonts sizes of headings and .so on.

1989805
output	mode
however my problem is that while running it in debugging mode it gives the correct output of 5 for the input

1989813
facebook-apps	fbml
facebook-apps use the exact same markup as any regular html page html is a subset of fbml .so any regular multi-column layout will work just fine

1989815
getter-setter	getter	getter-setter	setter	getter	setter
i know that flex identifies serialization field in java by looking for a public getter-setter pair .so you can prevent serialization by simply not exposing a getter and setter

1989817
sql-server-express	sql-server
.when creating a new database with sql-server-express 2005 the database files .mdf and .ldf get stored in c program files microsoft sql-server mssql.1 mssql data by default

1989821
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i would say that two of the largest difference are with queries and window-functions -- standards sql features from the sql-99 standards that are also available in other major sql implementation such as oracle db2 sql-server ... but not in mysql

1989821
postgresql	mysql
mysql has some non-standard conveniences such as insert ignore and replace which postgresql lacks

1989821
python	java	python	perl	postgresql	mysql
postgresql s stored-procedures and triggers can use any of several languages such as python java perl ... mysql s like db2 s use the sql 03 standards syntax here

1989821
postgresql	mysql
also outside the standards postgresql has many peculiar data types including user-defined types and multi-dimensional arrays mysql has unsigned int

1989830
linux	unix	netbsd	linux
i know you said linux but distributions like netbsd are also a flavor of unix and they are much more approachable from a compiler-everything-from-source perspective

1989830
linux	bsd
linux is a collections of utilities and package from a lot of different places that are individually built while the bsd distributions have a specific source tree that can be built from the top of usr src with a single cmd

1989830
contains	elements
with the bsd distributions a single source tree contains the base systemd and a clear dividing line is draw between internal and external elements

1989872
anchor	iframe
assuming your iframe has id results and your anchor has id not named my_anchor this should work

1989873
textbox	button
suppose that you have a form which has two textbox and a labels and a button named add

1989876
arrays	loops
loops over arrays using foreach unless you explicit need a loops counter

1989882
contains	set
i am using jquery to clone a div boxcollection contains grouping groupbox each of which contains a set of input

1989897
contains	elements
and will contains an elements box with an arrays of three value

1989898
actionscript	mxml
mxml is translation into an actionscript class

1989900
mstest	nunit
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

1989916
show	next
show fine in firefox continue the url down to the next line nice and clean

1989926
mstest	nunit
.so if you end up with a mstest project use the above step to get nunit instead

1989926
mstest	nunit
note resharper 4.5 onwards does have native support for running mstest as well as nunit tests

1989929
order	join
i am going to just come out and say you need an index for the join to your order table

1989933
markup	xhtml
i do have some strings that contains programming code like xhtml asp.net markup c# c java and i want to display them with a syntax highlighter on my webpage

1989944
mongodb	couchdb
have a look at akka concerning async and couchdb or mongodb as datastores.

1989946
png	gif
ps the snippet above can open any types of image gif png and jpeg and it always saves the image as jpeg with 90 of quality i believe this is what you re trying to archive

1989953
jface	swt
jface call swt

1989955
stdin	pipe
yes you can startup the process with a pipe as its stdin and then write to the pipe

1989955
stdin	pipe
normally a parent process would be needed to do this which would create an anonmyous pipe and supply that to the child-process as its stdin - popen does this many libs also implements it see perl s ipc open2 for example

1989969
double	int
13 virtual double operators int i int j

1989969
double	int
17 virtual double operators int i int j

1989971
arguments	default
this is exactly the reason dictionary have a get methods and getattr has a third optional default arguments to make it easy to apply dry don t repeat yourself a very important maxim of good programming

1989974
linked-list	dictionary
i noticed the enumerator is often inherited and that it can be used with structures such as dictionary and linked-list

1990004
value	field
i have a form to which i want to add extra field depending on the value of a dropdownlistfor

1990010
callback	methods
i ve optimized the graphics used as much as i feel is possible .so i m wondering if it s possible to out.source the drawing by creating a new view and calling that view s drawrect from within a thread created inside of the timer s callback methods

1990010
animation	rotation
if i m wrong i d be open to seeing some example code that allows animation of all the images in separate transformation individual rotation for each image while still keeping them able to blend using kcgblendmodescreen that i m currently implements

1990013
firefox	safari
correction it used to be an ie only properties i see now it s been added to css3 and is supported by ie safari and firefox

1990035
selected	listbox	selected	button
i need to delete selected grouping from the listbox and datasource upon button click

1990035
selected	listbox
the problem is to get the id of the selected item in the listbox because many grouping can have the same groupname

1990043
base-class	inherited
also virtual inherited is a way to folding together the same base-class which appears twice

1990045
classname	inherited
use virtual inherited in the declaration of foobarclient foobarserver windowsfoobar and unixfoobar put the words virtual before the foobar base classname

1990086
mongodb	couchdb
i haven t got my hands dirty yet with neither couchdb nor mongodb but i would like to do .so .soon.

1990097
markup	xhtml
try running your site through an xhtml compliance tool to see if it comes back with any obvious markup issues

1990097
markup	xhtml
also checked your xhtml doctype is appropriate for your markup

1990117
directory-structure	filesystems
if you really understand the filesystems you re writing to you can make sure you re writing a contiguous block you just later split into multiple-files in the directory-structure

1990124
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
it s equivalent performance but it s easier to read syntax is supported on oracle sql-server postgresql etc and provides consistent left join support

1990131
rowdatabound	databound
and then in rowdatabound event selected the row .when the databound recording matches the key in the qs

1990172
fclose	fopen	fclose	fread	fopen	fread
here is a more elegant way of writing brianreavis solution also use file_get_contents instead of fopen fread and fclose it s faster and less verbose

1990191
synchronous	.when
also .when you publishing a messages using jms - if its persistent - it will be sent synchronous and the send methods won t return until the messages is stored on the broker s disk - this is important - if you don t want to run the risk of loosing messagess in the event of failure

1990196
postgresql	mysql
what are specific features from postgresql that are not available in mysql

1990209
listbox	textbox
then clear your listbox and search the list for the item entered in the textbox

1990227
python	c++	data-structures	dictionary
since the list dictionary and set data-structures which are bolted on to c++ via the stl are native to core python then their usage is incorporated into common python code idioms

1990227
python	c++
if you want to give google another shot try looking for references for python for c++ programmers

1990227
python	c++
as others have said if you are looking for a plug-and-chug formula to convert stl c++ code to python you will just end up with bad python

1990227
python	java	python	c++
i had this very experience .when introducing python to one of our managers who was familiar with java and c++ iterator

1990236
debian	linux
the target systemd where mysql is running is a debian linux

1990254
scrollable	grid
do you have any scrollable lists or data grid

1990262
put	get
i don t know where to put the .jar and the .class files .so the client can read use the applet and i can t even get around the error for 2 weeks of searching now

1990262
directory	folder
i can give the whole directory folder files structure in the project if needed

1990262
directory	folder
and i have them also in the other web folder the one in the same directory as building

1990262
ubuntu	linux
operating systemd is linux ubuntu 9.10

1990270
ubuntu	debian
for instances debian and i guess ubuntu ask you to use the following cmd to reconfigure the locale settings

1990280
gitosis	repo
i have an autodeploy bash scripting to get updates repo to tmp in post-receive hook on gitosis

1990292
overlap	margins
then in the second pass your code would decline to move b to the left margins because the first attempt to move it would overlap with e

1990303
any	set
but in general any piece of data that is somehow associated with some behavior like set of functions macros etc

1990317
twitter	tweets
i want to be able to import my tweets from twitter into drupal as nndes

1990326
implements	abstract
you might also consider using the curiously recurring templates pattern instead of declaring abstract functions to avoid virtual function-calls .when the base-class needs to call a function implements in one of the specialized variants

1990338
json	xml
i can basically building an api to send a request to my server with libcurl and get the result back to the page in xml or json or whatever the problem is .when sending the request the user would have to know the userid they want to send to lookup data against this is fine for an api but i am wanting to have an .apps section where the user s .app site would be using the api and would be loaded into my site in the .app section with an iframe the problem is i need to find a good way to make it where a logged in user on my site can go to the .app section and go to an .app and there username should be available to that page loaded in the iframe

1990357
http-get	get
is there a value pair for example that i can use with http-get to hop me over the redirection .so that i get the page that i see .when i types into my browser

1990358
traceback	typeerror
to do .so it first needs to raise an exception-handling and catch it the typeerror .so that sys.exc_info can return a traceback for this exception-handling

1990388
unique	words	sequences	unique
that way you have one map of int to string that contains unique english words and a tree that contains sequences like .so

1990390
ruby-on-rails	grails
but ruby-on-rails and grails are also popular

1990413
value	field
on the .blur you are not supplying the value meaning index or count or id of the field being blurred

1990421
webforms	asp.net
i m trying hard not to go off and roll my own shopping-cart but after perusing the available .net ecom package it s all asp.net webforms

1990433
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1990440
mongodb	couchdb
nosql databases couchdb mongodb cassandre... let you defined dynamically your propretyfield you could add field to your product class whenever you want

1990441
blogspot	blogger
blogger blogspot isn t the best-suited tool for this

1990446
curly-brackets	macros
btw it s better to refer to makefile macros using rather than as round brackets are used for object substitution into archive and curly-brackets aren t

1990448
linux	aix
as per mike s point-out i thought it would be useful to include the extra rules .so that you can clean the directory with exe s and object code lying around...this was my original templates makefile from aix which i ve used under linux al.so... thanks mike for the heads up

1990467
python	perl
i had trouble installing a local installation of mysql .so i have a connection to a remote mysql database via an ip tunnel i connect to it via typing localhost in perl and python scripting

1990469
internet-explorer	opera
internet-explorer 6 7 and 8 as far as i know and opera do not support rounded corners

1990469
google-chrome	safari
apple s webkit web browser engine also supports rounded corners making them available in the safari and google-chrome web browsers the iphone and other devices running webkit

1990476
enumerator	any
a simple enumerator in any deterministic order together with a hash-function that depends .when the nodes is visited should work

1990482
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but it comes up as blank in ie and google-chrome

1990487
favicon	web	required	checked
also note that since most web browsers do not required the html link to retrieve a favicon you should also checked for favicon in the website s document-root if none of the above link references are found

1990493
command-line	cmd
if you want to test mysql cmd from the command-line then you will have to install the mysql command-line client

1990493
command-line	cmd
you can execute cmd in the query browser just like on the command-line

1990502
logout	login
get notified of a user login logout

1990511
logout	login
one option might be to wrap django s login logout views with your own

1990518
selected	button
finally click the downloading button you could pre-supply the filename and the data stored in step 3 but the location would have to be selected every time

1990528
typedef	struct
you re declaring myvariable to be an instances of the struct you declare in your typedef

1990552
stderr	stdout
this line detection failures i d suggest you to draw a diagram of batch-file contexts and their stdin stdout stderr assignments inorder to understand what it does -

1990560
children	nodes
reordering the children of a nodes should distinctly change the resulting hashcode

1990571
ref	out
while explicit declaring argumentss as ref out is expected having to declare arguments types in lambda is less common since the compiler can normally infer them

1990571
ref	out
in this case however the compiler does not currently infer the types for out or ref arguments in lambda anon expression

1990577
contains	elements
the reason for this is that it can contains either just text more child elements or both

1990591
linked-list	tree
i would consider moving your tree into a linked-list instead

1990592
ref	out
several c# questions on stackoverflow ask how to make anonymous delegation lambda with out or ref parameters

1990592
ref	out
calling a methods with ref or out parameters from an anonymous methods

1990595
show	next
from that session i have take value to show next php page

1990600
python	java
i have used both jena which is a java framework and allegrograph lisp java python binding

1990613
derived-class	inherited	derived-class	subclassing	derived-class	pure-virtual	subclassing	inherited	pure-virtual	subclassing
it s much more likely you want to have foobar privately inherited have each subclassing own a foobar have foobar be a pure-virtual class or have the derived-class own the things it currently definedd or even defined foobar on its own

1990614
windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows
i ve been looking at the windows 7 symbolic links using mklink edit - they are also supported on windows-vista windows-server 2003 windows-server 2008

1990635
python	c++
i have a c++ application that embed the python interpreter

1990641
contains	any
in either case it will be uninitialized which in c means it can contains any random value

1990641
python	php
c does not keep tracking of uninitialized variables or set them to uninitialized or whatever like php and python does

1990645
buffering	streaming
are there any good and simple examples that use a streaming as opposed to a buffering to read from a tcp socket with asio

1990666
singleton	facade
events aren t application wide unless you use some sort of singleton or like puremvc facade to grab all the events and perform actions based on those

1990671
32-bit	64bit
also a 64bit building of your application can actually be much more optimized than a 32-bit building because with 64bit you are guaranteed to have quite a few things such as sse2

1990678
64bit	x86
potential performance improvement relates mostly to usage of 64bit int around 4 time as fast in an x64 building on my machine than in x86 on the same and the fact that compilers may assume some cpu features to be universally present in cpus supporting x64 such as sse2 c

1990678
32-bit	64bit
but .some platform don t install their 32-bit support in 64bit versioning by default i think freebsd needs to be explicit told to do .so but i may err on that

1990687
buffering	streaming
are there any good and simple examples that use a streaming as opposed to a buffering to read from a tcp socket with asio

1990704
textarea	textbox
you could use jquery to replace a textbox with a textarea

1990707
web-applications	scalability
scalability web-applications provide a consistent response time measured at the server tcp ports in use irrespective of the numbers of request

1990712
bazaar	git	perforce	git	perforce	bazaar
i m researching git bazaar and mercurial as potential alternatives to perforce

1990728
background-image	transparency
however if you have a 24-bit transparency png as your background-image that is disappearing you need to be aware that you cannot combine filtering alpha which jquery correctly uses behind the scenes in ie with a 24-bit transparency png in ie7 or ie8

1990728
background-color	transparency
i believe the only way around it is to set a background-color other than transparency on the object on which you are using filtering alpha

1990728
background-image	background-color
how to test simply set a background-color on #list_box to a solid color by adding something like this to your css after your background-image declaration

1990732
hotmail	gmail
i should not have to register using hotmail or gmail or whatever inorder to protect myself from your code showing an email domain to all and sundry

1990754
revision	updates	contains	any
.when you perform a git submodule updates git will clone a copy of the referenced repository or you can configure it to points to a different copy of the same repository at a different url as it is a dvcs and .so any clone of a repository that contains the referenced revision will al.so work and then checkout the referenced revision

1990769
callback	methods
the outer alertdialog is working because i m using the callback oncreatedialog methods

1990778
linux	unix
this also allows you to access sql-server from a linux unix based systemd

1990792
font-size	width
.when the tableview first loads this snippet returns zero width due to the font-size being 0

1990804
typedef	struct
function typedef and variables named as well as struct union and

1990818
arguments	default
the second arguments default is what pop returns if the first arguments key is absent

1990818
arguments	default
you ll see it makes a difference the first pop removes the a key .so in the second pop the default arguments is actually returned since a is now absent from b.data

1990821
arguments	default
arguments default to a new empty

1990828
integration-testing	autotest
in integration-testing we test the database operations but still not the web-service and external service because that can make the test brittle depending on their availability and we use autotest to run the tests in the background all the while we are coding

1990840
python	php
joomla php is a cms while django python is a web framework

1990843
ip-address	hostname

inside of this class is one object trectangle - also of my own which is created in the constructor of tcustomdisplay - predecestor of tdisplay

1990907
gzip	zip
i m using gzip with php to zip up some log files

1990909
32-bit	64bit
for example this may expose improper conversions between 32-bit int and now 64bit pointers

1990909
32-bit	64bit
however unless your application would benefit from 64bit int additional cpu registers a larger memory spaces beyond 3.5gb or implements a device-driver staying with 32-bit application is fine

1990914
jndi	jta
in java ee environment the jta-data-source and non-jta-data-source elements are used to specify the global jndi named of the jta and or non-jta datasource to be used by the persistent provider

1990939
textarea	textbox
the textarea is to all intents a multiline textbox

1990956
macros	let
i ve tried to write another macros to do what you want but it doesn t appear to be possible with the classloader used by clojure as it doesn t let us access package resources

1990964
clutter	gdk	clutter	gtk	clutter	glib	gtk	gdk	glib	gtk	glib	gdk
for instances if you look at project in the gnome ecosystem gtk gdk glib gobject clutter etc. you ll see types like gtkbutton or clutterstagewindow

every resource has a common set of methods namely delete get .post and put

1990970
put	get
every resource has a common set of methods delete get .post put

1990979
python	perl
i can see the following distinct questions inside this one assuming that you are going to use a scripting-language like perl or python or something similar

1990979
sftp	ftp
in that case you can use ftp sftp or rsync my favourite

1991036
linux	unix	linux	aix	unix	aix
if you know the cmd on a popular unix flavour like linux you can find the same thing on other less popular unices like hp-ux or aix

1991071
continuous-integration	teamcity
i don t want to setup and maintain a continuous-integration server .so answers like teamcity or cruisecontrol.net are simply irrelevant

1991076
perl	php	perl	c++	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	ruby	python	perl	haskell	lisp	haskell	c++	haskell	python	haskell	perl
php works as a server-side scripting-language but you can also use perl python ruby haskell lisp java c++ assembly or pretty much any other language that can access standards input and standards output for cgi communication with web content

1991079
web-services	api
the web-services api jsr 172 will allow you to connect to a remote web service from a j2me application

1991085
abstract-class	subclassing
.when extends an abstract-class this show that the subclassing is of a similar kind

1991087
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
perl python ruby etc

1991106
32-bit	64bit
this is the case of the cell processor where you have a main program for the main processor 64bit powerpc processor elements called ppe and one or many main program for the 8 different co-processor 32-bit synergistic process elements called spe

1991120
constructor	object
the viewmodel will typically have a constructor that receives one parameter - a data object

1991133
google-chrome	firefox
.so after all this debugging i ve run into the same issue on both google-chrome and firefox .so the root cause is not the browsers

1991133
jquery	.post	put	get
if someone knows a fix for this or has a working jquery project that has working auth for get .post put destroy that would be great even tutorials don t work for me - but that might be due to an old versioning of jquery ruby-on-rails

1991135
jenkins	ant	push	pull
jenkins capistrano phing ant git push pull rsync etc

1991136
inherited	accessor	getter	setter
and then completing this person class and teach new things like why getter and setter methods are evil and avoiding accessor inherited polymorphism by creating other classes like student employee moderator etc

1991150
delphi	c++
i meet too many programmers who don t have a clue about oo and are still programming in c++ c# java or delphi

1991156
constructor	object
at construction time .when the sample_base constructor is called the object is not fully construct yet

1991165
notepad++	emacs
any editor will do windows-users will use notepad or notepad++ or ultraedit unix users will more likely use emacs or vi

1991166
fadein	hide
.so what does it mean to know jquery does it mean you know how to rock a little hide .show fadein .fadeout

1991166
shopping-cart	oscommerce
in response to the widely adopted response we all know oscommerce is the most widely adopted shopping-cart and we all know what a pile of shit that is

1991167
google-chrome	safari
i am using the hortizontal way as a base but i have just realized that the horizontal-scrolling with both the arrows and the mouse s wheel does not work in both safari and google-chrome

1991173
base-class	inherited
.when using castle activerecord your entities do not have to inherited from the base-class

1991175
double	int
i m doing some project euler problems and most of the time the computations involve large numbers beyond int float double etc

1991208
swing	gwt	swing	awt
it s fustrating seeing suggestions from awt and swing etc. .when i m working with gwt

1991217
digits	base
you need to store the big numbers in a base that your computer can easily handle with its native types and then store the digits in a variable-length-array

1991217
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract
once you have a class that can store the numbers in this form it s just a matter of implements the operations add subtract multiplying etc

1991217
digits	base
each operation will have to iterate over digits of its operands and combine them being careful to carry correctly .so that your digits are never larger than the base

1991217
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are simple

1991218
abstract-class	pure-virtual
it is legal to call a pure-virtual function explicit in a constructor body using an explicit class qualifier - although this would required the function to have a body defined - but it is undefined behavior to call a pure-virtual function via a virtual call which is only possible from the constructor or destructor of an abstract-class

1991220
constructor	object
.when you call the function directly since you are in the constructor the compiler resolves the static types of your object sample_base and call sample_base fun directly

1991244
protected	public
several object oriented programming characteristics like interfaces the public private protected keyword and more can be only found in php 5

1991248
emacs	vim
any others than vim and emacs vim and emacs are too powerful -

1991256
arrays	loops
if you insist on using scandir then use a loops to go through the arrays of files returned by scandir and then remove those you don t want from the arrays

1991272
emacs	vim
if you re really limited to using the console text-only then apart from the diff utilities built into editor like vim and emacs you could also try the original command-line utility diff

1991276
multiplication	mod	multiplication	division
a simple bignum implementation like that should be enough for most project euler problems probably all but i haven t .solved much at euler .so can t be sure but there are ways of using much faster algorithms for operations such as multiplication and division mod

1991289
webserver	upload
but .when i upload .solution to my webserver which is windows-server 2008 r2 .so it is iis 7.5 as well my localization suddenly stops working

1991295
any	set
do i need to set any path

1991318
screen-orientation	portrait
how do we change android-emulator screen-orientation to landscape or portrait

1991322
inspector	webkit
newer building of the webkit and google-chrome inspector support the displayname properties on functions 1

1991330
versioning	upgrade
also if you purchase the java versioning you get a years free upgrade support as the new release are created

1991333
getter	setter
start by avoiding classes with getter and setter

1991333
getter	setter
getter and setter are simply a mechanism to circumvent oop data travel in and you end up with heap of boilerplate

1991333
private-members	object
something that has real encapsulation changes to private-members don t required recompilation of client code and treats all types uniformly for example string literals are first class object

1991343
background-image	transparency
how can i set the cannon image transparency .so that it is a .solid image on top of the background-image

1991361
contains	set
i want to find all numbers that contains exactly one of each of the numbers in my set

1991362
delphi	c++	pascal	delphi
c# is partly based on c++ but also on java and pascal delphi

1991398
hide	show
.when it s time to switching hide the currently visible table and show the new one

1991401
contains	any
traits are fully interoperable only if they do not contains any implementation code

1991408
children	nodes
for each internal nodes compute the concatenation of 1 and the hash of any local data nb may not be applicable and the hash of the children from left to right

1991408
children	tree
using 31 as the multiplicative constants is good in that it will cause any overflow to happen on a non-bit boundary although i am thinking that with sufficient children and possibly adversarial content in the tree the hash contribution from items hash early may be dominated by later hash items

1991413
bitwise-operators	operators
but i think it s also useful to note that is just one of a family of operators that are collectively known as bitwise-operators

1991430
authentication	login
.so i would like to have a way for admins to authentication .when they go to login and use the website if they provide the right credentials and if not just display the coming .soon page

1991447
jquery-plugins	jquery
the thing to remember is that jquery.extend has nothing to do with jquery or jquery-plugins

1991453
linked-list	queue
you might have a linked-list class and ask them to inherited from it to make a stack or queue by writing their own push pop enqueue dequeue methods

1991453
binary-search-tree	binary-tree
or make a binary-tree class and ask them to make it into a binary-search-tree by overrides the insert methods

1991453
getter	setter
have them write a timer class that stores time as seconds but uses getter setter to automatically convert to from minutes or hours

1991462
authentication	login
you can apply simple authentication filtering everywhere except the login page

1991471
insertafter	appendto
insertbefore insertafter append appendto prepend prependto etc

1991477
authentication	login
and to authentication the user i checked if a login session exists otherwise i authentication the cookies

1991486
sigint	exit
do not exit the handler by calling die note that you do not need to send sigint or sigkill you can also send sigusr1

1991486
arrays	loops
the while can_read loops probably exists .when it receives an empty arrays of file handles .when it is interrupted by the signals

1991486
arrays	loops
and updates loops to handle an empty ready arrays

1991490
salt	md5
just an md5 is not enough you should at least include a random salt a small random string of characters that you store in your database

1991491
triggers	insert
then i thought i could use a triggers to insert this into the caching data into the connectedplayers table

1991491
triggers	insert
no second table triggers extra insert .net code whatever needed .

1991503
scala	java	python	java
i d prefer java or scala or maybe python which is a fine language for teaching

1991509
while-loop	arrays
don t printing it in the while-loop but store it in an arrays

1991520
worksheet	excel
inorder to use this in vba you need to use the worksheet-function object which exposes a subset of the excel worksheet functions

1991532
put	get
you might put the model in session and get it back in the controllers and nullify it in session

1991542
arrays	loops
it does everything just in one cycle to avoid recursion and function-calls overhead still if fakes the needed nested for loops using stack arrays

1991552
text-editor	editor
to see how an rtf document looks in its raw form save some text in an rtf-aware editor like wordpad and then open it again in a plain text-editor

1991553
revision	svn
first of all svn status has the revision numbers you can read it from there

1991553
revision	svn
also each file that you store in svn can store the revision numbers in itself -- add the keyword to your file and run propset svn propset svn keyword revision file

1991554
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
in comparison with asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc frameworks

1991556
revision	svn
i think i have to do svn info and then retrieve the numbers with a string manipulation from revision xxxxxx

1991565
children	nodes	addition	modulo
since the order of the child nodess matters a methods which might work here would be to combine the nodes data and children using primes multiples and addition modulo some large numbers

1991572
webforms	asp.net
it s like asp.net webforms where you use user-interface components and event-bindings to buser-interfacelding up your webpage

1991576
libqxt	qmake
assuming that configure have been run and libqxt have been built using qt-creator or manually via qmake + make my solution is adding following snippet with obvious qxt_dir customization to .pro file

1991614
default-value	default
you re doing everything right except one little bit the default-value you are specifying in your uipropertymetadata is actually null because it s null in that new scrollviewer as well by default

1991614
default-value	default
and in your default styles for the control specify a default-value for the styles as such

1991630
wamp	php
they are using wamp 5 php versioning 5.2.1 and windows xp

1991631
any	set
which rewrite all matched urls to an arbitrary scripting that handles the url parsing the combinations of abc-123 abc-456 controller-value etc to any list of pages or actions functions etc that can be set up from a database-table hardcode bla bla

1991632
postgresql	firebird
.so i would recommand firebird or postgresql

1991633
linux	unix
in unix linux and clones you need as path separator

1991643
32-bit	x86
.so as a .solution to this issue i have changed the building properties of the project to x86 .so that it will built-in 32-bit mode and rebuilding the project in the 32-bit machine

1991643
32-bit	64bit
.so .when i deployed my .app again in the 64bit os it throw the exception-handling attempted to load a 64bit assembly on a 32-bit platform

1991664
png	gif
i don t have any experience with image-processing but i d like to do this with multiple common formats such as jpg gif png if possible

1991684
qwidget	qobject
qobject does not provide any means of changing the order of its children exception-handling qwidget s raise function - but that s useless in this case

1991684
qobject	qlist
allows a child to be in the qlist more than one time or not at all even though it might be still a child of the qobject

1991705
updating	updates
if you don t need exactly ajax updating only parts of the site on request is sufficient for you then you can use invisible iframe as target for loading generator html file contains only javascript scripting that updates resets updateable parts of the site

1991711
machine-code	disassembly
the rest of the junk will be code of the bootloader in machine-code you ll need to disassembly it for it to make sense

1991749
haskell	python
i want to debugging data-structures and or algorithms visually in inferior bufferinging mainly python and haskell but any interpreter running in a buffering should be the same

1991760
web-services	api
i want to know whether there are any ways some open api or web-services or some hacking ways to retrieved the crawled page content

1991771
revision	svn
that gives the last changed rev which won t change until the code in the current tree actually changes as opposed to revision what the above gives which will change any time anything in the repository changes even branches and you do an svn up which is not the same thing nor often as useful

1991786
implements	extends
.when a concrete class finally extends mixes-in these traitss some class traits must implements a

1991786
implements	extends
however the second requirement mentioned above is not satisfied the burden of implements user still remains for classes traits which extends right

1991806
order	join
.when two pieces of advice defined in different aspects both need to run at the same join points unless you specify otherwise the order of execution is undefined

1991808
value	field
i usually choose to log all object using their tostring overloads in java or .net which serialization the hash of the value for field marked with a sensitive attributes applied to them

1991815
python	perl	windows-xp	windows
from c to perl to python on windows-mobile windows-xp and other windows versioning this problem persistent and f ks my nerves

1991825
malloc	free
.when that s not enough another trick i ve used is to run with my own custom versioning of malloc and free with code that takes special care to checked for common error conditional like freeing something that s already been free regularly verifying freelist pointers integrity looking to see if total memory use is increasing over time etc

1991849
digits	zero
this value is an ascii numbers with n digits you could use 8 digits for convenience filled up with zero to n positioning

1991849
lookup	any
you must lookup the grouping and delete any positioning on the map which cannot be assign this day

1991867
python	ruby
there are a few wr.apper over this amazon api for python and ruby which you could integrated into you .app using pyobjc or macruby

1991891
bundler	gem
as the documentation says gem bundle comes from bundler gem

1991892
double-quotes	single-quotes
the only real advantage that i can see to using double-quotes as a standards is if your strings contains apostrophes single-quotes you don t have to change your styles to accommodate them

1991939
python	java	python	ruby
i know that lots of languages have compatibility with c through .some form of external call or binding i ve been using binding in java ruby python etc. .so i know it can be done

1991943
selected	checkbox
if i have at least one checkbox selected on each of the questions this works fine and in my controllers and the data bind perfectly

1991951
contains	elements
and that i want to make the contains a elements which will display the exact same text and will look exactly like the looked before the change resulting code

1991957
fortran	pascal	fortran	ada	pascal	ada
examples of such languages are ada fortran pascal and d

1991962
click	mouse
the functionality users can draw rectangles on a defined area of the screens by click the left mouse button and dragging to create the desired sized rectangle

1991977
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
unlike the itemscontrol with a contentcontrol you also need to activate the view once you have added it to make it visible

1991989
selected	checkbox
one way around this would be to have a default hidden checkbox contains a known value that you could filtering out selected initially for each question a not answered checkbox if you will

1991995
input-field	textarea
all that the user is typing must be insert to a div instead of a input-field or a textarea

1992009
32-bit	64bit
.so if we are using micro.soft.jet.oledb.4.0 drivers in a 64bit server we have to force our application to built-in in 32-bit mode this is the answer i found .when i did an extensive search for this known issue and that causes other part of my code to break

1992009
32-bit	64bit
it works both in 32-bit as well as 64bit servers

1992017
perl	lua	perl	php	perl	tcl	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	lua	python	java	python	php	python	tcl	python	ruby	python	perl	ocaml	lua	ocaml	tcl	ocaml	perl	common-lisp	ocaml	common-lisp	tcl	common-lisp	scheme	tcl	lua	scheme	lua	scheme	ocaml	scheme	tcl
tcl python perl guile java ruby scheme php ocaml pike c# modula-3 lua common-lisp r and octave

1992027
subclassing	superclass
the main motivation for using a singleton instances over a class is that you can replace a singleton with an instances of its subclassing without code written against the superclass having to know next probably had different nsworkspace subclassinging for different filesystems or platform

1992028
selected	listbox
unrelated to the exception-handling but it looks like you re interating over the listbox items to find the selected item - if that s true why not just use the selected item directly

1992047
asymptotic-complexity	heapsort
also you can use heapsort but it is quite slower in average case but asymptotic-complexity is o n log n also in the worst case

1992067
32-bit	64bit
since it will get compiled twice once for the 32-bit part of the fat binary once for the 64bit part and the right one will be launchdd by the systemd you ll compile in the right launchd code by just writing sth

1992067
32-bit	64bit
if the user somehow explicit launchd your .app in 32-bit on a 64bit mac trust them that they know what they re doing

1992077
design-time	designer
the css does resolve at design-time and all the styles are rendering correctly in the designer

1992087
subclassing	nsobject
you would create a subclassing of nsobject named something like myfile and a subclassing of a collections class named something like myfolder

1992101
controllers	routes
1 depends on the routes defined in global-asax but by default the home controllers and the index action will return index.aspx

1992101
asp.net-mvc	webforms
2 you cam mix webforms and asp.net-mvc but it s better to just stick with asp.net-mvc unless you have good rea.son .so you should use a view

1992125
dataoutputstream	outputstream
you can wrap your outputstream with dataoutputstream

1992143
click	mouse
would convert the windows coordinates returned by a mouse click into the 3-space coordinates of the front most texel given the proper projection and model-view matrix

1992173
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval .so you can dynamically alter the timing of the next interval

1992176
implements	extends
and tell developers to extends abstractentity whenever they want to implements an entity

1992180
pecl	pear
but somehow pear install -f pecl memcached did the trick for me

1992182
boost	stl
the info therein is also applicable to decoding complex templates related diagnostics beyond stl for boost

1992198
kdevelop	kate
you could use kdevelop or kate although i don t know that there is a big community of support for these editor

1992198
textmate	vim
if you are on linux you are best to checkout vim it s the 2nd most popular editor for ruby ruby-on-rails with textmate being #1

1992203
updating	updates
as the while statement loops through the read data sqlreader 0 1 and 2 are updates with new data however they also appear to be updating the stored value held in return_value..

1992204
32-bit	64bit
64bit is the latest and greatest and must be better than 32-bit

1992204
32-bit	64bit
expecting average people to understand the technical demarcation line between 32-bit process on a 64bit os is unrealistic

1992208
implements	super
it s implements using the mbean mechanism mentioned above and offers a drop in out-of-the-box super duper solution

1992213
contains	any
where the parent-pom contains any shared configuration dependency-management properties etc. and the myproject pom.xml contains the list of modules

1992215
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit process cannot load a 32-bit dll directly .so you have to make yours 64bit as well

1992219
perl	php
both php and perl have easy to use modules for creating a pdf - with no licensing needed

1992239
soaplib	suds	soap-client	suds
in the case of soap with python there are recommendation to use soaplib as soap server and suds as soap-client

1992239
python	java
my target is to create soap service in python that can be consumed by several clients java etc

1992249
gitignore	git-add
would fail if there are untracked files that match gitignore use git-add --all instead

1992253
strncpy	memcpy
strncpy is to memcpy as strstr is to

1992264
dictionary	arrays
the images should be stored in a some kind of data structure arrays dictionary database etc

flex is mxml an xml markup and actionscript

1992267
actionscript	mxml
at compile building time this mxml file is converted to actionscript lots of it

1992277
python	java	python	php
best to choose an intermediate-language like python java c# php etc

1992282
multithreading	wait
if there is no memory available many multithreading and multitasking systemd will either force garbage-collection deletion of unnecessary variables or wait for a duration and try the allocation again

1992314
double-quotes	single-quotes
what is the difference between single-quotes and double-quotes in sql

1992323
stdin	pipe
the intention is to read a list of files first which are read from the stdin pipe and then read twice more to get two strings interactive

1992327
updating	updates
the other two options are equals in my opinion only if the title are changed by an administration then it s easier to updates an xml file in notepad not database-table in sql-server unless you have a nice gui for updating it

1992329
directory	folder
it can handle trunk and tags export the current directory or export every folder in a given directory

1992331
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
either works in oracle sql-server mysql â but i know some have said that the toad ide seems to give some grief .when using the single-quotes approach

1992351
default-value	arguments
each arguments is optional and has a default-value of null .so if you only want to pass in a particular arguments then just use null for all argumentss before that one

1992352
contains	any
any information they contains needs to be put into them using the beans setter

1992375
combinations	permutation
the search term you should probably be looking at is something like php string permutation instead of combinations

1992375
combinations	permutation
a permutation is an arrangement of items where the order of each item matters .so late and teal are different strings while a combinations is an arrangement where the order doesn t matter late and teal are considered identical because they use the same letters

1992375
combinations	permutation
given an algorithm p that generator all the permutation of a string an algorithm c that generator all the combinations of length n of some string and a string s of length m here s another algorithm that will generator all the permutation of s of length 1...m

1992393
appdata	temp
output if not exist c users myuser appdata local temp 4cbc file.txt goto nofile

1992441
arrays	loops
your loops fails because .when i 99 i + 1 100 which is outside the bounds of your arrays

1992455
instance-variables	local-variables
.so .some of the value needed for computation precisely those that are part of the object s state are in instance-variables other the intermediate results of computations that are not actually part of object state are local-variables arguments return value

1992455
python	ruby
since instances-variabless and local-variabless therefore get mixed in most computations many programming styles required them to have distinguishable namedd some languages such as python and ruby make that mandatory -- the instances variables location for example would be spelled location or self.location -- but i m talking about styles for languages that do not force the issue but still allow you to named that instances variables location_ with a trailing underscore.js or m_location with an m_ prefix and the like

1992462
required	checked
if what you mean is a new domain named points it to the same server as your first domain and do the language checked or whatever is required in the php scripting

1992481
jquery	.post
.so now in my jquery ajax .post request i want to grab that response and go through this collections

1992486
interpreter	runtime
wouldn t adding this feature add a significant boost to the initial runtime of the program .when the bytecode is essentially being interpreter

1992515
base-class	inherited
the same behavior could be achieved using inherited but deriving from a common base-class results in tight coupling which can be avoided using interfaces

1992519
pygtk	gtk	pycairo	pygtk
u should have pygtk pycairo pygboject and the gtk runtime.

1992532
haskell	scala
how is it possible to represent monads in scala in a generics way like the monad typeclass in haskell

1992536
xcopy	cmd
in other words i need to invoke two different xcopy cmd from the same post-build event

1992563
binary	hex	decimal	hex
numbers themselves aren t hex decimal or binary - that s just their representation whether in code or in memory

1992563
decimal	hex
but the value itself isn t hex or decimal

1992570
instances	destroy
then .when you have an object who is an instances of idestroy you can call the destroy methods

1992571
screen-readers	wai-aria
the only problem with wai-aria is that it only works with newer screen-readers and web browsers

1992574
innodb	myisam
but really you want to be using innodb and not myisam in most cases for a variety of other reasons

1992591
paintcomponent	draw
if paintcomponent is called fetch current image and draw it on component

1992599
filtering	grouping
i m now trying to create a filtering on the grouping entities named withnames which i may call within withgrouping to get better code

1992611
gitx	repo
.when i do the shallow clone the new repo show only the current branch but the size is identical 24mb and looking at the repo with gitx i can see the entire history back to the initial commit

32-bit	16-bit
also what is the byte order expected by the wav file-format for 16-bit and 32-bit int

1992647
codeigniter	cakephp
my scoping of knowledge on php frameworks is limited to 4 cakephp symphony zend and codeigniter sort by preferences

1992659
show	next
one of the column lists a persons named and all the rows that follow in that column provide some descriptive attributes about that person until the next persons named show up

1992664
haskell	scala
scala achieves similar power to haskell s types classes through use of implicit parameters particularly view bounds and context bounds

1992668
associations	model
the associations in your model classes are incorrect according to your description of how ingredients and units are related

1992669
subproject	ivy
ivy was merged into an apache project under ant as subproject through incubation process on october 11 2007

1992676

i d like to see again after call get .so i ve put

1992700
sql-server-express	sql-server	amazon-ec2	vps
amazon-ec2 with sql-server or sql-server-express edition a vps 1and1 has a pretty good deal right now running express edition or of course your own dedicated box

1992703
numerical	matrix
and one thing to remember in matrix inversion is numerical stability since you are dealing with floating-point numbers

1992706
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the clients for these are generally web browsers like google-chrome firefox or internet-explorer

1992720
macports	fink
fink macports maybe xampp for mac

1992724
zend-framework	phpunit
what i think that is happening is that the autoloaders of zend-framework doctrine and phpunit are disturbing each other but i am not sure about it

1992738
selected	checkbox
.so people can drop down and selected many options all the checkbox should be inside the dropdown

1992748
rad-controls	telerik
telerik rad-controls and the ajaxtoolkit are two such tools available to you

1992783
reserved-words	keyword
raise is a keyword reserved-words in python

1992791
communication	messages
if you don t want to listen for the give me more messages request not sure why you wouldn t want to then built-in a heartbeat types communication

1992795
ref	out
internally in the compiler the out ref types are represented as types like any other

1992795
ref	out
none of the linq methods generator have delegation with out or ref parameters

1992795
ref	out
delegation which have out ref parameters are relatively rare

1992796
lgpl	gpl
but it seems like lgpl as a variant on gpl imposes a larger insurmountable problem for iphone .app development in that the development tools needed to create and distribute any iphone .app are only available under terms from .apple that are incompatible with gpl

1992803
macports	fink
i haven t install fink on my new systemd yet but if i do i will manage it identically to the macports perl keep it later in my path than usr local bin and it will only get updates via installation dependencies.

1992809
buffering	streaming
the ofstreaming object is buffering .so anything written to the streaming will get buffering before written to disk

1992828
perl	ruby
the ruby binary at least mri s supports a lot of the switches that made perl one-liners quite popular

1992828
perl	ruby
feel free to google ruby one-liners and perl one-liners for tons more usable and practical examples

1992862
ostream	std
however with ostream iterator i don t think any implementation of std copy will do this as it doesn t have direct access to the ostream s buffering to write into

1992862
buffering	streaming
the streaming themselves though buffering too

1992879
callback	methods
but apparently it converts my instances this to void .so i can t retrieve it again on the updates methods which is static and it s interesting but the the sdl_addtime doesn t work on a non-static callback

1992897
constructor	object
the standards answer is #3 - you should pass the idbconnection or datacontext or other connection-like object through the constructor

1992897
nhibernate	ado.net
by the way - i believe that nhibernate supports db2 .so you might want to consider that as an alternative to raw ado.net

1992914
optgroup	selected
.when the user click an option this code clears all the selection in the current optgroup and allows the click one to be selected

1992920
child-process	spawn
also the server actually listener process should go back to listening for more connections after spawn the child-process

1992925
value	field
however if you want to do it in a much cleaner way you d use a great feature of nhibernate which is being able to map field and also mapping properties that store their value in field

1992929
websphere	ibm
i think this is only relevant if you buy commercial support from ibm like sla for a service tier websphere and db2 clustered environment etc.

1992947
json	xml
my question is which will be faster and or easier to work with xml or json

1992972
jquery	.post
the above is my jquery .post function

1992980
boolean-expression	operators
because the operators and most others are binary-operatorss they take two arguments and true true is not a valid boolean-expression

1992992
shuffle	unique
aside tatu has provided a simple solution using str_shuffle which is a more elegant way of doing that last methods unique characters but i m not convinced it s the most efficient way since it s likely to involve a lot of swaps to get a decent shuffle

1993013
selected	button
selected application-pool and click the ... button next to it

1993019
constructor	object
dependencies are generally inject at the time a class is initializer using one of these methodss constructor-injection passing dependent class instances in the class s constructor properties injecion setting the dependent class instances as properties or something else making all injectable object implements a particular interface that allows the inversion-of-control containers to call a single methods that inject its dependencies

1993021
ip-address	proxy
as mentioned already corporate proxy and other private networks can appear as a single ip-address

1993022
tuples	sorted
tupless f# tuples is a class sorted on the heap

1993026
value	field
the instances parameter sets the initial field value which is what i understood you want to do

1993030
ip-address	proxy
yes every request must have an ip-address but as stated above some isp s use proxy nat or gateways which may not give you the individual s computer

1993062
content-length	content-type
it seems that wcf already knows request headers at the points of invoking readmessage methods at least content-type and content-length but i cannot get the access to the content-encoding header

1993063
one-to-many	entity
i have a core data entity which has an exclusive one-to-many relationship with another entity

1993063
contains	set
should i remove the relationship and then call deleteobject for each entity or will calling deleteiobject for each contains entity cause the relationship to be set correctly

1993063
contains	set
if the second is true can i just enumerate the contains entities and call deleteobject or should i first make a copy of the set if calling deleteobject for each object severs the relationship this will modify the set which is not allowed in normals enumerator

1993079
decrement	increment
my solution is a global variables that gets increment .when a thread spawn and decrement .when a thread finishes

1993104
google-chrome	safari
don t worry about safari and google-chrome though a solution that supports them too would be nifty

1993114
decrement	increment
my solution is a global variables that gets increment .when a thread spawn and decrement .when a thread finishes

1993140
ienumerator	ienumerable
i was wondering why the getenumerator methods was factored out of ienumerator and placed in ienumerable

1993157
ienumerator	ienumerable
because ienumerable says come enumerate me and then you say- how give me the enumerator however ienumerator says i can enumerate your collections

1993158
ienumerator	ienumerable
if ienumerable and ienumerator were the same interface they couldn t be shared or you d need to have some untyped arguments on getenumerator that allowed you to pass in the object to be enumerated

1993169
ienumerator	ienumerable
the ienumerable interface is a factory that creates as many ienumerator object as you want

1993209
clearinterval	setinterval
you could write a javascript function include on every page that uses the the setinterval clearinterval javascript functions to send an ajax request to your server every few seconds and could send a different response back to the browser based on whether the conditional were met or not

1993212
click	mouse
click is generally preferred over mouseclick because it automatically compensates if the user has swapped the left and right mouse button via the systemd s control panels

1993213
contains	any
is it possible to selected an h1 tag that does not contains any img tags with a single line xpath expression

1993218
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
if it s bound via linqdatasource sqldatasource or objectdatasource i suggest you have a look at the updating event

1993227
updating	updates
am i going to have to just make a scripting that execute 110 queries to updates the username in each table and remember to updates the scripting .when i add new tables or is there a way to link the field in all of the tables .so updating the username in one table updatess it in all of the others

1993238
python	c++
i have a c++ .app that embed the python interpreter

1993260
arrays	loops
.so i get the query-string and just loops through the arrays of routes trying find a match

1993266
groovy	java
i run an instances of tomcat on my machine with a simple html page that has all the links i need java hibernate spring groovy

1993288
account	userid
if you create log contains date for login ip hash and userid - you might be able to get an idea if a user is a multi account or not

1993290
constructor	object
variables weren t being set due to a different problem - the constructor was initializer an object which was silently failing

1993305
open-session-in-view	lazy-loading
could you use the open-session-in-view pattern to allow lazy-loading

1993307
display	height
.when you use display tablerow the height of the div is solely determined by the height of the table-cell elements in it

1993307
margins	padding
thus margins padding and height on those elements have no effect

1993308
databound	gridview
the objectdatasource does have a selectcountmethod that can be used .when databound controls such as the gridview need to access the total row count

1993350
ienumerator	ienumerable
for instances - in the above link ienumerable ienumerator is collaped to a single methods interface

1993361
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection especially .when using an inversion-of-control containers provides loose coupling within an application or solution - with dependency-injection you do not hardcode your references to dependent object instead you code to interfaces and inject implementation of those interfaces

1993364
hide	show
one consideration is that combo boxes hide potential data while radio button always show all options

1993366
contains	any
if you are going to be writing more than one entity to the datastore at a time you should also use the pattern of db.put entities_list where the list can contains up to 500 entities of any kind - they don t even have to be the same model kind

1993369
selected	button
if only one item may be selected at a time i would use radio button up to three options

1993372
keyboard	mouse
it doesn t even know how to open a windows not to mention how to handle mouse or keyboard input

1993390
dynamic-linking	static-linking
are there any compelling performance reasons to choose static-linking over dynamic-linking or vice versa in certain situations

1993390
dynamic-linking	static-linking
1 the difference in runtime performance between static-linking and dynamic-linking is usually negligible

1993401
carbon	cocoa
you may need to add cocoa carbon and other frameworks depending on what you used

1993401
glut	sdl
if you used sdl or glut add their frameworks as well

1993405
16-bit	8bit
i have a very similar messages format to yours 16-bit payload length 8bit packets id types followed by the payload for me

1993407
dynamic-linking	static-linking
however if you are running multiple-processes which all call the same libs a lot you can end up saving caching line and thus winning on running performance .when using dynamic-linking relative using static-linking

1993418
logout	login
also look at logout and login from the same ip with different account in a short notice

1993434
getter	setter
it s just a list of getter and setter

1993436
solaris	unix	solaris	freebsd
i don t recall what os solaris or freebsd gave me problems with my unix build-system because i just wasn t doing this and wondered why it crash until i applied -fpic to gcc

1993438
linqdatasource	databound
.when the autopage properties is set to true the linqdatasource control retrieves only enough recording for one page in the databound control

1993457
lighting	quad
once you have your buffering prepare you start to rendering a bunch of full-screen quad each with a pixels shader program that reads out the normals and positioning and computes the lighting for one or multiple lighting-sources

1993457
lighting	quad
since lighting is additive you can rendering as much full-screen quad as you want and accumulate the lighting for as much lighting-sources as you want

1993471
spotify	last.fm
to be effective the application really needs to interrupt any currently playing media player eg last.fm imeem music player spotify etc

1993493
directory	folder
i have removed all other project from the webapps folder i have taken the servlet-api.jar file that was in the tomcat6 .lib directory and added that and only that to the project buildpath .so i can t see how there is still a conflict

1993522
buildpath	libs
choose one which you d like to use as the default server and then its libs will automagically be include in the project s buildpath

1993556
selected	button
i am having an awful hard time trying to implements the task of .when the user selected the next button in the keyboard the user is then sent to the next textfield to start editing

1993569
instances	self
the last two line do not copy the value from self and f onto the new instances they only copy the pointers effectively losing leaking the freshly allocated instances

1993614
value	field
is it possible to have an outer table mapped to a dataset and use another table inside the outer table which maps to a second dataset where the second dataset should take the field value

1993616
put	get
however note that the first line returns a different value an instances of either get or put and this value is used in the second line

1993616
put	get
perhaps i could have some interface that both get and put implements then required a delegate-like thing that takes an instances of that interface

1993616
put	get	base-class	inherited
get and put inherited from a common base-class request

1993616
base-class	inherited
getresponse and putresponse inherited from a common base-class response

it show how to use nsurl nsxmlparser and a tableview to do just this types of thing

1993645
variables	boolean
add a boolean variables

1993646
hide	show
the same windows in c is relatively easier in mfc as show here and it hide some of the boilerplate code

1993647
implements	extends	implements	final	extends	final
declaring a final __construct ensures that no one who extends your class can implements a methods with the same named

1993648
contains	set
each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components

1993661
wxwidgets	mfc
mfc atl qt wxwidgets will all allow you to get handles to the controls if you need to customise anything

1993671
margins	padding
i am setting peroperty margins and padding of a windows and it doesn t take effect

1993671
any	set	margins	padding
i guess if i won t find any solution i will create a named styles for greed where i will set the margins padding then i will go windows by windows and set the grid s styles but that s the last option i wanna do

1993678
python	php
does anyone know of a pre-existing libs php or python preferably that i can tap into for this

1993684
put	get
you will need to change the builder.getrequest methods .so that it takes in a parameter that indicates whether a get or a put is what you required unless that can be deduced from either the user or named parameter

1993687
put	get
btw - i didn t read all your code you might get more bettre response if you put a bit more effort in formatting it .so that it easier to read

1993691
ogre3d	ogre
ogre3d - ogre object oriented graphics libs

1993697
multiplication	exponentiation
see modular exponentiation montgomery multiplication and multiplication using fft

1993708
hash	md5
md5 is relatively fast but if you can t afford full-text comparisons on hash-collision you should probably use a stronger hash like sha-256

1993726
irrlicht	ogre3d
sourceforge has many including ogre3d irrlicht and crystalspace

1993729
initializer	getter
put a breakpoints on the allshipments getter to make sure it is not null .when the view initializer the binding

1993732
tuples	set
side issue don t use as your identifier built-in types named such as tuples list file set and .so forth -- it s horrible practice and it will come back and byte you .when you least expect it

1993734
value	field
you call gtk_clipboard_set_with_data or gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner passing a gtktargetentry with text html as the value for the target field

1993741
value	field
there is no way that they are actually sharing the value of their static field

1993747
order	add
i m trying to make a dictionary in python that i can sort through but it seems to change order .when i add new things

1993755
show	next
for a particular form there is not enough spaces to show the errors next to the form elements

obviously this will shrink or in my simplified example turn white the entire listbox .when anything is selected

1993824
listboxitem	selected
to get the selected listboxitem to remain full sized use the listbox.itemcontainerstyle

1993824
scaletransform	transformation
in this you can triggers on isselected and apply a suitable setter to reverse the shrinking transformation -- apply a negative margins or the reverse scaletransform

1993828
decimal-point	numeric
the ibaction works with the numeric keypad to allow entry of decimal numbers without having to enter a decimal-point

1993828
decimal-point	digits
the currencyfield1 segment works as desired display all numbers with two digits after the decimal-point even .when the delete key is used to delete all entered digits

1993828
rounding	currency
however it suffers from and illustrates perfectly the problem with using floats .when dealing with large currency value rounding errors show up .when entered numbers exceed 8 digits

1993828
decimal-point	digits
however it does not always display numbers with two digits after the decimal-point -- this is show .when the delete key is used to delete all entered digits

1993832
zpl	epl
in zebra-printers it s called epl zpl

1993840

javascript	dom
if you are simply writing to the dom or reading or filling in form controls you should just use javascript strings which are treated as sequences of utf-16 code units

1993901
icmp	arp
then you can either user icmp ping standards ping or arp ping to list all the valid ip addresses

1993901
subnet	ping
arp ping is much reliable in a subnet setting

1993905
subnet	ping
can you just look at the ip and subnet mask on the network adaptor and ping every address

1993916
any	set
even differencing with the empty set will remove any duplicates items

1993923
contains	any
it contains pointers to a particular class initializer s versioning of any virtual-functions that class implements

1993931
data-structures	tree
most of them come from okasaki s purely-functional data-structures although the avl tree is my own implementation since it wasn t present in the book

1993931
binary-tree	nodes
now since you asked about reusing unmodified nodes let s take a simple binary-tree

1993932
numeric	zero	base	zero
.when you begin a numeric literals with a leading zero it means the numbers is in octal base 8

1993932
decimal	octal
0103 in octal is equals to 67 in decimal

1993934
xsd	xml
once that is done i will write an xsd for it .so that i can comfortably edit the xml by hand at a later date

1994002
spring	grails
i also read about grails is that another framework or built on top of spring

1994009
decimal-point	digits
if you want to guarantee 2 digits after the decimal-point for your text value you could use an nsnumberformatter like in the following code draw from the answer here

1994010
spring	grails
yes grails is built on spring and several other frameworks and it uses spring-asp.net-mvc to implements its asp.net-mvc layer

1994011
data-visualization	charts
data-visualization like graphing and charts changing live .when data changes

1994015
databound	gridview

we know that since subset-sum is np-complete deciding in polynomail time probably is impossible

1994036
s#arp-architecture	automapper
i am using s#arp-architecture with fluent-nhibernate and automapper on a legacy db

1994057
double-quotes	single-quotes
the best way to do this is to use double-quotes around the content attributes value and single-quotes for everything inside that

1994074
duplicates	elements
how it is possible to alter or remove single elements without having to create a completely new collections where all elements even the unmodified ones will be duplicates in memory

1994092
python	perl
python and perl versioning of the scripting

get an nsbitmapimagerep from your nsimage

1994132
default-value	arguments
one of the arguments is overflowhandler and the default-value for that is def_overflow_handler but you can specify silent_overflow_handler to suppress the exception-handling instead

1994132
default-value	arguments
then specify the floattointrounder arguments that will provide your desired default-value if the input arguments is outside your desired range

1994143
sql-server	mysql
approach on sql-server or mysql -

1994143
sql-server	mysql
.so if i have transactional on mysql or sql-server i can have a scripting to backup any data modified after or between date x and y

1994157

i used an anonymous pipe to capture all stdout and stderr then printing into a richedit it s ok .when i use wsprintingf but the python using multibyte char that really annoy me

1994158
penetration-testing	security
for starters i wouldn t know if hosting on google is the best way to go because you will be forfeiting control i really don t know if .app engine is designed with the required level of security in mind you should find that out and probably cannot do penetration-testing which you should.

1994159
key-value	key
maintain a nsmutablearray to store the key inorder in addition to the nsdictionary which holds all key-value pairs

1994162
dictionary	arrays
you could either do it as an arrays of dictionary as you suggest or as an arrays of strings where the strings are the key to your original dictionary

1994169
primitive	int
the typesof operators can not test for primitive example int long string etc. but it can tell the specific types of object example

1994175
contains	set
raises keyerror if elem is not contains in the set

1994184
contains	set
as others pointed out def the set member you re trying to remove is not a member of the set and remove per the docs is specified as raises keyerror if elem is not contains in the set.

1994185
attributes	properties
generally speaking .so long as you don t mess around with the various attributes that let you exert control over the formatting of serialization xml every properties that s a value-type will look like this

1994203
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie7 the input all float left on a newline

1994204
hashtable	set
finally i extraction the elements from the hashtable into another set of nested-lists with a handy function stolen from xah lee s webpage

1994232
value	field
the initialization code is insert into a constructor in the order it appears in the source code which means that a field initializer can use the initial value of field declare before it

1994232
dependency-injection	inject
instead using dependency-injection is preferable - letting someone else another class framework initializer and inject the dependencies in your class

1994234
fontfamily	font-size
an easy alternative to hard-coding the margins would be to set it to a multi-binding on font-size fontfamily fontweight etc then use a imultivalueconverter to compute the proper margins given this these value

1994234
richtextbox	textblock
the front textbox is replace with a richtextbox or textblock whose content is computed dynamically to be the text with extra characters but the regular text transparency

1994237
constructor	object
this removes the responsibility of creating the b object from the constructor of a

1994237
constructor	object	implements	extends
a benefit that this gives you is that you can now pass any object that extends b or implements b if it is an interface to a s constructor and it will work

1994237
constructor	object
one disadvantage is that you give up encapsulation of the b object .so it is exposed to the caller of the a constructor

1994264
directory	folder
right-click the websites folder an individual website folder a virtual directory or a file

1994264
selected	checkbox
selected the enable content expiration checkbox

controllers	routes
you may notice that controllers destroy id is not listed by rake routes but it does fit the controllers action id form of the default route

1994305
delphi	c++
a kludgy workaround may be to set the service to start manually then write a very small stubs service in unmanaged code c++ delphi to start the service

1994318
value	field
this does mean your main page will have to carry the edit field value from first load but very often that is a small price to pay because the user accepts a wait at that time not .when they click a button

1994325
g++	gcc
once i downloading and install that and changed my path back to the default then g++ and gcc work fine

instances	self
if a new object is returned from an init methods we need to updates self .so that any subsequent instances variables references affect the right places in memory

1994462
python	perl
a big advantage perl has over python is that .when parsing text is the ability to use regular expression directly as part of the language syntax

1994467
json	xml
you might want to look at json it s a very popular format and is far simpler than xml

1994478
dynamic-linking	static-linking
1 i ve been on project where dynamic-linking vs static-linking was benchmarking and the difference wasn t determined small enough to switching to dynamic-linking i wasn t part of the test i just know the conclusion

1994478
solaris	linux
i m not sure that all os allow to separate the two concepts but solaris and linux do and istr that hp-ux does as well

1994483
subclassing	nsobject

1994539
python	c++
as a matter of fact i am a c++ developer and i have done some symbian c++ but even with that experience i find myself looking into python no previous experience with python to write and test small symbian utilities

1994541
debugging	exit
the simplest checked is simply to wrap your allocation and log them to a file with the line and file information for your debugging mode and most any leaks will be apparent very quickly .when you exit the program and numbers don t tally up

1994547
firefox	safari
also itâ s slightly faster than using the attributes not equals to selectorâ in firefox but slightly slower in safari

1994554
linux	osx
if you re working under linux or osx have a look at valgrind free available on osx via macports

1994564
accessor	ivar
if you are using automatic kvo notifications you have to use the accessor instead of directly manipulating the ivar to triggers notifications

1994582
triggers	insert
you can include a timestamp field in your recording and create a triggers in the sql-server to updates that timestamp on updates or insert

1994589
factors	primes
since m is primes m must divide one of those factors

1994675
winpcap	libpcap
for filtering there s libs like winpcap or libpcap

1994684
boolean-operations	modulo
thanks to boolean-operations that shortcut this should be a good enough solution regarding the average numbers of comparisons it required at most only one modulo per numbers it has no loops it can be nicely formatted to look symmetric and it is obvious what it tests

1994690
nsstring	nsdata
md5 is available on the iphone and can be added as an addition for ie nsstring and nsdata like below

1994695
registration	login
i have created all tables related to login and registration

1994709
binary-tree	tree
avl is a balanced tree with log n height this is the lowest height possible for binary-tree

1994715
binary-search-tree	tree
in computer science an avl tree is a self-balancing binary-search-tree and it is the first such data structure to be invented

1994722
callback	methods
.when you are done you have to patch the callback to call the original endscene methods

1994725
void	main
static void main within any static-class but you can change it as you could change entry-point in vc6

1994726
binary-search-tree	tree
avl tree red-black tree b-tree balanced binary-search-tree

1994740
jquery	dojo
there are to versioning of comet implementation dojo and jquery

1994817

al.so if you don t want an error you can use a default-value for that field .so the field value would be as the default-value instead of null

1994822
keyboard	mouse
get stuff done with the keyboard more and depend on the mouse less

1994822
ubuntu	linux
i also occasionally use ubuntu linux

1994826

is it correct that you want to create a windows form which provides input-field textbox checkbox etc. for all field properties of an object that you feed to the form as its datasource

1994847
search-engine	web-crawler
.so i would go for letting search-engine web-crawler decides whether a page is worth indexing

1994954
show	next
i am looking for best aproach from perfomance points of view to show resultset on webpage partially lets say by 10 item per page and if user want to see more result he pressing next button

1994979
jndi	jdbc
to the points you re trying to access a jndi resource with a jdbc url

1994979
jndi	jdbc
to fix this problem you need either to defined a jndi resource and access it with a jndi named or to load the jdbc drivers yourself and connect it with a jdbc url

1994985
buffering	streaming
it must buffering to create a streaming of data not matter what you try to do at each end to send or receive things separately

i use this code to export report

1994998
administration	account
then make it an administration action to wipe the account and associated post completely

1995014
put	get
a brief demonstration of what a monstrosity you can actually get away with in .net 4.0 this will actually compile and run and put up an instances of form1

1995031
sql-server	mysql
mysql provide an export functionnality that let you export your schema into sql-server compatible format

1995033
prerequisites	installshield
is there a way to change the default location of installshield s prerequisites issetupprerequisites

1995043
show	next
one approach is to have your first query obtain all results store them in a db show the first 20 and then let the next prev links pull subset of the stored data out of the db

1995058
constructor	object
an object does not exist if its constructor does not finish

1995058
constructor	object
.so putting a while 1 loops in a constructor will prevent object being created using that constructor

1995099
google-maps	bing-maps
it can used for both the bing-maps and google-maps

1995141
shell	bash
on linux you can use just the shell bash ksh etc to parsing log files if they are not too big in size

1995141
python	perl
of course perl or python or practically any other languages with file reading and string manipulation capabilities can be used as well

1995147
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m going to diverge from the other answers and say that it is a very bad idea to have a sqlconnection and especially sqldatareader as global state

1995150
where-clause	sql
can anyone confirm whether or not the sql 1999 arrays types constructor provides any operations for searching the arrays in a where-clause

1995154
python	ruby
in ruby python c you can concatenation strings just like this

1995166
value	field
if there is a field named namedd live click is not working .when i click input namedd value

1995166
value	field
if i change named from named to named2 click on field namedd value works

1995172
display	height
i often use formborderstyle sizabletoolwindow with forms on smaller resolution display ie netbooks for the smaller title-bar height and border sizes

1995182
python	java
python is usually considered easier to work with than java

1995182
erlang	scala
if distributing your concurrent applications across multiple machines is a requirement it is worth looking at runtime designed for this erlang or scala actors

1995193
automake	gnu
gnu automake 1.10.1

1995212
uitableview	uiview
if you do not have a fixed numbers of items you ll either want to create the views manually just +alloc -initwithframe the right uiview subclassing and -addsubview and keep a pointers to the view in another arrays or use a uitableview which is suitable for all kinds of lists of things

1995213
textbox	button
the validation always happens .when the textbox lose focus and i don t wanna it to validation .when the user click cancel button it is just a little bit silly to validation .when the user click cancel

1995244
order	join
you get the same order instances in any of the results but since now you are doing a join with the ordertransaction it has to return the same amount of results a regular sql join will return

1995248
arrays	loops
if you want to access the next character in your loops with iterator you could do that safely but increasing the arrays subscript might segfault on you on the last elements hence needing another checked

1995267
python	ruby
i don t know if you have to do this in ruby or not but the python community has some pretty strong science ties things like numpy and scipy seem to be everyone s favorite in that community

1995271
any	set
and i want to be able to cast from any of the variation classes to fullclass such that the defined field will be copy-paste and the missing field are set to defaultvalues

1995283
digits	zero
as written getint treats a + or - not followed by a digits as a valid representation of zero

1995286
perl	php
i m aware of the possibility of using 1 2 etc. inside the regex but i d like to match and then use the value in subsequent statements as is possible in perl php etc

1995288
serialization	marshalling
after the lookup describe above the object used as parameters in a rmi call are serialization marshalling that means a byte by byte representation of the object non transient data will be send over the network connection

1995289
value	field
in the field that is the id that auto-increments i want the user to see the recording numbers that this recording is by somehow showing latest value+1 in the field value

1995301
observers	listener
there are several listener observers approaches for this in iphone application development

1995303
value	field
with the hints kindly provided above here s what i found most useful as someone pretty new to jmockit jmockit provides the deencapsulation class to allow you to set the value of private dependent field no need to drag the spring libs in and the mockups class that allows you to explicit create an implementation of an interface and mock one or more methods of the interface

1995314
dictionary	arrays
arrays dictionary gb_trees and gb_sets modules does this

1995353
defined	declare
first you can defined four classes for each data types then declare templae class for types pairs then for three-types combinations then for four ones

1995358
silverlight	wpf
wait is it wpf or silverlight

1995360
environment	building
for running the compile target of a package foo it allows you to run make package foo compile which will recursively invoke make with the right environment variables inorder to building the subdirectories

1995378
filesystems	fat
if you are on fat ntfs in case-insensitive mode essentially any time it s being used under windows or hfs+ in case-insensitive mode and have two files foobar and foobar then git will see two distinct files but the filesystems will only see one which will cause all kinds of problems

1995384
boost	stl
std wstring would be much more portable and benefit from a lot of existing prewritten code in stl and in boost

1995390
python	ruby
your server-side application might generator the plist format for you using plistlib on python or plist for ruby

1995391
arrays	loops
is it better to create a single huge points arrays in loops and then stoke the entire arrays once

1995407
communication	messages
only if something is transmitted to communication the length - either prepend the length to the messages or send a terminator character of some kind

1995416

1995473
wordpress-plugin	wordpress
my wordpress-plugin call my integration function inside my application s bootstrap from myapplication libs wordpress

1995481
nsmutablearray	nsarray
one final note you mention taking an nsmutablearray and creating an nsarray with it

1995481
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you should be aware that an nsmutablearray is already an nsarray since it s a subclassing

1995481
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you can use an instances of nsmutablearray anywhere you d want an nsarray without creating some new copy of it

1995485
nsmutablearray	nsarray
outside of that since nsarray and nsmutablearray expect object .so it s difficult to get around this

1995513
data-members	instances
static data-members are shared among all instances of the class

1995513
local-variables	function-call
static local-variables in functions persistent across the scoping of each function-call

1995517
debian	linux
linux debian lenny 5.0.3

1995555
hash	md5	salt	md5
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the passwd then it would have to stored alongside the hash and salt passwd value which means you have an unsalt hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit

1995555
hash	md5
by taking a sha hash of an md5 hash you re reducing the possibility of the plain text value as there s a finite numbers of md5 hash value as they are fixed length

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
it takes two functions as arguments mouseover and mouseout

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
or the plain mouseover mouseout equivalent

1995557
slidedown	slideup

1996694
communication	messages
well you can use shared-memory between process too but that s not as common as messages passing. on unix systemd fork has typically been very cheap .so traditional design of concurrent programs in unix uses process and pipe to communication between them but on systemd where process creation is an expensive operation threads are often regarded as the better approach

1996698
32-bit	64bit

1998396
callback	methods
notably missing from the above is the storing result messages that s supposed to be printed in the factoryhandler s get_stock callback methods

1998396
callback	methods
i m at a loss as to why since the sendc_get_stock methods doesn t produce any immediate errors and is basically just a copy of the stockhandler s code and from there it s the responsibility of the ami orb interface to make the callback

32-bit - program files x86

1998505
temporary	copy
while i do not know of a way to get ie to unload a dll it keeps the dll file handle open -- i hope it release the object themselves correctly... one solution i use is to copy the dll over to a temporary file based on the assembly versioning before opening it and then explicit breaking the ie com whatever caching

1998511
yaml	ini
your configuration might also reside in an xml yaml or ini file but then you d have to have some sort of configuration class being able to read the file

1998644
c-preprocessor	macros
you might consider using the m4 macros processor instead of c-preprocessor

1998651
constructor	private	instances	private
a nice example can be singleton pattern.in this all you need is a single instances for a given class and that can be made sure by making the constructor private and giving a static methods or properties to access the instances.following code-snippets highlight the same -

1998692
any	set
all right...so is there any logical difference between that pdostatement thing and the recording set i get from fetch

1998788
32-bit	64bit
short answer is no there is no option in the compiler to make time_t a 64bit value in a 32-bit application

1998788
32-bit	64bit
it was extended to a 64bit value for 64bit applications as this seemed like a good change to make but for compliance with all the various standards it has to be kept as a signed 32-bit value for 32-bit applications

1998792
innodb	myisam
with innodb you don t need this anyway as the storage engine can t go into an inconsistent state unlike myisam and others

1998843

1999033
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
if you know you are running on 64bit windows then if it a process is running in wow64 mode then it must be 32-bit that is what wow64 is for - running 32-bit applications on 64bit windows if not then you can assume 64bit

contains	set
if this is not possible then you can set an ivar on the second view controllers .when it is created that contains the instances of the viewcontrollers that you want to change the background-color on

1999217
buffering	streaming
i can at least tell that the most common memory-efficiency mistakes in a webapp are abusing the httpsession as a copy of a datastore and using a instead of buffering streaming to pipe data from the one to other side

1999228
contains	sorted	contains	elements
i have a webpage loaded up in the browser its dom and elements positioning are both accessible to me and i want to find the block elements or a sorted list of these elementss which likely contains the most content as in a continuous block of text

1999278
any	set
you will need to checked the standards input of your program and you will need to set the standards input .so the input are not buffering otherwise you won t see any input until it is validation by the user pressing return

1999280
linux	unix
in pthreads environment such as are implements by gcc-compiled programs under unix linux that functionality isn t directly there

1999292
