130006
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit versioning of the .net jitter can apply it as an optimization at the il level which is all but useless if you need to support 32-bit platform

130079
attributes	properties
the only drawback i found was that i needed to decorator the specific string properties with a specific attributes

130109
modifiers	final
btw there s no need to explicit specify static final modifiers for field in interfaces because only static final field are allowed

130165
textbox	button
.when a value gets entered into a textbox the radio button are enabled via javascript

130165
selected	button	radio	click
the user then selected one of the radio button and click on a submit button which post back to the server

130165
radio-button	textbox
on the client this enables the radio-button .when the textbox value is changed

130165
radio-button	button
i then click the radio-button then postback via a button but back on the server this is always false

130181
attributes	properties
how i have solved it in the past is to set the disabled flag using attributes tags instead of using the enabled properties

130215
png	gif
we just include a gif versioning of every png alongside it in the same path and if the browser is found to be one that doesn t handle pngs properly it swaps it out with a gif versioning of the image

130230
telnet	ssh
ssh encrypts all communication does everything telnet does and more

130233
perl	php
i started using subversioning for one of my project and it would be absolutely amazing if i could just export the latest versioning from the repository on my production server by for example running a php or perl scripting

130241
constructor	object
then use types.getconstructor types to get a reference to a constructor for the specific generics types and finally call constructorinfo.invoke to get an instances of the object

130255
ubuntu	debian
the most common way would be to package it in a .rpm file for redhat -based distros like fedora or a .deb file for debian -based distros like ubuntu

130260
arrays	loops
you can use an arrays to store your data and just loops over it

130264
authentication	login
inorder to authentication request to the different service you include your access identifier login required

130264
credentials	account
amazon doesn t support more than one set of credentials per account

130270
ubuntu	debian
find someone skilled with debian and get their help to set up a building-process to building .deb package for debian and ubuntu

python	perl
or do i have to move to a scripting-language like python perl

130282
perl	php
as far as i know there is no svn client fully written in php or perl

130282
sftp	ftp
again depending on your access methods i m guessing ftp or sftp you might updates a local checkout and sync any changes up onto the web spaces

130298
utility	gnu
here s a general-purpose batch-file to printing the top n line from a file like the gnu head utility instead of just a single line

130299
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
there are great windows distributions for perl python ruby etc. .so no rea.son not to use them really

130300
packaging	building
then you building everything into a package using the packaging tools

130304
data-structures	linked-list
keep in mind that unless you re writing your own data structure linked-list in c it can depend dramatically on the implementation of data-structures in your language framework of choice

130314
authentication	login
removing the authentication section will required you to implements the redirection to the login page in your attributes but this shouldn t be a big deal

130323
htmlspecialchars	echo
this means that every single echo or printing statement should use htmlspecialchars

130323
external	embed
a third example could be shell cmd if you are going to embed strings such as arguments to external cmd and call them with execute then you must use escapeshellcmd and escapeshellarg

130327
any	set
using any member of the windows-server family i can set up an active-directory and have a single pool of users for a large scale of computers

130383
access-control	authentication
use the active-directory credentials for authentication and access-control

130387
arrays	map
if not looking in your map try moving the arrays declaration .so that one by one things placed after it are shuffled to be before it instead

130433
any	set
the latency may also be set to any arbitrary numbers of milliseconds

130433
linux	bsd
you could also use vmware to run bsd or linux and try this article dummynet or this one

130449
bin-packing	np-hard
note that the bin-packing problem is np-hard which means that for practical applications you ll want to decide what s most important to you .so you can pick an approach that will give you an approximately best .solution in rea.sonable time

130460
arrays	loops
this save-and-restore mechanism is the same one we ve already seen twice now in the control variables of a foreach loops and in the _ arrays of subroutine parameters

130494
groovy	java
i use the commercial versioning of jalopy for my java project but it doesn t work on groovy files

130500
average	min
running the test right after an oracle restart i will see a 1 min load average of 5 or .so and average cpu around 10-15

130515
required	checked
detection the os of the client s machine required browser sniffing - checked request.browser

130516
hash	tie
if the memory used by the hash is excessive physical memory you could tie them to a file on disk

130523
textmate	bbedit
never zoom font-size but did make switching from non-antialiased bbedit to antialiasing textmate and am not going back

130527
contains	any
obviously if you re writing an application which contains some parallelisable algorithm then you can probably start benchmarking to find a good balance in the numbers of threads but bear in mind that hundreds of threads won t speed up any operation

130541
benchmarking	profiling
i d probably leave that as-is unless i found a problem via benchmarking profiling

130544
push	pull
sax is a push model while xmlreader is a pull parsing that has a numbers of benefits

130547
postgresql	mysql
please don t tell me to use mysql or sqlite or postgresql

130578
macros	vba
it is a convenient way to write complex macros including activex automation if you don t want to use vba or their c++ or .net sdks or if a diesel expression doesn t cut it

130585
webserver	security	webserver	upload
if you were the administration of an apache webserver what protocols s would you prefer to provide for the web developers to upload static files html gif css ... with the goal of maximum security

130587
environment	building
as brian mentions user-defined macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which building tasks execute

130600
scp	ssh
ssh scp

130612
environment	building
this can be valuable if you add a new dependency to your project and forget to setup the release building environment to take that into account

130629
sftp	scp
i give web developers instructions on using an sftp scp client and a login shell using scponly

130629
webserver	upload
that way they get their access to upload files but i have fewer concerns about them doing bad things to the webserver

130668
dictionary	arrays
you can t gaurantee the order because a dictionary is not a list or an arrays

130668
lookup	any
it s meant to lookup a value by the key and any ability to iterate value is just a convenience but the order is not behavior you should depend on

130678
digits	base
convert each block of 47 bits to a base 26 numbers of 10 digits

130678
base	zero
.when decoding the letters a truncated final block can be filled out with zero letters and converted to a 47-bit base 2 representation

130685
temporary	copy
.when running your .app seek to the end of the file minus the size of the struct extraction the file offset and copy the 2nd exe to a temporary folder then launchd it

130699
selected	button
right click on the cmd button and selected assign macros

130714
pixels	line
with emacs i can get the proggy fonts .so that there are zero pixels separating the descenders on one line from the highest ascender on the line below

130715
python	java
you have the full power of -- whatever language you re using -- python java c# -- .so use that language well

130728
double-quotes	single-quotes
in windows dos prompt cmd.exe you need to use double-quotes not single-quotes

130730
constructor	private
i have an immutable class with some private field that are set during the constructor execution

130748
radio-button	selected
based on which radio-button is selected i want to display the proper control to the user

130748
any	set
the way i m doing this now is just loading both controls and setting up an onradiobuttonselectionchanged methods which gets called at form load to set the initial state and at any time the selection is changed

130754
32-bit	64bit
this is likely why you re only getting an error in 32-bit mode - .when compiling for 64bit mode it compiles for your processor more closely

130785
any	set
now you can use a fake mock object to set up its state such that any methods that rely on configuration can be tested to see if they utilize the correct values.

130795
ubuntu	debian
the way i do it on debian ubuntu boxes

130798
mp3	wma
if your streaming is some format other than wav file data like mp3 or wma you will have to perform the additional step of decoding the data into wav and playing it with the waveoutxxxx api

130801
autotools	gnu	build-system	autotools
i m using gnu autotools for the build-system on a particular project

130826
vb.net	vb6
you could use it as a text-editor only though it will offer you the vb.net intellisense not vb6

130862
constructor	object
suppose you have an object which in its constructor does something like

130862
constructor	object
instead pass the object in as an arguments to the constructor

130887
fwrite	fopen
i m more intrigued by the developer who doesn t mind writing in c++ assembly but not .net - but is apparently stymied by fopen fseek fwrite - since that s about all the program you describe sounds like it s doing

130894
ubuntu	debian	cvs	git
i have the source of a program taken from cvs svn git ... and i d like to building a debian ubuntu package for it

130936
sftp	ssh
i use ssh configuration to limit users to sftp on a development server then use version-control to review the changes and move them to production with got format-patch

130963
integrated-security	connection-string
connections are pooled per process per application domain per connection-string and .when integrated-security is used per windows identity

130968
sql-server-express	sql-server
the best would be of course sql-server but i can t afford a full-blown versioning at this moment and i don t think sql-server-express will be a good choice for the loaded service

130968
sql-server	postgresql
given that my development-environment will be asp.net 3.5 with say nhibernate or linq-to-sql how much trouble will i have if i use postgresql instead of sql-server

130986
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
could you guys recommend some affordable sql model tool which supports sql-server postgresql and mysql

130995
sql-server	oracle
currently linq only works with sql-server possibly oracle

131003
arrays	map	hashmap	arrays
i would second michael carman s comment please do not use the term hashmap or map .when you mean a hash or associativity arrays

131023
haskell	erlang	haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme	common-lisp	haskell	common-lisp	erlang	common-lisp	scheme
i know there is a list-comprehension libs for common-lisp incf-cl i know they re supported natively in various other functional and some non-functional languages f# erlang haskell and c# - is there a list-comprehension libs for scheme

131030
groovy	java
since it s implements in groovy you should be able to use it from any of your java project

131042
postgresql	mysql
some people i ve worked with have had good things to say about toad - it works with mysql though not postgresql

131050
constructor	private
since as3 does not allow private constructor it seems the only way to construct a singleton and guarantee the constructor isn t explicit created via new is to pass a single parameter and checked it

131050
constructor	private	constructor	object
the private object passed on the constructor seems preferable but it does not look like you can have a private class in the same package

131053
object-reference	instances
i have been getting an error in vb.net object-reference not set to an instances of object

131062
viewwillappear	addsubview
if i create a rootviewcontrollers and call addsubview on that controllers i would expect the added view s to be wired up for viewwillappear events

i ve found most machines have a resolution of about 16 ms on ie where google-chrome or firefox may have a resolution as good as 1ms

131068
keydown	keyup
i am trying to trap and recording keydown and keyup time in milliseconds and need it in the + - 10 ms range or less

131097
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
in fact its pl postgresql stored proc language is closer to oracle s pl sql than it is to ms sql-server s t-sql

131097
sql-server	postgresql
postgresql is scalability and works ok now with windows earlier versioning didn t support windows formally and pgadmin is a good management tool for it you ll be able to do most of the stuff you can do with sql-server s gui tools with it in a short time

131098
object-reference	instances
and the nullreferenceexception is the source of the object-reference not set to an instances of an object

131103
margins	padding
still has pages that suggest twiddling padding margins or even using javascript to fix these issues

131116
updating	updates
i m wondering if updating statistics has helped you before and how did you know to updates them

131140
sniffing	traffic
exposing your svn repo using http instead of http .so people sniffing your traffic can get your passwd - again don t do this

131140
rollback	commit
personally i wouldn t worry about this last step as if they compromise your production server you have bigger problems and you can easily just rollback whatever changes they may try to commit to svn

131179
contains	any
imagemagick-6.4.3 contains nothing interesting and i can t find any other files that i might be able to points gem install at

131186
dependency-injection	inject
that said no matter how you splice it if you re performing dependency-injection you re going to have collaborations with those classes whose functionality is inject in and something that sticks the depended upon object in whether its a full blown injection framework or just some assembler class

131190
value	field
.when working with databases you can get this error .when you try to get a value form a field or row which doesn t exist

131223
global-assembly-cache	gac
you can register the assembly in the gac global-assembly-cache

131224
global-assembly-cache	gac
the .snk file is used for signing the assemblies inorder to be able to add them to the global-assembly-cache gac

131251
g++	gcc
i believe gcc g++ have equivalent flags

131256
autotools	gnu	toolchain	gnu	toolchain	platform	toolchain	autotools	environment	building
the first is about adding tests to the gnu autotools toolchain - but those tests if i m understanding you correctly are for both validation that the environment necessary to building your application exists dependent libs and tools as well as adapt the building to the environment platform specific difference

131256
toolchain	autotools
the second is about unit-testing your c++ application and where to invoke those tests you ve proposed doing .so from the autotools toolchain presumably from the configure scripting

131262
google-chrome	firefox
unless firefox and google-chrome have their own high-resolution timer implements i believe that the best resolution you ll be able to get from a browser on the windows platform is going to be around 10 ms

131267
linked-list	nodes
now if you use iterator generally speaking it will make its best effort to be as efficient as possible in the case of a linked-list it will maintain a pointers to the current nodes and advance it in each iterator requiring just a single operation

131278
remote-debugging	debugging
you can throw it away once you re done debugging and you never need to upload it to the server unless you re planning to do remote-debugging

131279
any	set
now that i know about this trick feature i can easily set breakpoints on any part of my code that i want to which saves me loads of time and effort

131288
perl	ruby	perl	c++	javadoc	doxygen
for java we use javadoc for perl we use inline pod with some javadoc styles additions parameters and types return-type and exception-handling for ruby it s rdoc styles and in our c and c++ code we used doxygen

131325
lookup	any
implements any alias lookup logic you want in the action that route routes you to

131325
implements	extends
you can extends this technique to be as complicated as you want although as it gets more complicated it makes more sense to implements it by tweak either your routes or the ruby-on-rails default router logic rather than by essentially reimplementsing all the router logic yourself

131334
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	perl	python	ruby	python	java	python	c++
these days prototype usually are written in a younger dynamic-languages perl python ruby etc and implementation of successful research is usually in c or c++ sometimes java

processor	affinity
with a multi-core processor systemd you could use affinity to your advantage

131381
any	set
if you set it up on the local machine you don t need to know or do any of the above just run the install and then use your favourite client to interact with it

131382
printf	scanf
if it s all done with printf scanf and friend then you ll probably be best off by finding creating an include file that all the .source files include and adding a macros that redirects printf scanf and friend to your own functions that are written .so as to be amenable to dll implementation

131422
any	set
pretty sure the answer is you can t since the sql generator include the value entered for any dynamic filtering set up .when you built the query and as you say the act of editing the sql prevents using the query editor to make further changes

131496
put	get
i don t think you will get the pause if you put an application.doevents

131498
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is asp.net-mvc that much easier than my old-fashioned webforms application

131517
constructor	private
r# usually creator constructor and passing incoming variables to private field which for me mi tend to pass it to properties

131599
base-class	inherited
these types should implements a common interface or inherited a common base-class .so that they can be treated interchangeably polymorphically by code that only cares about archive not specific archive types

131599
abstract-factory	factory-method
for bonus points the single responsibility principles can even justify using a factory-method or abstract-factory for creating your model-view and controllers object rather than new-ing them up inline

131605
worksheet	excel
more than one person is working on a excel spreadsheet and they may be making changes to the same worksheet which they want to merge and integrated

is there any easy way to use say gecko firefox or even webkit safari google-chrome for rendering

131766
getter	setter	initializer	getter	initializer	setter
with dependency-injection instead of initializer the groupmembershipservice within your personservice you d either pass it in to the personservice constructor or else add a properties getter and setter to set a local instances of it

131834
32-bit	64bit
for example in 64bit systemd int and unsigned int may be 32-bit wide but size_t must be big enough to store numbers bigger than 4g

ellipse	angle
i know nothing else about the ellipse but the only thing i need to know is what angle the major axis is rotated at

131851
subtract	time
datetime object support the - operators .so you can just read your time into such object and subtract them

131876
ellipse	line
in your case that s the line from -2.5 6 to 5 -3 the top side of your ellipse

keyboard	mouse
is there a keyboard shortcut for pasting the content of the clipboard into a command-prompt windows on windowss-xp instead of using the right mouse button

131973
click	mouse
if you can use your mouse right click on the cmd windows works as paste .when i tried it

131975

python	java
my background was predominantly c unix and python with some java and dusty 2000-vintage vb6 .when i first used c#

132034
environment	building
you can set the properties in a properties-file as part of the building and pass in a parameter to the building cmd to tell it which server environment to building for

132034
environment	building
but it can work well - if you set up a continuous-integration server it can building for all the different environment and test the bundles for you

132071
any	set
as lars mentioned one possible j2ee solution is to store such details under jndi making the exact same application binary deployable on any environment leaving dbas admins to set the username passwd for each machine

132097
required	checked
this is easily and quickly done by checked that the to-be-injected object a implements the interface required by object b for all configure object injections

132102
pixels	line
then narrow screens users like my 800 pixels eee 701 don t have to twiddle the horizontal scrollbar to read every single line and wide screens users who don t know how to resize their browser windows don t get 500 character wide 1 character high paragraph

132105
contains	any
the latest makefile we ve received from a third party vendor contains rules with --depend on the end of building rules .so i thought i would look it up on google but try as i might i can t persuade it to display any pages with exactly the characters --depend

one option is to use type-ahead with postback ajax to reduce the size of the list

132199
ellipse	angle
set the angle of the ellipse 0

instances	private
failing that you can create a new class that has similar properties that simply callback to a private instances of the class you are interested in

132358
buffering	streaming
a problem with this approach see bellow is that .when creating the string streaming the buffering gets copy-paste and memory usage double

132394
stringstream	ifstream
you might want to checked his answer where he uses the ifstream s read methods as you used to do and then set the stringstream buffering to points to the previously allocated memory

132424
malloc	free
the problem with a crt that does not leak is that the executable might reasonable expect to use the memory as malloc ed memory should remain usable until free is called

132444
oracle	mysql
it works fine on mysql and oracle

132452
highlight	selected
a little while ago i managed to get visual-studio 2008 c++ into a state where if i would selected a keyword or any symbols for that matter by either double click on it or highlight it all other instances of that symbols within the current file would become highlight too

132527
windows-server	windows
you can use windows network load balancing on windows-server for no extra cost

132535
constructor	object
field really represent the inherent state of your object and the constructor job is to initializer this internal state

132535
constructor	object
the transformation logic you apply to the constructor arguments or to the properties input value before setting the internal state of the object could be very different

132542
quadtree	r-tree
there is a java implementation of quadtree and r-tree

132569
radgridview	xtragrid
i have used the .net s griddataview without any problems using the virtual mode while trying to show over 10000 rows but there are good product out there that are also very good in loading tons of data like developer express xtragrid and telerik s radgridview

132607

- is it reasonable to wrap all the code inside try-catch blocks and than throw a new exception-handling

132655
msbuild	nant
have you thought about using msbuild and nant instead

132668
publishing	release
i had 2 3 different web-config files in my site and on publishing depending on the selected configuration mode release staging etc... i would copy over the web.release.config and rename it to web-config in the afterbuild event and delete the ones i don t need web.staging.config for example

132718
constructor	object
agree with some of the others look at using readonly field that you initializer in the constructor to create immutable object

132718
protected	public
alternatively you could also add access scoping on the properties public get and protected set

132725
constructor	object
is it normals to rely on default initializer value for object or do you explicit set all instance-variables in the constructor

132725
variables	boolean	boolean	int	pointers	stack
as for stack procedure-level variables my tests are showing that unitialized boolean are true unitialized int are 2129993264 and uninialized object are just invalid pointers not nil

132747
asp.net-mvc	webforms
yes you can have your webforms pages and asp.net-mvc views mixed in a single web application project

132747
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this could be useful if you have an .application that is already built and you want to migrate your .app from webforms to asp.net-mvc

132747
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you need to make sure that none of your webforms pages go in the views directory in a standards asp.net-mvc application though

132748
configuration	environment
in either case your configuration files can have whatever developer value you want and they ll work fine from within your dev environment without breaking your production systemd

132749
any	set
with inlining there is no need to set up the function-call because the code is directly paste into any methods that uses it

132756
getter	setter
and perhaps they can automatically inline some trivial functions like simple getter setter

132757
python	perl
what are your own reasons to prefer python over perl

132757
python	perl
if .so what is it about perl that gives them a hard time and might work better in python

132764
.when	ready
we thought of making the user click a publishing button .when they re ready to commit their changes but we re afraid users won t remember to do that because from their stand points once they ve move a page to a new place - the action is done

132770
contains	elements
directly or indirectly contains fields-for recording or elements for

132776
inlining	inline
however there is no guarantee that your all candidates for inlining will actually be inline by the compiler

132776
inlining	inline
some compilers vc2005 have an option for aggressive inlining and you wouldn t need to specify the inline keyword .when using that option

132787
tapestry	wicket
tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though

132790
checkbox	button
use a publishing checkbox button and .when the user interacts with the page in a way that causes them to navigate away ask them if they want to publishing if that box is not checked button not click

132801
asp.net-mvc	webforms	controllers	routes
you ll need to make sure your asp.net-mvc routes don t conflict with your webforms pages .so that request for a .aspx page don t get routed to a controllers action as a parameter etc

132829
exception-handling	try-catch
i m from the school of thought where try-catch blocks should be used and exception-handling not rethrown

132841
solaris	bsd
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

132851
rollback	commit
you can then either rollback or commit

132865
debugging	trace
this way .when you are debugging you do not have to search through inner exception-handling and stack trace to find the real issue

132877
value	field
.when delphi first creates an object all of the field start out empty that is pointers are initializer to nil strings and dynamic-arrays are empty numbers have the value zero boolean field are false and variants are set to unassigned

132885
configuration	environment
is there an easy way to do this based on .some variables .so that the configuration doesn t have to be revised .when deploying to a new environment every time

132889
installation	environment
you can find out where gem are install by running gem environment look for installation directory

132898
exception-handling	try-catch
if i am reading the question correctly i would say that implements a try-catch which intercept exception-handling you don t mention - is it catching all exception-handling or just a specific one

132917
click	mouse
try assign your menu to the contextmenustrip properties of notifyicon rather than showing it in the mouse click handler

i m running windows-xp professional but advice for any versioning of windows would be potentially helpful to someone

132975
windows-xp	windows
for the original question asking about windows-xp and windows 7 windows task scheduling

132975
windows-server	windows
for newer microsoft os versioning windows-server 2012 windows 8 look at the schtasks command-line utility

132981

you ll find another solution here best way to switching configuration between development uat prod environment in asp.net

133002
put	get
all of this is using the blaze proxy since it involves get put delete and .post call

133027
data-structures	binary-tree	data-structures	hashmap
2 actions like add sort remove can take different amounts of time with different data-structures and algorithms for example add and find are o 1 for a hashmap but o log n for a binary-tree

133027
bubble-sort	quicksort
sort is o nlog n for quicksort but o n 2 for bubble-sort .when dealing with a plain arrays

in this standalone example i am going to have to format the date as a string in my code prior to evaluation the expression

133147
http	ssl
http ssl

133155
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop is pretty obscure it s basically splitting the arrays into a head the first elements and a tail all other elementss

133235
any	set
if you have any other pages outside the purview of the asp.net application then you set up handling for them in iis

133236

gridview	listview	gridview	formview	databound	formview	databound	gridview
if the server-side control is within a databound control listview gridview formview detailview then the syntax is

133271
inlining	inline
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointers to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

133330
compact-framework	.net
my platform is windows-mobile 5.0 sdk and .net 2.0 compact-framework c# vb.net

running the command-line syntax from an elevated command-prompt works

133399
attributes	properties
there is no properties with the attributes

133426
inlining	inline
as has been suggested in previous answers use of the inline keyword can make code faster by inlining function-calls often at the expense of increased executable

133426
any	set
however modern compilers are very good at inlining function-calls automatically without any prompt from the user .when set to high optimisation

133426
defined	declare
however declaring an inline-functions using the inline keyword has other effects and may actually be necessary to satisfy the one-definition-rules odr this rules in the c++ standards states that a given symbols may be declare multiple time but may only be defined once

133427
http	ssl
use ssl otherwise known as http

133440
contains	lookup
i tend to draw the line with the rules that if it will result in a column in the database contains a magic numbers that maps to an enumerator value then the enumerator should really exist as a lookup table

133446
filtering	grouping
ensure the user and workspace filtering are cleared and you ll get a list of all files grouping by changelist and client specifications

133451
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
in my designs the business-logic-layer manipulates the object based on the business rules then passes them to the data-access-layer which will format them to go into the database or the object from the database and the data service-layer handles the actual database call

133453
windows-xp	windows
windows ipsec faq says that it s not supported in windows-xp but maybe they changed it in service pack 3

133461

also show them how they can do all the good stuff in perl in python

133461
python	perl
show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl

133472
session-cookies	cookies
using cookies as a potential third option is simply not workable for the simple reason that many of your visitor are likely to have cookies turned off this doesn t affect session-cookies however

133473
installation	building
this will create the locale directory in the flex buildinger installation and building some required resources into them

133530
findwindow	showwindow
you can use findwindow to find the application handle and showwindow to minimize it

133550
signals	sigint
then you can install a signals handler for sigint and sigterm that break loops

133569

the stdlib map implementation is based on tree which provides better performance o log n than the standards arrays or stdlib vector

133573
python	java	python	c++
and .when you need to connect to the phone software or hardware you have can use java python c++ windows-mobile or the new kid on the block android

133609
sql-server	oracle
instead of is relatively new in sql-server i know there s an oracle equivalent

133613
hash	md5
if that s your case then you can just store a hash signature md5 instead and compare it with the signature of the entered passwd

133615
build-system	cmake
kde community with it s kde 4 series started to use cmake as a build-system

133666
radio-button	button
if you look at the html generator by asp.net for a disabled radio-button you ll see that the button is embedded in a span tag and the disabled attributes of the span is set to true

133679
csv	xml
i know sourcemonitor can be scripted to allow me to supply the files to be tested and grab the metrics out of the result file csv or xml

133679
revision	utility
ideally i want to get metrics for a specified file revision rather than a whole project which my utility will drag from version-control automatically

133720
http	ssl
are you sure you are connecting your http client to the server ports that talks over http tls ssl rather than http

133729
click	mouse
i believe it s as simple as capturing a mouse click event at an area at the edges of a cell header and then dynamically changing the width of the column as the mouse is dragged

133744
font-size	width
you can also size an object relative to the font-size by specifying the width in terms of ems 10em

133751
ssas	olap
basically we want a fast setup and deploy which doesn t inherently lend itself to ssas using sql-server 2005 but we want to use ssrs for report and we want an olap model for analysis in excel .so we d still like to use ssas to building the cube if possible

133751
rolap	ssas
the common solution in ssas for a fast deploy is rolap but we are getting execution errors on larger rolap queries and we also don t like all the overhead involved in converting the binary-data to sql and loading it into the cube

133751
ssas	olap
has anyone done work on a custom olap datasource that ssas can use

133772
constructor	object	initializer	setter
in my case all i had to do was initializer the collections object in the constructor and then remove the properties setter

133789
data-structures	tree
you only have to remember the details while modifying avl tree code or maybe during data-structures exams

133877
yaml	ini
ini json and yaml are usually ok

133890
icollection	ienumerable
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implements ienumerable or icollection

133890
icollection	ienumerable

133923
javascript	dom
this is done with javascript and dom manipulations

133932
selected	button
my first reaction .when testing the form was to press enter to edit the selected nodes but doing this would go against the normals default button behavior

133961
jquery	.post
you could use a libs like jquery and its .post methods

133964
boolean	int
i have a database column wantsreply that logically holds a boolean bit but is unfortunately implements as an int

133982
highlight	selected
confuses our users no end that enter doesn t selected what they have highlight

134006
python	perl
and if you re worried about perl being not-quite-as-purely oo as python use moose and i d counter that python is lacking in the functional-programming department compared to perl anyway

134006
python	perl
now if there s some libs or such that your company needs that is available or far superior in python that is not available or of far lesser quality in perl then go ahead and switching or add another language to the mix

134034
contains	any
i then have a main.mxml file that contains the flex application i add my component to the application without any problem

134047
rolap	olap
we are beginning to realize that we just can t use sql for querying and want to know if anyone has created a custom rolap datasource that analysis service or any olap tool can read

134049
triggers	insert
we thought about a triggers but we d have to shuffle the data around every time a new value came in because it might be earlier then the last messages and it can change the entire sequences insert would be slow

134062
constructor	object
if this is used inside a constructor function and the function was invoked with the new keyword this refers to the object that will be created

134081
dictionary	arrays
the other solution would be to bucket-sort your regexes since your key spaces being a character is relatively small and then use a arrays or dictionary to perform the needed regexes after performing a single discrimination on the first character

134092
cellular-network	gps
it has more capabilities gps bluetooth cellular-network and camera which makes for a wider range of potential applications that may actually be used

execute	prepare
if there are no other restrictions on the username a prepare statement would still make sure that the above embedded query doesn t execute at the time of insert and store the value correctly in the database

134149
callback	methods
since a callback is invoked as a function and not as a methods that s why you re seeing what appears to be inconsistent behavior

134149
constructor	object
.when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object

134152
rollback	commit
thus if only one such resource exist in xa-transaction we may first attempt to prepare all others then commit that lro one then if succeed commit others otherwise rollback others

134181
python	java
i definitely would stress against over-use since it would lead to writing c in c# much the same way one can write java in python where you re not embracing the patterns and idioms which make the new language special but instead simply thinking in your old language and converting to new syntax

134232
attributes	properties
the target with such an attributes will be execute if unless a properties with the named is set

134276

134677
exception-handling	try-catch	put	get
this tryparse methods was introduced in .net 2.0 to get over the fact that xxx.parse will through an exception-handling if conversion fails and you have to put in try-catch around the statement

134705
javascript	dom
one key is to understand that javascript dom call are way slower than html-parsing

134713

python	perl
he has a lot of perl experience and a lot of coding experience in general .so his glowing review of python comes with .some weight behind it

135120
javascript	dom
or even better you d have the default action link in the html and you d add the onclientclick event to the elements unobtrusively via javascript after the dom rendering thus ensuring that if javascript is not present utilized you don t have useless event handler riddling your code and potentially obfuscation or at least distracting from your actual content

135128
javascript	dom
this can be done via the dom but i would recommend a javascript libs like jquery

safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135231
system.net.httpwebrequest	httpwebresponse
what i do is building a custom class the wrap system.net.httpwebrequest httpwebresponse .so retrieving pages is as simple as using system.net.webclient

135231
postdata	request
however my custom class also keeps the same cookies containers across request and makes it a little easier to send postdata customize the user-agent etc

135234
ref	out
what is the difference between ref and out parameters in .net

135244
ref	out
ref parameters aren t required to be set in the function whereas out parameters must be bound to a value before exiting the function

135246
32-bit	64bit
everything works as expected on a 32-bit machine the binary files are always written on 32-bit architecture but not on a 64bit box

135246
32-bit	64bit
now on a 32-bit systemd this works great but on a 64bit my time_t sizes are different 32-bit vs 64bit longs

135255
ref	out
out parameters are initializer by the methods called ref parameters are initializer before calling the methods

135255
ref	out
therefore out parameters are used .when you just need to get a secondary return-value ref parameters are used to get a value and potentially return a change to that value secondarily to the main return-value

135257
ref	out
they re pretty much the same - the only difference is that a variables you pass as an out parameter doesn t need to be initializer but passing it as a ref parameter it has to be set to something

135257
ref	out
ref parameters are for data that might be modified out parameters are for data that s an additional output for the function eg int.tryparse that are already using the return-value for something

135263
ref	out
why does c# have both ref and out

135263
ref	out
ref parameters are passed both into and out of a methods

135263
ref	out
.so out means out while ref is for in and out

135275
ref	out
this the out and ref paramerter in c# has some good examples

135275
ref	out
the basic difference outlined is that out parameters don t need to be initializer .when passed in while ref parameters do

135287
selected	button
on the ports settings tab if i want to change the com ports-number for example from com1 to com51 i click the advanced button and then selected the com ports-number i need from the list

135292
ref	out
out and ref are exactly the same with the exception-handling that out variables don t have to be initializer before sending it into the abyss

135292
ref	out
to be more explicit about their use however the meaning of the modifiers is that if you change the reference of that variables in your code out and ref will cause your calling variables to change reference as well

135292
ref	out
if it weren t for ref or out the reference wouldn t be changed

135352
callback	methods
lifecycle of the statelesss session beans are doesnot exist passive and methodsready passive or inactive state.to optimize on perormance instead of traversal the bean all through from create to methods ready state containers manages the bean between active and passive states through the containers callback - ejbactivate and ejbpassivate there by managing the bean pool

135360
32-bit	64bit
for instances an int may be 32-bit on one architecture and 64bit on another

135360
32-bit	64bit
- use native endianness but standards sizes and alignment i 32-bit l 64bit

135361
required	checked
this required developers to know about the sharing and to remember to checked in

135403
ref	out
ref and out both allow the called methods to modify a parameter

135403
ref	out
technically speaking you could use always ref in-place of out but out allows you to be more precise about the meaning of the arguments and sometimes it can be a lot more efficient

135412
webforms	asp.net
i know about asp.net s capability of switching themes instantly but how do i have to design the webforms for it to be easy later

135441
upgrade	migrate
i have factored this code out into a third repository and then i periodically migrate that code into my dependent project repositories as internal release and upgrade step

135441
versioning	upgrade
my individual project then have a revision that looks like upgrade to v4.3.345 of shared.app.dll which include all changes needed to work against that versioning

135454
parentheses	lexical
you should be able to use true false rather than 0 1 in your #define and because the value is a single lexical token it s the one time you don t need parentheses around it

135458
malloc	free
will the detached thread free the memory allocated by malloc or is that something i now have to do

135460
python	perl
fwiw i think something like perl or python might be better suited to that sort of task

135494
any	set
expanding wayne s answer if anything you do needs to set response.headers you can t do it after any part of the response has been fflush

135495
value	field
easiest way would be to have the web service updates a field on a database with the progress of the call and then create a web service that queries that field and returns the value

135516
subclassing	base-class
i would subclassing the datagridview into my own custom control you know add a new windows forms -- custom control file and change the base-class from control to datagridview

135539
show	next
several different employee types will be show a list of tasks to do and as each one completes a task then it is move on to the next employee to work on

135543
versioning	upgrade
the subversioning versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook .so i guess my newer versioning .somehow upgrade the working directory .so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

135543
downgrade	upgrade
there s a scripting that can downgrade upgrade repositories .when it s safe

135545
function-call	inline
you could argue that the iterator process is less efficient but a for _ each also introduces a function-call at each step which might be mitigated by trying to inline the function but remember that inline is only a suggestion to the compiler - it may ignore it

135556
error-code	hresult
it seems likely to me that the os error-code would be an hresult but i have no idea what to look for in terms of potential sources for sharepoint error-codes

135577
linked-list	nodes
adding to the end of a linked-list is o 1 but the constants multiplier is larger than arraylist since you are usually creating a nodes object every time

135589
put	get
make sure you use a masterpage .so that all of your sub pages will have a common base and give all of your elements good ids because you will still need to get your hands dirty with css to put it all together

135599
diagram	erd
not sure if its a part of uml but i find entity relation diagram erd very useful .when model your database.

135600
selected	button
.when i downloading my program from my website to my windows 2003 machine it has a block on it and you have to right click on the exe then properties then selected the button unlock

135612
code-reuse	modularity
code-reuse modularity maintainability and extensibility

135654
command-line	cmd
in other case not windows nor tortoisesvn investigate documentation for command-line versioning of cmd describe above

135656
oracle	mysql
as long as your object has clearly defined input and output the way that the object does what it does doesn t matter at all - storing retrieving data could go from flat-file to xml to memcached to mysql to oracle and you only ever have to concern yourself with one single object

135656
postgresql	mysql
decide at runtime whether you want mysql postgresql memcached or http-post get request to a sketchy server in indonesia

135656
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
keep one thing in mind - oo in php even php5 isn t very good oo compared to a language like python or ruby

135656
python	php
the everything-is-an-object model in python is what made me oo programming really click for me - and as a former php programmer and doubly-certified zend engineer i strongly recommend exploring python oo if you want to understand what oo is all about

135700
device-driver	hardware
writing a device-driver for a very simple piece of external hardware like an 8bit microcontroller that communication via serial or even something you building yourself

135700
device-driver	hardware
if you have any hardware experience maybe try to write a device-driver that can emulate an nes controllers bit-bang a few wires using the serial-port and maybe a serial-to-parallel shift register

135711
freebsd	netbsd	opensolaris	freebsd
if you want to get your hands dirty with kernel programming go with freebsd netbsd or opensolaris for example

135711
opensolaris	linux
you say that you have experience with c -- look at web source code repositories of linux and of opensolaris or some of bsds compare the code and make your own opinion

135711
linux	unix
what i m saying is i guess that there s more to open-source unix than linux and that you should at least look at them before going for linux

135718
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit systemd will required 4 bytes per elements a 64bit systemd will use 8 bytes per elements

135739
declarative	imperative
the for-loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative

135772
static-class	inherited
you cannot inherited from a static-class

135791
json	xml
there are no apis for other language etc.. but it output json or xml so.

135801
any	set
i am using prototype and i can t find any built-in extensions to set or retrieve cookies

135814
eclemma	emma
you could always use a test coverage tool like emma or its eclipse-plugin eclemma or the like

135815
getter	setter
or course this is a simple example but there is a lot of stuff the operators module provides including the items setter getter for list and dictionary

135816
sql-server	oracle
for example what sql-server and sybase call clustered index is called in oracle an index-organised table

135832
put	get
i want to get your opinion on whether this is a good idea or should i put my application metadata in the soap header itself

135836
solaris	freebsd
freebsd has specific concepts of jails and solaris has containers

135841
static-class	inherited
as just stated in a recent question and answer you can t inherited from a static-class

135869
apache-config	.htaccess
if you can t change the apache-config and you can t overrides it with an .htaccess file then it seems to me that the easiest solutions would be either to change the file-extension or else to write a scripting that printing the contents of the target scripting

135876
boolean	int
i think you almost answered this yourself i think the end aim is to make the code more readable and in this case the enum did that imo its always best to look at the end aim rather than blanket ruless maybe think of it more as a guideline enums are often more readable in code than generics boolean int etc but there will always be exception-handling to the rules

135904
abstract	sealed
you can t create an instances because it is abstract and you can t inherited from it since it is sealed

135905
javascript	dom
this is especially relevant if you are using dom searching javascript as provided by the many javascript libs as it would benefit to reduce the dom tree size

135929
put	get
i d like to just put in a comment in the block of my if-statement but i get an error .when i try

135946
boost	stl
either standards c++ stl or boost ok mfc or atl win32 api or a small single-purpose and free libs that i can downloading from somewhere

135962
sql-server	oracle
i can t say for sure in sql-server but in oracle pl sql you would put a null statement in a block that you want to do nothing

135964
.when	ready
i believe the loaded event gets called .when the control has been initializer loaded rendering and ready for use

135971
uniq	grep
with some clever sort uniq diff grep awk later on has potential but i was wondering if anyone knows of any existing solutions

136033
perl	php
what s the shortest-distance approach to getting the same simplicity speed and isolation as php s runtime environment with perl semantics

136051
ienumerator	ienumerable
take the following class it doesn t implements ienumerable or ienumerator

136053
temporary	copy
.so my preferences goes to the const reference return because anyway i m just more confortable with sending a reference than hoping the compiler will optimize the extra temporary as long as the following contract is respected if you want it beyond my object s existence they copy it before my object s destructor

136069
python	php
i am planning on porting a php application over to python

136069
python	php
i did not use a framework in the php versioning but being new to python i am wondering if it would be advantageous to use something like django or at the very least genshi

136112
python	ruby
properties especially with c#3 object initializer or keyword argumentss a la ruby or python are a much better way to go where you d otherwise use a boolean arguments

136129
background-color	transparency
if background-color is transparency then forecolor is same as textbox disabled color

136135
design-time	designer
currently this doesnt work at design-time because the image pooling doesn t work i am thinking its because the designer doesn t give permission to the code to scan the filesystems

136161
.when	ready
if you mean .when it is ready to ship then presumably .when all of the agreed-upon unit tests pass assuming tdd xp agile methods of course

136165
selected	cell
what happens is a click on a table cell or something similar in the web editor and regardless of the size of the page i m working on it takes a second or two for the properties windows to show the properties for the selected item

136165
selected	cell
the most annoying thing about it is .sometimes i ll click a cell selected a properties and start typing but it s still stuck on the wrong unselecteded item .so it ends up putting what i m typing in the wrong place and then it disappears once the proper item is selecteded

136177
ndepend	fxcop
â just because code passes fxcop stylecop looks good in ndepend and passes automated-tests doesnâ t mean it provides the best business value

136182
shell	bash
but with bash you should know that .bashrc is execute with every new shell invocation

136195
value	field
we want to access the field variables and assign a value to it

136195
value	field
on subsequent call we cannot set the value of the variables field

136232
pyopengl	pyglet
if you are going to go with ctypes definitely checkout the pyglet and pyopengl project that have massive examples of ctype binding

136233
put	get
but .when i put this in my .aliases file i get an alias loops

136233
shell	tcsh
updates i m still curious if it s possible to redirect stderr in tcsh from .aliases but as has been suggested here i ended up with a shell scripting

136234
python	php
i recently ported a php .app to python using web.py

136240
contains	set
for example i downloading the manual for the mips 4ke core document #md00103 mips32â 4keâ processor core family software userâ s manual and chapter 10 contains a detailed description of the instruction set

136259
default-value	default
because the underlying storage of an enum is an int the default-value will be zero .so you should make sure that 0 is a sensible default

136270
instances	destroy
in the case of a connection for instances it makes sense that you wouldn t want to make the connection itself a singleton you might need four connections or you may need to destroy and recreate the connection a numbers of time

136276
selenium-ide	selenium
recording the actions in firefox using selenium-ide save the scripting in c# format then play them back using the selenium rc c# wrapper

136276
selenium-ide	selenium
addendum similar to selenium-ide and selenium rc which are java-based watin test recorder and watin are .net-based

136333
solaris	linux
exists for windows solaris and linux

136354
logfile	tail
for efficiency with very large-files common in logfile situations where you may want to use tail you generally want to avoid reading the whole file even if you do do it without reading the whole file into memory at once however you do need to somehow work out the offset in line rather than characters

136365
utility	gnu
it looks like there s a copy of the gnu link utility somewhere in the search path

136413
textbox	button	click	mouse
as it stands .when you click the button you will see two entries made in the textbox button click followed by canvas click even though the mouse was click only once

136454
contains	any
the scripting itself recursively inspects my include directory and assumes that any php file not namedd in a short list of exclusions the autoloader itself plus some other standards files i tend to have contains a class of the same named

136473
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are asking how to migrate an existing webforms project into asp.net-mvc keeping the same url rewrite the answer is

136476
icmp	arp
not receiving any response to icmp ping or arp request is not a 100 guarantee that there s no network connection

136489
directory	folder
it is perfectly feasible to deploy user-controls directly to sharepoint sites either through the controltemplates folder in the 12 hive or to a location in the web .app virtual directory which you can then reference from webpage using sharepoint-designer

136502
scriptaculous	jquery
there are two possible solutions there was a conflict with an older versioning of scriptaculous and jquery scriptaculous was attempting to extends the native arrays prototype incorrectly - first try upgrading your copy of scriptaculous

136506
contains	set
the basic idea is to set the window.location.hash properties to a value that contains whatever state information you need then either use the window.onhashchange event or for older browsers that don t support onhashchange ie 8 firefox 3.6 periodically checked to see if the hash has changed using setinterval for example and updates the page

136542
project-management	project
i m a s w developer in a small internal it department within a financial firm and have worked on a numbers of small-medium sized project that have had little or no project-management throughout

136559
publishing	release
i would publishing a release scheduling and add additional features to future phases of the project .so that you are not late on the entire project because of these additional features

136575
windows-server	windows
a lot of the cool things in sharepoint are avaialable in windows sharepoint service 3.0 which is free with windows-server 2003 2008

136578
arguments	undefined
.when called the first arguments to these methods specifies the object which will be referenced by the this keyword during execution of the function - if it s null or undefined the global object windows is used for this

136601
abstract	sealed
class public abstract auto ansi sealed beforefieldinit directory

136675
richtextbox	textblock
i m not sure if you can make a textblock selectable but another option would be to use a richtextbox - it is like a textbox as you suggested but supports the formatting you want

136676
any	set
having this set to true should enable any sections in your web-config .so you should be fine to remove it if there s none in there

136677
create-table	insert-into
you ll have to provide create-table and insert-into statements for little sample-data

136686
plugins	add-on
this is exacerbated by add-on and plugins

136733
codeigniter	cakephp
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp

136739
python	java
i m starting with python coming from java

136752
pointers	stack
x86 after account for different pointers widths stack buffering location of course

136752
pointers	stack
the oddity there is that the correct call stack reported by the debugger contains base-address return-address pointers value whose constituent bytes don t actually exist in stack buffering below or above the current stack-pointers

136773
communication	messages
i work on an application which communication with the server through the windows messages pump

136786
keyboard	mouse
for linux i unfortunately have not been able to find a good way to easily create keyboard mouse macros

136804
web.py	django
you might consider using .something like web.py which would be easy to distribute since it s small and it would al.so be easy to adapt your other tools to it since it doesn t required you to submit to the framework .so much like django does

136808
display	height
if i understand correctly you want the parent to be 25 wide and exactly the height of the browser display area

136831
random-seed	generator
let s say you need to generator a random-seed without connecting to the internet without using user-input ie there s no gui and it has to be cross platform therefore no jni to access hardware

136839
environment	building
no versioning-control could be the next next versioning or just a custom building that someone wanted to test out on near prod environment

136858
duplicates	elements
if however you cannot modify the input list at all and k is much less than n like 5 from 100 it would be much better not to remove selecteded elementss each time but simply selected each elements and if you ever get a duplicates toss it out and reselected

136870
execute	prepare
prepare and execute a database

136884
display	width
i learned recently that setting a div to display table will stop it from expanding to take up the whole width of the parent containers -- but now i realize that this introduces a new problem it stops collapsing margins with its neighbors

136948
internet-explorer	firefox
this worked fine in internet-explorer 5 most of the time and firefox but now does not work in internet-explorer 7

136948
subdirectories	absolute-path
the physical path is missing the internet-explorer hidden caching subdirectories for temporary internet files of content.ie5 albkho3q whose absolute-path would be expressed as

136958
arrays	loops
.so a slight deviation is to manually provide an arrays of base paths where the autoloader can expect to find classes setup in the pear fashion and just loops over the base paths

136962
configuration-files	web-config
asp.net also gives you the ability to add custom configuration sections to standards configuration-files like web-config

136966
restart	reload
knowing that the dll will reload its configuration at certain points is a useful feature since it prevents the users wondering if they have to restart the hosts process reboot the machine etc for the configuration to take effect

136988
diagram	erd
design document including an erd diagram of the database

137022
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think that migrating a webforms applicaiton to asp.net-mvc is going to be very hard unless you have a clear seperation of concerns in your current applicaiton

137029
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome .so far if it clears safari 3.0 on win it seems to clear google-chrome too

137035
fadeout	fadein
.so if you really really want this effect then you will need to do the image fadeout spinner fadein and once that is complete triggers the upload

137069
directory	folder
svn creates .svn directory in every single folder git only creates one .git directory

137069
revision	svn
in svn each file folder can come from a different revision or branch

137074
g++	gcc
use the -s option to gcc or g++

137077
.when	ready
greasemonkey scriptinging run .when the dom is ready .so you don t need to add onload events you just start manipulating the dom straight away in your greasemonkey scripting

137079
credentials	account
i think you could also fix it by disabling anonymous access in iis on the web application you are running the report from that way report service would authentication using the users credentials instead of the asp.net account

137087
sql-server	mysql
ms sql-server supports update...from and delete...from syntax as does mysql but the sql-92 standards does not

137092
show	next
3.1 selenium sample this and the next watin code sample do not show up in the original webpage on either ie or firefox .so i ve extraction them and listed them here.

137097
triggers	insert
the other .solution is to create triggers on the leads table for insert updates and delete .so that you keep the employees.leadcount column current all the time

137097
increment	reset
first reset the leadcount in all rows to zero then do a join to the leads table and increment the leadcount in each row produced by the join

137173
ubuntu	debian
.so far i ve tested it on ubuntu debian and red hat as

137177
worksheet	excel
i then finally discovered that you can use the excel worksheet round function like .so

137263
account	api
no you have to call win32 api logonuser function to get windows account token back .so you can then imper.sonate

137270
while-loop	infinite
you can modify the ret waitforsingleobject proc.hprocess infinite function-call to return after some finite amount of time in milliseconds--replace infinite with a positive value representing milliseconds and wrap the whole thing in a do while-loop

137274
constructor	object
any virtual methodss you call from the constructor may fall down to derived implementation and if they don t call the base methods and the constructor depends on it the object may be in an invalid state

137302
decompression	on-the-fly
at the local end you could use something like libcurl to do the client side of the transfer which also supports on-the-fly decompression

137335
python	java
i use both java and python all the time

137344
text-editor	editor
editor are logical subclassing of viewers but since all viewers are subclassing - textviewer image-viewer etc. editor does not derive from viewer thus allowing the final text-editor imageeditor classes to avoid the diamond

137378
lgpl	gpl
for instances you could license under gplv3 but with extra clauses that allow you to use it as if under the terms of the lgpl and that allow the code to be integrated with other gpl product .so that they can be mixed an important part of oss

137408
packets	ping
li even if ping random ip addresses the first few hops from you to the first real l3 router in the isp network will be the same for every packets

137414
httplistener	http
the first suggestion i have would be to use the httplistener class and possibly webclient or other system.net http related classes to re-post the request to your application as a proxy for the webbrowser test call

137417
event-listener	listener
that listener will be listening for any change with the form and a parameter equals to what the change was becomes available to the event-listener function

137426
random-seed	generator
the approach of measuring something to generator a random-seed appears to be a pretty good one

137449
contains	elements
this works fine but the div contains some form elements labels input

137490
private	self
the private modifiers and others like it can be a useful way of writing self documenting code

137500
perl	php	python	perl	python	php
what you learn for php isn t necessarily true for python or perl or c etc

137519
hide	show
for example how do i show or hide the outlook envelope icons from an outlook rules

137530
profiling	trace
here s an example trace from profiling

137552
boolean	int	numeric	zero
well i can t remember enough from my php days to answer the part but for most c-style languages null should be used in the context of pointers value false as a boolean and zero as a numeric value such as an int

137577
boolean	int
0 is the int value of zero and false is the boolean value of well false

137625
32-bit	64bit
the others here are correct only use less than int32 for 32-bit code int64 for 64bit code if you need it for extreme storage requirements or for another level of enforcement on a business object field you should still have properties level validation in this case of course

137654
put	get
technically you can get around it anyways but you have to put in extra work to shoot yourself

137660
stderr	stdout
the iis process must have a stdin stdout and stderr

137683
export	report
from an aesthetics points of view it s nice to integrated report into an .application .so that the user doesn t feel that they re leaving the .app to printing or export the .app s data

137694
execute	prepare
also it looks like the first trace does no prepare call and thinks p1 is an output paramer in the execute while the second trace does a prepare call with p1 as an output but does not show p1 as an output in the execute step - is this significant

137697
xhtml	tidy
tidy can do what you want but only for whole buffering it seems and the result is xhtml

137705
websphere	ibm
i m looking for people who have had experience scaling ibm s websphere to high traffic volumes

137713
export	csv
use proc export to produce csv file with the data in it

137715
boolean	int
false is a valid boolean value 0 is a valid int value and php has some fairly ugly conversion between 0 0 and false

this makes things a lot easier and allows c++0x templates to be treated like a perfectly functional language using variadic-templates

137815
ubuntu	debian
i ve generally been fine with plain old debian ubuntu has its caveats that sometime hit you at wrong time

137838

137955
modifiers	final
regarding the reliability part ensue that comments play a very important role .when using the final modifiers

137962
getter	setter
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoping properties getter or setter .when its opposite has greater than private accessibility

137972
user-input	output
the batch-file s only purpose is to invoke the java code and the only user-input is being passed in as command-line arguments which i can see are going in directly via the building s console output

137996
dependency-injection	singleton
where have all the singleton gone makes the points that dependency-injection has made it easy to get instances to constructor that required them which alleviates the underlying need behind the bad global singleton decried in the first article

138006
static-methods	unit-testing
static-methods are avoided by people who do unit-testing because they cannot be mocked or stubbed

138034
opensolaris	linux
you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important

138047
equality-operator	logical-operators
in c# nullable bool has interesting properties with respect to logical-operators but the equality-operator is the same as other types in that language bool

138061
dependency-injection	singleton
using dependency-injection has pretty much removed my requirements for singleton servicelocators and factory

138070
.net	wcf
there are .net implementation out there amf.net for instances .so it may be possible to .somehow make it work with wcf - you need to explore this area yourself i have no direct experience here

138072
implements	final
if you ab.solutely must make a class or methods final make sure this class implements .some interface .so you can have a mock implements the same interface

138095
any	set
just set to the appropriate value before initializing the cgi object or calling any cgi functions.

138121
python	java
jython is an implementation of the high-level dynamic object-oriented language python written in 100 pure java and seamlessly integrated with the java platform

138121
python	java
it thus allows you to run python on any java platform

138121
python	java
since you are coming from java jython may help you leverage python while still allowing you to use your java knowledge

138123
virtual-machine	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualization	virtualization	vmware
i know some virtual-machine software at least vmware have features that allow software to detection virtualization

138137
modifiers	final
the final modifiers especially for variabless is a means to have the compiler enforce a conventions that is generally sensible make sure a local or instances variables is assign exactly once no more no less

138142
administration	sysadmin
i have administration rights on the server and my database user is in sysadmin role

138142
administration	sysadmin
execute sp_addsrvrolemember built-in administration sysadmin

138146
linux	aix
if you need a 64bit jvm i would suggest that there is probably a 64bit building while i cannot comment on windows specifically i can tell you there is a 64bit websphere 6.1 building for both aix and linux

138152
attributes	properties
dynamic data for asp.net and asp.net-mvc lets you do validation for model properties using attributes

138154
firefox	safari
browser support currently is ie safari firefox 3.1 alpha

138157
system.out	system.in
i m just using basic system.out and system.in functionality but i m happy to rebuild my i o wrapper

138162
apache	vhosts
the idea is that as i develop multiple sites i can just add vhosts to apache called site1.local site2.local etc and have them all resolve to localhost while apache serves a different site accordingly

138179
administration	account
not because i necessarily agree with the feature any more than i agree that the administration account should be disabled permananty i love that account way too much but because the user is very likely to have it turned on and you need to see your program through their eyes

138203
export	report
is it possible for a stand alone executable to generator a report and output it as pdf or one of the other export options available from the report viewer without display the reportviewer control

138208
portrait	screens
for me the test view is a nice compact list that fits better on screens if i need it on screens at all as i use a seperate portrait monitor for most of the vs tool windows

138210
administration	sysadmin
all domain administration will have full sysadmin rights to your sql-server to drop databases etc

138259
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension methods

138259
data-structures	dictionary
if on the other hand access by index is the norm then stop using dictionary data-structures alltogether and simply store your value in a

138271
low-level	hardware
i m not saying maths are not needed at all for computers - obviously you need real math skills .when designing encryption algorithms and hardware and etc -- but if as lots of programmers you just work an a mid low-level language like c or higher level stuff like c# or java consuming mostly pre-built frameworks and apis you don t really need to understand the mathematical principles behind fourier transforms or huffman tree or moebius strips.

138282
cvs	git
there are even svn tools guides and git tools guides out there that will do this cvs conversion for you

138285
contains	elements
empty does not mean zero length the arrays starts out with a size but all the elements in the arrays contains nothing

138285
arrays	map
for an arrays with a size of 10 index 0-9 will map directly to an index and index 10-19 will map down to 0-9 again and .so on

138292
semantic-web	ontology
if you ve worked on a project that stores data for use with the semantic-web do you use rdf or even owl as the internal data format or do you have your own datamodel ontology that you map to rdf for interoperability

138306
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
even in scalar code loading 8bit or 16-bit value is no slower than loading 32-bit since .movzx .movsx is no different in speed from .mov

138313
alt	src
i already wrote me a little program to find and load all html files but now i am stuck at how to extraction src title and alt from this html

138320
markup	xhtml
you can also try simplexml if the html is guaranteed to be xhtml - it will parsing the markup for you and you will be able to access the attributes just by their named

138322
rdflib	jena
in the end i rely mostly on 3rd-party storage backends like jena rdflib et al

138336
sql-server	postgresql
if you use ms sql-server it is include in standards i use postgresql and it s only include in standards from 8.3 on

138353
widget	button
one of those widget is a list of radio button i have also tried a normals radiobox

138362
arrays	map
this arrays is passed to sort which compares the already computed value creating another intermediate arrays this one is sorted which in turn is passed to another map which throw away the caching value thus restoring the arrays to its initial list elements but in the desired order now

138362
filtering	sorting
you can also filtering the list before sorting by insert a grep if you want to filtering on the same caching value

138379
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
theoretically csidl_program_filesx86 should map to c program files x86 in a 64bit systemd but what does it map to in a 32-bit systemd where this path doesn t exist

138412
sqldatasource	gridview
i can t get my gridview to enable a user to sort a column of data .when i m using a custom sqldatasource

138414
udp	tcp
udp tcp messages

138434
any	set
are you trying to set the display-property to tablerow by any change

138440
semantics	keyword
the final keyword has visibility semantics .when used on object attributes

138440
constructor	object
basically setting the value of a final object attributes happens-before the constructor returns

138440
constructor	object
this means that as long as you don t let the this reference escape the constructor and you use final for all you attributes your object is under java 5 semantics guarenteed to be properly construct and since it is also immutable it can be safely published to other threads

138448
any	set
i need to create a button that has the same styles as buttonspec with its types set to context is there any way to create a buttonspec that isn t directly attached to another control or have i missed a simple styles option on another control

138450
spring	guice	dependency-injection	inject
also if you are using a dependency-injection framework spring guice etc... the functor can be automatically initializer and inject wherever required

138452
return-type	arguments
the performselector family of methods only takes 0 1 or 2 arguments methods whose argumentss and return-types are object .so if the types of the argumentss and return-type are not object or if there are more than two argumentss then you would have to use an nsinvocation to invoke it

138458
contains	set
if i have an .as file that is my custom-component a swc class that containss the custom-components skinss and a css file that tells the custom class how it should look references the swc skins file how do i set up a library-project using flexbuilder 3 to generator a single swc file that will contains everything

138463
hash	md5
if you use cryptography hash md5 sha1 ripemd160 the hash will be unique modulo collision which are very improbable -- sha1 is used for digital signature and md5 is also collision-resistant on random input

138467
sqldatasource	gridview
.when handling the sorting event do you recreate the sqldatasource and rebound it to the gridview

138472
put	get
you put in and get out data by specifying the key you are operating on

138472
put	get	key-value	key
this implies that put key-value get key contains key and remove key are all really fast

138504
ports	ddos
next you can view logs for various types of attack - such as ddos which you ll want to checked using ip tools as a lot of ddos attacks are made on non-web ports such as syn floods

138521
expression	evaluation
also you would need to bundle the python interpreter if you wanted to do dynamic evaluation of expression but perhaps a subset of python that didn t allow this would still be useful

138532
filenotfoundexception	eofexception
an example from the java-api is ioexception that has subclassing like filenotfoundexception or eofexception and much more

138541
interpreter	runtime
it does this by getting your code to run on the matlab-compiler runtime mcr which is essentially the matlab computational kernel - your code is still being interpreter

138546
ole-automation	com
if your business-logic is fairly well-separated from the gui code you could try wrapping it up as an ole-automation object called a com object in vb6 i think which you then use in an asp-powered web application

138547
launchd	daemons
i d install full-text searching during installation the sql full-text filtering daemons launchd is running thorough an admin user account

138581
command-line	cmd
apart from this did you notice that the built-in help of ms windows is a great resource for descriptions of cmd s command-line syntax

138587
permission-denied	root
the permission-denied error is showing that the scripting is running with root credentials because it s looking in root s home dir for files

138596
csv	xml
view contains templatess templates object handles templates composition and nesting wrap with headers and footers and produces output in one of well known formats x html but also xml rss atom-editor csv

138618
constructor	object
i would wrap the map inside a static object and put the map initialisation code in the constructor of this object this way you are sure the map is created before the initialisation code is execute

138625
contains	any
a function defined with def can contains any python code

138641
cvs	git
i m duty-bound by policy to use cvs in this certain project .so even though i d really to switching to .something else like git i cannot

138645
buffering	streaming
streaming operations are performed against the buffering only returning to the file for another read .when more data is needed

138667
perl	awk
of course i m working in an environment where the only available languages are some shity language which generator cobol omg omg bash old versioning perl i don t master it yet sed awk and some other command-line utilities

138690
cvs	git
if you are the only one developing on the feature-branch you could simply use git as your sandbox development systemd and then once you have the changes done merge them into your cvs repository

138709
python	perl
vim supports scripting in python and in perl as well i think

138736
ms-dos	dos
for me it s western european dos or just ms-dos in ms-word

138746
hash	md5
you can install an alternative hash generator function if you want to customise the way the id is generator it s a 128bit numbers generator via md5 by default

138779
organization	naming
there s a reason classes are broken into namespaces -- primarily for organization and to reduce naming conflicts

138825
arrays	map
.so i m not really sure how the real and imaginary part of the input and output map to the arrays

138833
url-rewriting	rewrite
one solution is to use url-rewriting to rewrite the url to what you need

138850
licensing	lgpl
qt c++ proprietary but free with the lgpl licensing

138851
postgresql	mysql
the one that s in mysql postgresql and not the one that s in myapp models.py

138871
python	lua	python	c++	c++	lua
i have a small lua python and c++ framework i made for that purpose want to add javascript for the backend with v8

138888
python	php
basic stuffs like session handling are a nightmare if you don t use a one because python is not web specialized like php

138888
web.py	django
if you think django is too much you can try a lighter one like the very small but still handy web.py

138898
push	pull
you don t need a server for it as it s a distribute version-control systemd - you can hold a whole repository copy on a flash drive and push pull changes from it

138929
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
there s a fairly intense discussion going on about the relative merits of csv json and xml

138929
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
we ve decided to provide xml and json due to the difficulty in recursion in csv needing multiple call for a single logical operation

138944
json	xml
i would bet more devs are comfortable with working with xml data than with json

138948
google-chrome	opera
users mainly use firefox2 but also opera 9.x ff3 ie7 and google-chrome are used to access the site

138949
updating	updates
normalize makes updatess much faster because each updates is the smallest it can be you are updating the smallest - in terms of columns and rows - possible table

138950
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
this filtering has to be added to the web.xml or the deployment-descriptor of the webapp

138965
constructor	private
additionally for serialization to work correctly the class must have a default no arg constructor constructor can be private if needed

138973
xsd	xml
xml - lots of libs devs are familiar with it xslt can be easiily validation by both client and server xsd dtd hierarchical-data

138973
json	xml
xml - bloated harder to interpreter in javascript than json

138973
json	xml
the client can generator it from either xml or json if it s really needed

138994
function-call	inline
is there a performance difference or does the function-call just get inline by the compiler

139012
lighting	uniform
i have tried by changing the ambient parameter of the lighting and the types of lighting directional and omnidirectional but the result was not uniform

139022
subclassing	base-class
but you may be able to map out a base-class softdeleteentity and have a table per subclassing hierarchy

139034
any	set
i can see their points here but what i am wondering is with this top level set of classes any web service-layer can simply call the same common methods without having to rewrite code

139035
display	height	display	width
display mode - composed of the size width and height of the monitor in pixelss bit depth numbers of bits per pixels and refresh rate how frequently the monitor updates itself

139055
svnkit	svn
i m using subversive plugins in ganymede but after today s updates it stopped working - it just doesn t see any valid svn connectors i ve already been using 1.2.0 dev versioning of svnkit instead of a stable one because subversive ganymede could not handle it

139072
contains	set
however if they are contains a lot of business-logic by this i mean conditional logic depending on the state of an entity or set of entities then i would take a careful look to see if you can make this logic explicit by making it its own class or moving it to the class with the proper responsibility

139089
json	csv
i don t have any experience with json csv works up to a points .when your data is very tabular and evenly structured

139089
python	java	python	c++
i have not tried this either but google s protocol-buffers look really good simple format creates automatic binding to c++ java and python and implements serialization and deserialization of the created object

139107
positioning	slider
now .when you move the slider you might have to resize the windows you ll see the slider positioning printed to the terminal as you the handle

139112
player	movie
then the actionscript that is supposed to play the movie fails because of the improper flash player versioning

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behavior components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139155
google-chrome	firefox
i have it on good authority that this won t work in google-chrome and firefox although it works perfectly in ie which is where i tested it

139165
mersenne-twister	generator
make sure to refresh now and then the secure random used for the initialization for example you could have one secure random generator per client using one mersenne-twister pseudo random generator per client obtaining a high enough degree of randomization

139168
contains	elements
add a progid elements to the component contains your executable like the following

139199
contains	any
i realize that parameterized sql queries is the optimal way to sanitize user-input .when building queries that contains user-input but i m wondering what is wrong with taking user-input and escaping any single-quotes and surrounding the whole string with single-quotes

139213
system.out	system.in
system.out and system.in are statics and therefore evil

139218
double	int
while you might find a solution that works for strings for numerical predicates you need to also make sure they re only passing in numbers simple checked is can it be parsing as int double decimal

139266
updating	updates
.when creating an auto updating feature for a .net winforms application how does it updates the dlls and not affect the currently running application

139283
shutdown	restart
then shutdown and restart and at startup you look for and use the new files if found

139301
linux	bsd
it might be a backslash windows forwarding slash linux os x bsd etc. or something else entirely on old or obscure oss

139306
callback	methods
to make this useful change the console.log to a callback methods defined in you main scripting setup to receive data and act on it

139308
gridview	datalist
datalist - more customisable versioning of the gridview

139308
datalist	listview
listview - the new datalist

139308
gridview	datalist
almost a hybrid of the datalist and gridview where you can use paging and built-in gridview like functionality but have the freedom of design

139333
decrement	increment
insert a newline and spaces after every characters keep and indentation counter to determine the numbers of spaces that you increment for every and decrement for every you see

139337
execution	exit
putting an exit statement as first statement in a function to disable the execution of that function instead of one of the following options

139363
perl	php
inorder to replicate the basic functionality for creating webpage that php offers out the box then you need two cpan modules that should be available in every base perl installation

139372
streamreader	streamwriter
make sure that the streamreader and streamwriter object you use all use the same encoding as the one you used with the xmlwriter not just the streamwriter like someone else suggested or

139372
streamreader	streamwriter
don t use streamreader streamwriter

139384
average	median
i need to calculate average standards deviations median etc for a bunch of numerical data

139407
32-bit	64bit
um that article says that 32-bit seeds are bad but 64bit seeds are good

139429
dependency-injection	service-locator
service-locator better dependency-injection inversion-of-control better still

139432
stop-words	term
however i d strongly suggest the mysql kinosearch route as they have covered a lot of ground stemming stop-words term weight token parsing that you don t benefit from getting bogged down with

139441
streamreader	streamwriter
both your streamwriter and your streamreader are using utf-8 because you re not specifying the encoding

139451
ruby	php
i deploy .war files developed in groovy with grails but there are more and more options for deploying php and ruby solutions

139478
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

139478
sortedlist	sorted
from sorted data sortedlist of

139482
alignment	wrap
of course getting a systemd like that to work properly proper text wrap alignment styling etc. seems almost akin to writing my own document rendering from scratch

139484
shell	bash
i would prefer a pthreads shell solution or at least something that works in bash on cygwin

139506
pragma	clang
clang llvm s c fronted supports most features except floating-point pragma

139516
gridview	listview
it is essential but you can achieve nearly the same effect with a listview that is using a gridview can t you

139546
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6

139546
vb.net	vb6
conversion between vb6 and vb.net is problematic

139551
code-coverage	ncover
ncover + cruisecontrol.net send out automatic report and then one can prove that as he checked in code-coverage goes down

139602
telnet	ftp
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

139605
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu there s packages.debian.org and packages.ubuntu.com

139624
silverlight	wpf
you can store data for the mockups as inline xml in the xaml or you can quickly convert it to wpf silverlight application and building basic business-logic behind your mockups using visual c# express or visual-studio 2008

139627
datalist	listview
if you meet all the criterion of listview but you would naturally fit in a grid you may consider datalist

139633
rollback	commit
commit and rollback

139633
rollback	commit
truncated can therefore not be rollback and a failure in the truncated process will have issued a commit anyway

139639
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
i ve tried to use dependency-injection to absract the service out of our application coupled with a factory-pattern to determine which implementation of my interface to initializer

139645
.war	jar
for example if you package log4j v1 in the .war file log4j v2 at ear level and you put log4j v3 in your app-server s classpath the module will use the jar in its own module

139646
sql-server	mysql	increment	reset
with sql-server or mysql if there is a pk with auto increment truncated will reset the counter

139723
scriptaculous	jquery
i ve been using various javascript frameworks including mootools jquery prototype and scriptaculous and have found them all good but difficult to extends to more complex ideas

139744
short	zero
short answer declare the variables as close to first use as possible and initializer to zero if you still need to

139771
python	java
you should now be able to run further operations on this file perhaps in some language such as python c# or java

139790
32-bit	64bit
other things to consider is that most asp.net 1.1 applications have no issues .when run in a 2.0 application-pool allowing you to easily convert your 1.1 32-bit application to a 2.0 64bit application

139790
any	set
this doesn t required any recompilation just change the .app pool to 2.0 then switching to x64 using the above adsutil.vbs scripting set to 0 rather than 1
